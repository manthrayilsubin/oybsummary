John speaks of heresy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104735" data-verses="2John 1:7">verse 7</span>: “Because many deceivers went out into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.” Certain heretics denied that Jesus is the Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104736" data-verses="1John 2:22">1 John 2:22</span>), and others denied the Son, not confessing that Jesus is the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104737" data-verses="1John 2:23">1 John 2:23</span>). Cerinthus, who denied that Jesus is the Christ, was a heretic. The Docetists and the Gnostics also taught heresy concerning the Person of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0tPF2sIH7qoAOFcV46NIRJg8OwbMgaGoM2W-a_IJSmyEkb2zoKDOZMgPbff1acs2X"> The Epistle of 2 John prohibits us from participating in any heretical teaching concerning Christ’s Person. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104738" data-verses="2John 1:10">verse 10</span> the apostle John says, “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!” As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104739" data-verses="2John 1:9">verse 9</span>, the “teaching” here is the teaching concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception. In this Epistle John warns us not to receive anyone who denies the truth concerning Christ’s deity and incarnation. </p>

<p data-content-id="IuIqSqzlyrxRHO3CK5Vo_8F-wtX7cEfMHtfRscxQO-elmtF7sjiMo7Funl_zZRY2N"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104740" data-verses="2John 1:1">verse 1</span> John says, “The elder to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth.” The apostle John, like Peter, was also an elder in the church in Jerusalem <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> before its destruction in A.D. 70 (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104741" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Gal. 2:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104742" data-verses="1Peter 5:1">1 Pet. 5:1</span>). According to history, after returning from exile, John stayed in Ephesus to care for the churches in Asia. Thus he was probably also an elder in the church at Ephesus, where he wrote this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="H3MChnUiMOE7AOHP63eqfZObQzUi_L9gUsknR0-EA6KCqaqgznji5hSs0xAU7LCyN"> John addresses this Epistle to the “chosen lady and to her children.” The Greek word rendered “lady” is <em>kuria,</em> the feminine form of <em>kurios,</em> lord, master. There are different interpretations of the word here. The most preferable is that it refers to a Christian sister of some prominence in the church, as “co-chosen” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104743" data-verses="1Peter 5:13">1 Peter 5:13</span> does. <em>Kuria</em> may have been her name, since it was a common name at that time. According to some accounts, she lived near Ephesus, and her sister (in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104744" data-verses="2John 1:13">v. 13</span>) lived in Ephesus, where the church was under John’s care. There was a church in her locality meeting in her home. </p>
<p data-content-id="XHxiEZQXFvlXDs0Gz-qwbkwp6cLqGobXcK6YxaekNVDZ3sAxFzo5vIglQp6TkBjRu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104745" data-verses="2John 1:1">verse 1</span> John speaks of loving in truth. According to John’s usage of the word truth, especially in his Gospel, the first instance of “truth” in this verse denotes the revealed divine reality—the Triune God dispensed into man in the Son Jesus Christ—becoming man’s genuineness and sincerity, to live a life that corresponds to the divine light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104746" data-verses="John 3:19-21">John 3:19-21</span>) and to worship God, as God seeks, according to what He is (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104747" data-verses="John 4:23-24">John 4:23-24</span>). This is the virtue of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104748" data-verses="Romans 3:7">Rom. 3:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104749" data-verses="Romans 15:8">15:8</span>) becoming our virtue, by which we love the believers. This is the genuineness, truthfulness, sincerity, honesty, trustworthiness, and faithfulness of God as a divine virtue and of man as a human virtue (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104750" data-verses="Mark 12:14">Mark 12:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104751" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:10">2 Cor. 11:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104752" data-verses="Philippians 1:18">Phil. 1:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104753" data-verses="1John 3:18">1 John 3:18</span>), and as an issue of the divine reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104754" data-verses="3John 1:1">3 John 1</span>). In such truth, the apostle John, who lived in the divine reality of the Trinity, loved the one to whom he wrote. This is the denotation of the first usage of “truth” in this verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="kA3YymQYr-CAgUVtiAHCwqdxidp1DHvdhoyO6CnVrPO2RybE_wizyVt1abqY24yRU"> Simply speaking, the first usage of truth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104755" data-verses="2John 1:1">verse 1</span> denotes sincerity, and John is speaking of loving in sincerity. However, the meaning of sincerity here is not simple. Usually, when we speak of sincerity, we understand sincerity to be merely a human virtue. But here sincerity is more than a <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> human virtue. The human virtue in which the apostle John loved the one who received this Epistle was the issue of the divine reality that he enjoyed. </p>
<p data-content-id="J5XPhVDqMbk-d4X3xABn85ybDT_AFf0xbBuchy-osHqdrQrf_d1F-8icFCDcD_VSc"> What is the divine reality enjoyed by John? This reality is the Triune God. The writer of this Epistle enjoyed the Triune God in the Son as his divine reality. Out of the enjoyment of this reality, which is the Triune God in Christ, issued sincerity. This sincerity, or faithfulness, actually is a virtue of God. When we enjoy God as our reality, His divine virtue becomes our human virtue, and this human virtue is sincerity, faithfulness. </p>
<p data-content-id="z1Ov3M5wTuTx_ifG83o4XhOoFuvToHW2KiQXqXAujdZcZvlhhrbRnISkGWEGZxWWM"> This understanding of loving in truth is based upon what is revealed in John’s first Epistle. In that Epistle John indicates that we should love one another by God Himself as love. God is love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104756" data-verses="1John 4:8">1 John 4:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104757" data-verses="1John 4:16">16</span>). As we enjoy God as love, out of this love issues a love with which we love others. When we love others with the love that issues from our enjoyment of God as love, our love will be in sincerity. This sincerity is not our human virtue; rather, it is the issue of our enjoyment of the divine reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="aVNsbqU_94jrL_dNCrI8TJf_Neq33-ncIGvx5ejb_7RgJjdQlRMk9m9UK2iZoePqx"> As we consider what John means in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104758" data-verses="2John 1:1">verse 1</span> by loving in truth, we are reminded that it is not a superficial matter to know the Bible. In particular, it is not sufficient to know the Epistles of John in a superficial way. Only when we get into the depths of these Epistles can we know the meaning of the writer. </p>
<p data-content-id="bJSqgr1eY4O8W5AMDuzhuuW7kMEaLLi9jPFb0RCO4NCEw1_3rC71vUJQDEINmbYvr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104759" data-verses="2John 1:1">verse 1</span> John speaks of “all those who have known the truth.” Here John refers to those who not only have received Christ by believing that He is both God and man, but who also have fully known the truth concerning the Person of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="qqrtJ7tQC1wFss3zwegx51SqFoqN1PvCyg9oi-eaFeKP9-xD1-z1OyHXK_j9ounhH"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104760" data-verses="2John 1:1">verse 1</span> John again uses the word truth. Here truth denotes the divine reality of the gospel, especially concerning the Person of Christ as revealed in John’s Gospel and first Epistle. (Seenote 6<sup>6</sup> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104761" data-verses="1John 1:1">1 John 1</span>.) The divine reality of the gospel here especially includes the fact that Christ is both God and man, having deity and humanity, possessing both the divine nature and the human <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> nature, to express God in human life and to accomplish redemption with divine power in human flesh for fallen human beings, so that He may impart the divine life into them and bring them into an organic union with God. The second and third Epistles of John stress this truth. The second warns the faithful believers against receiving those who do not abide in this truth—in the teaching concerning Christ. The third encourages the believers to receive and help those who work for this truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="yePAoo-2pV3rnAwUKa3RcbLq10aUcrntowYSTPBBxJ8oCV7bzDfpsnnfwG4cBn0PD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104762" data-verses="2John 1:2">verse 2</span> John goes on to say, “Because of the truth which abides in us and shall be with us forever.” The apostle John, in his Gospel and first Epistle, inoculated the believers with his mending ministry concerning the revelation of the Person of Christ against the heresies regarding Christ’s deity and humanity. Because of such an inoculating truth, he and all those who had known this truth loved those who were faithful to this truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="8eN6up73dANLT3j7m2YLtvz2nSRMCBpnrsW1HKEwJcJzcc5rloClHxBzSmp-ZBySZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104763" data-verses="2John 1:2">verse 2</span> John says that the truth abides in us and will be with us forever. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104764" data-verses="2John 1:1">verse 1</span> he tells us that he and all those who have known the truth love in truth the one to whom this Epistle was written. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104765" data-verses="2John 1:2">verse 2</span> John uses the word truth with the same meaning as that of the second usage in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104766" data-verses="2John 1:1">verse 1</span>, that is, to denote the divine reality of the gospel, especially concerning the Person of Christ. This divine reality, which actually is the Triune God, abides in us now and will be with us for eternity. </p>

Love refers to the expression of the believers in loving one another through receiving and knowing the truth. These two matters are the basic structure of this Epistle. In love and truth, grace, mercy, and peace will be with us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="_LjJ4HHbgcV5Wct1SsNfgQBOvOHL5PomhcNhiKIUOdjdxjQMLLtl0elvykmJ9UeO3"> The apostle greets and blesses the believers with grace, mercy, and peace based upon the existence among them of the two crucial matters of truth and love.

<p data-content-id="4f8HTS1PwQHbtVmmTcOy6heqpuWqQrMoi-4A0SQbsGCgiq8a7scPgi-1Dvg9E9rOS"> These deceivers do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This means that they do not confess that Jesus is God incarnate. Thus, they deny the deity of Christ. Jesus was conceived of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104789" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matt. 1:18</span>).

The things which the apostles wrought are the things of the truth concerning Christ, which the apostles ministered and imparted to the believers. To be influenced by the heresies regarding the Person of Christ is to lose, destroy, and ruin the precious things concerning the Person of Christ which the apostles had wrought into the believers. Here the apostle warns the believers to watch for themselves lest they be influenced by the heresies and lose the things of the truth. </p>

To enjoy this reward, we need to remain, abide, in the divine truth concerning Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

This is contrasted with abiding in the teaching of Christ. The Cerinthian Gnostics, who boasted of their supposedly advanced thinking concerning the teaching of Christ, had such a practice. They went beyond the teaching of the divine conception of Christ, thus denying the deity of Christ. Consequently they could not have God in salvation and in life. </p>

Denying this truth concerning Christ, the modernists claim to be advanced in their philosophical thought. In principle, they follow the way of the Cerinthian Gnostics. </p>

But he who abides in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son. To “have God” is to “have both the Father and the Son.” It is through the process of incarnation that God has been dispensed to us in the Son with the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104810" data-verses="1John 2:23">1 John 2:23</span>) for our enjoyment and reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104811" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104812" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). In the incarnated God we have the Son in His redemption and the Father in His life. We are thus redeemed and regenerated to be one with God organically so that we may partake of and enjoy Him in salvation and in life. Hence, to deny the incarnation is to reject this divine enjoyment; but to abide in the truth of incarnation is to have God, as the Father and the Son, for our portion in the eternal salvation and in the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="RRqEljBfaMgIF8qG-gPJ2AnsjL3q6MkE3GvsaQHw_QDLRnGXO0oslDpyHpGb5oSPe"> This point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104813" data-verses="2John 1:9">verse 9</span> concerning having both the Father and the Son has helped me to interpret the full reward spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104814" data-verses="2John 1:8">verse 8</span>. The full reward is to have both the Father and the Son for our enjoyment. Today’s modernists, like the ancient Gnostics, do not have the Father and the Son, for they do not abide in the teaching of Christ. </p>

Wherever we go, we should bring this reality, the reality of what the all-inclusive Christ is. Some of the young people may have an opportunity to present to their parents this reality, which is a wonderful treasure. </p>
<p data-content-id="LP7Q4jdd-FTbrCDPrmTXgN8vfppb2eVmhvUnyBf4lZ6J1QkuFQN3wccbPgDuaoCjV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104816" data-verses="2John 1:10">verse 10</span> the pronoun “him” refers to a heretic, an antichrist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104817" data-verses="2John 1:7">v. 7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104818" data-verses="1John 2:22">1 John 2:22</span>), a false prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104819" data-verses="1John 4:1">1 John 4:1</span>), who denies the divine conception and deity of Christ, as today’s modernists do. Such a one we must reject, not receiving him into our house or greeting him. Thus, we shall not have any <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> contact with him or share in his heresy, heresy that is blasphemous to God and contagious like leprosy. </p>
<p data-content-id="mtchIR0Y3N5FaMCAxAv5LQT8mjdM_9aD_BZlBsW1DJ1kUtnP1e4ONng5nbJO5e8q7"> We should not receive anyone who does not bring with him the teaching of Christ. Do not think that because we are told to love others, we should receive a heretic. Concerning this, love does not avail. John says clearly that we should not receive an antichrist, a false prophet, into our house, and we should not even say to him, “Rejoice!” </p>
