Many had turned away from him and forsaken him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95495" data-verses="2Timothy 1:15">1:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95496" data-verses="2Timothy 4:16">4:16</span>), including even some of his co-workers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95497" data-verses="2Timothy 4:10">4:10</span>). It was a discouraging and disappointing scene, especially to his young fellow-worker and spiritual child, Timothy. Due to this, in the opening of this encouraging, strengthening, and establishing Epistle, he confirmed to Timothy that he was an apostle of Christ, not only through the will of God, but also according to the promise of life which is in Christ. This implies that the churches may become degraded, and many of the saints may backslide in unfaithfulness, but the eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God, promised by God in His holy writings and given to the apostle and all the believers, remains forever the same. With and upon this unchanging life the firm foundation of God has been laid and stands unshaken through all the tide of degradation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95498" data-verses="2Timothy 2:19">2:19</span>). By such a life those who seek the Lord out of a pure heart are able to stand the trial of the church’s decline. This life, on which the apostle in his first Epistle charged Timothy and others to lay <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> hold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95499" data-verses="1Timothy 6:12">6:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95500" data-verses="1Timothy 6:19">19</span>), should be an encouragement and strengthening to him in perilous times. </p>
<p data-content-id="KYQZODoiJ56kxFU1BRTVTTn0B--TdMSdGnFsPbmT-yLVsSDWG0mQrGVCJL0ZFrqs8"> Only in the two Timothys did the apostle include God’s mercy in the opening greeting of his Epistles. God’s mercy reaches farther than His grace. In the degraded situation of the churches, God’s mercy is needed. </p>

THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK:<br/>INOCULATION AGAINST<br/>THE DECLINE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p data-content-id="OtHJzBWE0VPqWTrWknemSLSZGIVWzE-eWxe6T6xbTa52z7TjVCAaKmzVsk3YDicnq"> When Paul was writing this Epistle, he was fully aware that the churches were declining. However, because he was one who laid hold on the promise of eternal life, he was not discouraged or disappointed. He had something within him which never changed—the eternal, uncreated, incorruptible life of God. No matter how the environment may change, this eternal life remains the same. Because he himself was encouraged in the life of God and not disappointed by the situation, Paul wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy not only as an encouragement and strengthening to a younger co-worker, but also as an inoculation for the entire Body of Christ against the decline of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="4lyV5oDGKH_KgwZH1Yek92rflrBFN_yD1nDrq39oQGKksjBUxq3Qmrr-05U1jfs6m"> We should not regard 2 Timothy merely as a so-called pastoral book. If we have the proper insight, we shall realize that the divine thought within Paul was to inoculate the believers against the decline of the church. Paul foresaw this decline. However, deep within he was encouraged, not because he could understand matters according to logic, but because he laid hold of the eternal life promised by God in His holy writings. The very life promised by God in the Scriptures dwelt within Paul. Paul’s burden in writing this Epistle was both to encourage and to strengthen Timothy and also to inject a divine substance into the church in order to inoculate the church against the germ of decline. We praise the Lord that this inoculation has been effective. Yes, the church throughout the centuries has been ruined to a certain extent, but it has not been exterminated. Paul had the foresight to inoculate the church against decline. Even today <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> we in the Lord’s recovery are enjoying the benefit of this inoculation. </p>
<p data-content-id="yDt50HJ7Gf-4as1ewf_aanbKovmsxG-PFVoGPPrhDlDE5_DkUAODYT-urqcTdZvV8"> My burden in this message is to consider eight basic elements of this inoculation. These divine provisions for the inoculation include a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, incorruptible life, healthy words, and the indwelling Spirit. These ingredients of the marvelous dose administered by Paul are found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95501" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1-14">1:1-14</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="84Akdp8riq8NIsXgaQdU7z4k98pqxFONUyPWQVGzvoTe2q6ESqXm59NJhFEWawGV3">II. INTRODUCTION</h2><p data-content-id="0j6zk4Zj1qCpSgeAFBHvASrGqoLb7uvCki-1-F_gvfpJrh46J0HY91D0pSuUCvHzq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95502" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1-2">Verses 1 and 2</span> are an introductory word. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95503" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1">verse 1</span> Paul says that he was an apostle not only through the will of God, but also according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus. The expression “the promise of life” does not mean that we have only the promise and not the life. It means that we have received the promised life. A similar term, “the promise of the Spirit,” is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95504" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Galatians 3:14</span>. This term does not mean that we have received only the promise and have not received the Spirit. It means that we have received the Spirit who has been promised. In the same principle, the words “the promise of life” denote the promised life. Paul was an apostle according to the life which God had promised, which Paul had received, and which dwelt within him. Paul became an apostle by this life. </p>
<p data-content-id="7q0aRN4m8nWSapUrL4vWNeKhDygoiLXLq4a9HoDlKjAIoe2rIonNIUUMbn8L2Ul8g"> The eternal life according to which Paul became an apostle is incorruptible and unchanging, for this life is actually the processed Triune God Himself. Because Paul was indwelt by this life, not even the whole Roman Empire was able to prevail over him in its dealings with him. Paul was strengthened by the processed Triune God as life. </p>
<p data-content-id="_FfwsLphrKIXpcvGwo_bw2hxwAeiUZVxOp5TOQ2ntYnB3BzXXd16cJUgT_3WDSu-W"> Nowhere else but in the opening of this Epistle does Paul say that he was an apostle according to the promise of life. Elsewhere he tells us that he was an apostle through the will of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95505" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Eph. 1:1</span>). Not many Christian teachers emphasize the fact that Paul’s apostleship was not only through the will of God, but also by the promise of eternal life. The reason Christians emphasize the will of God but not the <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> promise of life is that they themselves do not see this matter of life. Whatever we do and whatever we are in the Lord’s recovery today must be according to eternal life and by this life. Praise the Lord that we are in His recovery by this life! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="B4MyB3Ro__i30fcwYprCNTygqvtSH9Ba5s7fADBUDVnwQ67ENXDt1TM54_l0q5tWC">III. THE DIVINE PROVISIONS FOR<br/>THE INOCULATION</h2><p data-content-id="xcRxQm2EL2GHd5d2bWUdqr_AQ4YJrSAunjFkPQIH7hl8gpvbjictmfLy6rSkMYEUv"> The life mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95506" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1">verse 1</span> includes all the eight basic elements of the inoculation. This means that eternal life includes a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, the element of incorruption, healthy words, and the indwelling Spirit. If we have this life, which is actually the processed Triune God, we have a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, and all the other provisions of the divine inoculation. Let us now consider these provisions one by one. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="r5Q_1Hl-cplmrRU15eVoDGn-ki8JyLp0nuLYF2Ags6dwYoumCSIwuaqlBTRg7pli3">A. A Pure Conscience</h2><p data-content-id="dLge27Yg8kXpXYfuw62oP9lkP2QBlu6WdqLvV6doML7Fa9T7JeeagirBycQsl6ni0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95507" data-verses="2Timothy 1:3">verse 3</span> Paul says, “I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day.” To serve here is to serve God in His worship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95508" data-verses="Acts 24:14">Acts 24:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95509" data-verses="Philippians 3:3">Phil. 3:3</span>). Paul followed in the footsteps of his forefathers to serve God in a pure conscience. In a time of degradation, a pure conscience, a conscience purified from any mixture, is needed if we are to serve God. </p>
<p data-content-id="QPIK-ummZTB-I4eH4p4KFwVgp7gF4tniT2aE5rRS_U1sqNtf_vxpnhLhXS0NNwBuN"> I have the assurance that all the saints who are so honest, truthful, and faithful to the Lord in His recovery have not only a good conscience, but also a pure conscience. In this matter we should not accept the lie of the enemy. The more we doubt that we have a pure conscience, the more we shall feel that our conscience is not pure. We need to declare, “Satan, get away from me! I have a pure conscience. Satan, don’t you know that I am for the Lord and not for anything else? I am for the Lord, for His recovery, for His church, and for His interests.” The more we testify in an honest way that we have a pure conscience, the stronger will <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> be our realization that our conscience is in fact pure. The way for us to have a pure conscience is to declare by faith, honestly, truthfully, and steadfastly, that we have a pure conscience toward the Lord. Do not listen to your doubts, and do not believe the lies of the enemy. The Lord’s blood prevails against him. Do not believe the enemy when he says that you are weak, or when he accuses you of being impure and not having a good conscience. Do you not love the Lord? Are you not for the Lord and His church? Learn to tell the enemy, “Satan, you have been cheating me long enough. I will not believe you any longer, and I will not allow you to hold me back. I am for the Lord, and I have a pure conscience.” </p>

Although this portion of 2 Timothy is short, Paul must have had strong feelings when he wrote these words. </p>
<p data-content-id="D__jF6NCdqAs5B2p6OBSr1Vv9qCLJ37F5ELI7K-qR9_dx7TUa2O1H2LwdOETp79Um"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95544" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1-14">1:1-14</span> Paul covered many positive, encouraging, and strengthening matters. Based on his charge to Timothy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95545" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1-7">verses 1 through 7</span>, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95546" data-verses="2Timothy 1:8">verse 8</span>, “Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God.” Here the gospel is personified; it is regarded as a living person that is suffering persecution. Paul encouraged Timothy to suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="SZ6ePvGN6OBHQqa_MlziQZY_vJsoE9E-4Vb8bXwg6FjUOZQk1zGITPIpJlRCm0jsa"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95547" data-verses="2Timothy 1:9">verse 9</span> Paul goes on to speak of God who “saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal.” The purpose here refers to God’s goal, and grace refers to the means of reaching this goal. The grace to reach God’s goal was given to us in Christ Jesus “before times eternal,” that is, before the world began. Grace “has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95548" data-verses="2Timothy 1:10">v. 10</span>). Hence, grace did not come until the Lord Jesus came. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95549" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> indicates this: “The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.” The grace which came through Jesus Christ is nothing less than the Triune God <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> dispensed into us for our enjoyment. This grace carries out God’s purpose and enables us to reach His goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="giRCIc6JQIjswqIyh4T97NLyWyF9o9XG29QXNmgEeom62qw9Wu9pXhS4HlRcrELGh"> Grace works in two ways. It works negatively to nullify death, and it works positively to bring in life and incorruption. This work of grace is still taking place within us. Today, in the church life grace is nullifying death and bringing life and incorruption to light through the gospel. Although we heard the gospel preached in the past, we probably did not hear that the gospel of grace nullifies death and brings in life and incorruption. </p>
<p data-content-id="eO8qUkJNYpeHhG0xNfAbWH4HPDm2zG1-7w4nbjwzXtjz45uNv8IOjIqXx2c2-kH9h"> On behalf of such a gospel, Paul was “appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95550" data-verses="2Timothy 1:11">v. 11</span>). Paul was a herald to proclaim the gospel, an apostle to establish churches, and a teacher to instruct the churches and the saints in the details of the gospel. For the sake of this gospel, Paul suffered “these things.” However, he was not ashamed, for he knew the One whom he had believed and was persuaded that He was able to guard his deposit, to guard what he had committed unto Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95551" data-verses="2Timothy 1:12">v. 12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="nB4LWW9R-1pdlliKhqg8jxbHGilkLG0tfKYYUaI-VuksL0mO1YtCcLSPddYvm2xu0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95552" data-verses="2Timothy 1:13">verse 13</span> Paul charges Timothy, “Hold a pattern of healthy words which you heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.” Paul’s foregoing words to Timothy are a pattern of the healthy words which Timothy was to hold. We should hold such a pattern in faith, in the organic union with the Triune God, and in the divine love. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95553" data-verses="2Timothy 1:14">verse 14</span>, we should “guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.” The good deposit here is equal to the healthy words. We should guard this deposit through the indwelling Holy Spirit. The more we consider all the matters covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95554" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1-14">verses 1 through 14</span>, the more we realize what riches these verses contain. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="61jxnuemHfu4MLYiIKK4N_tiMSFiUOQPlOk4mR6G7WCJfIYFjtHGAFguarHArDG30">I. THE APOSTASY</h2><p data-content-id="RdP3f2y72B4H_Untrwt_wEPep4OFnX25wuRxFEoL8A6yEa_3NxO1e87vjctudIyHM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95555" data-verses="2Timothy 1:15">1:15</span> Paul says, “This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.” Asia here refers to the province of Asia. In this verse Paul indicates that believers in Asia who had <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> formerly received the apostle’s ministry now forsook him. In spite of such desertion, the apostle grew stronger in the grace that was in Christ, who was the same and would never change. Without being discouraged, he exhorted his son in faith to persevere steadily in the ministry in the midst of failure and ruin of the churches. </p>
<p data-content-id="st2lnVQYyLDDBJ7bf4CbzkYnsOmbHVIuh_e9rPTxY8redn7TckNf-ZgdsVkHuu7I1"> It is difficult to say to whom the words “all who are in Asia” refer. Does it mean that every believer in Asia turned away from Paul? Paul specifically names Phygelus and Hermogenes, two who must have taken the lead to desert the apostle because of his imprisonment. But what about all the other believers in Asia? We cannot say that every one deserted Paul, for Paul mentions Onesiphorus as one who often refreshed him and who sought him out diligently in Rome and found him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95556" data-verses="2Timothy 1:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="wtX0jdEm5suMiP0PMqtMrBQ4AG7wi9mukPEPLKZD2k9gRGpKCdIuUNr8aWAoABD-d"> A number of expositors say that these verses point to an apostasy, a departure from the truth. But what was the extent of the apostasy? I believe that “all who are in Asia” points to the general situation among the believers in Asia without including every particular believer. Generally speaking, there was apostasy in Asia. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Lj55zzEKG6nwOZVtaY0R_-CSRC7DzeZI2AhIcNKtR1W3H3KC-wbXw4MYlFt1o8ETx">II. THE FAITHFULNESS</h2><p data-content-id="mcwnJunTa5btwa5PIxFcoDrClZnbUPMxQ9OfKJ0VqSKC-ZvLura3wcLWBLSstBbYC"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95557" data-verses="2Timothy 1:15-18">Second Timothy 1:15-18</span> indicates that we cannot be neutral. We are either a Phygelus or Hermogenes, or we are an Onesiphorus. Onesiphorus was an overcomer who resisted the general trend and stood against the down current to refresh the Lord’s ambassador in spirit, soul, and body, one who was not ashamed of Paul’s imprisonment for the Lord’s commission. Concerning him Paul says, “May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day! And in how many things he served in Ephesus, you know very well.” The words “that day” refer to the day of the Lord’s victorious appearing to reward His overcomers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95558" data-verses="2Timothy 4:8">4:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95559" data-verses="Revelation 22:12">Rev. 22:12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Zs7Rq1l005ulIAVjQ-lo0b0adFazdwLvBLXEW8xV2ERdZNMejsabWbl4CjUX8mMR7"> The principle here is nearly the same as that at the time of Elijah. Elijah said to the Lord, “I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the children of Israel have <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95560" data-verses="1Kings 19:14">1 Kings 19:14</span>). The Lord replied, “Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95561" data-verses="1Kings 19:18">v. 18</span>). The principle here is that even during a period of decline, a downward trend when most of God’s people are carried away, there are always a number who remain faithful. There will always be an Onesiphorus to stand against the downward trend. Yes, Phygelus, Hermogenes, and others in Asia turned away from Paul. But Onesiphorus, an overcomer, stood against the decline, against the down current. </p>
<p data-content-id="AjmtXNoAHgNCquwjuJCombIbD51zNIEkfMaTPjjEvh31Fs0n6eqjA6Q6PPgqS0tjz"> I am certain that both Phygelus and Hermogenes were believers. Otherwise, Paul would not have said that they turned away from him. Phygelus and Hermogenes were with Paul at one time. Probably they were not ordinary believers; they must have been either co-workers or leading ones among the saints. To be sure, they took the lead to turn away from Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="FPv8KfmY0WFq4jhjEa6D-swPQowkjg5PPguhlcj3IGkoJSH4hr0zx6F5rf7ov0aow"> Those who turned away from Paul turned away not only from his person, but also from his ministry. Actually, it is not the person himself who is important; it is the ministry carried on by a person which is of extreme importance. When Paul said that certain ones turned away from him, he did not mean that they merely turned away from him as a person, but that they turned away from his ministry. In perilous times, genuine believers, even leading ones and co-workers, may turn away. </p>
<p data-content-id="CkVFuVy_6Pnsa9siJJPAoXDzs4n7KSFAk0PMWzX-Z9owcK9cPlay3WFAiFrzKbNoP"> In relation to this matter, I would like to relate certain aspects of the history of the Lord’s recovery. During the years I was with Brother Nee in mainland China, I saw many who accepted Brother Nee’s ministry for a time and later turned away. Although the number of saints was not large, it happened again and again that some, perhaps just two or three, turned away from Brother Nee’s ministry. </p>

These titles are a teacher, a soldier, a contender (an athlete), a husbandman, and a workman.

A TEACHER</h2><p data-content-id="iwf0rwg2yYuADpokDFv3OF31Cc7Luc13ZckeU731spp343O4v2_iTjJl7K2emz0cs"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95565" data-verses="2Timothy 2:1">2:1</span> Paul says, “You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.” The word “therefore” refers to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95566" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1">chapter one</span>. Paul’s exhortation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95567" data-verses="2Timothy 2:1">2:1</span> is in view of what has been mentioned in the preceding chapter. Based upon what he has just written to Timothy, Paul now goes on to encourage him to be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus. Paul did not charge Timothy here to be empowered in knowledge or in gifts. He charged him to be empowered in grace. The apostle himself had experienced the empowering of grace in life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95568" data-verses="2Timothy 1:9-12">1:9-12</span>). Now he exhorts Timothy to be empowered in the same grace. This grace is God’s provision in life for us to live out His purpose. Instead of being discouraged, Paul was empowered in grace, even though he was in prison. He realized that grace is nothing less than the processed Triune God—the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the indwelling Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95569" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">Second Corinthians 13:14</span> indicates that grace is the very Triune God Himself: “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” Grace is not a thing; it is a unique Person, the living, divine Person of the Triune God processed to be the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit. This Spirit now dwells in us as our grace. We all can be empowered in this grace in the indwelling Triune God processed to be our enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="1I1IpLfBXfGpa9yZ6L0ochALsyfr5Sk52H6aujNgj2jZvkWizLd0DhziehAMZdTbi"> The more we are empowered in this grace, the more able we shall be to teach others. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95570" data-verses="2Timothy 2:2">verse 2</span> Paul goes on to say, “And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.” The things to which Paul refers here are the healthy words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95571" data-verses="2Timothy 1:13">1:13</span>. The healthy words, after being committed to faithful men, become the good deposit in them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95572" data-verses="2Timothy 1:14">1:14</span>). This word indicates that if someone in a local church has a deposit of the Lord’s healthy words, he should train the faithful ones, the trustworthy ones, that they also may have a good deposit from the Lord, thus making them competent to teach others. </p>
<p data-content-id="9WtQAGaWd3JGwMLsN3WZPsaG50l2l3f-zEB0TByXTgsqBy-AtMzCnNQ5a9SYmtMRh"> Paul realized that Timothy had received a good deposit, that he had been taught and nourished with the riches of grace. Therefore, he charged Timothy to commit these things to others who would be faithful and competent to carry on the same ministry. This indicates that more than one person is needed to carry on the riches of God’s New Testament economy. My hope is that through all these Life-study Messages thousands of saints in the Lord’s recovery will receive a good deposit of the riches of grace concerning God’s New Testament economy. Then those who have received these riches will be able to commit these things to others. Imagine what the situation would be if the Lord had ten thousand saints filled with His good deposit, spreading the riches of His economy throughout the earth. No doubt, this would hasten the time of His glorious appearing. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLge27Yg8kXpXYfuw62oP9lkP2QBluaWdoLvV6doML7Fa9T7JeeagirBycQsl6ni0"> There is one God, one Christ, one Spirit, and one church. Because God is one, His way must also be one. Is this way to be found in Catholicism or in the denominations or in the charismatic movement? Certainly not! Neither is God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> unique way found among the independent Christian groups. God’s way is in His recovery. Actually, the recovery is the recovery of the unique way. Many saints can testify with a pure conscience from the depths of their being that if they do not take the way of the recovery today, they have no other way. The Lord’s recovery is <em>the</em> way. I say this, not because I have been used of the Lord in His recovery, but simply because it is a fact. Some who became dissenting and left discovered that they had no way to go back to the denominations. In certain cases the denominations might not even be willing to accept them. This shows that if we touch the recovery and then leave it, we commit spiritual suicide, for we turn away from God’s unique way. </p>

To fight a good fight (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95579" data-verses="2Timothy 4:7">4:7</span>) for the Lord’s interests on this earth we must be cleared of any earthly entanglement. The matters of our material, physical life should not entangle us as we are endeavoring to minister Christ to others. This ministry is a fighting, and the fighting requires that we be free from entanglement. On the one hand, the priestly service is a ministry to God; on <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> the other hand, it is a warfare against God’s enemies. As the priests were bearing the ark of testimony, they had to be prepared to fight against those who might attack this testimony. </p>

Just as a soldier must win the victory and an athlete must receive the crown, so a husbandman must partake of the fruits, the food. This requires patience. As athletes we should be quick, but as farmers we need to be patient. If out of impatience a farmer would pluck up the tiny sprouts, his crop would be ruined. Likewise, if he drives his cattle too much, he may hurt them. With both crops and livestock, farmers must learn to have patience. </p>

Many Christians think that truth in such verses as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95624" data-verses="2Timothy 2:15">2:15</span> means doctrine or teaching. However, in the New Testament truth does not denote mere doctrine. Concerning Christ in His incarnation, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95625" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says, “The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and truth.” It certainly would be nonsensical to interpret truth here as doctrine. How could we say that the Word became flesh and was full of doctrine? In New Testament usage truth refers to the reality of God’s New Testament economy. When Christ came through incarnation, grace and reality also came. Both grace and reality are God Himself. Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment; reality is God realized by us in the Son. Therefore, grace and reality both refer to God incarnate. When we receive grace, we also receive reality. Then we have God as our reality. This reality is the truth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95626" data-verses="2Timothy 2:15">2 Timothy 2:15</span>. As we have pointed out, this truth is the reality of the contents of God’s New Testament economy. These contents include Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. To cut straight the word of the truth is not simply to divide the Bible into various sections. Rather, it is to cut the healthy word of the reality of the contents of God’s economy. <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> </p>

Literally it means “will find pasture,” as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95630" data-verses="John 10:9">John 10:9</span>. The word for pasture in Greek is the medical term for the consuming progress of a mortifying disease (Alford). Hence, its meaning in this verse is to spread. </p>
<p data-content-id="FPv8KfmY0WFq4jhjEa6D-swPQowkjhZPPiuhlcj3IGkoJSH4hr0zx6F5rf7ov0aow"> The word gangrene denotes an eating sore, a cancer.

Paul does not say that Hymenaeus and Philetus misaimed concerning doctrine or teaching; he says that they misaimed concerning the <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> truth, concerning the reality of the New Testament economy. They swerved from the truth by saying that the resurrection had already taken place. This is to claim that there will be no resurrection.

This subjective faith, our believing act, is very much related to the resurrection of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95637" data-verses="Romans 10:9">Rom. 10:9</span>). As we have pointed out, this subjective faith involves an organic union between us and the Triune God. For one’s faith to be overthrown is to have this inward organic union damaged in some way. Some among us can testify of having had this organic union temporarily cut off by hearing the words of those who taught differently. Inwardly these ones realized that the organic union within them had ceased. That was the overthrowing of their faith. </p>

It is true that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95639" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span> Paul says that Christ is the unique foundation. Apart from Him, we do not have any other foundation. Nevertheless, if we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95640" data-verses="2Timothy 2:19">verse 19</span> according to the context of the chapter, we shall see that the foundation here does not refer to Christ as the foundation of the church, but refers to the church as the foundation, or base, of the truth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95641" data-verses="2Timothy 2:14-18">Verses 14 through 18</span> give instruction concerning how to deal with heresies on the negative side and how to handle the truth on the positive <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> side.

However, because it is built upon a firm foundation, the recovery did not collapse and it will never collapse. Had the Lord’s recovery been founded on something other than the divine life, the eternal life, it would have collapsed long ago. But because the recovery has the firm foundation of the truth, it is not hurt by attack. On the contrary, those who seek to damage the recovery actually damage themselves, and at the same time they strengthen the recovery and expose the firmness of its foundation. The recovery is built on something eternal and divine—God’s life with His nature. For this reason, not even the gates of Hades can conquer it. Because it is built on the indestructible and unconquerable eternal life, the firm foundation of the truth stands. In recent years, it has not been necessary for us to protect the Lord’s recovery. It has been protected by the unconquerable divine life. Hence, the church is the firm foundation of God standing in the eternal life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Il9MOPOP1pauhikGkXcWV3ieyyi4im1ciZ3qWJspoHNlz145tUofqfB_Hlc8RvYHI"> Paul says that this firm foundation has “this seal.” The seal has two sides. On the Lord’s side it is: “The Lord knows those who are His.” This is based on the Lord’s divine life, which He has given to all His believers and which has brought them into an organic union with Him, making them one with Him and causing them to become His. On our <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> side it is: “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.” This is the issue of the divine life: it enables us to depart from unrighteousness and keeps us blameless in His holy name.

After a word of introduction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95673" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>), Paul speaks of the divine provisions for the inoculation: a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, incorruptible life, the healthy word, and the indwelling Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95674" data-verses="2Timothy 1:3-14">1:3-14</span>). Then he goes on to point out that the basic factor of the decline is the forsaking of the apostle and his ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95675" data-verses="2Timothy 1:15-18">1:15-18</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95676" data-verses="2Timothy 2:1-15">2:1-15</span> Paul speaks of the inoculator, indicating that he must be a teacher, soldier, contender, husbandman, and workman. In the second half of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95677" data-verses="2Timothy 2:1">chapter two</span> he tells us of the spread of the decline, a spreading likened to that of gangrene (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95678" data-verses="2Timothy 2:16-26">2:16-26</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95679" data-verses="2Timothy 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul first speaks of the worsening of the decline, showing that it will become grievous times of deceiving (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95680" data-verses="2Timothy 3:1-13">3:1-13</span>), and then speaks of the antidote of the inoculation—the divine word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95681" data-verses="2Timothy 3:14-17">3:14-17</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95682" data-verses="2Timothy 4:1">chapter four</span> there are three sections: the incentive to the inoculator—the coming reward (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95683" data-verses="2Timothy 4:1-8">4:1-8</span>); the issue of the decline—loving the present age and doing many evil things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95684" data-verses="2Timothy 4:9-18">4:9-18</span>); and the conclusion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95685" data-verses="2Timothy 4:19-22">4:19-22</span>). If we consider the outline of 2 Timothy, we shall see that it is not merely a pastoral book, a book for so-called pastors. On the contrary, it is a book written for inoculators, those who would inoculate others against the decline of the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="2TJZFx-IYv7UwKQYQxYNeHYfVjDAx13K24kviyOU3UQ216notEkpiNGvoutnnn42C"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95686" data-verses="2Timothy 3:1">Chapter three</span> opens with the words, “But know this, that in the last days difficult times shall come.” Once again Paul uses the word “but” to point out a contrast. The contrast here is with the hope just expressed at the end of the preceding chapter. Toward the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95687" data-verses="2Timothy 2:1">chapter two</span> Paul declared that “the firm foundation of God stands” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95688" data-verses="2Timothy 2:19">v. 19</span>), and that we should “flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95689" data-verses="2Timothy 2:22">v. 22</span>). Furthermore, if in meekness we correct those who oppose, “God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth, and they may return to soberness out of the snare of the devil” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95690" data-verses="2Timothy 2:25-26">vv. 25-26</span>). Paul realized that even though the decline would spread, the firm foundation of God still stands unshakable, bearing a seal which says, “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.” At least God would have a remnant of those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace. Furthermore, such ones may even dispense the inoculation against the church’s decline. Yes, the decline is spreading, but we have a firm standing, we can enjoy the riches of the Lord, and we can do the work of inoculation, even convincing those who oppose to come back to the full knowledge of the truth. This is to bring back those who have been caught by the devil, and snared by him, to God’s will. All this indicates that Paul was not discouraged. Even though the decline is spreading, we can do something positively to inoculate others against it. </p>
<p data-content-id="uV0I4CkIgTAfzESvbwFwyhI8Cuk1THh1pnhFbxVfVvFKGV-6NZflL7dVS_qi1vO77"> Then in contrast to all this Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95691" data-verses="2Timothy 3:1">3:1</span>, “But know this, that in the last days difficult times shall come.” Paul had the foresight and the insight to realize that difficult times would come in the last days. The expression “the last days” denotes the closing period of the present age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95692" data-verses="2Peter 3:3">2 Pet. 3:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95693" data-verses="Jude 1:18">Jude 18</span>). It began from the end of the so-called apostolic age, in the latter part of the first century, and will last until <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> Christ’s second appearing. The long duration of this period was not revealed to the apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95694" data-verses="Matthew 24:36">Matt. 24:36</span>); they expected the Lord to return in their generation. </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW-HE5PRlO8PUBjq3CVpkfbOI86mFQfppWGGkAyFlQfK2aXtG3bovuNCow23WVC1"> Many Christians identify “the last days” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95695" data-verses="2Timothy 3:1">3:1</span> with the “later times” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95696" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>. This is a mistake. In the Bible there is a dividing line between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The ancient Jews regarded the times of the Old Testament as the early times or early days. With the coming of Christ the period of the Mosaic law was over. Christ’s coming began a new period, regarded as the last days, which will continue until Christ’s second coming. Concerning Christ’s second coming, there is a secret period of time, which was not known by the apostles. They were eager to know the time of the Lord’s second coming. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95697" data-verses="Mark 13:32">Mark 13:32</span> the Lord Jesus said, “But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.” Later, after the Lord’s resurrection, the disciples asked Him, “Dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95698" data-verses="Acts 1:6">Acts 1:6</span>). To this the Lord replied, “It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within his own authority” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95699" data-verses="Acts 1:7">v. 7</span>). It is not easy to explain how the Lord could say that only the Father, not the Son, knows the time of the end. Perhaps in refusing to answer the question about the time of His coming, the Lord Jesus was maintaining the proper position under the headship of the Father. Therefore, He told them that this was something which “the Father hath set within his own authority.” </p>
<p data-content-id="cWbelvU1vDvowMHCNaxjxu3zAlzIyLzoiWEKorLkOnqXyEQ8O-skNn-kafQfAs6di"> The early disciples thought that the Lord Jesus would come back in their generation. This was Paul’s concept when he wrote 1 and 2 Thessalonians. This shows that the length of the last days was a secret unknown by the apostles. We simply do not know the duration of time the Father has set in His administration between the Lord’s ascension and His second coming. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y8age40pVXGWFFc1KKaQ2cikI9rBVMmtThTO4XBGeMCu7FO6O1YBSuwmqaNMtnQsg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95700" data-verses="2Timothy 3:1">3:1</span> Paul says that in the last days “difficult times shall come.” The Greek for “difficult times” also means hard times, grievous times, perilous times. This means that these times will be extremely difficult for Christians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95701" data-verses="2Timothy 3:12">verse 12 </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> Paul says, “All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.” For those who pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace and who call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart, this time will indeed be difficult, grievous, perilous. Here Paul seems to be saying, “Timothy, I am encouraged by the fact that the firm foundation of God stands and that, with others, you can pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace and call on the Lord out of a pure heart. You can stand together and dispense the inoculation against the decline of the church. Some may even be recovered to the full knowledge of the truth and to the will of God. Nevertheless, I want you to know that the time which is coming will be very difficult for you. This time will be grievous, perilous, for all those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart and who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus.” </p>

This is proved by the phrase, “having a form of godliness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95705" data-verses="2Timothy 3:5">v. 5</span>). Unbelievers do not have even the form of godliness. Those who have such a form are those who are called Christians. Thus, the men in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95706" data-verses="2Timothy 3:2">verse 2</span> are Christians. </p>
<p data-content-id="SZ6ePvGN6OBHQqa_MlziQZY_vJsoE80--Gr8bXwg6FjUOZQk1zGITPIpJlRCm0jsa"> The first thing Paul says about these men is that they will be “lovers of self.” Many Christians today are self-lovers. Not only those who indulge in worldly entertainments are selfish; even those who attend the chapels and cathedrals may be selfish. </p>

Complete here <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> means complete and perfect in qualifications, and equipped denotes being fitted out, furnished, made ready. </p>
<p data-content-id="84Akdp8riq8NIsXgaQdU7z4k98pqxE-NXyvWQVGzvoTe2q6ESqXm59NJhFEWawGV3"> We need to know the Bible not merely according to letters in black and white, but also according to the divine revelation and heavenly wisdom. Do not think that having an advanced degree qualifies anyone to understand a book such as Ephesians. If we study this Epistle only in letters, we shall not be able to understand it. For a proper understanding of this book, and for the Bible as a whole, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. This was the reason Paul prayed, “That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95761" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17-18">Eph. 1:17-18</span>). We thank the Lord that for more than fifty years we have been receiving such a spirit of wisdom and revelation. As a result, the messages put out in the Lord’s recovery always contain something fresh and new. These messages are given not merely according to the black and white letters of the Scripture, but according to the spirit of wisdom and revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="0j6zk4Zj1qCpSgeAFBHvASrGqoLb7vfCnje1-F_gvfpJrh46J0HY91D0pSuUCvHzq"> We in the Lord’s recovery do not treasure theology, tradition, or the councils. We honor, respect, and treasure the holy Word under the shining of the heavenly light which comes by a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Because we depend on God’s enlightenment, His Word is opened to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="7q0aRN4m8nWSapUrL4vWNeKhDygoiKnLp569HoDlKjAIoe2rIonNIUUMbn8L2Ul8g"> Many Christians misuse <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95762" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16-17">3:16 and 17</span>. They point out that the holy Scripture is for teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness and that it enables the man of God to be equipped, completed, and perfected. Although all this is true, it neglects the element of life in the Word. Those who regard the Bible as a book of teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction often ignore the life essence of the Word. As human beings we have a physical body outwardly, but inwardly we have a spirit and a soul. Our person is composed not mainly of the outward part, the body, but of the inward parts, the spirit and the soul. The principle is the same with the Bible. The Bible has not only a “body” of letters in black and white; it also has a spirit, because it is <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> God-breathed. If in reading the Bible we exercise only our mind to study it, we shall not receive the life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="_FfwsLphrKIXpcvGwo_bw2hxwAeiUYlxNpZTOQ2ntYnB3BzXXd16cJUgT_3WDSu-W"> Most Christians neglect the spirit and take the Bible as a book of letters. The Lord Jesus once said, “The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95763" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>). Furthermore, we have pointed out that every word of the Bible is part of God’s breath. Thus, we should not only study the Word, but also breathe in the divine breath embodied in the Word. If we do not breathe the divine breath by exercising our spirit, we shall not receive life from our study of the Bible. But when we breathe in God’s breath, we are enlivened by a divine, heavenly, and spiritual element. </p>

<p data-content-id="dLge27Yg8kXpXYfuw62oP9lkP2QBlvaWU6rvV6doML7Fa9T7JeeagirBycQsl6ni0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95781" data-verses="2Timothy 4:1">4:1</span> Paul speaks of Christ’s appearing and His kingdom. Christ’s appearing will be for judgment, to reward each one of us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95782" data-verses="Matthew 16:27">Matt. 16:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95783" data-verses="Revelation 22:12">Rev. 22:12</span>), and His kingdom will be for His reigning with His overcomers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95784" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">Rev. 20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95785" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>). By these two events the apostle charges Timothy to fulfill his ministry of the word faithfully. Here it seems that Paul is saying, “Timothy, you must realize that your life and work today have much to do with the Lord’s appearing and His kingdom. At His appearing will you be praised by the Lord, or will you receive a rebuke from Him? Will you receive a reward or chastisement? Will you be considered qualified to participate in the divine kingship and reign with Christ for a thousand years, or will you be disqualified from reigning with Him? Timothy, you need to think seriously about these <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> things. Thus, I charge you by the Lord’s appearing and kingdom.” </p>
<p data-content-id="QPIK-ummZTB-I4eH4p4KFwVgp7gF4sHibmqE5rRS_U1sqNtf_vxpnhLhXS0NNwBuN"> It is a matter of great significance to be charged by the Lord’s appearing and kingdom. As genuine Christians we are saved for eternity, but how are we living our Christian life, and how well are we fulfilling our Christian duty? Are we taking care of God’s New Testament economy? Do we practice the proper church life, the Body life, to express God in Christ through the Spirit? These questions deserve our attention, for the way we answer them may determine our future as far as the Lord’s appearing and coming kingdom are concerned. Do not listen to the superstitious and superficial teachings which tell you that as long as you are saved you cannot have any problems with the Lord at His coming. You may have great problems when you meet Him at the judgment seat. Every believer in Christ, every genuinely saved person, must stand before the judgment seat of Christ and be judged by Him not concerning salvation or perdition, but concerning reward or punishment. Because this is a solemn matter, Paul charged Timothy before God and Christ Jesus and by the Lord’s appearing and kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="527nrROY7BYtyzTENyolNtfDlAd4A1nxLGzn_pLvAg8t4kcVj3v2dVhC9B0Wa9Vx6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95786" data-verses="2Timothy 4:2">verse 2</span> Paul continues his charge: “Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.” The word Timothy was to preach included what he had learned both of Paul and of the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95787" data-verses="2Timothy 3:14-15">3:14-15</span>). This proves that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95788" data-verses="2Timothy 4:1-2">verses 1 and 2</span> are a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95789" data-verses="2Timothy 3:14-17">3:14-17</span>. In caring for a local church, especially in a time of the church’s decline, the preaching of the Word is vital. </p>
<p data-content-id="NbF2W4I5Oj8ORgqsBivVGwY3iF3Vkot9wuMjObF09mb-UPKi0nnDeGOEM1SGs6qlM"> Timothy was not merely to preach a word about salvation from hell to heaven. He was to speak a completing word regarding God’s revelation concerning Christ and the church. Such a healthy word is the truth, the reality of the contents of God’s New Testament economy. Timothy was charged to be ready to preach this word in season and out of season. To preach in season and out of season means to preach whether the situation is opportune or inopportune, whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether you are welcome or <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> unwelcome. Furthermore, Timothy was to reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all longsuffering and teaching. Reprove here means to convict. The adjective all modifies both longsuffering and teaching. It speaks of teaching in many aspects and directions. The carrying out of such teaching requires longsuffering. </p>

At that time many will not tolerate healthy teaching, teaching which is healthy in life and which ministers the supply of life. Instead, they will prefer teachers who tickle the ear. This indicates that those who do not tolerate healthy teaching have an itching ear, an ear which seeks pleasing speaking for its own pleasure. Furthermore, such persons will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to fables. The itching ear that is turned away is the main factor of the worsening decline in the churches. </p>
<p data-content-id="UscIlaMsVn6FiSb-bVCMMOx1o04ZgLwMHPdYsMZHfz-x_4UTjyByzF9XZcQSta7HM"> Many Christians today do not tolerate the healthy teachings related to God’s economy. When we teach that Christ is the God-man, the One who is the embodiment of God as His expression, some accuse us of blasphemy or heresy. Some have even gone so far as to twist our words concerning Christ as the God-man and, in print, to falsely accuse us of teaching that Christ was neither quite God nor quite man. In <em>The Four Major Steps of Christ</em> I say, “We know that Christ is God incarnated as a man. Christ is the God-man. He is not only a man of God, He is also a God-man. Therefore, the incarnation of Christ simply means the mingling of God with humanity” (p. 6). Twisting our words and grossly misrepresenting us, certain of our opposers have written, “This incarnate deity was neither quite God nor quite man; He was a third thing, a mingled God-man.” We believe that <span class="pg" data-page-id="60" id="60">[60]</span> because Christ is true God and true man, He is the God-man. He is the perfect God and a complete man as well. Both His divine nature and His human nature, each being complete, concur in His one Person—without separation, without confusion, and without being changed into a third nature. Our Lord Jesus Christ, the God-man, one Person with two natures, is worthy to receive our worship and praise forever. </p>
<p data-content-id="M0vVc5bcmMEIYw9tUbdbFRgDSLUMt8u5IAY9BtDld6l_7RpkYRVwZCUToknU4HHMC"> Because many Christians today will not tolerate healthy teaching, they heap up teachers to tickle their itching ears. The teachings in the Lord’s recovery are altogether different. Our teachings do not tickle the ear. Instead, they may operate on the ears of those who hear. Unable to bear such an operation, some turn their ears away from the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="V0EVfG-HR_iYtEfRUOjliMrJCqjwwGkLNsoyo7A8NTKOIPClX2bn3d_krb5pJm7El"> We have pointed out again and again that in 1 and 2 Timothy truth refers to the reality of the contents of God’s New Testament economy. This reality consists primarily of Christ as the embodiment of God and of the church as the Body of Christ. Instead of listening to proper teachings concerning Christ and the church, many Christians have turned aside to other things. </p>

This ministry denotes the ministry of the Word to minister Christ in all His riches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95793" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Eph. 3:8</span>) to both sinners and believers for the building up of the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95794" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11-12">Eph. 4:11-12</span>).

I have fought the good fight, I have finished the <span class="pg" data-page-id="61" id="61">[61]</span> course, I have kept the faith.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95797" data-verses="2Timothy 4:6">verse 6</span> Paul indicates that he was already being poured out as a drink offering. The drink offering was additional to the basic offerings revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95798" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1-7">Leviticus 1 through 7</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95799" data-verses="Numbers 15:1-10">Num. 15:1-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95800" data-verses="Numbers 28:7-10">28:7-10</span>). The basic offerings were types of various aspects of Christ. The drink offering was a type of Christ as enjoyed by His offerer, an enjoyment that filled him with Christ as the heavenly wine and even made him wine to God. The apostle Paul became such a drink offering by so enjoying Christ that he could be poured out by the actual shedding of his blood. To be poured out here means to shed one’s blood. “Already being poured out” indicates that the process of being offered as a drink offering had begun. </p>

Paul could write such a word only to one who was very close to him. Timothy was close to Paul and intimate with him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y8age40pVXGWFFc1KKaQ2cikI9rBVP2tazTO4XBGeMCu7FO6O1YBSuwmqaNMtnQsg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95835" data-verses="2Timothy 4:10">verse 10</span> we find the reason Paul charged Timothy to come to him quickly: “For Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.” Loving the present age, the world now before our eyes, is in contrast to loving the Lord’s appearing, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95836" data-verses="2Timothy 4:8">verse 8</span>. The world, the cosmos, is composed of many ages. It seems that every decade is a different age. The present age is the world which surrounds us, attracts us, and tempts us. Demas was one who loved the present age. </p>
<p data-content-id="Eiv4AGEXAq-DzhELExxh-azlA8AC6zJKQW2XK4utWuJexsHihvtV128-KA1_AYiDQ"> Some believe that Demas came from Thessalonica and that this was the reason he went to Thessalonica after forsaking Paul. But whether or not he was a native of that city, it is certain that he went there because he loved the world and forsook the apostle. </p>
<p data-content-id="zcpRl-c09H-ubBf7bGjwzu4ud-YjBNlT5Cfm1YIZXkQb3UqwVSo61m8m2jRuBai1h"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95837" data-verses="2Timothy 4:10">Verse 10</span> is difficult to understand because the predicate “has gone” governs not only Demas, but also Crescens and Titus. This means that Demas had gone to Thessalonica, Crescens had gone to Galatia, and Titus had gone to Dalmatia. Does this indicate that Titus, like Demas, left Paul in a negative way? If it were not for the fact that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> name of Titus is presented positively in the New Testament, I would understand this verse to say that Demas, Crescens, and Titus all left Paul in a negative way. At least, I would take it to mean that Crescens and Titus took their own way. However, I find it difficult to believe that Titus would leave Paul in a negative way, especially after he had received from Paul an epistle addressed to him. After Paul had been arrested and imprisoned the second time, Titus visited him. Although I find it hard to believe that he forsook Paul, it is nonetheless a fact that he is categorized with Demas in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95838" data-verses="2Timothy 4:10">verse 10</span>. Did Paul send Crescens to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia? We do not know for sure if they were sent by Paul or if they went on their own initiative. </p>

Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for the ministry.” The fact that Paul says that Luke alone is with him may indicate that Titus left either in a negative way or in a neutral way. Demas forsook Paul because he loved the present age; Titus may have left him for some other reason. Because Paul was suffering as a prisoner in Rome, none of his co-workers should have left him for any reason unless they were sent by Paul. They should have remained there with Paul to strengthen him. Paul’s word about bringing Mark also indicates that he needed helpers to strengthen him. Ultimately we must leave to the Lord the question of whether Titus was sent by Paul to Dalmatia or went there on his own. </p>

We could use now, but, yet, or and. I prefer to use either but or yet. It seems that Paul is saying, “Although I need helpers and although I need you to come quickly and bring Mark with you, yet I have still sent Tychicus to Ephesus.” Although we may have difficulty deciding how to render the Greek word at the beginning of this sentence, we can still praise the Lord that there was a church in Ephesus, that Paul could send a brother there, and that there was a brother willing to be sent.

Paul’s co-workers had the freedom to act on their own. Paul did not say, “Titus, don’t go to Dalmatia. I need you to stay here with me. If you leave, I shall fire you from the work.” But although there was no human organization, there was a divine arrangement in which the leading apostle was the authority. Therefore, Paul could charge Timothy to come to him quickly. </p>

Very rarely, if ever, would Brother Nee say anything. However, along with others who knew the situation, I can testify that whenever I asked Brother Nee about something, he always gave me a direct answer. Sometimes when I was in a distant city, he would send me a cable telling me either to come to him or to go to a certain place. </p>

Yes, Paul wrote an epistle to Titus. But he could not say as much to Titus as he could to Timothy. To such an intimate co-worker as Timothy, Paul could issue a command for him to come quickly. </p>
<p data-content-id="0j6zk4Zj1qCpSgeAFBHvASrGqoLb7s_Ckj-1-F_gvfpJrh46J0HY91D0pSuUCvHzq"> Paul and his co-workers were not related to one another in the way of organization. This means that Paul did not regard himself as a boss who could hire or fire co-workers at his discretion. Likewise, because there is no organization in the Lord’s recovery today, there is no hiring or firing. </p>
<p data-content-id="7q0aRN4m8nWSapUrL4vWNeKhDygoiJHLq5a9HoDlKjAIoe2rIonNIUUMbn8L2Ul8g"> We have seen that, due to the attraction of the present age, Demas forsook the apostle. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95842" data-verses="2Timothy 4:8">verses 8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95843" data-verses="2Timothy 4:10">10</span> we have a contrast between loving the Lord’s appearing and loving the present age. If we love the Lord’s appearing, we shall take sides with Him and fight with Him for His interests. But if we love the present age, we shall take sides with the world. Even though Demas loved the present age and forsook Paul, Paul does not say that he dismissed him from the work. <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> Furthermore, Crescens and Titus may have left Paul without having been sent by him. Perhaps, deep within, Paul wanted Titus to stay with him to help and support him. Whatever the situation may have been, these verses make it clear that Paul did not use his authority according to the way of human organization. </p>
<p data-content-id="_FfwsLphrKIXpcvGwo_bw2hxwAeiUbFxOq5TOQ2ntYnB3BzXXd16cJUgT_3WDSu-W"> Many of those who have been co-workers for more than thirty years can testify that in the Lord’s recovery we do not have a human organization with a boss who exercises authority to hire or fire co-workers. Instead of organization, we have God’s coordination with His deputy authority. Because there was also such coordination and authority among Paul and his co-workers, he could tell Timothy to come to him quickly, and he could send Tychicus to Ephesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="B4MyB3Ro__i30fcwYprCNTygqvtSH_Ra5v7fADBUDVnwQ67ENXDt1TM54_l0q5tWC"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95844" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">Philippians 2</span>, Timothy was one with Paul in a very intimate way. He was one soul with him and was even willing to risk his soul for the work of Christ. Because of this oneness, this intimacy, Paul could command Timothy to come to him. He could also send Tychicus to Ephesus. This, however, is not organization. On the contrary, it is according to the spiritual situation among those in God’s coordination. How much the leading ones in God’s coordination can say to you depends on the extent to which you are one with the ministry. This is not a matter of organization, but of the degree of oneness. </p>
<p data-content-id="xcRxQm2EL2GHd5d2bWUdqr_AQ4YJrQQukilkPQIH7hl8gpvbjictmfLy6rSkMYEUv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95845" data-verses="2Timothy 4:13">verse 13</span> Paul goes on to say, “The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.” This word also reveals the intimacy between Paul and Timothy. Troas was a seaport in northwest Asia Minor, where Paul received the Macedonian call (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95846" data-verses="Acts 16:8-11">Acts 16:8-11</span>). The scrolls and the parchments were materials used for writing in ancient times. The cloak was probably a traveling cloak or traveling case. </p>
