<p class="scripture" data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfwGL_X3ZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83834" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:1-11">2 Cor. 1:1-11</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0Pc2zH4Rc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> The book of 2 Corinthians is unique in that it has a very long introduction. This Epistle contains thirteen chapters, and the first one and a half chapters are the introduction. No other book in the Bible has such a long introduction. </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpQGwOI1_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> The introduction to 2 Corinthians is long because the background of this book is quite complicated. In 1 Corinthians Paul dealt with the Corinthian believers regarding many things. He argued with them and rebuked them. Because of this background, it was necessary for 2 Corinthians to have a lengthy introduction. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbGnHQfsf5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> This introduction is actually a word of comfort. Paul realized that, because he had disciplined the Corinthians in the first Epistle, he needed to bind up their wounds in this Epistle. The first one and a half chapters of 2 Corinthians are related to this binding up of wounds. What Paul was doing here is similar to the comfort a parent may give to a child after the child has been disciplined. Suppose a child misbehaves and is seriously disciplined by his parents. After the child repents, the parents will spend time to comfort the child. In the first chapter and a half of 2 Corinthians, Paul pours oil into the wounds of the Corinthians, wounds caused by his discipline. </p>
<p data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfgTPgJXSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu"> Another reason for this lengthy introduction is that Paul was a very emotional person. He was a person strong in his emotion in a proper way. Although he was restricted by the Spirit when he was rebuking the Corinthian believers, he was still strong. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83835" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span> he asks, “What <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?” These words indicate that he was strong in his emotion. When Paul was pouring oil into the wounds and binding them up, he exercised his emotion and released it in a very positive way. Thus, he needed a longer time to express his emotion. </p>
<p data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weYED08p_AY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83836" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:3">Verse 3</span> reveals Paul’s emotion: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement.” Paul’s reference to affliction, suffering, and encouragement in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83837" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> also indicates that he was emotional. It seems to me that Paul could have condensed these three verses into one sentence and said, “Dear Corinthian brothers, since I have been encouraged by God, I would now encourage you.” But because Paul was very emotional, he wrote in a way that seems repetitious. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83838" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:6">verses 6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83839" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:7">7</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83840" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:8">8</span> he continues to speak of suffering, affliction, and encouragement. Because Paul was emotional, he needed the opportunity to release his emotion positively. </p>
<p data-content-id="3x4y4bH-jSB8_0__dQRX-nn-7_QC7aefq9LMx3tkiw83hJtljo8fD-KpeOzqVxFkY"> Another reason for this long introduction is that the Corinthians were very complicated. On the one hand, they liked Paul; on the other hand, they were somewhat unhappy with him. He used this long introduction to resolve their complications and calm them down so that they could receive his word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GBLvlFuZpxpOzPlHECwzEvBrtGtiuqGT34VDcvZLsVtjWxkMb27nu2FPxyYbaMXgd">I. THE WRITERS AND THE RECEIVERS</h2><p data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ3dDM-qkH014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB"> In this long introduction we can see Paul’s person. I very much love Paul. He can be emotional, sympathetic, and tender. He can also be strong and even tough. He is honest, simple, and sincere. Sometimes he may be polite, but he is never political. I have learned a great deal from Paul. Throughout my life I have learned the most from two persons: the first is Paul; the second is Watchman Nee. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_oNtNa3ZHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83841" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:1">Verse 1</span> says, “Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia.” Achaia was located south of Macedonia. A <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> province of the Roman Empire, it formed the major part of today’s Greece. The city of Corinth was in this province. The writers of 2 Corinthians were Paul and Timothy; the receivers were the church of God in Corinth with all the saints in the whole of Achaia. </p>

GREETING</h2><p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QXGHmEnVP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> Paul’s greeting is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83842" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:2">verse 2</span>: “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” This greeting is commonly used by Paul in his Epistles. </p>

<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfwGL-T7ZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83843" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:3-4">verses 3 and 4</span> Paul says, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement; Who encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God.” The Greek word rendered compassions also means mercies, pity, sympathy. Encouragement is slightly different from comfort and consolation and has the sense of being cheered. Such a title as the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement is ascribed here to God because this Epistle is one of comfort and encouragement, written by the apostle after he was comforted and encouraged by the repentance of the Corinthian believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0Pc2yDQRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83844" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:4">verse 4</span> Paul says that we encourage those in affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God. First we must experience the encouragement of God. Then we shall be able to encourage others with the encouragement we have experienced of God. Hence, we are encouraged so that we may be able to encourage others. This requires experience. When we are experienced, we have the spiritual capital necessary for encouraging others. </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpQGwPcZ_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> If you have never suffered and have never been encouraged by God, you will not be able to encourage others. Your words of encouragement will be empty. You will be like someone writing a check for a large amount of money without having the funds <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> in the bank to back up such a check. You do not have the reality, the experience, the spiritual capital. First we ourselves must suffer for the Lord’s interests and then be comforted and encouraged by God. Then this experience will become the spiritual capital to encourage others. In this way, we are encouraged and then we encourage others. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbGnHQdI_5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> The first Epistle to the Corinthians was the apostle’s argument, an argument which defeated and subdued the Corinthians, who had been distracted and confused. Now the second Epistle brings them back into the experience of Christ, who was the subject of his argument in the first Epistle. Hence, the second Epistle is more experiential, more subjective, and deeper than the first. In the first, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, the church, and the gifts are covered as the major subjects. In the second, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, and the church are further developed, but the gifts are not even mentioned. They are replaced in this book by the ministry, which is constituted of, and produced and formed by, the experiences of the riches of Christ through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross. The second Epistle gives us a pattern, an example, of how the killing of the cross works, how Christ is wrought into our being, and how we become the expression of Christ. These constitute the ministers of Christ and produce the ministry for God’s new covenant. The first Epistle deals negatively with the gifts; the second speaks positively about the ministry. The church needs the ministry much more than the gifts. The ministry is to minister Christ whom we have experienced; the gifts are just to teach the doctrines concerning Christ. The proof that the apostles are ministers of Christ does not consist in the gifts, but in the ministry produced and formed by the experience of the sufferings of Christ, His afflictions. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfgTPi9zSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu">B. In Affliction Pressed Down<br/>unto the Despairing of Life</h2><p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2YKOl8u5Rw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83845" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:5">verse 5</span> Paul says, “Because even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> encouragement also abounds.” Here the sufferings are not sufferings for Christ, but Christ’s own sufferings as shared by His disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83846" data-verses="Matthew 20:22">Matt. 20:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83847" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83848" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">Col. 1:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83849" data-verses="1Peter 4:13">1 Pet. 4:13</span>). “The Christ” is a designation of the condition of Christ, not a name (Darby). Here it refers to the suffering Christ, who suffered afflictions for His Body according to God’s will. The apostles participated in the sufferings of such a Christ, and through such a Christ they received encouragement. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83850" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:6-7">verses 6 and 7</span>, their affliction and encouragement were all for the encouraging of the believers. </p>

<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNwooknvQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> In this message we shall consider just three verses, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83860" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12-14">1:12-14</span>. In these verses there is something very deep, not in doctrine but in experience. If we have not had the experience described here, we shall not be able to understand what Paul is talking about in these verses. Apparently Paul’s word here is simple and easy to understand; actually Paul is referring to something deep and profound. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAdKqsPZEy_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1">IV. THE APOSTLES’ BOASTING OF THEIR CONDUCT<br/>IN THE GRACE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKRYrUEqAr7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83861" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">verse 12</span> Paul says, “For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.” Here Paul says that their boasting was the testimony of their conscience regarding the way they lived and behaved themselves. We need insight to understand what Paul means. </p>
<p data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MMI7iosCoCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj"> The Greek word rendered singleness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83862" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">verse 12</span> can also be translated simplicity. Instead of singleness or simplicity, some manuscripts read holiness. The deep thought and rich experience found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83863" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">verse 12</span> are mainly related to the Greek word that means singleness, sincerity. In the New Testament this word is used at least five times. Different translations adopt different renderings: singleness, simplicity, liberality, generosity, bounty. Without adequate experience, it would be difficult to decide which word to use in the translation here. <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceSGis6ogfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83864" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">Verse 12</span> opens with the word “for,” indicating that this verse is to be an explanation of the preceding verses. Thus, in order to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83865" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">verse 12</span>, we need to keep in mind what Paul has said in the foregoing verses. Paul has just pointed out to the Corinthian believers that he and his co-workers were in a death situation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83866" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:10">verse 10</span> he testified that God had delivered them “out of so great a death.” Every difficulty, problem, or hard situation can be changed by human power, strength, wisdom, or methods. The only exception is death. No human being has a way to handle a situation of death. Wealthy people can solve problems by writing a check for a large amount of money. There is a proverb which says, “Money goes everywhere.” This means that money can solve every problem. But not even the wealthiest person can handle a death situation. When death comes to a millionaire, no amount of money can enable him to avoid it. Before writing this Epistle, Paul was in a death situation. Humanly speaking, there was no way out of that situation. But for the apostle, and for those who believe in resurrection, there is a way out. The God of resurrection is the way. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TMSwbCxQZ3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4"> The situation in which Paul found himself in Asia forced him to be single or simple in the way he dealt with it. Those who are rich, strong, or knowledgeable are not single in the way they deal with difficult situations. On the contrary, they apply their knowledge, their wisdom. If a certain method does not work, they turn to another method. Their mind is very complicated; they are far from being simple. Because they are knowledgeable and capable, they have many ways to deal with situations. A person who has many ways to deal with situations surely is not simple. </p>
<p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwF-TQgneqezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> According to the preceding verses, Paul and his co-workers were in a situation that restricted them to such an extent that no human way was of any help. Only one way was available to them: the God of resurrection. They were not just in difficulty or afflictions, and they did not just have problems. They were in death. No matter how knowledgeable, capable, or wealthy we may be, there is nothing we can do about a death situation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> For Paul and his co-workers, the only way of escape was the God of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="uKAggo26VcYIYatm2wE1X7mlIjGB46_tKYIyAUPpKUS9ib9fxDxuiAAHQDKQU_Qdp"> A dead person is always simple. A living person, however, is not simple. On the contrary, he always has a way to face a situation. We human beings are not simple. We all have many different ways. But blessed are they who are simple. What kind of person can be simple? Only a dead person. When Paul and his co-workers were suffering affliction in Asia, they were pressed to such an extent that they regarded themselves as dead. They had no way to deal with their situation. Their confidence was not in themselves; it was only in the God who raises the dead. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVzpzf4Z2Dyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM">A. The Testimony of Their Conscience</h2><p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3esth1CsiBS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83867" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">verse 12</span> Paul refers to the testimony of the conscience. We must have a pure conscience (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83868" data-verses="2Timothy 1:3">2 Tim. 1:3</span>), a conscience without offense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83869" data-verses="Acts 24:16">Acts 24:16</span>), to bear a testimony to what we are and do. Paul’s conscience testified that he was sincere, faithful, and honest. In particular, he had the testimony of his conscience that he was single. He did not use any human way to deal with situations. He did not exercise his knowledge, ability, strength, or wisdom. He did not use any policy, and he did not play politics. Rather, he was single, simple. His conscience bore testimony concerning this. This testimony was his boast. Thus, Paul could say, “We live, behave, act, and work only in God, not in any way that is of ourselves. Our unique way is the God of resurrection. The God who raises the dead is our only way. Therefore, we did not play politics, and we did not exercise our wisdom. We were absolutely simple, as simple as those who are dead. Our confidence is in nothing other than the living Person who is the God of resurrection. This is our boast, and this is the testimony borne by our conscience.” </p>

<p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcV-f6nRZrUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> Why did Paul speak to the Corinthians about singleness? It was because the Corinthians were very complicated. They had <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> many different ways. This was the reason some preferred Apollos, and others preferred Cephas or Paul. Actually, 1 Corinthians is a book which deals with the complications of the believers at Corinth. </p>
<p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQtOAVt9arzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> The source of confusion and division among Christians today is the complications that are within the believers. If all Christians became simple, there would be no problems among them. The problems in a local church always come from complications. If there is a problem in your locality, that problem comes from someone who is not simple, but who is complicated. For this reason, I always try to avoid being involved with a complicated person. Whenever you meet a complicated person, you should not try to argue with him or correct him. Any attempts at argument or correction will cause you to become trapped in complications. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QPEsgez1ADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83870" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">verse 12</span> Paul speaks of the singleness and sincerity of God. The sincerity of God is a divine virtue, a virtue of what God is. To conduct ourselves in such a virtue means to experience God Himself. Hence, it equals “in the grace of God” also mentioned in this verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0GncVR2YkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> God is wise and almighty. But in a sense He is also single; He is very simple. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was wise; yet He was also simple and single. I very much enjoy having contact with the Lord Jesus because of His singleness and simplicity. However, when you talk to certain brothers, you find that they are extremely complicated. But our God is simple. Whenever we talk to Him, we find that He is not full of complications. When He says yes, He means yes, and when He says no, He means no. Likewise, when He says white or black, He means white or black, not gray. No matter how God may feel about us at a particular time, He is always single. He may be unhappy with us or He may be happy, but He Himself is simple. </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0ziGcjM4B_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> From experience we have learned that a person who is simple and single is also generous and full of liberality. Those who are simple are those who give freely. For example, suppose a brother approaches a person so single and tells him that he is short of money to pay his rent. <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> Immediately the one who is simple will be willing to give that brother whatever he needs. This illustrates the fact that to be simple is to be generous. But those who are complicated are not generous. Instead of being willing to give freely, they may consider the matter in a complicated way and then give an amount that falls short of the need. Paul was single, simple, and generous. </p>

We have pointed out that Paul wrote such a long introduction in order to calm down the Corinthian believers and to soothe them. The complicated Corinthians talked about Paul and even criticized him. Some may have said, “Paul told us that he would come to Corinth, but he has not yet come. Paul seems to be changeable; he says yes one day and no the next day. Thus, Paul is not faithful or trustworthy. Let him say whatever he wants. He always changes his word.” Because this was the situation with at least some of the Corinthians, Paul included <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83877" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:15-22">1:15-22</span> in his word of introduction. </p>

CONCERNING THE APOSTLE’S COMING</h2><p data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwknFn9nkujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83878" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:15">Verse 15</span> says, “And in this confidence I intended to come to you previously that you might have a second grace.” By “this confidence” Paul is referring to what he has just said in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83879" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12-14">verses 12 through 14</span>: the testimony of his conscience that he and his co-workers conducted themselves in the singleness and sincerity of God, not in human wisdom, but in the grace of God. It was in this confidence Paul intended to come to the Corinthians. His intention and decision to visit Corinth were not political or changeable. Paul and his co-workers did not live in such a way. On the contrary, they lived in the singleness and sincerity of God. Their yes was yes, and their no was no. They did not say yes at one time and no at another. <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42RKVk1q-WYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83880" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:15">verse 15</span> Paul speaks of the Corinthians having a second grace. This is a double grace by the apostle’s coming to Corinth twice, once referred to in this verse, and again, referred to in the next verse. Through the apostle’s coming, the grace of God, that is, the imparting of God as the life supply and spiritual enjoyment, is bestowed upon the believers. His two comings would bring them a double portion of such grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEtGsReYtVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83881" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:16">Verse 16</span> says, “And through you to pass through into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be sent forward to Judea.” Macedonia was a province of the Roman Empire, north of Achaia, in which were the cities of Philippi and Thessalonica. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfwOL-TbZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83882" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:17">verse 17</span> Paul asks, “This therefore intending, did I then use fickleness? Or the things which I resolve, do I resolve according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes, yes and no, no?” Fickleness here means changeableness, turning from one thing to another. Here Paul indicates that he did not use fickleness; he did not change from yes to no and from no to yes. Furthermore, he did not resolve according to the flesh. To resolve is stronger than to decide. Paul was not two-faced. He did not say yes and no at the same time, for he did not resolve anything according to the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0PU2yzYRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83883" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:18">verse 18</span> Paul declares, “But God is faithful, that our word toward you is not yes and no.” “But” gives a contrast. In the preceding verse the apostle refers to the charge that he is a man of yes and no. In this verse he defends himself by saying that God is faithful, so that the word of their preaching is not yes and no. Hence, neither are they fickle persons of yes and no. Their being is according to their preaching. They lived according to what they preached. The word of the apostles’ preaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83884" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:18">1 Cor. 1:18</span>) in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83885" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:18">verse 18</span>, their word toward the Corinthians, was their message concerning Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83886" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:19">v. 19</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpQOwPsR_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83887" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:18">verse 18</span> Paul indicates that he was one with God. Paul did not use fickleness; he did not say yes and then no. Rather, he was the same as God in being faithful. His word toward the Corinthians, the word of his ministry, was not <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> yes and no. Paul did not change his tune. From the first time he came to the Corinthians until the writing of this Epistle, his preaching sounded the same note. There was no change at all in the word of the ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbGnPQd4n5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83888" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:19">verse 19</span> Paul continues, “For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, Who was preached among you through us, through me and Sylvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes.” “For” indicates that what follows is an explanation of what is mentioned in the preceding verse. God is faithful, never changing, especially in His promises concerning Christ, so that the word the apostles preached concerning Christ is likewise never changing, because the very Christ whom God promised in His faithful word and whom they preached in their gospel did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes. Since the Christ whom they preached according to God’s promises did not become yes and no, the word they preached concerning Him was not yes and no. Not only their preaching but also their living was according to what Christ is. They preached Christ and lived Him. They were not men of yes and no, but men who were the same as Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfgbPiNrSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83889" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:20">verse 20</span> Paul says, “For whatever promises of God there are, in Him is the Yes; wherefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us.” “For” again gives the reason for what is mentioned in the preceding verse. Christ, whom the faithful God promised and whom the sincere apostles preached, did not become yes and no, did not change, because in Him is the Yes of all the promises of God, and through Him is the apostles’ and believers’ Amen to God for His glory. Christ is the Yes, the incarnate answer, the fulfillment of all the promises of God to us. The Amen here is the Amen given by us through Christ to God (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83890" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:16">1 Cor. 14:16</span>). Christ is the Yes, and we say Amen to this Yes before God. The phrase “for glory” means for the glory of God. When we say Amen before God to the fact that Christ is the Yes, the fulfillment, of all the promises of God, this is a glory to God through us. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2YKGl8exRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> The “us” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83891" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:20">verse 20</span> refers not only to the apostles, who preached Christ according to God’s promises, but also to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> believers, who received Christ according to the apostles’ preaching. Through both there is glory for God when they say Amen to Christ as the great Yes of all God’s promises. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wqgqUisjfcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> It is not a matter of great importance to decide to go to a certain place. This certainly cannot compare with a major decision like the decision to get married. Nevertheless, the Corinthians criticized Paul over such a small matter. Some of them probably said, “Paul said that he would come to Corinth, but he hasn’t come. This proves that he is a man of yes and no.” Paul defended himself against this accusation. Thus, even in this Epistle of encouragement, there is an aspect of argument and vindication. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv3XY13P6T6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB">A.

When I resolved to come to Corinth, I did not resolve by myself or in myself; I resolved with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God.” In his vindication Paul speaks of God and of Christ, indicating to the complicated Corinthians that he was absolutely one with God and with Christ. God is faithful, and Paul also was faithful. Christ, the Son of God, is unchanging, and Paul, a person who was one with this Christ, was also unchanging. He resolved not according to human wisdom, but in oneness with the faithful God and the unchanging Christ. In these verses we have a strong indication that Paul was living absolutely in Christ and in God. He was one with God and with Christ. </p>

The apostle would not come to visit the Corinthian believers with a rod for discipline, but would come in love and a spirit of meekness for building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83912" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:21">1 Cor. 4:21</span>). In order to avoid any unpleasant feeling, he refrained from coming. He treated them leniently and would not come to them in sorrow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83913" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:1">2 Cor. 2:1</span>). He did not like to lord it over their faith, but longed to be a fellow-worker of their joy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83914" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:24">1:24</span>). This is the truth. He calls on God to witness this for him. </p>

Calling on God as a Witness against His Soul</h2><p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQtOYVt96rzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83915" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:23">verse 23</span>, Paul called upon God against his soul. The apostle called on God to be a witness against his soul, that is, against himself, if he was speaking falsely. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QPE0geD9ADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> To call on God is not only to pray to God or ask Him to do something for us. To say, “O God,” or, “O Father,” is not just to pray; it is to call upon God. Many Christians today do not have a calling spirit, a strong spirit in which to call upon God. If the circumstances or situation allowed it, I would <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> like to call, “O my Father,” or, “O Lord Jesus,” continually. There is a difference between calling and praying. For example, someone may pray like this: “Father God, You are faithful. You never change. Help me to be faithful and unchanging also. I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.” Although this is a good prayer, it may not be very living. We may also pray to the Lord Jesus in a manner that is not so living. We may say, “Lord Jesus, I thank You that You love me. Lord, I also love You. But, Lord, You know that I am weak. Lord, please help me in my weakness.” Many Christians pray like this, but they may pray with little heart and with no exercise of the spirit. They may not even understand what it means to exercise the spirit in prayer. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83916" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> the Lord Jesus said, “God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.” Worshipping God includes praying to Him. Since to pray is to worship, and since the Lord Jesus says that our worship of God must be in spirit, then our prayer must be in spirit also. The words we use to express ourselves in prayer are secondary. The primary matter is that we exercise our spirit to contact God. When we pray, we need to call on God, exercise our spirit, and say, “O Father, O my God, my Father.” This is to call upon God. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0GnEVRGQkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> God the Father is happy to hear us calling on Him. According to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83917" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span>, the Father today is seeking those who worship Him in spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0ziGEjMIZ_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> I do not know of a better way to exercise the spirit than to call upon God. It is not necessary to call aloud. Often it is not convenient or suitable to call aloud. For example, others may be working or sleeping, and your calling in a loud way would disturb them. Even by calling in a very quiet way, our spirit is exercised. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2sSlSi-xzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> Paul wrote all his Epistles in a careful manner and with much consideration regarding the use of words. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83918" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:23">1:23</span> he did not say, “I ask God”; neither did he say, “I pray to God.” Instead, Paul said, “I call on God.” This calling upon God implies the exercise of the spirit. Paul was a person who lived in spirit and who worshipped God in spirit. If we do not live <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> in spirit, it certainly will be difficult for us to worship God in spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8CnTid3ZNYKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83919" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:23">verse 23</span> Paul called upon God as a witness against his soul. This means that he called upon God to witness for him in a negative way. Here Paul seems to be saying, “Brothers in Corinth, I did not behave in the soul. If I had done this, God would witness against me. I am not a person living in the soul and behaving in the soul. I did not resolve in the soul to come to you. If this had been my situation, God would be a witness against me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVukGW8mf2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK"> It is interesting that Paul did not say, “I call on God as a witness for my spirit to testify that I resolve in my spirit to come to you.” On the contrary, he called on God to witness in a negative way against his soul. He called upon Him to testify that he did not resolve anything in the soul, that is, in the self. God would witness against such a resolving in the soul. This kind of negative witness is sometimes stronger than a testimony from the positive side. </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIcVDYCmxgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> The reason Paul did not come to Corinth was that he wanted to spare the Corinthians. It was not because he was fickle and was saying yes and no at the same time. Paul did not want to come to Corinth with a rod to discipline them; rather, he wanted to spare them and come to them in love. He called upon God to witness of this concerning him. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVeCqDmQ-zDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> Paul is a good example for us to follow. By the Lord’s mercy, we all need to learn of him and follow him. Paul was a wonderful person. He was spiritual, he was constituted of Christ, he was experienced, and he was mature in the riches of Christ. As such a person, he wanted to spare the Corinthians and for this reason had not yet come to Corinth. </p>

To lord it over their <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> subjective faith weakens it, but to be a fellow-worker of their joy strengthens it. </p>

Is this not a matter in the soul? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83923" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:1">2:1</span> Paul’s self is a spiritual self, a spiritual soul, a soul under the control and direction of the spirit. In a human way, Paul determined in himself not to come again to the Corinthians in sorrow. This determination was not inspired by the Spirit; it was a human matter determined by Paul in himself. We need to remember, however, that this was determined by one who was under the control and direction of the spirit. This is another example of the principle of incarnation. This principle is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83924" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>. The principle of incarnation always operates in this way. The Lord Jesus, as a man, performed miracles, but it was God who did these miracles and not the Lord Jesus Himself. This is what we mean by the principle of incarnation. </p>

<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8CnTmd2t9YKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> After the introduction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83941" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:1">1:1—2:11</span>), Paul comes to the ministry of the new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83942" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:12">2:12—3:11</span>). The ministry is absolutely different from the outward, miraculous gifts. In 1940, while giving messages on 2 Corinthians, Brother Nee strongly emphasized the difference between 1 and 2 Corinthians. He pointed out that the first book deals with the outward, miraculous gifts, especially tongue-speaking. Brother Nee used the illustration of Balaam’s donkey speaking a human language, pointing out that that was a genuine miraculous gift. It certainly was a miracle for a donkey suddenly to receive the ability to speak a human language. Brother Nee went on to say that a gift can be received in a sudden way. However, he pointed out that it may take twenty years to produce a ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVukCW9Cr2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK"> In speaking concerning the ministry, Brother Nee said that Christ must be woven into our being. This means that Christ must be constituted into us. The ministry is a matter of constitution. We need to be constituted with what Christ is, with what He has done, with what He has attained, and with what He has obtained. Christ has obtained the throne, the glory, and the highest power. Christ also has certain attainments. His attainments are the result of what He has accomplished and achieved. Today what Christ is, what He has done, what He has obtained, and what He has attained are all in the life-giving Spirit. This means that the life-giving Spirit is the embodiment of Christ in these four matters. The all-inclusive Spirit is the embodiment of what <span class="pg" data-page-id="36" id="36">[36]</span> Christ is, of what Christ has done, of what Christ has obtained, and of what Christ has attained. This all-inclusive Spirit is an all-inclusive drink, a drink that has many ingredients. </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIcVHYAy5gkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> As we have pointed out a number of times, the all-inclusive Spirit is typified by the ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83943" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. This ointment is composed of oil compounded with four different kinds of spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. This ointment portrays the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is now being constituted into us. The result is a constitution of the processed God with redeemed human beings. A believer who is so constituted with this all-inclusive Spirit will become a minister of Christ, and his work and service will be the ministry in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVeCuDkUyzDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> The ministry in the New Testament is unique. The New Testament has just one ministry. Both Paul and Peter had a part of this ministry. All the apostles shared in the one ministry in the New Testament. This unique ministry is the ministry of the new covenant. Such a ministry is not gained by prayer and fasting. Anything received in that way would be a gift, not a ministry. The ministry is brought forth as a result of being constituted of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. Christ, with all that He is, has, and has obtained and attained, must be constituted into the fiber, into the very being, of God’s chosen and redeemed people. This is the only way to have a ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv3XA13PaT6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> My burden is not simply to preach the gospel or teach the Bible. My burden is to carry out this New Testament ministry and to help those who sincerely seek the Lord and care for the desire of His heart to have a share in this ministry. This is the ministry Paul talks about in 2 Corinthians, especially in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83944" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>, where the word ministry is used a number of times. Paul compared this ministry to that of the old covenant. The ministry of the new covenant is far superior to that of the old covenant. The new covenant ministry is not only a matter of life; it is a constitution in life and of life. Therefore, this ministry takes time to grow and mature. <span class="pg" data-page-id="37" id="37">[37]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8Xq_LVStxV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> In 1943 I contracted tuberculosis and came very close to death. I thank the Lord that, for Himself and for His ministry, He spared me and has kept me. Brother Nee used to tell us that because it takes years for the Lord to gain one who has been constituted of Himself, we need to take care of our health in a proper way. This means that we should do everything possible to prevent an early death. If we are truly spiritual, we shall learn how to take care of our health in order to have a long life. </p>
<p data-content-id="123M5cSNMEj-7uz-rGkoC46zlbHtHXa8O4c0RsOV1iusSytY9NpKTJ_yPM6vOLmNG"> It takes more than a few years to grow and be constituted of the Triune God. As one who has passed through many things over the years, I can testify that a person needs to be at least sixty years of age before this constitution reaches maturity. However, for this to take place in a person by the age of sixty, he should be saved before the age of twenty. One who is saved in his forties probably cannot be matured in the divine constitution by the age of sixty. During the first twenty years of our Christian life, we need to learn certain matters. Then we need another twenty years to be constituted of the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="9y_RCEn53QXJX8AG7BzDo03GiIrcVdFzVLB9VZjyh8fFM7yeaCSVDU7M5P31_v8wC"> When the young people hear this word about how long it takes to be constituted into a minister of the new covenant, they may be disappointed. Young people, I encourage you not to be discouraged by the fact that it may take twenty years to learn things and another twenty years to be constituted. We are dealing with the highest life, the divine life, constituted into our human life. Surely this requires time. Even in the natural human life, a man is not adequately matured by the age of forty. I certainly would not have confidence in a president who is only forty years old. In everything we do, we need experience. This is true even in driving a car. The more years we drive a car, the more experienced we become, and the more skillful. I do not believe that a person under sixty years of age is mature enough to be fully adequate as a president or head of state. This is an illustration of the fact that life needs time to grow. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNw0olTXQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> There is the need of more among us who are matured. I hope that in the years to come there will be a number of <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> fathers in the Lord’s recovery. It is a blessing to have such fathers, such matured ones, among us. Their very presence among us is a great blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAdK2sO94y_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> I say again, the ministry cannot be formed in a short time. I am happy that I heard such a word concerning the ministry from Brother Nee in 1940. Approximately twenty years later, the Lord sent me to this country. </p>
<p data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKRY3UG-wr7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc"> Now we are ready to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83945" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:12-17">2:12-17</span>, some verses which are the introduction to the section on the ministry of the new covenant. Chapter <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83946" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:1">1:1—2:11</span> is the introduction to the entire book of 2 Corinthians. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83947" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:12-17">2:12-17</span> is the introduction to the section on the ministry. Following this section, we have a long section concerning the ministers of the new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83948" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:12">3:12—7:16</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MMIniqo2oCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj">I. ITS TRIUMPH AND EFFECT</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9ihkb0gkGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ">A. Caring for the Church<br/>More Than for the Gospel </h2>
<p data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8b1Fek8o6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr"> Paul introduces the ministry in a very personal, intimate way, in a way that is not at all doctrinal. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83949" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:12">2:12</span> Paul does not say, “I have finished my introduction. Now I want to give you some doctrine concerning our ministry.” On the contrary, Paul says, “Furthermore, when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, a door also being opened to me in the Lord, I had no relief in my spirit when I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83950" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:12-13">2:12-13</span>). In addition to what he has mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83951" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:10-11">verses 10 and 11</span>, the apostle furthermore tells the Corinthian believers of his concern for them. Although a door was opened to him in Troas, even in the Lord, not of human effort, he had no relief in his spirit when he did not find Titus there. He was anxious to meet Titus to receive information concerning the effect of his first Epistle among them. Therefore, he left Troas and went forth to Macedonia (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83952" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:13">v. 13</span>), being anxious to meet Titus for the information because of his great affection for them. His concern for the church was much more than that for the preaching of the gospel. <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSxHPWPwTP6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk"> In the foregoing message we covered the triumph and effect of the ministry of the new covenant. This ministry is a triumphal procession. Wherever this ministry goes, it shows forth the triumph of Christ becoming the victory of the ministry. Wherever Paul and his co-workers went, that was the triumphal procession celebrating Christ’s victory. Such a celebration always brought in the victory of Christ. Thus, there was the triumph of the ministry. The triumph of the ministry is the celebration of Christ’s victory by the conquered captives in the train of this procession. All of those in this procession have been conquered, subdued, and captured. Today we also have been captured and subdued by Christ. We need to have this realization in faith. Since we are in the procession, we have been captured and subdued, whether or not we feel this is our situation. If we had not been captured and subdued, we could not be in the procession. Praise the Lord that we are all in Christ’s triumphal procession! </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDH4PlolVyIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> Paul’s concept was that the preaching ministry was a triumphal procession celebrating Christ’s victory. Today we ourselves are an example of Christ’s victory over us. Because we have been conquered, subdued, and captured by Christ, we are now in His procession preaching Him. The fact that we are in this procession preaching Christ is a testimony that we have been conquered by Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCOSfvkPwbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83967" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> Paul says that he counted everything as refuse for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83968" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:14">2:14</span> he speaks of the savor of the knowledge of Christ. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> excellent knowledge of Christ was a fragrance, an aroma. This means that we who have been conquered and captured and brought into the triumphal procession to celebrate Christ’s victory speak to others the excellent knowledge of Christ. Whatever we speak, that is the excellent knowledge of Christ. We know Christ by our experience of Him and enjoyment of Him. As we march in the triumphal procession, we speak to others about Christ. What we say concerning Him is a sweet smelling savor. The manifestation of the savor of the knowledge of Christ has a twofold effect, a twofold result: either it results in life unto life, or it results in death unto death. This is the triumph and effect of the ministry, which is the constitution of Christ within us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4hMyExre1zbM0fe_x-GmaBEs6q87iO-T9fB9bnZhqy5h3nbIoZkpmSlQGlIoMTxNS">II. ITS FUNCTION AND COMPETENCY</h2><p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIcVLYCmRgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> In this message we come to the function and competency of the ministry of the new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83969" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>). After giving us a picture of the ministry’s triumph and effect, Paul shows the function of this ministry and also its competency. What kind of work does this ministry do? What is its function? Furthermore, who can bear such a responsibility, a responsibility of life and death? Because the ministry results either in life unto life or death unto death, Paul exclaimed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83970" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:16">2:16</span>, “Who is sufficient for these things?” Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83971" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1-6">3:1-6</span> he gives us a picture showing the function and sufficiency of this ministry. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVeCiDmQezDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC">A.

Or do we need, as some, letters of commendation to you or from you?” These questions are raised because of the apostle’s frank and faithful word in the preceding verse concerning himself and his co-workers. From what Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians and also in this Epistle, the Corinthians may have thought that Paul and his co-workers were commending themselves. Therefore, Paul asks the two questions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83973" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">3:1</span>. The answer to both questions is a definite no. <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> They were not commending themselves, and they did not need letters of commendation. </p>
<p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkh0fXilXkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83974" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:2">Verse 2</span> says, “You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men.” The believers were the fruit of the apostles’ labor, commending the apostles and their ministry to others. Thus, they became the apostles’ living letters of commendation, written by the apostles with the indwelling Christ as the content in every part of their inner being. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18cWoQopE-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> Paul says that the Corinthians were a letter “inscribed in our hearts.” The Corinthian believers, as the apostles’ living letter of commendation were inscribed in the apostles’ hearts. Thus, they were carried by the apostles and could not possibly be severed from them. They were in the apostles’ hearts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="83975" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:3">7:3</span>), brought by them everywhere as their living commendation. </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i-zwq5FyF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83976" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">Verse 3</span> is the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83977" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:2">verse 2</span>: “Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.” A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey and express Christ. All believers in Christ should be such a living letter of Christ that others may read and know Christ in their being. These letters are written by the ministry of the apostles. The apostles are filled with Christ so that their ministry spontaneously ministers Christ to those they contact, inscribing Christ in their heart and making them living letters conveying Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="dChzg2DUKpIBDLedcWn1ydFKoiHfeFV0KBAaJsET5ldzIRhtliB64uqos5WWmePIs"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83978" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:2">verse 2</span> Paul speaks of “our letter.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83979" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">verse 3</span> he tells the Corinthians, “You are a letter of Christ.” It seems that here there are two kinds of letter—the letter inscribed in the hearts of the apostles, and the believers as the letter of Christ. Actually, there are not two kinds of letters. Grammatically speaking, in these verses Paul is saying, “You are our letter because you are a letter of Christ.” “Being manifested” means something that is evident. It was evident that the Corinthians, as the apostles’ letter, were a letter of Christ. But which comes first, a letter of Christ, or “our letter”? The letter of Christ must come first. It is because the believers are a letter <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> of Christ that they are also the letter inscribed in the heart of the apostles. They are the apostles’ letter because they are first a letter of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ql5Pg2ZNuykXsyEjASMH8B5GtMoTjCdfD3r9djGvnWm2lFgAKpLfM_KLzMYyqkpuP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83980" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:2">Verse 2</span> says, “inscribed in our hearts,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83981" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">verse 3</span> says, “in fleshy tablets of the heart.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83982" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:2">Verse 2</span> speaks of the apostles’ hearts, whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83983" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">verse 3</span>, the hearts of the believers at Corinth. The one kind of letter is inscribed both in the hearts of the apostles and in the hearts of the believers. For years I have been puzzled by this matter and have been seeking to understand it. Where is this letter inscribed, in the hearts of the apostles, or in the hearts of the believers? If we can answer this question, we shall grasp the main point of this message. </p>
<p data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSxHPWOEbP6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk"> We need to see that the same letter is inscribed in the hearts of two categories of people: in the hearts of the apostles and in the hearts of the believers. What does this mean? This certainly presents a problem in our understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83984" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>. However, recognizing a problem is a sign that we are proper students of the Bible. If we cannot find any problems as we read the Word, then we are not reading it in a proper way. Now that we have found the problem here—one letter inscribed in the hearts of the apostles and the believers—we must find out how to explain it. </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDH4PlpBZyIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> It is not the function of the new covenant ministry to do a work; its function is to write letters. This is, of course, a figure of speech. Often in his deeper teachings Paul uses metaphors. When he comes to a deeper truth, he may use a metaphor. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83985" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:14">2:14</span> there are two metaphors: the first is that of the captives in the triumphal procession celebrating Christ’s victory; the second is that of the incense-bearers scattering the excellency of the knowledge of Christ as a fragrance resulting in either death or life. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83986" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul uses another metaphor, that of writing letters. </p>
<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCOSfvmrYbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="83987" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">verse 3</span>, the letter of Christ is “inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.” The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, like a pen for writing, but the very element, like the ink, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> for the writing of living letters that convey Christ. The writer of this letter is not the Spirit of God; the writer is the apostles. The Spirit of the living God is the “ink,” the element, the essence, of the writing. This means that the Spirit of the living God is the element with which the letter is written. This is a very crucial matter. </p>

As we shall see, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84001" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7-11">verses 7 through 11</span> show the inferiority of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, the ministry of law, a ministry of condemnation and death, and the superiority of the apostolic ministry, the ministry of grace, a ministry of righteousness and the Spirit. The former was through glory temporarily; the latter remains in glory forever. </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnG062es-dTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> After speaking of the triumph and effect of the ministry of the new covenant, Paul goes on to speak of the function and competency of that ministry. The function is to inscribe living letters of Christ, and the competency, the qualification, is God Himself. The writer of these living letters is actually not Paul; the writer is the very God who has been constituted into Paul’s being. Therefore, God is not only the writer; He is also the “ink,” the substance or element, of what is written. This means that God is writing Himself into His chosen people. The result of this writing is a constitution of the Triune God into His people. Thus, the writer is God, the writing substance is God, and the issue, the result, is also God. </p>
<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEtG8RcMFVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> We may take writing with a ballpoint pen as an illustration of how God writes Himself into us. First a pen is filled with ink. Then it is used for writing certain words on paper. It is not the pen that actually does the writing; it is the ink, the substance which fills the pen, that does this. Nothing of the pen is put on paper. Rather, it is the substance of the ink <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> that is inscribed on the paper. Eventually, the writing on the paper is a composition, a constitution, of the ink. In the same principle, the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is both the writer and the writing substance. In the writing of living letters of Christ, the Spirit is the substance that is inscribed into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfweL8X3ZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> In this message we come to the glory of the new covenant ministry. The writing substance is inward, but the glory is outward. The writing element is hidden, but the glory is expressed. Actually, the glory is the shining out of the hidden substance. Once again, we may use electricity as an illustration. The element of electricity flows into a light bulb. This element is the substance of the light that shines from within the bulb. But the shining of the light is the glory of the electricity. Hence, with electricity there is both the essence, the element, and the shining out, the glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9ihsb0gEGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> Paul’s writing concerning the ministry of the new covenant is in a good sequence. First he shows that the new covenant ministry is triumphant and effective. This ministry is triumphant because Christ has triumphed and gained the victory. It is triumphant also because the apostles have been captured and have become submissive to Christ. All the early apostles were conquered, subdued, and captured by Christ and became very submissive to Him. Their preaching was a sign of their submission. Consider the example of Saul of Tarsus. How rebellious he was against the Lord Jesus, against the churches, against God’s administration, and against God’s New Testament economy! But even though he had been so rebellious, he was conquered, subdued, and captured. Then he became so submissive to Christ that he had no problems with God’s economy. On the contrary, wherever he went, he preached the New Testament economy of God. This preaching was a strong indication that he had become submissive to God’s government and administration. Paul, therefore, became a submissive captive of Christ. His submission was an expression of Christ’s victory. </p>
<p data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8b1Nek8I6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr"> Every captive in Christ’s triumphal procession is a proof of Christ’s victory. This procession celebrates the victory of <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> Christ. As the apostles were marching in this procession, they could say, “Jews and Gentiles, look at us and realize how triumphant Christ is.” This was Paul’s concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84002" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:14">2:14</span>. As he passed through Ephesus, Troas, and Macedonia, he was in Christ’s triumphal procession. Today, God is also leading us in a triumphal procession to celebrate Christ’s victory. We all are captives in this procession. Christ has conquered us, subdued us, and made us submissive to Him. Praise Him! </p>
<p data-content-id="wNe845Y8ijQ5dKg6d7KErQ-XLlzu45pbRdLEIe7Q12hM0LmqbZ_Oxp9c_fGFhtXWL"> The ministry of the new covenant is not only triumphant—it is also effective. It is so effective that to some it results in life unto life, and to others, in death unto death. Therefore, this ministry is a matter of life and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQqlRcKCaH1qNoR9pCwjeaEM_YJjhABbeu4yFqHM4jtib6znl17X3ZC_aTXbYtnrJ"> As we have emphasized, the function of the ministry of the new covenant is to write, even to inscribe, living letters of Christ. And the competence of this ministry is the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit. The glory of this ministry is its shining, its expression. </p>

The glory in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84004" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7">verse 7</span> is the glory that shone temporarily on Moses’ face (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84005" data-verses="Exodus 34:29">Exo. 34:29</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84006" data-verses="Exodus 34:35">35</span>). </p>

After talking about the triumph and effect of the ministry and also about the function and competency of the ministry, he in addition goes on to speak of the glory and superiority of the ministry. The ministry of the new covenant has glory, and this glory is much better than that of the old covenant ministry. <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> </p>

The glory here is the glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God Himself shining forever in the hearts of the apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84009" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:6">4:6</span>), surpassing the glory of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84010" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:10">v. 10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="pbBnT8P58uzq4V0jIiQ68lujBXFx65nhPRrIuWNLsZuuDDkZCUidRP80lkw5FcmBk"> Paul is very careful in his use of words. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84011" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7">verse 7</span> he says that the ministry of the old covenant <em>came</em> in glory, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84012" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8">verse 8</span> he indicates that the ministry of the Spirit <em>is</em> in glory. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84013" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7">verse 7</span> he says “came”; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84014" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8">verse 8</span> he says “be” in glory. Why does he change from came to be? If we had been writing this Epistle, we probably would have said that both the ministry of condemnation and the ministry of the Spirit came in glory. But there is a difference between came and be. To come is temporary and also may be somewhat superficial. However, to be is permanent and rather deep. The old glory came, but the new glory is and will continue to be. The old glory came for awhile and then disappeared. The new glory, however, is here and will remain. </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceSG2s6YofDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> As Paul was writing this Epistle, he knew that the glory of the old covenant ministry was temporary, but that the glory of the new covenant ministry would remain forever. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84015" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> Paul says that the “ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.” The apostolic ministry of the new covenant not only has glory, but also abounds in the glory of God. This glory surpasses the glory of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84016" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:10">v. 10</span>). </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84035" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:12">3:12—7:16</span> Paul comes to the ministers of the new covenant. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84036" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:12-18">3:12-18</span>, these ministers are constituted by and with the Lord as the life-giving and transforming Spirit.

<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDH43lpB5yIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> The lasting glory of the new covenant ministry is the basis of the apostles’ hope. In their ministry they have a hope. In the ministry of Moses, by comparison, there was no hope. Moses <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> put a veil on his face to conceal the shining. When we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84039" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exodus 34</span>, we may have a positive impression about this. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84040" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>, however, Paul does not interpret the veil in a positive sense, but in a negative sense. According to Paul’s interpretation, Moses put a veil on his face because he was afraid that the children of Israel would see the fading of the glory. Fading means termination. Thus, according to Paul’s understanding, Moses realized that the shining on his face would not last very long. In this sense, Moses did not have any hope. On the contrary, he had a fearful concern. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84041" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:12">verse 12</span> Paul says that the ministers of the new covenant have hope, for the shining glory of the new covenant ministry remains forever. </p>
<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCOSnvmbQbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> Having such a hope, the apostles used much boldness. If you read the book of Exodus carefully, you will see that Moses did not have as much boldness in giving the law as the apostles did in ministering Christ. The more they ministered, the more boldness they had. The longer they ministered, the more bold they became. Their boldness came from their confidence in the everlasting glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hMyExre1zbM0fe_x-GmaBEs6q87iO-T9fBFbldFqy5h3nbIoZkpmSlQGlIoMTxNS"> The principle is the same with us today. I can testify that the more I minister Christ, the more bold I become. Even though there is opposition to this ministry, I still have hope. Eventually the opposition will fade. We have the confidence that we are ministering the truth that carries the glory and that the glory in this truth will remain. Others may not believe what we are preaching. But in the next age, or in the New Jerusalem, they will believe it. </p>

After speaking, he veiled his face (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84043" data-verses="Exodus 34:29-33">Exo. 34:29-33</span>) lest they see the end of his ministry, which was passing away.

Since this fact was not revealed to the sons of Israel, their thoughts were hardened, and their minds were blinded. The veil is being done away in Christ through the new covenant economy, yet it still remains in their minds when they read the old covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84047" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:15">v. 15</span>). </p>

This indicates that their heart is away from the Lord when the veil lies on their heart. When their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Actually, their turned-away heart is the veil. To turn their heart to the Lord is to take away the veil. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfwiL-jTZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> Do you know why Christians have no light, no revelation? It is because they are covered by a thick, heavy veil. Of course, there may be a small number who turn their heart to the Lord. When their heart is turned to Him, the veil is taken away, and they see light. Many Christians today are covered by such a thick veil. This is the reason there is so little light among them. </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0P42yDARc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> Many among us can testify that when we turned to the Lord we were enlightened. We became clear concerning <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> ourselves, our situation, and the condition of our inner being. By turning to the Lord and coming to the church, we became more clear than ever before. </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpQiwPcJ_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> Those who are constituted apostles are believers whose hearts have been turned to the Lord. Saul of Tarsus became this kind of believer. When he was on the way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus said to him, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” Immediately and unconsciously Saul’s heart was turned to the Lord, and he called, saying, “Who art thou, Lord?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84052" data-verses="Acts 9:5">Acts 9:5</span>). Although he did not know who the Lord was, he still called Him Lord. He called on Him foolishly and even blindly. Many of us have done the same thing. Some time later, however, we realized what happened, and our spiritual sky became very clear. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbGnjQdIv5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> After the Lord appeared to Saul and he called on Him, Saul became blind. Before that time he was a religious leader and led others to persecute the church. But after he called on the name of the Lord, he needed someone to lead him. The Lord Jesus said to him that he should go into the city and that he would be told what to do (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84053" data-verses="Acts 9:6">Acts 9:6</span>). Eventually, Ananias came to him, and the scales fell off Saul’s eyes. This indicates that the veil was taken away and that he received light. Because the heart of Saul of Tarsus was turned to the Lord, the veil was taken away. What light this man received! His Epistles were all written under the shining of this light. The reason Paul received so much light was due to one factor: the turning of his heart to the Lord and the taking away of the veil. </p>

This, then, is a strong word in the Bible, telling us emphatically that Christ is the Spirit. “The Lord Christ of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84065" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:16">ver. 16</span> is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84066" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">ver. 6</span>), and the ministration of which is with glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84067" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8">ver. 8</span>).

Their conduct is governed and controlled by a purpose. This purpose is to shine the glory of the gospel of Christ. They conduct themselves in such a way that the gospel of Christ may shine through them and out from within them. This is the goal, the purpose, of their living. They do not merely preach the gospel—they shine out the gospel of the glory of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZqAjSO9LixKc_F2NRK9fXc76Cf3n_v9KDTBBD24pKKBOTnM6X34wk61RvjbLDfwsH"> The gospel preached by Paul was a gospel of glory, a gospel full of light and glory. This glory cannot be conveyed just by speaking, by preaching. It must be expressed through shining. Furthermore, this shining must be the living of the New Testament ministers. Their living is the very shining of the gospel they preach. For them, the gospel is not merely a <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> doctrine. There is no need for a doctrine to have any shining. But the gospel they preach, the gospel of glory, is full of shining. This glory is God Himself, God embodied in the gospel they preach. Therefore, the gospel preached by the ministers of the new covenant is not a theory, a philosophy, or a mere doctrine. It is the embodiment of the God of glory. This gospel cannot be carried out simply through preaching. There must be shining. </p>
<p data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwkntn_zMujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG"> The ministers who carry out this gospel of glory are luminaries; that is, they are shining ones. As luminaries, they themselves do not have light, but they have the ability to reflect light that comes from another source, just as the moon reflects the light of the sun. </p>
<p data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42RK9k3uSWYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4"> The gospel can be compared to Christ shining forth as the sun, the God of glory embodied in His redemptive work. We all need to understand the gospel in this way. Do not regard the gospel as a philosophy or a teaching. No, the gospel is the embodiment of the very God of glory. This gospel needs many shining ones, many luminaries, to reflect its light. Reflecting the light of the gospel of glory is the living of all the ministers of the new covenant. This reflection is the conduct of the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="-fHkLKWj9SQ91tLa1G364G4pOcTRoaCMvHurZ1-DM3u8vtBx03384wRIRHSxo1kdf"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84119" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4">verse 4</span> Paul uses the word illumination. Deep in his spirit, Paul considered himself and his co-workers luminaries. Today we also need to be such luminaries reflecting the glory of the gospel of Christ. The goal, the aim, and the purpose of the living of the New Testament ministers is to shine in this way. The goal of Paul’s conduct was to shine out the gospel. He and his co-workers, ministers of the new covenant, conducted themselves for the shining of the gospel of the glory of Christ. </p>

In this chapter, he goes on to tell, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84122" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1-6">verse 1 through 6</span>, how they as the ministers of the new covenant conduct themselves <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> for the carrying out of their ministry, and, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84123" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:7-18">verse 7 through 18</span>, what kind of life they live. </p>

All the apostles’ works are to carry out this unique ministry of ministering Christ to others for the building up of His Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="uKAggo26VcYIYatm2wE1X7mlIjGB46_tKYIeAUP5KUS9ib9fxDxuiAAHQDKQU_Qdp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84126" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">verse 1</span> Paul speaks of ministry in the singular. This is a strong proof that the co-workers all had one ministry, the unique ministry. Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament there is one unique ministry. The unique ministry in the New Testament is the ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit. In this ministry Christ is ministered to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVzpff4ZGDyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> Today it is common for preachers to talk about different ministries. Although I would not say that it is wrong to speak of ministries, we need to be careful in speaking concerning ministry in this way. What is crucial here is what we mean by the words ministry and ministries. In 2 Corinthians the ministry is unique; it is not spoken of in the plural. “This ministry” is the unique ministry of the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3esthZCsixS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84127" data-verses="Acts 1:1">chapter one</span> of Acts Peter refers to the ministry. There was the need for someone to fill the gap among the Apostles, for someone to join the eleven in bearing the ministry. The twelve Apostles all had one ministry. This ministry was to preach Christ in resurrection. In 2 Corinthians the apostles also have one ministry—to minister Christ to others. </p>

I can testify that because I also have a part in this ministry, I do not lose heart. The ministry is an incentive and a motivation. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="76" id="76">[76]</span> ministry strengthens me, supports me, backs me up, and causes me not to lose heart. Even the opposition is a sign that this ministry is under the Lord’s blessing and that it is effective. We do not lose heart, no matter how much the opposition may rise up against us. </p>

Having Renounced<br/>the Hidden Things of Shame</h2><p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQtOsVtNyrzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84128" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:2">verse 2</span> Paul says, “But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience before God.” We need to have a conscience that can declare to the angels and the demons that we do not have any hidden things of shame, but are transparent and crystal clear. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QPEAgezlADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> The Greek word rendered adulterate primarily means to ensnare; then to corrupt, as in the case of gold or wine that is not pure. The meaning is narrower than that of the word for peddling in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84129" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:17">2:17</span>, which adds the sense of being for the sake of gain. To adulterate gold is to mix it with some inferior metal for the purpose of selling it at a price higher than its actual value. Likewise, to adulterate wine is to mix it with another kind of liquid for the purpose of presenting it as if it were wine of good quality. Even in the first century, certain so-called preachers adulterated the Word of God in this way. They added inferior things to the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0GnwVR2IkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> Some preachers today adulterate the Word of God. In their sermons they may use verses from the Bible, but they add adulterating elements. They claim that what they preach is God’s Word. Actually, only a small percentage may be the Word, with the remainder being the adulterating elements that have been added to the Word. In this way, they adulterate the divine gold and the divine wine in the Bible. Paul’s way of conducting himself was absolutely contrary to this. He certainly did not adulterate the word of God, but presented the pure gold, even the refined gold, of the Word. </p>

<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceSWqs7cIfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84174" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">Chapters three and four</span> of 2 Corinthians are the most crucial chapters of both 1 and 2 Corinthians. No other chapters in these Epistles are so related to the constitution of Christ for the deeper experience of life. These two chapters are very deep in the experience of life. First, these chapters reveal how the apostles, as ministers of the new covenant, were constituted. They were reorganized, rearranged, having been made ministers of the new covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TMC4bDV8Z3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4"> Paul considered himself the chief among the sinners. How could such a rebel against God become a minister of the new covenant, a minister of Christ for the carrying out of God’s economy? It is certainly a great matter to convert a rebel against God into a minister of Christ for the accomplishing of God’s administration in the New Testament age. </p>
<p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwFubQiz-qezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> In order for Paul to become a minister of Christ, he was first reborn and then reconstituted. Rebirth is not sufficient to make someone a minister of the new covenant; it is also necessary for that one to be reorganized, rearranged, reconstituted. A new constitution, however, requires a new element. Without the element as the essence of the constitution, it is not possible for us to be constituted of anything. The redemption of Christ brings us back to God, but it does not do the work of constitution. This work requires some element in addition to the redeeming blood of Christ. This element is not only life, or the Spirit; it is the processed God. </p>
<p data-content-id="uKAggo26VcYIYatm2wE1X7mlIjGB46_tKYY6AWLNKUS9ib9fxDxuiAAHQDKQU_Qdp"> I would call your attention to the steps of the process through which God has passed: incarnation, human living, <span class="pg" data-page-id="86" id="86">[86]</span> crucifixion, and resurrection. These four major steps of God’s process are also the ingredients of the processed God as the element with which we are constituted. These ingredients are typified by the four spices compounded with olive oil to make the ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84175" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. The olive oil was the basic element, and the four spices were the ingredients compounded with this element. The compound produced as a result of this process was the ointment with its ingredients. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_odpNa3JHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> God is the Spirit, the olive oil, the basic element. The four spices are related to incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Incarnation brought divinity into humanity and made them one entity. But neither divinity nor humanity was changed in nature. No, divinity remains divinity, and humanity remains humanity. This is illustrated by the mingling of oil with fine flour in the meal offering. The oil and the flour are mingled together to form one entity with two natures. However, each nature remains separate and complete. The oil does not lose its nature, and the flour does not change its nature. Nevertheless, the oil and the flour are mingled together to produce one entity. But this entity is not a third nature, something that is neither oil nor flour. Rather, it is a complete entity with two natures, the nature of oil and the nature of flour. This is an illustration of incarnation bringing divinity into humanity, making them one and causing them to live as one. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExH9HzfrbLpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF"> The Lord Jesus, a wonderful Person with two natures, divinity and humanity, lived in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth for thirty years. After completing His ministry, He was crucified. His human living implies that He passed through everything in humanity related to the first creation. When He was crucified, He brought the entire old creation to the cross and terminated it. Because the old creation has been terminated, we should not be bothered by our problems. In the sight of God, all these problems have been terminated. God sitting on the throne can say to Satan, “Little Satan, what are you trying to do? Are you still causing trouble? I’ll give you a little more time to play. However, you must realize that I have already terminated you. You, <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> along with the old creation, have been terminated.” Satan and the old creation have been terminated, and we also were terminated by the death of Christ on the cross. This termination is the true significance of the crucifixion. </p>
<p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QXWDmEnFP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> Through His resurrection Christ brought God’s chosen and redeemed people into God. Incarnation brought God into man; resurrection brought man into God. Today we, the redeemed people of God, not only have God in us; we also are in God. It is wonderful to have God in us, but it is even more wonderful to be in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnGkm2fIadTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> Perhaps you are not very conscious of the fact that you are in God. By the Lord’s mercy I can testify that I definitely have the sense, the consciousness, that I am a man in God. Apparently, I am a man living on earth; actually, I am a man in God. God is in me, and I am in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEtWgReY9VYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> God has been brought into us through incarnation, and we have been brought into God through Christ’s resurrection. This is the Triune God, the processed God. The processed Triune God is the very element with which we have been constituted. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfgCL-TLZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> Some may say, “I do not feel as if I have been constituted with the processed Triune God.” You may not feel this, but you need to believe it. As Christians, we need to live by faith and walk by faith, not by sight (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84176" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:7">5:7</span>). We are believers, not those who walk by sight. Are you a believer or one who walks by sight? A believer is one who does not trust in things that can be seen, but he takes certain unseen things, confesses them, and realizes them by faith. To be one who walks according to feelings is even worse than being one who walks by sight. You may not feel that you are living in a certain place. Actually you are living there. Feelings are not trustworthy. You may feel that you are wonderful, but your condition may be pitiful. Do not believe in your feelings—believe in the facts. It is a fact that we all have been brought into God. The processed Triune God is the very element with which we have been constituted. You may not feel constituted, or that there has been any change within you. Again I say, be a believer, one who walks by faith, not one who walks <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> according to his feelings. When God says a certain thing, you should also speak that thing simply because the Bible tells you so. The Bible reveals that God has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit as the constituting element. The Bible says this, and we must believe it. </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0fY2yzIRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> Brother Nee often said that first we have fact, then faith, then experience. The sequence is not experience, faith, and fact. The facts are always first. But how do we know about the facts? The facts are recorded in the New Testament. This testament is a will, something stronger and better than a covenant. A covenant is an agreement similar to a contract. But a testament, a will, refers to something already accomplished. Suppose a will declares that a person has been given a million dollars. The evidence, the proof, of this is the will. </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpACwPsB_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> The New Testament is a will. This will says that the processed God is now in us, that He is our portion, and that He is the element with which we have been constituted. Yes, we <em>have been</em> constituted. We need to believe this fact, just as we believe that we are children of God. Sometimes the Devil says, “Look at yourself. Are you a son of God? How can you say you are a son of God when you lost your temper this morning?” Even when we lose our temper, we must insist on believing that we are sons of God. Thus, we should say, “Satan, even though I have lost my temper many times, I am still a son of God. Losing my temper does not change the fact that I am a son of God. Satan, with my declaration of this fact, I chase you away.” </p>

<p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QPUggf3dADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> In this message we come to the last three verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84205" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84206" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16-18">verses 16 through 18</span>. These verses are still related to the living of a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life by the excellent power of the treasure in the earthen vessels. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0G3QVQi0kVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84207" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapters three and four</span> we see that first the apostles were constituted of God Himself. That constitution was everything in relation to their life and behavior. Every aspect of their living and behavior was based on this constitution. Furthermore, this constitution afforded them the life supply with the power, strength, riches, wisdom, and even the ministry. They ministered with what had been constituted into them. </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0ziWQjOch_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> The apostles did not preach something which they had merely heard or had been taught. What they ministered was not something that had only been revealed in a vision. What they preached, taught, and ministered was altogether what had been constituted into them. The apostles were constituted in a certain way, having become constituted persons. Therefore, what they ministered was their constitution. They ministered what they were, what they had become. This means that their reconstituted being became their ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2sCxSg6Nzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> Paul’s writings are very different from today’s Christian writings. Paul’s writings are a record of his constitution, whereas today’s writings are mainly concerned with theology, doctrines, teachings, expositions, and interpretations. Among the fourteen Epistles written by Paul, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84208" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapters three and four </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> of 2 Corinthians are the richest as far as his personal experience of Christ is concerned. In these chapters we have an accurate and precious record of Paul’s spiritual constitution. If we would know what kind of person Paul was as a minister of the new covenant, we need to spend much time in these two chapters, chapters which reveal Paul’s spiritual constitution. </p>
<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVz5_f4ZmDyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> Because ministry requires constitution, Brother Nee told us that we could receive a gift immediately, but we could never have a ministry in a short time. It takes years to become constituted. This involves growth into maturity. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3estx5CsiRS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> Everything related to this constitution is organic and of life. This life is by the Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the processed God. Paul was a person constituted of God. It is not sufficient to speak of him as a God-man, for he was actually a person constituted of God. Therefore, Paul’s ministry was his being. What he preached and taught was what he was. He ministered his very being to others. As Paul ministered in this way, Christ was imparted into others, for Paul and Christ had become one. Paul was one with Christ and had been constituted of Christ. His ministry was a ministry of the Christ who had been constituted into his being. Without this kind of ministry, there is no way to have the church adequately built up or to have the bride properly adorned. </p>
<p data-content-id="HBnt4SwtmItWiwiqI0PmS5SoF6HanOgY9GVZmv9yTfj2hxGvMiNVng7WQlZnI5E96"> The Bible indicates that what God initiated at the beginning will be accomplished. Moreover, God is a God of resurrection. As the God of resurrection, His purpose cannot fail, and He Himself cannot be defeated. Rather, all frustrations and distractions prove His unchangeableness, prove that He is the unchanging God. What He has determined, He will accomplish. What He set out to do at the beginning, He will fulfill at the end. In the New Testament God began with a group of ministers. Paul was among them. At the end God will also have a group of the same kind of ministers. Here and there around the world, He must have ministers of the new covenant. My burden is that many among us will become ministers of the new covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWiJRj3JeMVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9"> I hope that these messages on the ministry and the ministers of the new covenant will remain with you. I hope <span class="pg" data-page-id="97" id="97">[97]</span> especially that the leading ones, the co-workers, and all those who have a heart for the Lord’s recovery will aspire to be today’s new covenant ministers. We need to have a heart not only to love the Lord in a general way, but also to become ministers of the New Testament. If we have such a heart, we must be serious with the Lord and dwell on these two chapters of 2 Corinthians, praying over them, having fellowship concerning them, and telling the Lord that we are willing to open ourselves for His working in us. We need to tell Him that we are willing to be broken, ground, and constituted; that we are willing to live a crucified life; that we are willing to renounce ourselves and deny ourselves and be constituted daily with the elements of the processed Triune God; that we are willing to be today’s Paul, not a great person or a famous believer, but a small man, a crucified man, even a Nazarene. </p>
<p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcVuT6nRprUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> Jesus of Nazareth did not seek to be great or famous. On the contrary, He was a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died. In this way Jesus became the first minister of the new covenant. We need to follow Him also to become ministers of the new covenant. Concerning this, we must look to the Lord and pray desperately to Him. </p>

Not Losing Heart </h2>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0G3QVRGAkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84209" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">4:16</span> Paul says, “Wherefore we do not lose heart, but if indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.” In this verse Paul says, as he does in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84210" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">4:1</span>, “We do not lose heart.” Many things had happened that could have caused Paul and his co-workers to be disappointed or to lose heart. Hardly anything was encouraging. Nevertheless, because they were in resurrection, they did not lose heart. Actually, resurrection requires death, discouragement, and disappointment in order to be manifested. Without death, how could there be the manifestation of resurrection life? Death allows resurrection to be manifested. Therefore, as they passed through death, the apostles did <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> not lose heart. Although many disappointing things happened, they were not discouraged. </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0ziWQjMIp_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84211" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">verse 16</span> Paul says that our outward man is decaying. The outward man is our body and our soul, with the body as its organ and the soul as its life and person. The inward man is our regenerated spirit with our renewed soul. The regenerated spirit is its life and person, and the renewed soul is its organ. The life of the soul must be denied (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84212" data-verses="Matthew 16:24-25">Matt. 16:24-25</span>), but the functions of the soul, the mind, will, and emotion, must be renewed and uplifted by being subdued (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84213" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:4-5">2 Cor. 10:4-5</span>) to be used by the spirit, the person of the inward man. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2sCxSi-Bzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> The Greek word rendered decaying also means being consumed, being wasted away, being worn out. By the continued killing, the working of death, our outward man, that is, our material body with its animating soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84214" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:44">1 Cor. 15:44</span>), is being consumed and worn out. </p>
<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8CnD2d3pVYKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84215" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">verse 16</span> I prefer the word consumed to the word decayed. Decay implies that something is disintegrating by itself without anything acting upon it. Here Paul does not mean that the apostles were decaying. According to the context, their being put to death was not initiated by them. If they had taken the initiative, then we may say that they were decaying. But since the initiative was taken by the persecutors and by the circumstances and environment, it is better to say that they were being consumed. They were being wasted away. The meaning of the Greek word includes decaying, being consumed, and being wasted away. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVu0SW8WH2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK"> The persecutors and the environment were working on the apostles. This was not a work carried out by the apostles on themselves. Grinding is never initiated by the grains. Rather, the grinding work is carried on by the person doing the grinding. The apostles were not the grinders; they were the ones under the grinding. Their outward man was being consumed, destroyed, put to death. </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIcFXYCWZgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> Teachers of the Bible have different interpretations and explanations of the term the outward man. Certain of the so-called inner life people regard the outward man as <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> the soulish man, the natural man, and they consider the spiritual man, one who lives in the spirit, as the inner man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84216" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:1-2">1 Corinthians 2 and 3</span> Paul does speak of the spiritual man, the soulish man, and the fleshly man. A fleshly person is one who lives in the lust of his flesh, whereas a soulish person lives in the soul. Those who are soulish are divisive. In the church life they have their own preferences and choices. The spiritual person, like Paul and the apostles, lives and walks in the spirit. According to some inner life teachers, we may either be soulish ones who live in the outward man, or spiritual ones who live in the inward man. </p>

This description began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84231" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:12">3:12</span> with the word concerning their constitution. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84232" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> we see the way these ministers conduct themselves (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84233" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1-6">4:1-6</span>), and we have a record regarding their living (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84234" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:7-18">4:7-18</span>). They were constituted of the Triune God, they conducted themselves in such a way as to shine out the gospel of the glory of Christ, and they lived a crucified life for the manifestation of resurrection life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84235" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1-8">5:1-8</span> we see another characteristic: their longing to be clothed upon with the transfigured body. </p>

This means that they were longing for the redemption of their body. Their spirit had been regenerated and their soul had been renewed and transformed, but there was still a problem related to the fallen, mortal body. This body was a burden to them. They sighed, groaned, under this burden. They did not have any problems in their spirit or in their soul. Their soul had been constituted of the divine element. But they still had a problem with the mortal body. <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Ql5Pg2ZNuykXsyEjASMH8B5GtMoTjCdfD37tdhCbnWm2lFgAKpLfM_KLzMYyqkpuP"> In God’s full and complete salvation, there is a matter which takes care of our mortal body. This is transfiguration. Transfiguration changes our mortal body into a body of glory, just like the resurrected body of the Lord Jesus. This aspect of God’s salvation is very promising; it is the hope of glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbG3LQd435eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> After giving us a clear view of how the new covenant ministers have been constituted of the Triune God and how they conduct themselves for the shining of the gospel and live a crucified life, Paul goes on to speak of their longing to have the fallen body redeemed. In this Epistle, however, Paul does not speak of the redemption of our body, a term used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84236" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>.

<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wqwuUiszfcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84237" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">Second Corinthians 5:1</span> says, “For we know that if our earthly tabernacle house is taken down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.” “For” indicates that what is to be mentioned is an explanation of what is spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84238" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:13-18">4:13-18</span>. In this chapter the apostle tells us of the apostles’ aspiration for the redemption of their body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84239" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Rom. 8:23</span>), their ambition to please the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84240" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:9-15">2 Cor. 5:9-15</span>), and their commission from the Lord for His new creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84241" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:16-21">vv. 16-21</span>). They cared for the things that are not seen, not for the things that are seen. </p>
<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv3Hc13PKT6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> The word “earthly” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84242" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">verse 1</span> does not mean made of earth; it means upon the earth. The word “tabernacle” indicates that our physical body, in which our person dwells, is not only for living, but also for worshipping God (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84243" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:19">1 Cor. 6:19</span>). The word “building” denotes a building with a foundation, not like a tabernacle without a foundation. This building is from, or out of, God, a “house” that is our spiritual body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84244" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:44">1 Cor. 15:44</span>). In contrast to something upon the earth, it is a house in the heavens. <span class="pg" data-page-id="105" id="105">[105]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8X6jLVS9xV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> The expression “tabernacle house” is unusual. Our body is a house and also a tabernacle. The word house indicates that the body is our dwelling place, and the word tabernacle indicates that this house is a temporary dwelling place. It is not a building with a foundation, but a tabernacle similar to the one erected in the wilderness. As Paul indicates, some day this tabernacle-house will be taken down. Here Paul does not simply say that our mortal body will die. Instead, he speaks of the earthly tabernacle-house being taken down. When this happens, we shall have a building from God, not another tabernacle. This building will be solid and will have a foundation. Furthermore, this house is not heaven, but it is in the heavens in contrast to upon the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="123M5cSNMEj-7uz-rGkoC46zlbHtHXa8O4MoRsOF1iusSytY9NpKTJ_yPM6vOLmNG"> This building will be our resurrected, transfigured body, the spiritual body mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84245" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:1">1 Corinthians 15</span>. Today our body is a soulish one, but one day it will be transfigured into a spiritual body. As a soulish body, it is now animated by the soul. When it becomes a spiritual body, it will be directed by the spirit. That building will become our house, a house not made with human hands, but a house from God in the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="9y_RCEn53QXJX8AG7BzDo03GiIrcVdFzVLRhVZjih8fFM7yeaCSVDU7M5P31_v8wC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84246" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:2">verse 2</span> Paul says, “For indeed in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our dwelling place from heaven.” The word “this” refers to the tabernacle in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84247" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">verse 1</span>. To be clothed upon is to be transfigured and conformed to the body of Christ’s glory. The apostles were longing for this. Our dwelling place from heaven, or out of heaven, refers to the house in the heavens in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84248" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">verse 1</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNgoolTnQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> In our spirit we rejoice and in our body we groan. If you want to rejoice, get into the spirit. But if you want to groan or sigh, remain in the body. As Paul says, in the body we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our dwelling place from heaven. Since we have not experienced this kind of clothing, we cannot say much about it. We know what it is to rejoice in the spirit and to groan in the body, but we do not know what it is to be clothed upon with the resurrected, spiritual, heavenly body. But according to what is prophesied in the New Testament, we shall eventually be clothed with such a body. <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> This is one item in the New Testament, in the will.

A dead person, being disembodied, is naked, without a body as a covering before God. The apostles were expecting to be transfigured in their body, to be clothed with a spiritual body to meet the Lord before they died and were disembodied, that they might not be found naked. </p>
<p data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MMY7iqYuoCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj"> Many Christians think that when a believer in Christ dies, he goes to heaven. If this is true, then there are a great many naked persons in heaven, for those who have died are now disembodied. God, however, will not allow such naked persons to come into His presence. In the Old Testament it says that someone who is not properly clothed cannot come into the presence of God. The priests, in particular, had to wear a long robe. This was a type. If we would be in the presence of God, we cannot be naked; that is, we cannot be disembodied. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9ix4b0QMGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> When Paul said that he did not want to be found naked, this means that he did not want to die. To die is to be naked. Paul’s desire was to be clothed and thereby not to be found naked. Of course, after our bodies are transfigured, none of us will be found naked. We shall live eternally. The point here is that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84250" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:3">verse 3</span> to be naked means to die. </p>

The apostles groaned in the desire not to be unclothed, disembodied, that is, not to die but to be clothed upon, to put on the spiritual body. This is to have our body transfigured (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84252" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Phil. 3:21</span>), to have it redeemed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84253" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Rom. 8:23</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="107" id="107">[107]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="GBLvlFuZpxpOzPlHECwzEvBrtGtiuqGT34FLcutrsVtjWxkMb27nu2FPxyYbaMXgd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84273" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapters three and four</span> Paul speaks concerning the qualifications of the New Testament ministers. The first qualification is that of being constituted of the Triune God. This qualification is basic. We become competent, sufficient, equipped, and qualified to be ministers of the new covenant by being thoroughly constituted of the Triune God, who is now the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. As these ministers are constituted of such a One, the effectiveness of Christ’s all-inclusive death operates within their being, terminating the old creation and killing the flesh and the natural life. </p>
<p data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ3NLM_OAH014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB"> In the constitution received by the apostles, there are a number of factors or ingredients. These ingredients are typified by the spices used to make the ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84274" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. One of these factors is the effectiveness of Christ’s death. Daily this ingredient, this factor, works within the apostles. For this reason, in their daily living there is nothing of the old creation: no self, no flesh, no natural life. This killing element can be compared to an antibiotic used to kill germs. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_odlNYjhHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> Along with the factor that puts to death the old creation, there is another factor, a positive one. This is the factor of resurrection. This ingredient includes not only divinity, but also Christ’s resurrected and uplifted humanity. The resurrected Christ Himself is resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExH9Lzdv3LpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF"> The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the processed God. The processed God as the life-giving Spirit includes divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Therefore, it is a very significant matter to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> constituted of the processed God. God has been processed, and we have been constituted. God has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Today the resurrected Christ is also the ascended One, the exalted and enthroned One. </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0ziWYjMIJ_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> A person can be helped by medicine without understanding all the ingredients of the medicine. Likewise, although it is helpful to know all the elements of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we can be helped by these ingredients even without understanding them. We simply need to take the “dose” of the Spirit. Then the elements of death and resurrection will work within us. As resurrection works within us, we become heavenly, empowered, and authorized. The ingredient of resurrection often works in us apart from our consciousness. This can be compared to the way an antibiotic works in us apart from our consciousness of it. Today the ingredient of resurrection is working in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2sC5Si-hzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> In his living Paul had the highest humanity. Paul’s humanity was actually an expression of the human living of Jesus. He had been constituted of the life of Jesus and thereby became properly human, “Jesusly” human. When we come to the remaining chapters in this book, we shall see how outstanding is Paul’s humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8CnD-d3ZdYKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> We have pointed out that the basic qualification of a new covenant minister is to be constituted of the processed Triune God. The constitution is the base, the foundation, of the qualifications. We today also need this foundation. In doing anything or learning anything, we need a base. If we would be ministers of the new covenant, we must have the constitution as a basic qualification. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVu0aW8mP2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK"> The second qualification of the ministers of the new covenant is to conduct themselves for the shining out of the gospel. Their conduct and behavior were based on their constitution. Because they had been constituted in a certain way, they could live a life that manifests the truth and shines forth the glory of the gospel. It was not necessary for them to determine to do something to cause themselves to shine. No, apart from their consciousness and intention, <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> simply by the way they lived, there was a shining forth from their being. Their constitution became their shining. For example, charcoal does not shine, but a gold coin shines. Between the charcoal and the gold there is a difference of constitution. Because of their constitution, the apostles shined forth the glory of the gospel. It was not necessary for them to preach, for their being was shining. </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIcFfYCmBgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> Because this shining came out of their being, their constitution, their behavior was not a performance of any kind. Today people often behave in a certain way to match the occasion. This behavior is a performance. For example, on some occasions they may conduct themselves with pride, as if they were dignitaries. But on other occasions they may conduct themselves humbly as subordinates. All this is a performance. However, those who are qualified to be ministers of the new covenant do not behave in this way. On the contrary, their behavior, based on their constitution, is genuine. This is the second qualification of a new covenant minister. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVeS2DmQOzDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> I aspire to follow Paul’s example. By the Lord’s mercy, I do not want to perform in any way, but I want to have a behavior which comes out of my constitution. </p>
<p data-content-id="_4w9Ar9Vyp0N_HoNrdaOQWC9shEsus7o-47uMp82ngRtO9yGHFVltw-zoF6hLKtMB"> Third, the apostles lived a crucified life. Day by day they were under the grinding. As Jesus of Nazareth lived a crucified life, so the apostles also lived this kind of life. The Lord Jesus was crucified throughout His life. He lived a crucified life from the time He was born in the manger. Then through all the years He was continually being crucified. He was under the grinding, the killing, the putting to death. But this killing afforded Him the opportunity to manifest the resurrection life from within Him. Before Christ was actually nailed to the cross, He had already lived a crucified life. In like manner, before Christ was resurrected, the resurrection life had already been manifested in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkhkLXilHkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> In their ministry the apostles were, on the one hand, captives in the Lord’s triumphal procession. On the other hand, they were crucified ones, those who daily lived a crucified life. They were put to death, crucified, not only by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> opposers, but even by the believers. By reading the book of 1 Corinthians we can see that the Corinthian believers put the apostles on the cross. This was the reason Paul said, “Daily I die” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84275" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:31">1 Cor. 15:31</span>). Daily he was being put to death. This is the living of a crucified life for the manifestation of resurrection life and for the truth of everything ministered by the apostles to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18cG8Qop0-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> Under the grinding, the outer man of the apostles was consumed. But simultaneously they were renewed in the inner man. They were constituted of the Triune God, they behaved themselves according to this constitution to shine out the glory of the gospel, and they lived a crucified life for the consuming of the outward man and the renewing of the new man. These were the qualifications for them to be ministers of the new covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i-jkq5FCF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> I hope that not only the leading ones in the churches but all the saints, including the young ones, will be impressed with these matters. Do not think that you are too young to have some experience of these things. Yes, I did point out that it takes many years to be constituted by the Lord. Nevertheless, it is also true that the Lord can use even those who are young. I can testify that not long after I was saved, the Lord began to use me, for there was some amount of the divine constitution within me. This constitution is the base, the foundation, for us to be used by the Lord as a new covenant minister. This constitution affects our behavior. When I was saved, there was a change in my inner constitution. Spontaneously I began to behave according to this constitution. Although I was never taught to live a crucified life, I automatically began to live this kind of life. As a result, early in my Christian life, I became a little minister of the new covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="dChzg2DUKpIBDLedcWn1ydFKoiHfeFV0KBQOJs0L5ldzIRhtliB64uqos5WWmePIs"> Being a minister of the new covenant is a matter of degree. We all can be new covenant ministers, as long as we have the constitution and conduct ourselves according to it and live a crucified life with the elements of resurrection and ascension. Then we all, brothers and sisters alike, can be used by the Lord as little ministers of the new covenant. <span class="pg" data-page-id="115" id="115">[115]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Ql5Pg2ZNuykXsyEjASMH8B5GtMoTjCdfD37pdj23nWm2lFgAKpLfM_KLzMYyqkpuP"> By the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84276" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:18">chapter four</span>, Paul has recorded fully the qualifications of the New Testament ministers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84277" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">5:1</span> he expresses his aspiration, his desire and longing, to be raptured. Paul was mature and ready to be raptured. He was like ripened wheat in a field that is ready for harvest. This wheat is golden, no longer green. Hence, it is ready to be reaped. </p>

COMMISSIONED WITH THE<br/>MINISTRY OF RECONCILIATION<br/>FOR THE LORD’S NEW CREATION</h2><p data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfwHPjpXSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84308" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:16-21">5:16-21</span> we see that the apostles have been commissioned with the ministry of reconciliation for the Lord’s new creation. After speaking concerning the qualifications of the ministers of the new covenant in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84309" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapters three and four</span>, Paul tells us of his longing to be raptured and of his ambition to please the Lord, not by working for Him but simply by living to Him. Spontaneously such persons have a ministry to bring others fully back to the Lord. This is the ministry of reconciliation. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2Yaal-KBRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> According to the context, the ministry of reconciliation was a commission given to the apostles. As those who were mature and ready to be raptured, the apostles were commissioned by the Lord to bring others back to God in full. This is complete and thorough reconciliation. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wqw2UgoXfcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84310" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">2 Corinthians 5</span> we see that reconciliation has two steps. Fallen human beings cannot be fully brought back to God simply by the first step. The second step is necessary. As Paul speaks of his ministry of bringing others back to God, he spontaneously presents a clear view of the two steps of reconciliation. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNgwolTHQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> These steps are typified by the two veils in the tabernacle. There was a veil separating the Holy Place in the tabernacle from the Holy of Holies. There was another veil, called the first veil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84311" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">Hebrews 9</span>, at the entrance to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> tabernacle. In our translation of Exodus, we speak of this first veil as the screen. The function of a screen is to keep out negative things (such as insects) and to allow the positive things to come in. The second veil, the veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies, is called a veil, not a screen. The area outside the tabernacle was the outer court. According to typology, the outer court typifies the world. Hence, the tabernacle in the outer court signifies God’s dwelling place in the world. In the world there is a place where God dwells, and that place is the tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAdaysO9oy_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> The entire human race is in the world, outside the tabernacle. But whenever a person repents and desires to return to God, he comes to the altar. The altar signifies the cross, where Christ died for our redemption. In the Old Testament, sacrifices were offered to God for atonement. But in the New Testament Christ died on the cross for redemption. In the typology of the Old Testament there was atonement, but in the fulfillment in the New Testament there is redemption. In the outer court there was also a laver, with water used for washing. Once a person had repented, had been redeemed, and had experienced the washing, he could enter the Holy Place. This is to be reconciled to God. Therefore, passing through the first veil signifies the first step of a sinner and a rebel being brought back to God and being reconciled to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKRIzUG-gr7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc"> The believers at Corinth once were sinners and rebels, but they had been reconciled to God. However, they were still in the Holy Place, not in the Holy of Holies. Paul’s purpose in 1 and 2 Corinthians was to bring these believers into the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MMYjiqomoCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj"> In <em>The Economy of God</em> I pointed out that the outer court corresponds to Egypt, that the wilderness corresponds to the Holy Place, and that the good land, the land of Canaan, corresponds to the Holy of Holies. For the children of Israel to come out of Egypt and enter into the wilderness is equal to leaving the outer court and coming into the Holy Place. This was precisely the situation of the Corinthian believers. As the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, so these <span class="pg" data-page-id="123" id="123">[123]</span> believers were wandering in the soul, in particular in the mind. Because they were wandering in the Holy Place of the soul, Paul wrote these two Epistles for the purpose of bringing them into the spirit, where Christ is. The spirit is also related to the good land and the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9ixgb0gUGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> The believers at Corinth had experienced the first step of reconciliation, but they had not experienced the second. They had not been reconciled to God in full. As there was a veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, so a veil still remained between the Corinthians and God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84312" data-verses="Hebrews 10:20">Hebrews 10:20</span>, this veil is the flesh. The flesh was the veil that kept the Corinthian believers away from the direct presence of God in the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8blBek8Y6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr"> Paul and the other ministers of the new covenant, those who had been constituted of the processed Triune God and who were mature in life, were no doubt in the Holy of Holies. They lived in the spirit, and they were ripe, ready to be raptured. Their only goal was to please the Lord by living to Him. Spontaneously, being such persons, they were able to bring others thoroughly back to God. For this reason, at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84313" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">chapter five</span> Paul indicates that they, the ministers of the new covenant, are those who seek not only to reconcile sinners to God, but also to reconcile the believers to God in full. These ministers of the new covenant were qualified to bring back to God anyone who had not been fully reconciled to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="wNe845Y8ijQ5dKg6d7KErQ-XLlzu45pbRdbIIe7A12hM0LmqbZ_Oxp9c_fGFhtXWL"> As long as we have not been brought back to God fully, we need someone like the apostles to bring us back to Him. It does not matter whether the distance between us and God is great or small. We need to be reconciled to God entirely. The ministry of the new covenant is to bring people back to God in a full and thorough way; it is to reconcile us to God entirely and completely. </p>

They did know Christ in this way, but now they know Him so no longer. </p>
<p data-content-id="AE9CEdRlVZ0DfzvVD9YH94VL_i-X9J56-zm5dK3kzjh81ESQHHyJQoNdtgNJws_Lr"> To know others according to the flesh is to know them according to the old creation. But to know others according to the spirit is to know them according to the new creation. Formerly, as Saul of Tarsus, Paul knew Christ according to the flesh. He regarded Him merely as a Nazarene. The Jewish people all knew Christ in this way, according to the flesh. But after his experience on the way to Damascus, Paul’s concept changed from knowing Christ according to the flesh to knowing Him according to the spirit. He also learned to know the saints not according to flesh, but according to spirit. </p>

God is not the God of yesterday or the God of tomorrow; He is the God of today. Every day God is advancing, moving on. Therefore, we need to be open to God’s speaking today.

I do not believe that before 1980 any of us knew this expression “live Christ for the church.” This saying has come forth only recently. However, we are concerned not simply with living Christ for the church, but with seeing a pattern of living Christ for the church. Paul is a pattern of living Christ for the church. </p>

I would ask you to consider what is revealed in the sixteen chapters of 1 Corinthians. These chapters reveal how to enjoy Christ, how to take Christ as our life, how to live Christ so that we may have the church and that He may have the Body to fulfill God’s eternal purpose. Not many readers of the Bible have <span class="pg" data-page-id="134" id="134">[134]</span> seen that 1 Corinthians is a book on living Christ for the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18cGkQopU-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> In the Life-study of 1 Corinthians I pointed out that 1 Corinthians deals with many problems. These problems are of two categories: the problems in the realm of human life and the problems in the realm of the divine administration. It is very important to have a proper human life. Of course, the divine administration is very crucial. We certainly need to have a proper human life to carry out God’s administration. But how can we have such a human life, and how can we carry out God’s administration? By what kind of life can we have a proper human life, and by what means, by what instrument, can we carry out the divine administration? Christ is the factor for solving the problems in the realm of human life, and the church is the factor for solving the problems related to the divine administration. </p>

Because of the fall, these germs have come into our family life and also into the church life. First Corinthians reveals that the church at Corinth had been invaded by these negative germs. The result was ruin and corruption. Christ is the only “antibiotic” that can effectively deal with these germs. Thus, in the first ten chapters of 1 Corinthians we see Christ as the factor, the element, the “medicine,” to heal all the problems in human life and to cure the diseases in the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ql5Pg2ZNuykXsyEjASMH8B5GtMoTjCdfD37xdjG_nWm2lFgAKpLfM_KLzMYyqkpuP"> The church at Corinth was indeed sick.

What could cure the believers of these diseases? The only cure was Christ, the divine medicine. </p>

As wisdom to us from God, Christ becomes our daily righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Daily we may enjoy Christ as our righteousness. If we enjoy Him in this way, we can declare, “Angels and demons, and all human beings, I am right with God and man. I am right with my family and with all the brothers and sisters in the church. This is my testimony because daily Christ is my righteousness.” </p>
<p data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weYUT08pfAY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx"> We can also testify that Christ is our daily sanctification and holiness.

We can say, “Angels and demons, you must realize that I am holy. I ask you to confirm the fact of my holiness in Christ. The Son of God, who is both the wisdom of God and the power of God, is becoming my daily holiness and sanctification.” </p>
<p data-content-id="3x4y4bH-jSB8_0__dQRX-nn-7_QC7aefq9bcx3tEiw83hJtljo8fD-KpeOzqVxFkY"> Holiness is the substance, whereas sanctification is the activity of being made holy.

Eventually, this sanctification becomes our holiness. Furthermore, this holiness is a Person, the Son of God, the unique portion into which God has called us. God has called us into the fellowship of Christ. Now, daily and hourly, we need to enjoy Him, first as righteousness, then as sanctification, and then as redemption. </p>

In this chapter Paul says that he planted, that Apollos watered, and that God gives the growth. To give the growth is a matter of growing Christ. The Christ who grows within us is the unique foundation. Hence, it is a living, growing foundation. </p>
<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEtW0Reo1VYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> As the foundation grows in us, this growth produces gold, silver, and precious stones, the materials needed for the building up of the church.

When we enjoy this portion, we are cleansed from every kind of leaven. Enjoying Christ as the unleavened bread causes us to become unleavened. This purification from every kind of leaven is not a suffering. It is not the result of being placed on a surgical table; it comes from sitting at a table of feasting where we enjoy Christ as unleavened bread. </p>

<p data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwk3Rn-HkujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG"> First Corinthians reveals the matter of living Christ for the church. If we read this Epistle in a thoughtful way, we may wonder if there is a pattern of living Christ for the church. We may say as we read this book, “Paul, show us a pattern. We have seen many things in our parents, relatives, neighbors, friends, and colleagues, but we have never seen a person living Christ for the church. We would like to see a pattern, for a pattern is much better than thousands of words.” Realizing the need for such a pattern, Paul presents this pattern in 2 Corinthians. Therefore, in this Epistle we see a living pattern. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42RaBk2K-WYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4">A PERSONAL TESTIMONY</h2><p data-content-id="-fHkLKWj9SQ91tLa1G364G4pOcTRoaCMvH-XZ3qjM3u8vtBx03384wRIRHSxo1kdf"> Paul opens each of his Epistles in a different way. For example, the way he opens Romans is different from the way he begins Ephesians. The Epistle of 2 Corinthians also begins in a particular way. After the greetings and the word about grace and peace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84398" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:1-2">1:1 and 2</span>, Paul goes on to speak, not in a doctrinal way or in the way of revelation, but in the way of giving a personal testimony. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84399" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:8">1:8</span> he says, “For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, as to our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living.” It seems as if Paul is saying, “Corinthian believers, I want to give you my testimony concerning how I live Christ for the church. When we were in Asia, we were excessively burdened, heavily pressed. We were pressed beyond our power, <span class="pg" data-page-id="144" id="144">[144]</span> beyond our ability to withstand pressure, so that we despaired even of living. It was very clear to us that we were dying.” There is nothing doctrinal here. On the contrary, Paul is giving a testimony. This testimony is part of the pattern. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pbBnT8P58uzq4V0jIiQ68lujBXFx65nhPR7MuU5nsZuuDDkZCUidRP80lkw5FcmBk">THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="muHafN-ILtAYeBa5rCiGrZeAqj5x_pHm3PQ_sp6iEwJyH9-WaG0rXZzKN8RdvDILu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84400" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span> Paul continues, “But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God, Who raises the dead.” Because they realized they were dying, the apostles did not have any confidence in themselves. Their confidence was in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZqAjSO9LixKc_F2NRK9fXc76Cf3n_v9KDTR9D08FKKBOTnM6X34wk61RvjbLDfwsH"> The God in whom they were confident was not simply the One who created the heavens and the earth. Rather, their confidence was in the God of resurrection, in the God who raises the dead. Here Paul does not say, “I call upon the God who created heaven and earth to witness for me.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84401" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:9">verse 9</span> Paul refers not to the God of creation, but to the God of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="AE9CEdRlVZ0DfzvVD9YH94VL_i-X9J56-zmxdKHszjh81ESQHHyJQoNdtgNJws_Lr"> Paul’s confidence was not in himself; it was in the resurrecting God, the God who raises the dead. To have confidence in the God of resurrection and have no confidence in ourselves is to live Christ. If I have confidence in myself, then surely I am living myself. I am not living Christ. But here is an apostle who had no confidence in himself. His confidence was fully in the very God who raises the dead. In this matter he is a pattern of living Christ. </p>

Paul’s conscience testified that he lived in singleness; being political was not his manner of living. With Paul there was no politics. On the contrary, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="145" id="145">[145]</span> was single. However, Paul did not live his own singleness and sincerity; he lived the singleness and sincerity of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42RaBk3uCWYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4"> The expression “the singleness of God” implies that God Himself is this singleness.

Grace is the processed Triune God. First Corinthians reveals that the Triune God has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit for us to enjoy. This enjoyment of the processed Triune God is grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceSWys6oAfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84405" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span> Paul says, “But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.” The expression “the grace of God” in this verse and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84406" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span> actually indicates that grace is God Himself. The grace of God is the very God. Hence, grace is not something which belongs to God; grace is God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TMCgbCxwZ3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4"> Furthermore, the unprocessed God is not grace. Rather, grace is the Triune God in resurrection. It is not God only as He is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84407" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>; it is the God revealed in the Epistles of Paul. The God in Paul’s ministry is not merely the God of creation, but He is the God in resurrection. Resurrection involves the processes of incarnation, human living, and crucifixion. After passing through this process, the Triune God entered into resurrection. Therefore, when we speak of God as the God of resurrection, we imply the process through which He has passed. </p>
<p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwFuDQgXWqezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> Christ passed through incarnation, through thirty-three and a half years of human living, and through crucifixion, which lasted six hours. After he died, He was placed in a tomb. Then He went into Hades and had a tour of the realm of death. Following that, He came forth in resurrection.

Or the things which I resolve, do I resolve according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes, yes and no, no?” Paul was neither political nor fickle. He was not the kind of person who would say yes at one time and then shortly afterward change his answer and say no. With Paul, yes was yes, and no was no. Whatever he resolved, he resolved by being one with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3estxlCsSZS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> Paul was absolutely one with Christ, with God’s anointed One. This was the reason he could say, “But God is faithful, that our word toward you is not yes and no; for the Son of God, Christ Jesus, Who was preached among you through us, through me and Sylvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84409" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="HBnt4SwtmItWiwiqI0PmS5SoF6HanOgY9GVFmvNqTfj2hxGvMiNVng7WQlZnI5E96"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84410" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> Paul continues, “For whatever promises of God there are, in Him is the Yes; wherefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us. But He Who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.” Christ is God’s anointed One, and Paul was firmly attached to this One. This One is the unchanging Christ of the faithful God. As a person who lived Christ, Paul was one with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God. If we would live Christ, we must also keep ourselves one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWiJNj35GMVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9"> Paul could say of himself, “I am a person who is always one with Christ. Christ is not yes and no, but in Him is yes. If you say yes and no, you are not living Christ. In Christ is the yes. Whenever He says yes, it is yes forever. With Him there is no change. I am one with this unchanging Christ. When I resolved to come to visit you, I resolved with Him. I did not do this in myself or by myself. In oneness with Christ, I made a strong decision to come to you. He is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="147" id="147">[147]</span> anointed One, and I am firmly attached to Him.” This also is part of the pattern of living Christ for the church. </p>

Paul is not a pattern of living a certain culture; he is a pattern of living Christ for the church. When we speak of living Christ for the church, we need to know who Christ is and also what the church is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWiJJj2t6MVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9">CRUCIAL QUESTIONS</h2><p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcVuL6lFRrUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> Who is Christ? Christ is God processed to be the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This expression, brief and accurate, is an explanation of Christ that is according to both the New Testament revelation and our spiritual experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQteUVv5WrzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> For what purpose should we live Christ? Should we live Christ for evangelism? For spirituality? We must live Christ for the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weYUb08p_AY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx"> Since we need to live Christ for the church, we need to answer an important question: What is the church? First, the church is the assembly of the called-out ones. Second, the church is the organic Body of Christ. Furthermore, the church is the fullness of Christ and also of God, the new man, the habitation of God, and the bride. This is the sequence followed by Paul in the book of Ephesians. Furthermore, according to the book of Revelation, the church is the lampstand. Ultimately in the Bible the church is called the bride. Therefore, if we would know what the church is, we must see that the church is the called assembly, the organic Body of Christ, the fullness of <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> Christ and of God, the new man, the habitation of God, the lampstand, and the bride. </p>

In particular, what is revealed in the New Testament? Many Christian teachers would say that the New Testament is a revelation of Christ. Perhaps those with a more thorough understanding would say that it speaks concerning Christ and the church. I would say that the best answer to the question regarding what is revealed in the New Testament is that it reveals Christ with the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ3NbM-qkH014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB">THE MEAT OF THE WORD</h2><p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_od1Na3ZHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> We need to know Christ not merely in a superficial way, but in a deep, profound, and mysterious way. Some believers would say that Christ is God incarnated to be a man named Jesus. This Jesus, a man from Nazareth, eventually was crucified and resurrected. This, of course, is true; it is according to the Bible. We believe all this concerning Christ, for the Bible tells us these things. However, the Bible also reveals deeper matters related to Christ. The Bible shows us not only things that can be compared to “feathers” and “skin”; it also reveals things that can be compared to “meat.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExH9bzfrLLpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF"> Many kinds of living things have either skin or feathers. Even garlic has some very thin layers of skin. Before you eat garlic, you first need to peel off the skin. Chickens and other kinds of birds have feathers. When we eat chicken, we pay attention to the meat, not to the feathers. There is a Chinese proverb which refers to insignificant matters as chicken feathers and garlic skins. When we say that a certain matter can be compared to chicken feathers or garlic skin, we do not mean that the matter in question is meaningless or useless. Chicken feathers may be used to stuff a pillow, and garlic skin may be used in making medicine. My purpose in using this illustration is to say that even the divine revelation in the Bible contains “skin” and “feathers,” that <span class="pg" data-page-id="151" id="151">[151]</span> is, matters that are necessary and important but are nevertheless somewhat superficial. </p>
<p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QXWfmEnVP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> We may also use as an illustration the shell of an egg. Without a shell an egg could not exist. But when we eat eggs, we do not eat the shells; rather, we eat what is inside the shell. The revelation in the Bible can be compared to an egg with its shell and contents. Many Christians devote their attention to the “shell.” Using the illustration of the chicken feathers and the garlic skins, we may say that these same Christians concentrate on the “feathers” and “skins” found in the Bible. The shells, the skins, and the feathers all refer to matters that are true and important. Nevertheless, as we shall seek to make clear, they are not the “meat” of the divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnGk62fIKdTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> During the period known as the Dark Ages, from approximately the sixth century to the sixteenth, the Bible was locked away, and even the skins and the feathers were lost. In the Reformation the Bible was opened to a certain extent, and the revelation of the divine Word was somewhat recovered. During the Reformation the skins and the feathers were recovered; however, the depths of the Word were not opened very much. </p>

Regarding division, some of the Brethren teachers said something like this: “In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84416" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span> Paul rebukes those who say that they are of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, and of Christ. Why, then, do you take such names as Lutheran, Baptist, Presbyterian, or Wesleyan? To say that you are a Lutheran means that you are of Luther. Does not Paul’s word apply to the matter of assuming denominational names? This practice must be rebuked.” This is sound, fundamental teaching. Nevertheless, this teaching is skins and feathers. It is not the meat of the Word. <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0fE2yDQRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> If we would learn to eat in a healthy way, we should not eat the feathers and the skins. Instead, we should eat the meat. When I eat chicken, I eat only the meat, not the feathers, the skin, or the bone. In the same principle, when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84417" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Corinthians 1</span>, we should pay attention not merely to the feathers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84418" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:12">verse 12</span>, but to the meat in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84419" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">verse 9</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpAewPcZ_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> Does 1 Corinthians primarily reveal the matter of division? No, the basic revelation here concerns the fellowship of God’s Son. Furthermore, this chapter teaches that Christ, the crucified One, is God’s wisdom and power to us. This Christ is now our daily righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. This is the basic revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84420" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapter one</span> of 1 Corinthians. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbG3fQdI_5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> If we would eat the meat of a chicken, we need to pluck out the feathers and peel off the skin. In like manner, if we would find the meat in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84421" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Corinthians 1</span>, we must go deeper than the feathers and the skin in this chapter. Then we shall see past the divisions and the divisive spirit and see that Christ, the Son of God, is our portion and that He, God’s wisdom and power, may be enjoyed as our daily righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We all need to see Christ in this way and partake of such rich food. If we remain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84422" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:12">verse 12</span>, concentrating on the matter of division, we shall have only the feathers and the skins. We shall not enjoy the healthy meat—Christ as our portion. I can testify that when I read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84423" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Corinthians 1</span>, I do not pay attention only to the skin of divisiveness; much more, I enjoy the crucified Christ as my portion and as my righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfwLPi9zSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu"> Many Christians have not seen the meat in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84424" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">chapter one</span> of 1 Corinthians. Some see only the feathers; others, going somewhat deeper, see the skin. But when I tell the believers that they must go beyond the skin and the feathers and touch the meat, some are offended and even oppose me. They are like my grandchildren who complain when I tell them to eat the meat of the chicken and not to eat the skin. In my ministry I am doing my best to show the Lord’s people the meat that lies beneath the feathers and the skin. <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84442" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:14">2:14</span> Paul says, “But thanks be to God, Who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place.” In this verse Paul uses two metaphors: captives in a triumphal procession and incense-bearers scattering incense in such a procession. As incense-bearers, the apostles scatter the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphal ministry as in a triumphal procession. The apostles are such incense-bearers in the ministry of Christ and captives in the train of His triumph as well. Paul was attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led to scatter the incense of Christ. We also need to experience all these matters so that we may scatter the incense of Christ. </p>

In these five verses there are a number of marvelous truths. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84445" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21-22">1:21 and 22</span>, we must be firmly attached to Christ, we must be anointed by God, and we must be sealed with the Spirit.

All <span class="pg" data-page-id="158" id="158">[158]</span> this is that we may scatter the incense of our Savior, the incense of the One whom we love to the uttermost. In my ministry I am not merely a teacher or a preacher—I am one scattering the incense of my Lord. I am beside myself with love for Him, and I desire to scatter His incense. Every one in the Lord’s recovery must be a person scattering the incense of Christ. Wherever we go we should scatter this incense. </p>
<p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkhknXghzkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> Some have wondered why a number of Christians in this country have been willing to receive my ministry. The reason is that I am scattering the incense of Christ. This is my unique occupation, my unique profession. My major in the heavenly university was scattering the incense of Christ. I expect that in the years to come many among us, especially the young people, will rise up to scatter Christ’s incense. Young people, your aspiration should be to scatter the incense of Christ. Regarding this, you need to say, “By the Lord’s grace, I shall become one who scatters the incense of Christ wherever I go.” </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceSWKs6ogfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> I believe that in the next ten years many of today’s young people will become those who scatter the incense of Christ. I believe there will still be time for the young people to grow up and be used by the Lord. Because of the immaturity of Christians, the bride is not yet ready for the Lord’s coming. The Lord will not come for the bride until she is mature and ready for Him. Until the bride is prepared, the Lord will continue to execute God’s government and carry on His heavenly ministry to hasten the process of our maturing. We cannot mature overnight. Anything of life needs time to grow. It is possible to make hundreds of artificial flowers in a day, but genuine flowers need time to grow. I believe that during the time required for the bride to grow and mature, many young people will scatter the incense of Christ. In the years to come, the Lord may lead certain ones to different places. Wherever we may go, we should scatter the incense. </p>

Rather, he says that the apostles were attached with all the other believers. The Greek word rendered “with” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84448" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21">verse 21</span> means together with. Together with the rest of the believers, the apostles have been attached to Christ, the anointed One. This proves that Paul was not individualistic. Even though he was the greatest apostle, he still needed all the other believers. It was with the believers in Corinth that he was attached to Christ. Hence, he was attached to Him corporately, not individualistically. </p>
<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVz5bf4Z2Dyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> The One to whom we have been attached is Christ, God’s anointed One. The Bible reveals that all the ointment of God has been poured out upon God’s anointed One. Apart from Him, there is no ointment, no anointing. When the anointing was poured upon Christ, the process of anointing was completed. There is no ointment other than that which is on Christ, the anointed One. God does not do any more anointing. What He does concerning us today is to attach us together to this anointed One. Because we have been attached to Him, we are attached to the anointing. For this reason, the anointing follows the attaching. God has attached us, and He has also anointed us. After we are attached, we are anointed spontaneously. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3estxdCsiBS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> Do you know what it means to be anointed by God? It means that we are put into all the riches of the Triune God. The riches of the Triune God are now the ointment, and the ointment has been poured out upon Christ. When we are attached to Christ, we are under the anointing. In this way, we are anointed. We are put into the practical enjoyment of all the riches of the Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="160" id="160">[160]</span> </p>

The anointing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84450" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21">verse 21</span> is the sealing. Since God has anointed us in Christ, He has also sealed us in Him. This seal is a mark placed upon us by God. This mark can be compared to a person’s signature. Whenever I purchase a new book, I immediately write my name in it. Every book belonging to me bears my signature. Writing my signature in a book illustrates what it means to be sealed by God. If we would live Christ, we must be attached to Him and enjoy the anointing. Then this anointing will become a seal indicating that we are possessed by the Lord. Now that we have been anointed and sealed, we no longer belong to Satan or the world. We do not even belong to ourselves. We belong to the Lord, to Christ, God’s anointed One. Hallelujah, we are His! </p>
<p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcVu36nRZrUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> In order to live Christ, we must first have Christ. The same is true in principle with spending money. Spending money requires that we have money to spend. If we are in debt and have no money in our account, then we do not have any money to spend. Likewise, if we do not have Christ, we cannot possibly live Him. But because we have been attached to the anointed One, anointed with the riches of the Triune God, and also sealed, we have the spiritual wealth required to write “checks” and draw on the riches from our spiritual bank account. We can live Christ because we have Christ, and we have Christ because we have been attached, anointed, and sealed. Paul, the pattern of a person who lives Christ for the church, was attached, anointed, and sealed. Such a one has an abundance of riches to use for the church. </p>

<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCOCjvnvwbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> In the book of 2 Corinthians, a very deep book, Paul presents himself as a pattern of living Christ for the church. In this Epistle Paul presents us his living, the way he lives. Paul’s life is a pattern for all Christians. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hMyExre1zbM0fe_x-GmaBEs6q87iO-T9fRBbk5hqy5h3nbIoZkpmSlQGlIoMTxNS"> When I was a young Christian, I heard again and again that Christ is our example and that we should imitate Him. I was also taught that the Apostle Paul is an example for us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84454" data-verses="1Timothy 1:15-16">1 Timothy 1:15 and 16</span> Paul says that he was the greatest sinner, the chief of sinners, but he received mercy in order to become an example, a pattern, for the believers. However, I never heard that in 2 Corinthians Paul presents himself as a pattern of living Christ for the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weYUj0-9XAY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx"> Paul is a pattern not only of living Christ, but of living Christ for the church. As God’s new creation, we are destined to live Christ. Furthermore, we are to live Christ not merely for salvation, spirituality, power, or evangelical work, but for the church. To live Christ for the church is the destiny God has appointed to His new creation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3x4y4bH-jSB8_0__dQRX-nn-7_QC7aefq9bsx1pIiw83hJtljo8fD-KpeOzqVxFkY">JUSTIFICATION UNTO LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEtWEReYtVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> The matter of living Christ for the church is something that has been lost and that needs to be recovered. At the time of the Reformation, Martin Luther recovered justification by faith. By God’s grace, Luther was willing to risk his life for <span class="pg" data-page-id="166" id="166">[166]</span> the recovery of justification by faith. Justification by faith in an objective way can be compared to the skin of a chicken; it is not the meat. According to Romans and Galatians, justification by faith must have a result. These books reveal that justification by faith is unto life. This means that justification is with a view to life. It should not stand by itself; rather, it must result in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfgmL-TbZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> Kaspar Schwenckfeld saw that justification must result in life. He may be regarded as one who touched not only the “skin” of the revelation in the Bible, but also began to see the “meat” under the skin. One day I was very surprised to learn that Schwenckfeld used some of the expressions we use today to speak of life. He even spoke of the life-giving Spirit. My point in referring to Luther and Schwenckfeld is to say that the Lord wants to recover not only the skin, that is, certain fundamental doctrines; He also wants to recover the meat under the skin of the Word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0f82yzYRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss">CHRIST AS OUR NOURISHING PORTION</h2><p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpAmwPsR_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> In message seventeen of this Life-study I pointed out that the truths of the Bible can be compared to the feathers, skin, and meat of a chicken. In reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84455" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Corinthians 1</span>, for example, we may pay attention to the feathers and neglect the skin. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84456" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span> Paul says, “Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.” In this verse we have feathers, not meat. Readers of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84457" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Corinthians 1</span> often pay attention to the feathers in this verse; however, they neglect the meat in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84458" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">verse 9</span>. There Paul says, “God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” Many read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84459" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Corinthians 1</span> without paying adequate attention to this verse and to the meat contained in it. Others may study this verse, but without an adequate understanding of the word fellowship. They may think that to have fellowship with the Son is merely to contact the Son of God in a prayerful way. Not many believers realize that the fellowship of the Son refers to the enjoyment of the Son of God. The Son of God here is rich meat to be our portion. <span class="pg" data-page-id="167" id="167">[167]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbG3nQd4n5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> The thought of enjoying the Lord as rich, nourishing meat is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84460" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span>. In the parable of the prodigal son, the prodigal repented and came back home. The father received him and had the best robe put upon him. Some Bible teachers use this parable to teach that salvation is by grace, not by works. The son planned to tell the father to make him like one of the hired servants. The father, however, interrupted him and told the servants to put the best robe upon him. This robe signifies Christ as our righteousness. We received this robe not by our working, but by grace, the free gift, of God the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfwzPiNrSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu"> I myself preached gospel messages from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84461" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> emphasizing this point. But there is more in this parable than the robe. There is the fatted calf. The robe can be likened to the skin, and the fatted calf to the meat. For years, I preached a “robe gospel,” that is, the message that salvation is by grace. But eventually I came to see that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84462" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> also speaks of the fatted calf. The robe is outward; it is something that covers us. The fatted calf is related to something inward; it is food for nourishment. After I saw this, I began to preach the gospel in a somewhat different way, emphasizing the fatted calf as well as the robe. However, certain ones who saw only the robe and not the fatted calf, only the skin and not the meat, were not happy with this kind of gospel preaching. They did not agree with the teaching concerning the eating of the fatted calf. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2Yaul8exRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> Sometimes in my preaching from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84463" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> I said that the prodigal son repented and returned not because his clothes were dirty but because of hunger. The son came back home because he was hungry, so hungry that he was even willing to feed on the husks that were given to swine. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84464" data-verses="Luke 15:17">Luke 15:17</span> says of the prodigal, “And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!” Therefore, he resolved: “I will arise and go to my father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84465" data-verses="Luke 15:18">v. 18</span>). He did not say to himself that in his father’s house were many robes. No, he remembered that there was “bread enough and to <span class="pg" data-page-id="168" id="168">[168]</span> spare.” Instead of remaining where he was and starving to death, he decided to return home. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wqwCUisjfcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> Suppose the father had said, “Poor son, you look like a beggar. I’ll tell the servants to get the robe I have prepared for you and put it on you so that you may have a proper appearance.” If the father had provided only a robe to cover him, the son might have said, “Father, I’m hungry. You are satisfied with the robe, but I need something to eat. Please give me some food.” The father, however, did not care only for the robe. After telling the servants to bring forth the best robe, the father said, “And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84466" data-verses="Luke 15:23">v. 23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv3Hw13P6T6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> Furthermore, the elder son was jealous not because of the robe, but because of the feast. He complained to his father: “Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment; and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84467" data-verses="Luke 15:29">v. 29</span>). The elder son did not say that the prodigal son had the best robe. He was jealous because the fatted calf had been prepared for his younger brother. </p>
<p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8X6PLVSNxV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> In certain points the teaching in the Lord’s recovery is different from that common among today’s Christians. Some who care only for the robe and not for the fatted calf go so far as to say that our teaching is heretical. In the recovery we have both the robe and the fatted calf. Luther recovered the robe, but now we are also enjoying the recovery of the fatted calf. By the Lord’s mercy we are in His recovery enjoying Christ, the fatted calf, as our rich, nourishing portion. </p>

Paul’s word condemning fornication is a “feather truth.” Anyone who is ethical or moral will appreciate Paul’s word regarding this matter. In reading this chapter, some Christians pay attention to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84469" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:19">verse 19</span>, where Paul says that our body is the temple of God and that we should glorify God in our body because we have been purchased with a price. Others in reading this <span class="pg" data-page-id="169" id="169">[169]</span> chapter would pay attention to Paul’s word concerning lawsuits between brothers. Not many would recognize that the key verse in this chapter is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84470" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:15">verse 15</span>. </p>

<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEtmgRfsFVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84486" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">3:3</span> Paul says, “Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.” Here Paul speaks of a letter of Christ ministered by the apostles. Such a letter is written, inscribed, with the Spirit of the living God. All those who are co-workers and leading ones in the churches must look to the Lord for His mercy and grace in order to carry on the work of writing Christ into the saints. Instead of merely teaching doctrines to others or only teaching the Bible, we must do the unique work of writing living letters of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfQCL_33ZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA">CHRIST IN OUR EXPERIENCE</h2><p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0vY2wn4Rc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> If we would inscribe Christ into others, we must first have Christ in our experience. If we do not have Christ in an experiential way, then with what shall we write a letter of Christ? We shall, of course, have nothing with which to write. If we try to do any writing, it will be like trying to type with a typewriter that has a dry ribbon. One day I was typing and discovered that nothing was on the paper. Then I learned that the ribbon was completely dry. There was no ink on the ribbon to transfer the letters to the paper. I use this to illustrate the fact that in order to write a living letter of <span class="pg" data-page-id="176" id="176">[176]</span> Christ, we must first have the experience of Christ ourselves. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpwCwNo1_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB">HEAVENLY INK</h2><p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcVeX6nR5rUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> Living letters of Christ are written with the life-giving Spirit of the living God. The life-giving Spirit is the heavenly ink. If we would have this kind of ink, we need to experience Christ and be filled with Christ. This means that we must be thoroughly saturated with the life-giving Spirit. If we are persons full of Christ, saturated with the life-giving Spirit, we shall have the riches of Christ to use in writing Christ into others. We shall also have the life-giving Spirit of the living God as the heavenly ink. The ink is the Spirit, the essence of the ink is Christ, and we are the pen. </p>
<p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQtuIVt96rzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> Any kind of ink must have a particular essence. Ink is different from plain water. It is not possible to write a letter using only water. There must be a certain substance added to the water to make ink. Praise the Lord, the heavenly ink is the Spirit, and the essence of this Spirit-ink is Christ with all His riches. To have this ink in our experience, we must enjoy Christ, possess Christ, be filled with Christ, be saturated with Christ, and be covered with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QPkkgeD9ADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> Others should always find us in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84487" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">Philippians 3:9</span> Paul speaks of being found in Christ. He wanted to be found by others in Christ, not in anything other than Christ. Paul did not want to be found in himself, in his culture, or in his particular way of living. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0GHUVRGQkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> We also should aspire to be found in Christ, to be one with Christ, saturated with Christ, and even constituted of Christ and reorganized with Him. Then, being anointed with the Spirit and filled with the life-giving Spirit, we shall have the Spirit as the ink to write Christ into others. Then as we speak to others, we shall spontaneously write upon them with the life-giving Spirit of the living God. The element of the riches of Christ will be infused into them, imparted into their being. In this way, Christ will be inscribed into them. To write Christ into others in this way is truly to live Christ for the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="177" id="177">[177]</span> </p>

First, we are competent of Christ, the Son. Because we are competent of Christ, we may write living letters with the life-giving Spirit. Thus, we have the Son and the Spirit. These living letters are of the living God, that is, of the Father. Hence, in the writing of living letters, we have the experience of the Trinity in a real way. </p>
<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8Cnzyd3ZNYKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> The pure revelation of the Trinity in the Bible is very different from the tritheistic concept of the Trinity held unconsciously by some Christians today. In certain fundamental groups the believers are taught that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are separate and distinct Persons. Actually, this is tritheism, the belief that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three Gods. Of course, hardly anyone would teach explicitly that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three Gods. However, some believers hold this concept subconsciously and unconsciously. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVuEWW8mf2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK">COEXISTENCE AND COINHERENCE</h2><p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIc1TYCmxgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> Several years ago certain ones put out a written statement in which they said that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three distinct and separate Persons. In our rebuttals we pointed out that the three of the Triune God are distinct, but They are not separate. As a result, some of them are careful not to use the word separate with respect to the three of the Trinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVei6DmQ-zDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> It is heretical to teach that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are separate. According to the Bible, it is impossible to separate the Father from the Son, or the Son from the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84488" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works.” The Lord’s word here clearly indicates that the Father and the Son are inseparable. <span class="pg" data-page-id="178" id="178">[178]</span> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84489" data-verses="John 14:11">verse 11</span>, the Lord went on to say, “Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.” Here we have not only the coexistence of the Father and the Son, but also Their coinherence. The three of the Godhead—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—are both coexistent and coinherent. We all should be familiar with the terms coinhere, coinherence, and co-inherent. </p>
<p data-content-id="_4w9Ar9Vyp0N_HoNrdaOQWC9shEsus7o-4LiMpMungRtO9yGHFVltw-zoF6hLKtMB"> The Father, the Son, and the Spirit all exist at the same time. This is coexistence. Furthermore, the Father exists in the Son and the Spirit; the Son exists in the Father and the Spirit; and the Spirit exists in the Father and the Son. This is coinherence. Therefore, if we would have a proper understanding concerning the Trinity, we must recognize not only the coexistence of the Father, Son, and Spirit, but we must also believe in Their coinherence. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkhUHXiVfkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7">THE THREE-ONE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18c2wQoZc-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> We do not believe in tritheism; rather, we believe in the Triune God. The word “triune” means three-one. It is composed of two Latin roots: tri-, meaning three and -une, meaning one. Hence, triune is three-one. We are not able to understand how God can be triune, that is, three-one. This eternal, divine mathematics is beyond our ability to understand. Nevertheless, according to the divine mathematics, God is three-one. </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i-Toq51qF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> This matter of God’s being triune may be illustrated by the fact that the Bible speaks of the Spirit of God and also of the seven Spirits. Is God’s Spirit one or seven? Perhaps the best answer is to say that the Spirit of God is seven-one or one-seven. On the one hand, we all know that God’s Spirit is uniquely one. On the other hand, in the book of Revelation, where we have the ultimate and consummate revelation of the Triune God, we read of the seven Spirits. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84490" data-verses="Revelation 1:4-5">Revelation 1:4 and 5</span> say, “Grace to you and peace from Him Who is, and Who was, and Who is coming, and from the seven Spirits Who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ.” The seven Spirits here undoubtedly are the Spirit of God, for They are ranked among the Triune God in these verses, <span class="pg" data-page-id="179" id="179">[179]</span> mentioned between the Father (the One who is, who was, and who is coming) and the Son, Jesus Christ. In substance and existence, God’s Spirit is one. In the intensified function and work of God’s operation (signified by the number seven), God’s Spirit is sevenfold. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84491" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">Revelation 4:5 and 5:6</span> we also read concerning the seven Spirits. </p>

For example, a human being has an outward appearance and also an inward reality. If you know a person merely according to his outward appearance, you actually do not know him at all. In order to know a person thoroughly, you need to know him according to his inner being. This requires that you spend much time with that person to know what he is like inwardly. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNQkonHvQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84499" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:16">5:16</span> Paul says, “So that we, from now on, know no one according to flesh.” To know others according to the flesh means to know them merely according to the outward appearance. Paul’s desire was to know others according to the spirit, that is, according to the inner reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAdqmsM5Ey_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> This was also the way Paul knew Christ: “Even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer.” This means that Paul knew Christ no longer according to the outward appearance, but according to the inward spirit. This principle applies also in our study of the Bible. If we would know the Bible, we must know not only the outward form of the Word, but also the inward reality. <span class="pg" data-page-id="184" id="184">[184]</span> </p>

It is not even part of the skin in the Word. Many of the sermons given in today’s Christian circles are either in the category of feathers or in the category of skin. Few messages given among Christians take the listeners deeper than the skin and help them touch the genuine meat of the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8XKvLVStxV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> Prior to World War II, books were still being published that contained some weighty messages dealing with the meat of the Word. But in recent years it has been extremely difficult to find newly published books of this kind. Throughout the years, I have been observing the situation among Christians. I have been especially interested to see what kind of books and articles have been published concerning spiritual matters. According to my observation, since 1945 few books touching the meat of the Bible have been published. If others know of more books, I would appreciate knowing the titles and the authors. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84500" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> Paul speaks of the shining of the glory of the new covenant. This is part of the meat of the Word; it is not feathers or skin. </p>

In answer to this question, some may say that the shining of the glory of the new covenant is the Spirit. Others may reply that it is resurrection, or Christ in resurrection. It is surely true to say that the glory of the new covenant is the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84501" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">Second Corinthians 3:18</span> says, “And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” In this verse the preposition “from” is used twice. The first time is in the phrase “from glory to glory”; the second, in the phrase “from the Lord Spirit.” There is a connection between “from glory to glory” and “from the Lord Spirit.” This connection is made apparent by Paul’s use of the words “even as.” This indicates that the matter of being <span class="pg" data-page-id="185" id="185">[185]</span> from glory to glory is a matter that is from the Spirit. This gives us the basis to say that glory is intimately related to the Spirit. In fact, in this verse the glory is equal to the Lord Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNQkolTXQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84502" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span> Paul says that we are being transformed into the same image. When we with unveiled face behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. As a result, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence, transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84503" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>), into His image. Being transformed indicates that we are in the process of transformation. The phrase “from glory to glory” means from one degree of glory to another degree. This points to a continuing process in life in resurrection. Furthermore, the phrase “from the Lord Spirit” indicates that the process is proceeding from the Spirit. </p>

This verse speaks of God. The word God in Hebrew is Elohim. But in the last chapter of the Bible, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84505" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>, we have another divine title. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84506" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> says, “The Spirit and the bride say, Come!” Here we do not have God, Elohim; we have the Spirit. Furthermore, the Spirit and the bride speak together. How can this be, since the Spirit is divine and the bride is not? There is not this kind of utterance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84507" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. There is no verse which says, “In the beginning God and the angels created the heavens and the earth.” On the contrary, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84508" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> speaks only of God; it does not say “God and....” But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84509" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> speaks concerning the Spirit and the bride. </p>
<p data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MMo3iqo2oCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj"> We need to notice two important aspects of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84510" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>. First, as we have seen, the Spirit is mentioned with the bride; that is, the Spirit is mentioned with something additional. Second, this verse is not a demand; instead, it contains a promise related to the water of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="186" id="186">[186]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9iB0b0gkGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> When a young brother gets married, he is no longer single, no longer a bachelor, for he gains a wife as an addition. Now instead of a single person, there is a couple. Before he is married, whatever a young brother says, he says by himself alone. But after he gets married, it is possible for him and his wife to speak as one. Then it can be written concerning this couple, “He and his wife say....” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8bVVek8o6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr">A UNIVERSAL COUPLE</h2><p data-content-id="wNe845Y8ijQ5dKg6d7KErQ-XLlzu45pbRdrcIeLY12hM0LmqbZ_Oxp9c_fGFhtXWL"> The principle is the same in the Bible regarding the Spirit and the bride. The entire Bible tells us of a universal romance, the romance of a universal couple. This couple consists of God as the Husband and His chosen people as the bride. Therefore, at the end of the Bible we have the revelation of this universal couple. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQqlRcKCaH1qNoR9pCwjeaEM_YJjhABbeuYqFq3E4jtib6znl17X3ZC_aTXbYtnrJ"> When the Lord Jesus came, John the Baptist spoke of Him as the Lamb of God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84511" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>, John declared when he saw the Lord Jesus coming to him, “Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!” According to the third chapter of the Gospel of John, John the Baptist later spoke of the Lord Jesus as the Bridegroom. Some of John’s disciples were jealous because of the fact that so many were coming to the Lord Jesus and following Him. They said to John, “Rabbi, He Who was with you across the Jordan, of Whom you testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84512" data-verses="John 3:26">John 3:26</span>). As part of his reply, John said, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84513" data-verses="John 3:29">v. 29</span>). By this we see that the Lord Jesus is not only the Lamb of God, but He is also the Bridegroom who deserves to have the bride. </p>
<p data-content-id="muHafN-ILtAYeBa5rCiGrZeAqj5x_pHm3PgjspKqEwJyH9-WaG0rXZzKN8RdvDILu"> The concept of a universal couple is found not only in the New Testament, but in the Old Testament as well. Even in the Old Testament we see that God desires to have a married life with His chosen people. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84514" data-verses="Isaiah 54:5">Isaiah 54:5</span> says, “For thy Maker is thine husband: The Lord of hosts is his name.” God loves His people as a bridegroom loves his <span class="pg" data-page-id="187" id="187">[187]</span> bride. Thus, God’s desire is to marry His people, to have them as His addition. </p>

He does not say that the old covenant ministry had glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="FXS_xlsr3gzjoDc53zkOKTBo0Wu8y0MncqU631UGX0PDpj4qrLlX-GYZybGMhOX53"> The proper translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84539" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> should be this: “For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.” The ministry of death came in glory but it did not have glory. We may use the matter of riding in a car as an illustration. Although you may not have a car, you may come to the meeting in a car belonging to someone else. The fact that you came in a car does not mean that the car belongs to you. Hence, to have a car is one thing, and to come in a car is another thing. In the same principle, having glory is very different from coming in glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIc1bYCmRgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84540" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> Paul says that the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory. There is a great difference between the two predicates came and abounds. Once again <span class="pg" data-page-id="194" id="194">[194]</span> using the illustration of riding in a car, we may say that one person comes in a car, whereas another may own several cars, that is, he abounds with cars.

<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVeiyDmQezDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> What was the glory with which the old covenant came?

That glory was the light which was shining temporarily on the face of Moses. The glory in which the old covenant came was a temporary glory. It perhaps did not last even a day. The shining on Moses’ face lasted for only a short time. </p>

What is the glory which the new covenant has and with which it abounds? Basically, in the Bible glory signifies the expression of God. Whenever God is expressed, that is glory. The expression of God is God glorified. Therefore, to say that God is glorified simply means that He is expressed. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18c24QopE-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was God incarnate. He did not come as God expressed; He came as God concealed. God was concealed within the physical body of the Lord Jesus. Inwardly there was God; outwardly there was the flesh. With this flesh there was no glory. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84542" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span>, when the Lord Jesus was about to die, He prayed, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84543" data-verses="John 17:1">v. 1</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84544" data-verses="John 17:5">John 17:5</span> the Lord went on to say, “And now, glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.” In His prayer the Lord seemed to be saying, “Father, now is the time for You to glorify Your Son. Father, let Your Son glorify You. The disciples have not yet fully seen what Your Son is and what You are in Me. Father, You are concealed, and I am hidden. For this reason I pray that You will glorify Your Son so that Your Son may glorify You.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="195" id="195">[195]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i-Tgq5FyF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> We may use the blossoming of a carnation flower as an illustration of what it means for the Lord Jesus to be glorified. A carnation seed does not have any glory. After a carnation seed is sown into the earth, the seed dies and then it begins to grow up. It sprouts, it grows into a plant, and eventually it blossoms. This blossoming is the glorification of the carnation seed. Because a carnation seed dies when it is sown into the soil, we may say that its blossoming is its resurrection. Glorification, therefore, is equal to resurrection. The sprouting of the carnation seed is the beginning, the initial, stage of resurrection. The further growth of the carnation plant is the continuation of the process of resurrection. But the blossoming of the carnation flower is resurrection in its fullness. </p>
<p data-content-id="dChzg2DUKpIBDLedcWn1ydFKoiHfeFV0KBgKJsET5ldzIRhtliB64uqos5WWmePIs"> When the Lord Jesus prayed that the Father would glorify Him, He actually prayed that He would enter into glory through death and resurrection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84545" data-verses="Luke 24:26">Luke 24:26</span> the Lord Jesus asked the two disciples on the way to Emmaus: “Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?” When the Lord Jesus spoke these words, He was already in resurrection. Thus, for Him to enter into His glory was for Him to be in resurrection. This verse reveals clearly that Christ’s glorification was His resurrection. The Lord’s resurrection was His blossoming. Christ’s blossoming, His glorification, refers to His resurrection in its fullness. </p>

The glory of the new covenant is actually the resurrection of Christ in fullness. In other words, the resurrected Christ is Himself the glory of the new covenant. Furthermore, this Christ in resurrection, or the resurrected Christ, is the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, the glory of the new covenant as the resurrected Christ, or the resurrection of Christ, is the Spirit. Now we have the proper understanding of the glory of the new covenant.

It is the glory of the Lord as the resurrected and ascended One, the One who is both God and man. This One passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, entered into resurrection, having accomplished full redemption, and became a life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, the resurrected Christ dwells in us to make Himself and all He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us so that we may be one with Him and may be transformed into His image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit. This is the glory of the new covenant. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwFeXQhT-qezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq">ASPECTS OF THE PATTERN</h2><p data-content-id="uKAggo26VcYIYatm2wE1X7mlIjGB46_tKYo2AVrNKUS9ib9fxDxuiAAHQDKQU_Qdp"> In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that Paul is a pattern of living Christ for the church. In 2 Corinthians this pattern is revealed in a number of aspects. We have already covered four of these aspects. First, a person who lives Christ for the church does not trust in himself, but trusts in God who raises the dead. Paul refers to this aspect in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84551" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:9">1:9</span>: “But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God, Who raises the dead.” Related to this aspect are the matters of conducting ourselves not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God and of being one with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84552" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">1:12</span> Paul says, “For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84553" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:18">1:18</span> Paul declares that God is faithful; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84554" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:19">verse 19</span>, that in Christ is yes; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84555" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:20">verse 20</span>, that “whatever promises of God there are, in Him is the Yes.” Therefore, we speak of the unchanging Christ of the faithful God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVzJ3f6NODyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> The second aspect involves being attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led to scatter the incense of Christ. Paul speaks concerning these matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84556" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21-22">1:21 and 22</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84557" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:14-16">2:14-16</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3estBxCum9S_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84558" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3-6">3:3-6</span> Paul comes to the third aspect of the pattern of living Christ for the church. This aspect is that we are competent of Christ as the spiritual alphabet to write living letters with the life-giving Spirit of the living God. The fourth aspect of this pattern is that of shining the glory of the new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84559" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7-11">3:7-11</span>), and the fifth aspect, which we shall consider in this message and in the message following, is that of being transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory as from the Lord Spirit by beholding and reflecting His glory with unveiled face. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9iB8b0gEGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> I appreciate all these aspects of Paul as a pattern of living Christ for the church. Paul and the other apostles lived a life in which they had no confidence in themselves. Rather, their confidence was altogether in the God of resurrection. They did not conduct themselves in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God. They were also one with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God; that is, they were one with the Christ who is the Yes. Furthermore, they were attached to God’s anointed One, and they were anointed by God and sealed. As those attached to the anointed One, they were also captured, subdued, and led by God to celebrate Christ’s victory. As captives marching in Christ’s triumphal procession, they scattered the incense of Christ wherever they went. Actually the apostles’ journey of ministry was not an ordinary journey; it was a triumphal procession celebrating Christ’s victory in the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8bVdek8I6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr"> Paul and his co-workers were also competent of Christ as the heavenly alphabet to write living letters of Christ, with Christ, and for Christ. The “ink” used in writing these letters was the life-giving Spirit of the living God. The apostles inscribed Christ into the saints and in this way wrote living letters with the Spirit as the ink. As a result, the saints became living letters of Christ for others to read. <span class="pg" data-page-id="201" id="201">[201]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="wNe845Y8ijQ5dKg6d7KErQ-XLlzu45pbRdrUIe7Q12hM0LmqbZ_Oxp9c_fGFhtXWL"> Furthermore, Paul and his co-workers were shining forth the glorified, resurrected Christ. In their lives the blossoming Christ, the Christ in resurrection, could be seen. They were shining forth the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit. With them there was such a shining, such a glory. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LQqlRcKCaH1qNoR9pCwjeaEM_YJjhABbeuYiFqHM4jtib6znl17X3ZC_aTXbYtnrJ">DAILY TRANSFORMATION</h2><p data-content-id="muHafN-ILtAYeBa5rCiGrZeAqj5x_pHm3Pgrsp6yEwJyH9-WaG0rXZzKN8RdvDILu"> Daily and even hourly, they were also in the process of being transformed into the same image, the image of the glorified Christ. “And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84560" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span>). This transformation did not happen once for all; it was a gradual matter. The apostles were transformed from one degree of glory to another. They were transformed from glory to glory, as from the Lord Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZqAjSO9LixKc_F2NRK9fXc76Cf3n_v9KDThpD08VKKBOTnM6X34wk61RvjbLDfwsH"> It is possible to understand the word rendered “even as” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84561" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span> to mean “that is.” Hence, the apostles were being transformed from glory to glory, that is, from the Lord Spirit. They were being transformed into the image of the Lord from the Lord Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="AE9CEdRlVZ0DfzvVD9YH94VL_i-X9J56-zWldKH8zjh81ESQHHyJQoNdtgNJws_Lr"> According to the book of 2 Corinthians, the pattern of living Christ for the church includes the aspect of daily transformation. Anyone who lives Christ for the church must be one who is daily being transformed. If we are not in the process of transformation, then something is wrong with us in our Christian life. Day by day we need to be transformed. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FXS_xlsr3gzjoDc53zkOKTBo0Wu8y0MncqU-33QyX0PDpj4qrLlX-GYZybGMhOX53">A METABOLIC PROCESS</h2><p data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwkHFn_zsujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG"> The word transformed is a good word; however, it does not convey the full meaning of the Greek word. Instead of transformed, some versions of the Bible use the word “changed.” This word is very inadequate; it is a poor equivalent of the Greek word. The King James Version renders this Greek word transformed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84562" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span>, but translates it as changed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84563" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42RqVk3uyWYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4"> We need to know the difference between change and transformation. Transformation involves the process of metabolism. <span class="pg" data-page-id="202" id="202">[202]</span> However, something may change without being affected metabolically. Many things may change in an outward way without any inward metabolic transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="-fHkLKWj9SQ91tLa1G364G4pOcTRoaCMvHODZ1OLM3u8vtBx03384wRIRHSxo1kdf"> In the process of metabolism a new element is supplied to an organism. This new element replaces the old element and causes it to be discharged. Therefore, as the process of metabolism takes place within a living organism, something new is created within it to replace the old element, which is carried away. Metabolism, therefore, includes three matters: first, the supplying of a new element; second, the replacing of the old element with this new element; and third, the discharge or the removal of the old element so that something new may be produced. </p>
<p data-content-id="pbBnT8P58uzq4V0jIiQ68lujBXFx65nhPRLYuWNLsZuuDDkZCUidRP80lkw5FcmBk"> The digestion and assimilation of the food we eat involves metabolism. First, we take the food into our stomach. Then the food is digested metabolically to supply our being so that new elements may be added to replace the old and that new cells may be brought into being. Through this process of metabolism we grow and are strengthened. Also through proper metabolism we may be healed of certain illnesses. Constantly a healing is taking place in our physical bodies through the process of metabolism. This healing is not caused by medicine given by a physician; it is the healing that is caused by the proper functioning of the body itself. Daily by the process of metabolism we can experience healing. </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceSmms6YofDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> I wish to emphasize the fact that transformation is a metabolic process, a metabolic change. We may define transformation as spiritual metabolism. Concerning this, I appreciate Paul’s care in choosing words. Paul, a marvelous writer, is always precise in his choice of words. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84564" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span> he deliberately chose a Greek word which is best translated by the English word transformed. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TMy0bCBYZ3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4">THE GLORY OF THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwFeXQgXGqezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> We have pointed out that transformation involves metabolism and that metabolism includes the supplying of new elements to replace what is old. Now we must ask what in <span class="pg" data-page-id="203" id="203">[203]</span> Paul’s concept is the new element supplied to us as we undergo transformation. According to Paul’s understanding, this new element is the glory of the Lord. The glory of the Lord is actually the resurrected Christ. We have seen that the glory of the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84565" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span> is the glory of the Lord Jesus as the resurrected and ascended One, the One who is both God and man and who has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit. How rich is this resurrected Christ! The resurrected Christ with all His riches is the new element added to us for our transformation. This element, the resurrected Christ with His riches, is the glory of the Lord. This is not simply the meat of the Word; it is a choice portion of the meat. </p>

<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0zimEjN8h_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84573" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span> Paul says, “And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” We have seen that, as a pattern of a person who lives Christ for the church, Paul was daily experiencing transformation. Transformation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84574" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span>, a metabolic change, is from glory to glory, that is, from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit. We covered these matters in the previous message. In this message we shall consider how to be transformed from glory to glory. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2sylSjaNzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON">BEHOLDING AND REFLECTING</h2><p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8Cnzid1N9YKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> As the title of this message indicates, we are transformed by beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord. We are transformed not only by seeing the Lord, but also by reflecting Him. A mirror has the capacity both to behold an object and to reflect it. The English words “beholding and reflecting as a mirror” are the translation of a single word in Greek. The use of this word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84575" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span> is metaphorical. On the one hand, a mirror beholds a person or an object. On the other hand, a mirror reflects what it beholds. These are the two aspects of the function of a mirror. Whenever you stand <span class="pg" data-page-id="210" id="210">[210]</span> before a mirror, that mirror beholds you and also reflects you. Because the mirror functions in these two aspects, you can see yourself in it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVuEGW-ir2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK">OUR NEED TO BE UNVEILED</h2><p data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSxnHWOE7P6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk"> In our experience we all should be mirrors looking at the Lord and reflecting Him. However, if we would be mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, we must not have any veils over us. Suppose a mirror is proper in every way. It is in the right position with respect to the object it is to behold and reflect. But the mirror is covered with a veil. As long as a mirror is covered with cloth, veiled, it loses its function. The veil keeps the mirror both from beholding and from reflecting. Likewise, if we are veiled, we cannot behold and reflect the Lord’s glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDHYHlpB5yIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> If, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, all the veils are removed, we shall be mirrors beholding and reflecting Him with unveiled face. As a mirror, are you veiled or unveiled? If you are veiled, you may call on the name of the Lord and still not behold Him. If we would behold and reflect the Lord, all the veils must be removed. Every one of us needs to be fully unveiled. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCOyXvmbQbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ">VEILED BY RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS</h2><p data-content-id="4hMyExre1zbM0fe_x-GmaBEs6q87iO-T9fh1bldFqy5h3nbIoZkpmSlQGlIoMTxNS"> Many Christians cannot behold and reflect the Lord because they are covered by a thick veil or perhaps several layers of veils. Consider how many people there are in today’s Catholicism, and how many have been veiled by the influence of Catholicism. Suppose there were no such thing as Catholicism and all those in Catholicism were unbelievers who did not know anything about God. How much easier it would be to preach the gospel to them and bring them to the Lord! Many would be quick to receive and understand spiritual things. However, if you try to speak to those in Catholicism concerning God’s New Testament economy, you will discover that the majority are veiled. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for them to see the things of Christ in a genuine way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="211" id="211">[211]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weYkX08pvAY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx"> A particular brother in the Lord’s recovery was raised a Catholic. As a child he even served as an altar boy. But when he was in high school, he received the Lord Jesus into him and was genuinely saved. Happy and very excited, he told others of his experience with the Lord. He said, “Now I have the Lord Jesus!” But one of his relatives pointed to an image of Jesus on the wall and replied that they already had Jesus. To be sure, that person was covered by a thick veil! I use this as an illustration of the fact that religion has caused a great number of people to be veiled. These veils keep them from seeing the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="3x4y4bH-jSB8_0__dQRX-nn-7_QC7aefq9rYx3t0iw83hJtljo8fD-KpeOzqVxFkY"> Those without a religious background often find it easier to enter into the truths of the New Testament than those who were raised in either Catholicism or Protestantism. Nevertheless, even those without a religious background may still be under the influence of religion. Even before certain ones became Christians, they had some concept concerning the way people worship God. They may already have the thought that in a Christian service of worship there is a pastor who does certain things and that the congregation will pray or sing in a certain way. Even those who are not Christians are affected or influenced by religious concepts. These concepts can be veils. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GBLvlFuZpxpOzPlHECwzEvBrtGtiuqGT341XcvZbsVtjWxkMb27nu2FPxyYbaMXgd">VEILED BY NATURAL CONCEPTS</h2><p data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ39XM-q0H014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB"> In addition to the religious concepts that veil people, every person is veiled by certain natural concepts or ideas. Often these veils are related to the kind of people we are by our natural constitution. If you are a quiet person, you may prefer to worship God in a cathedral that has a high ceiling and stained glass windows and is dimly lit. Upon entering such a building, you immediately act in a reverent way. The atmosphere spontaneously causes you to be quiet and solemn. You want to be silent and not even speak to the person next to you. Because you were born a quiet person, you appreciate a quiet atmosphere in a cathedral. If this kind of person attends a church meeting in which the saints are praising the Lord, he would be very bothered and wonder <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> how anyone could worship God in this way. He would not be able to appreciate anything of value in the meeting. On the contrary, he would feel that he could not worship God in such a place. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_ot5Na3pHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> Paul’s word about beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face was written with his background in Judaism in mind. Paul knew from his experience that the Jews were veiled by their religion. Paul himself had once been veiled in this way. In particular, many Jews were veiled by their concept concerning the law, especially circumcision. Because Paul taught that the law was over and that circumcision was no longer necessary, many Jews were not willing to listen to him. Their doctrine regarding the law and circumcision was a veil that kept them from seeing the Christ preached by Paul. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExHNXzfr7LpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF">VEILED BY OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER</h2><p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QXmTmEXNP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> In addition to religious veils and the veils of our natural concepts, we are also veiled by our racial and national character. For example, the Japanese character may prefer one thing, whereas the German character may prefer something absolutely different. Differences of national character can make it difficult for believers from different countries to worship together. The various national characters, dispositions, habits, and customs are veils that keep us from beholding and reflecting the Lord. Those who are veiled by their racial, national, or cultural characteristics are not able to receive the Christ ministered by one of a different race, nationality, or culture. They may hear a word concerning the glorious, resurrected, blossoming Christ, but it does not penetrate them. Because they are veiled, they cannot see anything of such a wonderful Christ. The light of the truth cannot shine into them. Those who are veiled in this way can be compared to cameras that have a cover over the lens. When the lens of a camera is covered, no light can come in, and no image can be impressed on the film. </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnGU22f4SdTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> We should not assume that we do not have any veils. Instead of taking it for granted that we are fully unveiled, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="213" id="213">[213]</span> need to look to the Lord and pray for mercy that all the veils will be taken away that we may behold and reflect the Lord. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEtmwReolVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN">VEILED BY OUR CONCEPT OF HOW TO MEET</h2><p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfQSL-jTZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> Some who have been in the church life in the Lord’s recovery for many years may be veiled by their concept of what is the best way to meet. Suppose someone who has been in the church life in the Far East moves to the United States and says, “The churches in the United States meet in a way very different from the way we met in the Far East. I cannot tolerate this way of meeting. The way we practiced before was certainly the best.” This also is a veil keeping us from seeing the light of the truth. </p>

<p data-content-id="dChzg2DUKpIBDLedcWn1ydFKoiHfeFV0KBgWJtwj5ldzIRhtliB64uqos5WWmePIs"> The title of this message is “The Essence of the New Covenant Ministry.” The word essence is related to what Paul says concerning the glory and superiority of the ministry of the new covenant in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84580" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7-11">3:7-11</span>. These verses show the inferiority of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, the ministry of law, a ministry of condemnation and death, and the superiority of the apostolic ministry, the ministry of grace, a ministry of righteousness and the Spirit. The former was through glory temporarily; the latter remains in glory forever. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84581" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:12-17">2:12-17</span> the apostle speaks of the triumph and effect of the apostolic ministry; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84582" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>, of its function and competency; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84583" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7-11">3:7-11</span>, of its glory and superiority. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ql5Pg2ZNuykXsyEjASMH8B5GtMoTjCdfD3LxdiibnWm2lFgAKpLfM_KLzMYyqkpuP"> In previous messages we have covered a number of basic points related to the new covenant ministry: the essence, the effect, the function, the competency, the glory, and the superiority. Now in this message we need to consider the essence of the ministry of the new covenant. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSxnDWMQTP6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk">INSCRIBED WITH THE SPIRIT AS AN ESSENCE</h2><p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDHYDlrFVyIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> Some may point out that the word essence is not found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84584" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>. Although this word is not used here, the concept of essence is nonetheless implied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84585" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">verse 3</span>: “Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.” In this verse the word “ministered” actually means served. The Greek word means to serve something to someone, for <span class="pg" data-page-id="216" id="216">[216]</span> example, as a waiter serves in a restaurant or a stewardess on an airplane. Thus, Paul is saying that the Corinthian believers are a letter of Christ served by the apostles. However, realizing that the word serve is not adequate, Paul went on to use the word “inscribed.” This explains the meaning of ministered, served. Paul’s way of ministering was by inscribing. </p>
<p data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwkHdn_zMujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84586" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">3:3</span> Paul says “inscribed not <em>with</em> ink”; he does not say “inscribed not <em>by</em> ink.” The word “with” indicates that the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God, is an essence, an element, used by the one doing the inscribing or the writing. It is important that we pay careful attention to Paul’s use of the preposition “with.” This preposition indicates that the Spirit is neither the writer nor the instrument used for writing; rather, the Spirit is the essence, the element, the substance, used in writing. The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, such as a pen, but an element, the heavenly ink used in writing, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42RqNk3uSWYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4"> Let us take as an illustration the simple matter of writing a letter with a ball point pen. You may be the writer, but the pen is the instrument. The ink, however, is neither the writer nor the instrument—it is the element, the essence. But if your pen is out of ink, any writing you try to do with it will be in vain. You may write words on paper, but the paper will be blank. In such a case, there would be a writer and an instrument, but there would not be any ink as the necessary writing essence. </p>
<p data-content-id="-fHkLKWj9SQ91tLa1G364G4pOcTRoaCMvHObZ1-DM3u8vtBx03384wRIRHSxo1kdf"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84587" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span> the Holy Spirit is not the writer, the instrument, or even the power. When many Christians today talk about the Spirit, their concept is related to power. But if we read this verse carefully, considering it in its context, we shall see that the Spirit here is a matter of essence, not of power. </p>
<p data-content-id="pbBnT8P58uzq4V0jIiQ68lujBXFx65nhPRLAuW9DsZuuDDkZCUidRP80lkw5FcmBk"> Because many Christians neglect the Spirit as an essence, I purposely emphasize the word essence in this message. What Christians today consider the Spirit as an essence? For the most part, Christians think of the Spirit as <span class="pg" data-page-id="217" id="217">[217]</span> an instrument or as a power. Others go farther and speak of the Spirit as a divine person. But I do not know of any preachers who speak of the Spirit the way Paul does in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84588" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>. Paul’s view of the Spirit in this chapter was that of an essence used for inscribing letters of Christ. Here he does not view the Spirit as a person, an instrument, or a power. Rather, the Spirit is the essence used for inscribing living letters of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceSm-s6owfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> The ministry of the new covenant is not that of mere teaching. None of your teachers in school ever inscribed an essence into your being. They may have put concepts into you, but they did not deposit the essence of anything into you. However, the new covenant ministry does more than merely teach us; it inscribes us. Furthermore, this new covenant ministry inscribes us not with concepts, knowledge, or theology, but with an essence, with something real and substantial. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TMysbCxAZ3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4"> In the church life in the Lord’s recovery, do you not have the sense that you are under a spiritual inscribing? Many of us can testify that through the new covenant ministry Christ has been inscribed into us. A divine essence has been written into our being, and this essence is the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwFePQgnOqezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> However, we still need to define what this essence is. We realize we have been inscribed with the Spirit, but what is this Spirit? </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uKAggo26VcYIYatm2wE1X7mlIjGB46_tKYouAUP5KUS9ib9fxDxuiAAHQDKQU_Qdp">DEATH VERSUS THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVzJvf4ZGDyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> Now we must go on to see certain terminology related to the ministry of the new covenant. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84589" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:7">3:7</span> Paul speaks of the ministry of death, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84590" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8">verse 8</span>, of the ministry of the Spirit. Thus, in these verses we have a comparison between the ministry of death and the ministry of the Spirit. The ministry of death refers to the old covenant ministry, the Mosaic ministry. Paul was bold in speaking of the ministry of death. No wonder the Jews were offended because of him. Then Paul goes on to compare the ministry of death with the ministry of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3estBpCsixS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> Most of us would not contrast death with the Spirit, for death is always versus life. For us, the issue is a matter of life or death, death or life. But instead of using the word life <span class="pg" data-page-id="218" id="218">[218]</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84591" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8">3:8</span>, Paul speaks of the Spirit. This indicates that the Spirit here is related to life, since life is what stands in contrast to death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84592" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">3:6</span> Paul has already said that the Spirit gives life. Therefore, the Spirit here points to the Spirit who gives life and also to the life given by the Spirit. The old covenant ministry was a ministry of death; the new covenant ministry is a ministry of life embodied in the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="HBnt4SwtmItWiwiqI0PmS5SoF6HanOgY9GlJmvN6Tfj2hxGvMiNVng7WQlZnI5E96"> The essence of the Spirit inscribed into us is life. Life here is not an instrument, person, power, strength, ability, talent, or gift. If we realize that the Spirit here is of life, then we shall understand what is the nature of the essence with which we are inscribed through the new covenant ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWi5Bj35WMVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9"> Often Christians refer to the Spirit as an instrument, power, or gift. Under the influence of tradition, we also may not pay adequate attention to the Spirit as the essence inscribed into us. For this reason, I want to emphasize the fact that the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84593" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> does not denote a power or instrument—it denotes an essence. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcVeD6nhxrUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR">FROM GLORY TO GLORY</h2><p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQtucVtNyrzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> This understanding is confirmed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84594" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">verse 18</span>: “And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” Glory here is not an instrument, power, ability, or gift. Glory also is an essence. As we behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, we are being transformed with glory as an essence. In a previous message we pointed out that “from glory to glory” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84595" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">verse 18</span> means from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit, for in this verse the glory and the Spirit are synonyms. Therefore, to be transformed from glory to glory is to be transformed from the Spirit to the Spirit. </p>

The matter of the ministry or of the ministries is not simple. According to 2 Corinthians, there is just one ministry, the unique ministry. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84612" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">4:1</span> Paul says, “Therefore, having this ministry, as we have received mercy we do not lose heart.” On the one hand, here Paul says “we”; on the other hand, he speaks of “this ministry,” not these ministries. According to this verse, there are many who have the one ministry. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84613" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:5">1 Corinthians 12:5</span> Paul says, “There are distributions of ministries.” </p>
<p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QXmbmGzlP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> How can it be that the ministry is unique and yet at the same time there are many ministries? The answer is that in the New Testament God has only one operation. Furthermore, He has just one ministry to carry out His unique operation. All the apostles—Peter, James, John, Paul, Timothy—carried on the same ministry. Peter did not carry on one ministry, Paul another ministry, and Timothy yet another ministry. This is the situation among preachers, teachers, and ministers today, who carry on different kinds of ministries. </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnGU-2dM-dTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> Because there are different kinds of ministries, there are many different denominations. The Baptists carry on the Baptist ministry to accomplish the Baptist operation. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> Presbyterians carry on another kind of ministry to accomplish the Presbyterian operation. The same is true of the Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Methodists. All these denominations carry on different kinds of ministries for the sake of their own operations. According to the New Testament, this practice is not right. The New Testament reveals that there is a unique ministry. Today the local churches are not carrying out different kinds of ministries to accomplish many operations. God has one operation to be carried out by the unique ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_otxNa3JHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> Now we must see what this unique ministry does. The unique ministry in the New Testament serves Christ to others. It inscribes Christ into people as the Spirit within them and as righteousness outwardly. This is the function of the unique ministry. When we preach the gospel, we should preach in this way. Likewise, when we teach the Bible, edify the saints, or build up the churches, we should do these things in this way. Everything we do in the church life should be to inscribe Christ into the saints. Regarding this, we do not have many different ministries. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExHNfzfrbLpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF"> Although the New Testament clearly indicates that the ministry is one and unique, it also speaks of different ministries. These ministries refer to various services in the church. When <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84614" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:5">1 Corinthians 12:5</span> speaks of ministries, it means the different services. In the church life the saints are involved in different services. For example, some take care of the children. This is one kind of service. Some shepherd the younger ones or the weaker ones. This is another kind of service. These different services, however, all carry out the unique ministry, the unique service. As we have seen, the function of the unique service is to minister Christ into God’s chosen people. In what way should we take care of the children? We should do so in the way of ministering Christ to them. Likewise, how should we shepherd the younger ones or the weaker ones? In shepherding we should minister Christ to others. Even when the sisters meet together to pray, they all should minister Christ. The many services are for the unique service; the many ministries are for the one ministry. <span class="pg" data-page-id="227" id="227">[227]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QXmbmEnFP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> We accept all ministries that are accomplishing the unique ministry for God’s operation. But we cannot accept a ministry that is seeking to establish or accomplish something different from God’s unique operation. For example, we cannot accept a ministry which has as its goal the establishing of the Presbyterian denomination; neither can we accept a ministry that seeks to carry out the Baptist, Lutheran, or Episcopalian operations. These ministries are divisive; therefore, we cannot accept them. The ministries we accept are those that are for the unique New Testament ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnGU-2fIadTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> If you take note of this understanding of the ministry and the ministries and read through the New Testament again, especially the Epistles, you will see that this understanding is accurate. I would encourage you to study the Epistles along this line, paying special attention to the words ministry and ministries. If you make such a study, you will see that the different ministries, services, are all for the carrying out of the one new covenant ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEtm4ReY9VYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> For the carrying out of God’s New Testament economy, the ministry is uniquely one. But for the accomplishing of this unique ministry, especially in the church life, there is the need of many services, the need of diverse ministries. But again I would emphasize the fact that these different ministries and services are all for the carrying out of the unique ministry, which is the ministry of the new covenant. This ministry inscribes the saints with the all-inclusive God, who is the Spirit within us and righteousness as our expression outwardly. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfQaL-TLZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA">A MINISTRY OF INSCRIBING</h2><p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0vA2yzIRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> As we pointed out in the foregoing message, the Spirit and righteousness are the two aspects of the essence which is inscribed into us by the ministry of the new covenant. The living Spirit is the inward aspect, and the perfect righteousness is the outward aspect. The essence of the new covenant ministry includes the two aspects of the Spirit and righteousness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="228" id="228">[228]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpwawPsB_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> Our ministry in the local churches must be a ministry of inscribing. It should not be mere teaching. If we only teach others, the divine essence will not be inscribed into them. Teaching does not require any essence; however, inscribing does require an essence, just as writing with a pen requires ink. If you try to write with an empty pen, there will be no words on the paper. In order to write, we must have the ink as the writing essence. Then the more we write, the more words will be inscribed on the paper. Likewise, we must have the divine essence in order to inscribe it into the being of the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbGHbQd4X5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> The ministry of inscribing is unique, and the essence used for inscribing is also unique. Peter did not do one kind of inscribing with one kind of essence, and Paul a different kind of inscribing with a different kind of essence. No, the apostles were not divided; neither were they divisive. Rather, they all practiced the same inscribing with the same essence. However, today’s preachers have different kinds of inscribing, different kinds of teaching. As a result, the more they teach and preach, the more divisions are produced. Therefore, the unique inscribing must be with the unique essence. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfAPPiNbSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu">THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD<br/>AS THE UNIQUE ESSENCE INSCRIBED INTO US</h2><p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2YqSl8upRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> What is the unique essence which needs to be inscribed into the saints? This unique essence is the Triune God as the Spirit. The term “the Spirit” as used in the New Testament is very meaningful. The Spirit denotes the processed Triune God to be the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wqA-Uic7fcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84615" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</span> we read of the Spirit of God. Elsewhere the Old Testament speaks of the Spirit of Jehovah. In the New Testament the term the Holy Spirit is used. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84616" data-verses="Acts 16:7">Acts 16:7</span> (lit.) we read of the Spirit of Jesus; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84617" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Romans 8:9</span>, of the Spirit of Christ; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84618" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Philippians 1:19</span>, of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84619" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> we are charged to walk in the Spirit. In the New Testament the emphasis is not on walking in the Holy Spirit or in the Spirit of God; the emphasis is on walking in the Spirit. Finally, at the end of the Bible, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="229" id="229">[229]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84620" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>, we read of the Spirit and the bride. Thus, the Bible ends with a word not about the Spirit of God, nor about the Holy Spirit, but about the Spirit. The Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84621" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> is the processed Triune God. </p>

<p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2YqWl9qBRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> The ministry of the new covenant is a very great matter. It includes the entire New Testament of twenty-seven books. In foregoing messages we have seen from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84641" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span> of 2 Corinthians that in the Old Testament age there was only one ministry, a ministry that was called in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84642" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> the ministry of death and condemnation. Christians, however, often consider that in the Old Testament there were three different kinds of ministries: the ministry of the priesthood, the ministry of the kingship, and the ministry of the prophethood. Christians have this concept because the Old Testament speaks of three classes of people—the priests, the kings, and the prophets. Since these three kinds of people can be found in the Old Testament, many students and teachers of the Bible have thought that in the Old Testament there were three kinds of ministries. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wqA6UjIXfcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> Paul regarded the entire Old Testament as the law. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84643" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:21">1 Corinthians 14:21</span> he says, “In the law it is written, In other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people, even so they will not listen to Me, says the Lord.” In this verse Paul quotes a portion from the book of Isaiah. Although Isaiah was a prophet, Paul refers to the book of Isaiah as the law. This indicates that the books of the prophets were also considered <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> part of the law. Actually the entire Old Testament was regarded as the law. This is a proof that in Old Testament times there was a unique ministry. This was the ministry of the old covenant, the ministry of death and condemnation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv33I11byT6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB">THE UNIQUE MINISTRY<br/>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8XK3LXWBxV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> In the New Testament there is also a unique ministry. The twelve Apostles all had this unique ministry. After Judas betrayed the Lord and committed suicide, Peter stood up and said that Judas had been numbered with them and “had obtained part of this ministry” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84644" data-verses="Acts 1:17">Acts 1:17</span>). Then they prayed for the Lord to show whom He had chosen to “take part of this ministry and apostleship” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84645" data-verses="Acts 1:25">v. 25</span>). This indicates that the apostles all had one ministry. It was not a case of Peter having a ministry, John having another ministry, and James having yet another ministry. If that had been the situation, the twelve Apostles would have had twelve different ministries. No, they had one ministry, the unique ministry. Eventually, more apostles were raised up by the Lord. The most prominent of them was Paul. Paul and his co-workers also had the same ministry, the unique ministry of the new covenant. Therefore, in the New Testament there are many apostles, but there is only one ministry. This new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVzJnf4ZmDyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> Throughout the centuries there have been only two ministries: the ministry of the old covenant and the ministry of the new covenant. However, among Christians today there are many different ministries. The reason Christians have been divided into groups and denominations is that they have invented many different kinds of ministries. Every denomination has its own ministry. The Episcopalians have an Episcopalian ministry, the Methodists have the Methodist ministry, and the Baptists, Presbyterians, and Pentecostals each have their ministries. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3estBhCsiRS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> Today some who regard themselves as broad-minded want to embrace all the different kinds of ministries to prove that they are not narrow, sectarian, or divisive. They want <span class="pg" data-page-id="235" id="235">[235]</span> to be all-inclusive and receive ministries from Catholicism, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Protestant denominations, and all the independent groups. This is in contrast to the new covenant ministry, which is unique. The new covenant ministry is unique in nature, essence, function, and purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="HBnt4SwtmItWiwiqI0PmS5SoF6HanOgY9GlBmv9yTfj2hxGvMiNVng7WQlZnI5E96"> In what kind of ministry are we? In particular, what kind of ministry do you have? Certainly none of us would say that we are in the old covenant ministry of death and condemnation. Are you in the ministry of Catholicism? of Greek Orthodoxy? of one of the Protestant denominations? </p>
<p data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWi5Jj3JeMVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9"> Those who have the Baptist ministry will certainly emphasize baptism by immersion. Those in the Episcopalian ministry will surely be in favor of bishops. Likewise, those who have the Presbyterian ministry will be in favor of the administration of the presbytery. Those in these denominations practice such ministries. Furthermore, these denominations have been established to carry out such ministries. The Pentecostals also have their own kind of ministry, a ministry that emphasizes tongue-speaking, healing, and miracles. But none of these ministries is the unique ministry of the new covenant. Is the ministry of the new covenant a ministry of baptism by immersion? A ministry of bishops, presbytery, or tongue-speaking? Certainly the answer to these questions is no. The new covenant ministry is absolutely a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness. This is the unique ministry in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcVeL6nRprUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> When we say that the new covenant ministry is unique, we do not mean that it is the ministry of only one person. For example, it is slanderous to accuse me of saying that the unique ministry today is the ministry of Witness Lee. We do not say this, and we do not mean this. By the unique ministry, the new covenant ministry, we mean the ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness. Whoever ministers the Spirit and righteousness to others is one in the unique ministry, no matter who he may be. Peter, John, James, Paul, Timothy, Titus, Apollos—they all had the one ministry. The ministers are many, but the ministry is unique. As long as you <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> minister the Spirit and righteousness to others, you are in this unique ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQtuUVt9qrzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> A number of times I have been asked something like this: “Brother Lee, you say that the ministry is unique. This means that there is just one ministry. When you say that there is one ministry, that the ministry is unique, do you mean that your ministry is this unique ministry?” Some of those who question me like this may have the concept that I think of myself as someone like Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. I always answer this question by saying, “No, I definitely do not mean that my ministry is the unique ministry.” </p>
<p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QPk4geDtADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> Others may go on to ask if we accept all ministries. The answer is that we do not accept all different kinds of ministries. Then some may say, “On the one hand, you say that your ministry is not the unique ministry. On the other hand, you do not accept all ministries. What, then, do you practice regarding the ministry?” Because those who ask this question may be short of knowledge and may also be under the drugging effect of traditional concepts, it is not easy to explain the matter to them. I may say to myself, “I simply am what I am. But you have been drugged and cannot understand what the New Testament says concerning the ministry.” The ministry of the new covenant is unique; it is the ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness. Although we do not accept all different kinds of ministries, we do accept the ministry of anyone who truly ministers the Spirit and righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0GHIVRGAkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> What I am speaking in this message concerning the ministry is something new and also something old. It is old because it was in existence nearly two thousand years ago. On the other hand, it is something new because it is a matter which has been lost and recovered. We thank the Lord that He has recovered the truth concerning the ministry. We thank Him for showing us from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84646" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> that in the Bible there are two ministries: the old covenant ministry—the ministry of death and condemnation; and the new <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> covenant ministry—the ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness. </p>

<p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9iBQb1UsGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> We need to have a proper definition of righteousness. Unbelievers, of course, do not know the meaning of righteousness in the Bible. But many believers in Christ also do not have a full understanding of the significance of righteousness. Strictly speaking, in the Bible righteousness signifies the expression of God’s image. This means that, according to the Bible, righteousness is God expressed. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8bVxelYk6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr">THE LIVING EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="wNe845Y8ijQ5dKg6d7KErQ-XLlzu45pbRdr4Icvw12hM0LmqbZ_Oxp9c_fGFhtXWL"> How can we say that righteousness in the Bible signifies the expression of God? In order to answer this question, we need to see that in the Word righteousness refers in the first place to the fulfilling of the law. If we keep the law and fulfill it, we are right. We have righteousness. But if we break the law, or if we offend others by breaking the law, we are not right. We do not have righteousness. Hence, the first meaning of righteousness in the Bible is that righteousness is the fulfillment of the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQqlRcKCaH1qNoR9pCwjeaEM_YJjhABbeuYOFoDo4jtib6znl17X3ZC_aTXbYtnrJ"> The law denotes the Ten Commandments. But what is the significance of the Ten Commandments? The Old Testament indicates clearly that the Ten Commandments are the testimony of God. The ark was called the ark of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="246" id="246">[246]</span> testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84670" data-verses="Exodus 25:16">Exo. 25:16</span>), and the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84671" data-verses="Exodus 38:21">Exo. 38:21</span>). The testimony here refers to the law. The law, therefore, is God’s testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbGHjQd435eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> As a testimony of God, the Ten Commandments were a picture of God, a description of Him. This means that the law is a clear description, definition, and explanation of God. It reveals what kind of God our God is. </p>
<p data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfA3PiN7SeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu"> If you study the Ten Commandments, you will see that our God is holy. He is not common. He is separate, different from everything outside of Himself. Therefore, one of the commandments declares that we should have only one God and not make any images or worship idols. Furthermore, we should not take the Lord’s name in vain, and we should recognize that the Sabbath is a day of memorial of God as the unique Creator. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2Yqql8ehRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> By studying carefully the first four commandments, we see that these commandments indicate that God is jealous. He is jealous because He is holy and unique. The Bible uses the marriage relationship to illustrate God’s uniqueness. Just as a wife has a unique husband, so we, the people of God, should not have any other God. God is our unique Husband, and we should not have another husband besides Him. Just as a woman’s husband is separate from all other men and thus is not common, so God is separate from everything else and is not common. This means that our God is holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wqAGUiszfcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> If we read the last six commandments, we shall see that God is righteous. He is a just God, a God of justice. Furthermore, He is a God of love and of light. Therefore, according to the description of God contained in the Ten Commandments, God is holy and righteous and He is a God of love and light. This is our God. </p>
<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv33013PKT6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> The last six commandments definitely reveal that God is righteous and a God of love and light. To honor our parents is surely right. It is right not to murder, not to commit fornication, not to steal, not to bear false witness, and not to covet. If we fulfill these commandments, we shall be right with others in society. Moreover, fulfilling these six commandments is also <span class="pg" data-page-id="247" id="247">[247]</span> a matter of love. Certainly someone who commits murder does not have love. If you love others, you would not commit fornication, steal, or bear false witness. Neither would you covet others’ possessions. Therefore, the Ten Commandments present a God who is holy and righteous and full of love and light. </p>
<p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8XKLLVS9xV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> If we keep the Ten Commandments, we have righteousness. This righteousness is the expression of God, that is, the image of God. Hence, according to the biblical meaning, righteousness is the keeping of the law to present to others an image, an expression, of God. In this way we make known what kind of God we worship. If we are righteous, full of righteousness, this righteousness becomes the expression of the God we worship and serve. </p>
<p data-content-id="123M5cSNMEj-7uz-rGkoC46zlbHtHXa8O48ARsOF1iusSytY9NpKTJ_yPM6vOLmNG"> Suppose someone claims to be of God and says that he worships God and serves Him. However, this person steals, lies, and covets. This would cause others to say that they would never believe in that man’s God. Such a person would give others the wrong impression of God. But suppose we worship God, serve Him, and claim to be of Him. Suppose we also live a life that is holy, separated unto God, and a life that is righteous and full of love and light, a life that is considerate of others. We honor our parents, we do not steal, we do not bear false witness, and we do not covet. In other words, we serve God and worship God and we are also righteous. As a result, we have the expression, the image, of God. Then others will realize that our God is surely the true God. They will have the desire to take this God as their God. </p>
<p data-content-id="9y_RCEn53QXJX8AG7BzDo03GiIrcVdFzVLhJVZjih8fFM7yeaCSVDU7M5P31_v8wC"> Christ, our precious Redeemer, now dwells within us as the life-giving Spirit to be our life and life supply. Now we have a wonderful motivation and supply in us. As the Spirit, Christ supplies us, motivates us, and even carries us all day long. If we live by Him and live Him out, our living will be genuine righteousness. This righteousness is the living image, the living expression, of God. This is the reason we say that the Spirit is within us as life and that righteousness is the expression outwardly. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNQAolTnQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> The purpose of the ministry of the new covenant is to minister into the saints the life-giving Spirit and righteousness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> Both the Spirit and righteousness are actually Christ Himself. Christ living within us is the life-giving Spirit, and Christ expressed through us is righteousness as the image of God. How wonderful! </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAdqCsO9Iy_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84672" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8-9">3:8 and 9</span> Paul speaks first of the Spirit and then of righteousness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84673" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8">verse 8</span> he says, “How shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory?” Here we read of the ministry of the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84674" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> Paul goes on to say, “For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.” Here we have the ministry of righteousness. This is our reason for saying that the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKR4DUGOor7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc">A MINISTRY OF THE LORD’S IMAGE</h2><p data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MMoTiqYuoCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84675" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span> Paul uses a word which is a synonym of righteousness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84676" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">3:9</span>. This word is image. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84677" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">3:18</span> Paul says, “And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” As we behold and reflect the Lord, we are transformed into His image. This image is synonymous with righteousness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84678" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span>. Thus, the ministry of righteousness is a ministry of the Lord’s image. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9iBQb0QMGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> How can we have this image? How can we have a living righteousness which is the image of the Lord? We can have this image, this righteousness, only by the Spirit. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84679" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">verse 18</span>, we are transformed into the Lord’s image from glory to glory even as from the Spirit. This means that the source and the substance for this image, this righteousness, is the Spirit. The Spirit within us is the factor that produces the image of God, the righteousness of God as His expression. </p>

<p data-content-id="pbBnT8P58uzq4V0jIiQ68lujBXFx65nhPRLwuXZnsZuuDDkZCUidRP80lkw5FcmBk"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84703" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> Paul says that the law of the Spirit of life frees us from the law of sin and death. The key phrase in this verse is “the Spirit of life.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84704" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Romans 8:4</span> Paul goes on to speak concerning walking according to the spirit. This involves walking according to the Spirit of life mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84705" data-verses="Romans 8:2">verse 2</span>. We must walk according to the Spirit of life so that the righteous requirements of the law may be fulfilled in us. This does not mean that we endeavor to keep the law; it means that the law is spontaneously and unconsciously fulfilled in us when we walk according to the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceSmOs48IfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj">THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW<br/>FULFILLED IN US</h2><p data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TMycbA18Z3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4"> If we do not live in the Spirit of life and do not walk according to this Spirit and yet try to keep the law, we shall not succeed. Even if we are successful in keeping the law in an outward way, we still shall not have righteousness. But when we live in the Spirit of life and walk according to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="254" id="254">[254]</span> Spirit of life, we shall keep the law automatically, even though we may not have the intention to do so. Spontaneously, all the requirements of the law will be fulfilled in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0zimwjMIJ_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> Let us now consider in more detail how the law of God, the Ten Commandments, is fulfilled in us when we walk according to the Spirit of life. When we live and walk in the Spirit, we certainly will have only one God. We shall never have any other God than our God. This means that we spontaneously fulfill the first commandment. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2syRSi-hzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> Furthermore, we would never make an image to worship as an idol. We would make neither visible images nor invisible ones. Sometimes we make invisible images in our imagination or in our daydreams. For example, someone may think that in the future he will become a very wealthy doctor, a millionaire who owns vast properties. This daydreaming causes him to make an invisible idol, an invisible image. Then he may try his best to fulfill this dream. This is the worshipping of an invisible image. </p>
<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8CnzWd3ZdYKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> It is easy for young people especially to make idols in their imagination. A brother may dream about the wonderful young woman he will marry someday. Then he may search for someone to be the fulfillment of his dream. When he comes to the church meetings, he may be seeking the perfect wife he has in mind. This dream is this brother’s invisible idol. If we walk according to the Spirit, we shall condemn any such dreams. However, those who do not walk according to the Spirit may spend much time lingering in their dreams and enjoying them. By walking according to the Spirit, we spontaneously fulfill the second commandment. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVuEyW8mP2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK"> The same is true regarding the third commandment, the commandment about not taking the name of the Lord in vain. If we live and walk in the Spirit of life, we would never mention the divine name, the holy name, in vain. On the contrary, we would always name the Lord in reality and with a definite purpose. Also we would spontaneously keep the memorial day of the Lord and thereby fulfill the fourth commandment. Thus, when we walk according to the Spirit of life, the first four commandments are fulfilled in us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="255" id="255">[255]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIc13YCmBgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> What is true of the first four commandments is also true of the last six commandments. When we live and walk according to the Spirit, the last six commandments, which concern our relationships with others, are fulfilled spontaneously. The fifth commandment requires that we honor our parents. If we walk according to the Spirit, we shall honor our parents automatically. There will be no need for us to make up our minds to honor them or to endeavor to do this. There will be no need for a young person to say to himself, “In the past I did not have a proper attitude toward my mother and father. Now that I am a Christian I shall have the right attitude, I shall behave properly, and I shall become a good example for my younger brothers and sisters.” Anyone who makes up his mind to honor his parents in this way will not be successful. This can be compared to a cat trying to fly in the air like a bird. A cat is a cat, and it cannot fly. It simply does not have the capacity, the ability, to fly. The same is true of anyone who tries in his natural life to fulfill the fifth commandment. But if we live Christ, if we live and walk in the Spirit of life, spontaneously and unconsciously we shall honor our parents. When our parents see this, they may be greatly surprised and wonder what has happened to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVeieDmQOzDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84706" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span> Paul says that the Corinthians were a letter of Christ ministered by the apostles. By having Christ inscribed into us, we also become living letters of Christ which can be read by others. I know of many cases of young people who have been read by their parents. At first, their parents opposed them because they had turned to the Lord or had come into the church life. But even while the parents were opposing them, they were reading what had been inscribed of Christ into them. As a result, after a period of time, many of these opposing parents turned to the Lord’s way. I have heard many wonderful testimonies concerning this. </p>
<p data-content-id="_4w9Ar9Vyp0N_HoNrdaOQWC9shEsus7o-4LGMp82ngRtO9yGHFVltw-zoF6hLKtMB"> Even if your parents are opposing you, they are still watching you, reading you as a letter of Christ. Eventually, if you live and walk in the Spirit of life in your relationship with your parents, they will be convinced. Although you may not intentionally try to honor your parents, spontaneously <span class="pg" data-page-id="256" id="256">[256]</span> you render them the most excellent and wonderful respect because you walk according to the Spirit. Your parents will notice this, appreciate it, and eventually may be convinced and subdued by it. </p>
<p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkhUjXilHkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> During more than fifty years in the church life, I have seen many cases like this. At first, certain saints were opposed by their parents. In some cases the parents were Buddhists; in other cases, they were Christians. Because the way of the Lord’s recovery was new to them and strange to their understanding, they opposed their children. Some said, “Other Christians attend church just once a week. Why must you go to meetings several times a week? What attracts you to go to church so often? Formerly you loved many things, but now you don’t seem to care about them anymore. What has happened to you? Have you lost your mind? What kind of influence does this church have on you?” When their children loved worldly things, their parents were happy with them. But when they stopped loving those things, their parents were troubled. Wondering what was happening to their children, they decided to oppose the church and to do everything possible to keep them away from the church life. This kind of thing happened hundreds of times in China and also in the United States. But before the Lord I can testify that in the vast majority of cases, the parents eventually turned to the Lord and to His way. Some turned after a few years; others turned after more than thirty years. In some instances the parents came to the church meeting, and, with tears, stood up to give testimony of how they had opposed the church by opposing their children. Then they went on to say that they were convinced by the lives of their children and had repented. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18c2UQop0-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> Why has the Lord gained the victory in so many cases? He has been victorious simply because the saints have lived in the Spirit of life and walked according to the Spirit. Automatically, they respected and honored their parents in such a way that their parents were convinced that the way their children had taken was of the Lord. </p>

When He issued the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84736" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matt. 5:1—7:29</span>), He said some important things concerning righteousness. Again and again He emphasized righteousness. He declared, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84737" data-verses="Matthew 5:6">Matt. 5:6</span>). Then He went on to say, “Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84738" data-verses="Matthew 5:10">Matt. 5:10</span>). He also taught His disciples, “Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84739" data-verses="Matthew 5:20">Matt. 5:20</span>). The Lord Jesus also emphasized righteousness when He said, “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84740" data-verses="Matthew 6:33">Matt. 6:33</span>). Instead of worrying about food and clothing, we need to seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness. But what is this righteousness emphasized by the Lord Jesus? This righteousness is Christ lived out from within us to be the expression of God and the kingdom of God. When we have this righteousness, we surely have God’s reign. We have God’s ruling, administration, and government. This means that we have the kingdom with peace and joy in our daily life, family life, and church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcVOX6mlRrUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> Again and again I would emphasize the fact that the new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness. I never grow tired of repeating this. This new covenant <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> ministry is the ministry in the Lord’s recovery. In the recovery we only minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit and as our living righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQt-IVsZWrzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84741" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8">3:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84742" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">9</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84743" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:16-18">16 through 18</span>, we can see clearly that eventually all the ministers of the new covenant become one with their ministry. This means that the ministers are the ministry. Their ministry is what they are, not merely what they do or the work they accomplish. The very being of the new covenant ministers is their ministry. Therefore, we may speak of the ministers and the ministry becoming one. </p>

For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.” Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84745" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8">verse 8</span> says that the ministry of the new covenant is in glory, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84746" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">verse 9</span> says that this ministry abounds in glory. Here we see two stages of the new covenant ministry. The first stage is the ministry of the Spirit; the second stage is the ministry of righteousness. When the ministry is of the Spirit, it is in the first stage. This is the ministry in glory. When the ministry is of righteousness, it is in the second stage. In this stage the new covenant ministry not only is in glory—it abounds in glory. The reason it abounds in glory is that righteousness comes forth. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNAgolTHQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> These two stages of the new covenant ministry can be applied to our family life. Suppose a brother, his wife, and child receive the ministry of the Spirit. With the ministry of the Spirit there is glory, but this ministry does not abound in glory, for there is not yet any righteousness. But perhaps after a period of time the husband, the wife, and the child all live out righteousness according to the Spirit of life within them. This is the ministry of righteousness abounding in glory. Anyone visiting that family would be able to realize what a glory there is with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAd6isO9oy_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> In the initial stage, the stage of the ministry of the Spirit, <span class="pg" data-page-id="265" id="265">[265]</span> the ministry of the new covenant is in glory. But when this ministry becomes the ministry of righteousness, the ministry abounds in glory. Whenever the ministry of the Spirit is lived out in us with the expression of righteousness, the ministry abounds in glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKRojUG-gr7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84747" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8-9">3:8 and 9</span> “in glory” and “abounds in glory” are both related to the ministry. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84748" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:16-18">verses 16 through 18</span> glory is related not to the ministry, but to the ministers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84749" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">verse 18</span> Paul says, “And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” In this verse the word “we” refers to the apostles, who, as examples and representatives of all believers, are the ministers of Christ. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84750" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span> the glory is related to the ministry, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84751" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">verse 18</span> it is related to the ministers. </p>
<p data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MM4ziqomoCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj"> Although the glory in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84752" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span> is related to the ministry, and the glory in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84753" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">verse 18</span> is related to the ministers, there are not two kinds of glory. There is not one kind of glory attached to the ministry and another kind of glory related to the ministers. No, there is only one kind of glory. This proves that eventually all the ministers of the new covenant become one with their ministry. What they are in their being, their person, is their ministry. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9iRwb0gUGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ">THE LIVING OF<br/>THE NEW COVENANT MINISTERS</h2><p data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8bFRek8Y6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr"> The fact that the ministers and the ministry are one is fully proved in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84754" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span>. In this chapter Paul gives us a strong indication that the ministry is just what the new covenant ministers are. Actually, the ministers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84755" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> are not working; they are simply living. Hence, their living is their working. Apart from their living, there is no need for them to do any work, for their living is their work, their ministry. Their inner being is actually their ministry. What counts in the new covenant ministry is what the ministers of the new covenant are in their living and in their being. <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="wNe845Y8ijQ5dKg6d7KErQ-XLlzu45pbRd7YIe7A12hM0LmqbZ_Oxp9c_fGFhtXWL"> The situation of the ministers of the new covenant is very different from that of many of today’s Christian preachers. It is common for Christian ministers and preachers to work in one way, but to live in a different way. This means that what they work is one thing, and what they are is another thing. They may teach others to be according to a certain high standard, but they themselves do not live according to this standard. Thus, there is a discrepancy between their work and their being. But the new covenant ministers are one with their ministry. What they do is what they are. The way they work is the way they live. Their living, their being, is their ministry. As a result, the glory of their ministry is their glory, and their glory is the glory of their ministry. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LQqlRcKCaH1qNoR9pCwjeaEM_YJjhABbeuIuFqHc4jtib6znl17X3ZC_aTXbYtnrJ">INVISIBLE GLORY</h2><p data-content-id="muHafN-ILtAYeBa5rCiGrZeAqj5x_pHm3Pwnsp6CEwJyH9-WaG0rXZzKN8RdvDILu"> The glory of the new covenant ministers is not something visible or outward. This glory is inward and invisible; it is a matter of Christ realized by others in our living. For example, when you visit a brother’s home, you may see in his family life a condition, a state, of glory. This glory is not Christ seen by others; it is Christ realized by them when they observe the daily living of this family. Others have the sense that in the life of this family there is something glorious. This is the glory of the new covenant ministers and their ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZqAjSO9LixKc_F2NRK9fXc76Cf3n_v9KDTxlD08lKKBOTnM6X34wk61RvjbLDfwsH"> When Moses came down from the mountain, glory shone from his face in a visible way. But there was no such shining of glory on Paul’s face. With Moses, the glory was physical and visible. The shining of that glory, however, did not last very long. With Paul there was no visible, physical shining of glory. However, with him there was a spiritual, inward shining of glory. Anyone who stayed with Paul for a period of time would realize that with him there was an invisible shining. Although this shining could not be seen, it could be sensed, realized. This is the shining of the inward glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="AE9CEdRlVZ0DfzvVD9YH94VL_i-X9J56-zGpdK3kzjh81ESQHHyJQoNdtgNJws_Lr"> With Paul there was no outward shining. With him there was something glorious shining from within. I thank the Lord that today there are also ministers who shine not with <span class="pg" data-page-id="267" id="267">[267]</span> an outward light, but with an inward light, with a light from within. </p>

I realize that for many of us doctrine is not a positive word. Because of our background, a background of religion full of doctrine, we do not regard doctrine as something pleasant or tasteful. In giving a testimony in a church meeting, we would want to say, “What I want to share with you is not a doctrine. It is a real and precious experience.” We all appreciate the word experience, and whenever we have the opportunity, we would testify concerning our experience of the Lord or our experience in the Lord. We would hesitate to stand up and say, “What I am about to present to you is a doctrine.” Nevertheless, I have the boldness to say that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84762" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span> of 2 Corinthians is a chapter on doctrine. Of course, as a rule, doctrine should involve experience. In like manner, any genuine spiritual experience involves doctrine. Therefore, we may say that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84763" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> is a chapter on doctrine with some amount of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18cm0Qq98-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> Let me give my reasons for saying that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84764" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> is concerned with doctrine. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84765" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:8-9">Verses 8 and 9</span> speak of the ministry of the Spirit and of the ministry of righteousness. Thus, the new covenant ministry is first a ministry of the Spirit and then a ministry of righteousness. Is this not a matter of doctrine? If we are fair and if we are not influenced by a negative concept regarding doctrine, we shall admit that <span class="pg" data-page-id="272" id="272">[272]</span> this is in fact a matter of doctrine. Because the Bible is a book of doctrine, we cannot avoid doctrine or ignore it. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84766" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>, in particular, we have the doctrine that the new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i-Dsq7BOF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84767" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">Chapter three</span>, however, also contains some amount of experience. For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84768" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">verse 18</span> Paul says, “And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” This verse contains both doctrine and experience. Although Paul speaks here from the standpoint of experience, at the same time his word includes doctrine. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18cm0QopU-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> If <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84769" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> is basically a chapter on doctrine, what is the nature of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84770" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84771" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">Second Corinthians 4</span> is a chapter on experience. How do we know this? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84772" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">Verse 1</span> gives us an indication that this chapter is concerned with experience: “Therefore, having this ministry, as we received mercy we do not lose heart.” Here Paul refers to “having this ministry.” Even this is related to doctrine as well as to experience. But the matter of not losing heart is definitely a matter of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i-Dsq5FiF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> Even in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84773" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>, a chapter on experience, we can find doctrine. Likewise, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84774" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>, a chapter on doctrine, there is experience. We may say that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84775" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> is experientially doctrinal and that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84776" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span> is doctrinally experiential. Having such an understanding of these two chapters is essential to grasping what we shall cover in this message. </p>

It is not the experience of salvation, justification, or forgiveness. Some may say that in this chapter we have the experience of the cross. However, this is to speak of the experience in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84778" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> in a way that is too negative. What we find here is the manifestation of life. This chapter is on the experience of the manifestation of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="273" id="273">[273]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSx3TWOErP6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk"> Christians may read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84779" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span> without realizing that this chapter is on the manifestation of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84780" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:10-11">Verses 10 and 11</span> say, “Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body. For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh.” In these verses Paul does not use the adjective manifest. Instead, he uses the verb “be manifested.” There is a difference between something that is manifest and something manifested. The word manifest does not involve experience or a process. But manifested involves a process, a procedure. In these verses Paul does not say that the life of Jesus may be manifest. If he had said this, no process or procedure would be involved. There would be no need for us to go through anything in our experience. But when Paul speaks of the life of Jesus being manifested in us, that involves a process. For the life of Jesus to be manifested requires a process, a procedure. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84781" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:10-12">4:10-12</span> we can definitely see the manifestation of life. This indicates that this chapter concerns the experience of the manifestation of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDHITlpBpyIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> The manifestation of life comes through the killing of the cross. For this reason, the title of this message is “The Manifestation of Life through the Killing of the Cross.” Of course, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84782" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> we cannot find the word cross. Nevertheless, the concept of the cross is implied. For example, the “putting to death of Jesus” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84783" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:10">verse 10</span> surely implies the cross. The death of Jesus is not the same as the putting to death of Jesus. We should not think that putting to death is the same as death. No, there is at least some difference between them. The experience of the manifestation of life is related to the putting to death of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCOiDvmbAbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> After presenting the ministry of the new covenant in a somewhat doctrinal way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84784" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>, Paul goes on in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84785" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> to present the experience of a new covenant minister. In doing so, why does he refer to the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus might be manifested? No doubt, Paul and the other apostles had many different kinds of experience. Why, then, does he present this particular <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> experience in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84786" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>? The central focus of this chapter is nothing other than the manifestation of life through the killing of the cross. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84787" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul tells us what the new covenant ministry is. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84788" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> he testifies of this ministry from his experience. In order to testify of the new covenant ministry, the ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, it is necessary for Paul to present the experience of the manifestation of life through the killing of the cross. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4hMyExre1zbM0fe_x-GmaBEs6q87iO-T9fxhbldVqy5h3nbIoZkpmSlQGlIoMTxNS">THE MINISTRY CONFIRMED</h2><p data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weY0D08pfAY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84789" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">4:1</span> Paul says, “Therefore, having this ministry, as we received mercy we do not lose heart.” Suppose Paul had composed this verse differently and had said this: “Therefore, having this service, as we have received abundant grace, we are comforted.” Would this kind of writing confirm what Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84790" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>? Certainly not. There would be no beauty or riches to correspond to the matters covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84791" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84792" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span> Paul covers some marvelous points: the ministry of the Spirit, the ministry of righteousness, transformation from glory to glory. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84793" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> there is something that corresponds to each of these points, points that describe the wonderful new covenant ministry, a ministry of the Spirit, a ministry of righteousness, a ministry for transformation from glory to glory. This ministry, described in a doctrinal way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84794" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>, needs to be confirmed. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84795" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul gives us an experiential confirmation of the points he has just made regarding the new covenant ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="3x4y4bH-jSB8_0__dQRX-nn-7_QC7aefq97Mx3tEiw83hJtljo8fD-KpeOzqVxFkY"> Someone reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84796" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span> might say, “Paul, you have just told us what your ministry is. Your ministry is of the Spirit and of righteousness, and it is for our transformation from glory to glory. This is wonderful. But can you confirm to us this excellent ministry from your own experience? Will you give us some experience as a confirmation of your ministry?” Almost as if to anticipate such questions, Paul seems to say in this Epistle, “In the following chapter, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84797" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>, I shall tell you of my experience.” What Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84798" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> regarding his experience, therefore, must emphasize <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> the crucial points covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84799" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>. This means he must emphasize something related to the Spirit, righteousness, transformation, and glory. As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84800" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>, we need to find what matters correspond to all these points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84801" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>. </p>

Furthermore, we saw that what Paul speaks of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84837" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> is a confirmation from his experience of what he says concerning the ministry in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84838" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>. For each of the major points regarding the ministry in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84839" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span>, there is a corresponding point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84840" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>. Thus, life corresponds to the Spirit, renewing to transformation, and the weight of glory to the degrees of glory. But what corresponds to righteousness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84841" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>? In order to answer this question properly, we need to say a further word about righteousness. </p>

Where there is righteousness, there is no disturbance, confusion, or mixture. For example, in a church meeting we often can see righteousness, for in the meeting everything is right and in good order. As a result, the meeting is in a condition, a state, of righteousness. But suppose the brothers are arguing, the sisters are upset, and the children are running around the meeting hall. What turmoil there would be! In that kind of a situation, a condition of turmoil, there would not be any righteousness. Righteousness refers to a state where everything is in good order. </p>

Instead of turmoil and confusion, there will be peace and order. In the sight of God, such a state is righteousness. The entire condition in the new heavens and the new earth will be righteousness. Nothing will be disorderly; rather, everything will be in good order. This orderly condition is a condition of righteousness. </p>

In spite of the trouble that comes to you from every side, you remain in such an orderly and peaceful condition. The processed Spirit, the “cooked” Spirit, within you experienced as life calms down the whole situation. This is righteousness. </p>

According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84848" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>, the new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness. This ministry supplies Christ as the Spirit and as righteousness to others. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84849" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span>, Paul presents the experience of the Spirit and of righteousness. When we experience the Spirit, life is manifested. When life is manifested, we are brought into a condition of peace, where nothing is wrong or out of order. This is righteousness, a state where everything is living, right, and orderly. In the sight of God, this is righteousness. The apostles experienced the Spirit, manifested life, and lived in a condition of righteousness. Once again we see that their living and their ministry were one. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84852" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">4:16</span> Paul says, “Wherefore we do not lose heart, but if indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.” The rendering “our outward man is decaying” is a correct translation. However, many of us would prefer to say that our outward man is being consumed, wasted away, worn out. The difference is that “is decaying” is active, whereas “being consumed” is passive. </p>
<p data-content-id="uKAggo26VcYIYatm2wE1X7mlIjGB46_tKY4yAU_hKUS9ib9fxDxuiAAHQDKQU_Qdp"> We may use the falling of leaves from a tree as an illustration. In the autumn, many trees lose their leaves, and during the winter these trees are dormant. On the one hand, the falling of the leaves from a tree is an active matter, but in another sense, it is passive. It is active in the sense that the trees drop their leaves. No outside force causes the leaves to fall. It is the tree itself that drops its leaves. We may say that when a tree drops its leaves, the tree is decaying. This is active. But in another sense, the trees are forced to drop their leaves. If a tree could speak, it might say, “Help me! I don’t want to lose my leaves. I would like the season to change from autumn directly to spring. Then my leaves will not be lost.” A tree’s losing of its leaves may also be regarded as passive. Paul’s word, “our outward man is decaying,” is active. But it can also be understood as if it were in the passive voice. Hence, we can speak of our outward man being consumed or being wasted away. </p>
<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVzZzf4puDyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> Let us now apply this understanding to our daily experience. Suppose a brother is afflicted on every side. Surely one who is afflicted, attacked, in this way would be worn out, consumed. If you were the one suffering such affliction, would you not cry out and say, “Please rescue me. I am being consumed. All of you are wearing me out and wasting me away. I am being consumed by you all.” Nevertheless, this brother, along with all of us, needs to realize that just as a tree is destined to lose its leaves, so our destiny is for the outward man to be consumed. </p>

<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0_U2zH4Rc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> We have seen that, as the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84856" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:1">2 Corinthians 3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84857" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> presents a picture of a life that enables the ministers of the new covenant to be one with their ministry. How could the apostles prove that they were ministers of the new covenant? They could prove it by living the kind of life described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84858" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>. It is by this life that they are one with their ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpgOwOI1_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84859" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span> Paul does not speak of his work. He does not refer to what he has done or accomplished. Instead, he speaks of a life, the kind of life lived by him and his co-workers. According to this chapter, Paul and his co-workers lived in such a way that their life became their ministry. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbGXPQfsf5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo">THE NAME OF JESUS</h2><p data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfQbPgJXSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu"> In presenting the life he lived as a minister of the new covenant, Paul uses the name Jesus in a very particular way. In no other place in his writings does Paul use the name Jesus the way he does in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84860" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84861" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:10">verse 10</span> Paul says, “Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.” Here Paul refers to the death of Jesus and to the life of Jesus. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84862" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:11">verse 11</span> he goes on to say, “For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh.” Paul also uses the name Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84863" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:14">verse 14</span>: “Knowing that He Who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> Jesus, and will present us with you.” In these verses Paul again and again uses the name Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weY0L08p_AY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx"> It is important to find out why in this chapter Paul uses the name of Jesus in such a particular way. It is not easy to explain the reason. Actually, there may be more than one reason. In this message we shall begin to consider why Paul uses the name Jesus the way he does in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84864" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3x4y4bH-jSB8_0__dQRX-nn-7_QC7aefq97Ex3tkiw83hJtljo8fD-KpeOzqVxFkY">A RECORD OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="GBLvlFuZpxpOzPlHECwzEvBrtGtiuqGT34lLcvZLsVtjWxkMb27nu2FPxyYbaMXgd"> We have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84865" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul portrays the life lived by himself and his co-workers. This is the life which made them one with their ministry. This life is in contrast to the works emphasized among Christians today. </p>
<p data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ3tLM-qkH014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB"> Christianity has become a religion. Every religion is dependent on certain works, for without works a religion cannot survive. A religion cannot exist unless its adherents carry on certain works. As a result, in religion we have works of many kinds. But although it is easy to point out the works in religion, it is very difficult to find anything of life. Thus, a basic principle of religion is that it is full of works but lacking in life. This is true not only of the Christian religion; it is true of any religion. Every religion is full of work, activity, and doings. But in religion there is no life. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_o9lNa3ZHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> Having this understanding of religion, let us once again look at the history of Jesus. When we consider the record of the Lord’s life on earth, we see that the emphasis is not on works. The four Gospels do not stress what the Lord did, what works He accomplished. The record concerning the Lord Jesus in the Gospels is mainly a record of life. In the Gospels the emphasis is on life, not on works or activities. The Gospels are biographies presenting a person living in a particular way. Therefore, the Gospels are not primarily an account of the Lord’s marvelous works; they are a description of the life the Lord Jesus lived on earth. This is one reason Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84866" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span> uses the name Jesus so often. The use of this name in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84867" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> brings us back to the Lord as a man whose life was one with His ministry. The Lord lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry. <span class="pg" data-page-id="291" id="291">[291]</span> Strictly speaking, the Lord did not accomplish a work. Instead, He simply lived a certain kind of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExHdLzfrLLpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF"> When some hear that the Gospels emphasize the Lord’s life and not His works, they may want to argue, “Brother Lee, don’t the Gospels also give us an account of the works of the Lord Jesus?” Yes, they certainly do. I do not deny that the Gospels describe the Lord’s work. However, if you read the Gospels carefully, you will see that the picture in them was not painted as an account of the Lord’s works. On the contrary, the portrait in the Gospels was painted in such a way as to show forth the Lord’s life. At least, in this portrait the life of the Lord Jesus is presented in a more emphatic way than His works. The Gospels show us more of the Lord’s life than of His work. Yes, the Gospels do describe the Lord’s works, but much more they present the life Jesus lived and show us by what way He lived. </p>
<p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QX2PmEnVP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> There are a number of indications in the Gospels that the Lord Jesus did not care for the accomplishing of a great work. We know that during His ministry the Lord performed many miracles. One of these miracles was that of feeding a crowd of more than five thousand with five loaves and two fishes. Was it not a wonderful miracle for the Lord Jesus to feed such a multitude with five loaves and two fishes? It certainly was a great miracle. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84868" data-verses="John 6:14">John 6:14</span> describes the response of the people to this miracle: “The people therefore, seeing the sign which He did, said, This is truly the prophet who is to come into the world.” The next verse describes the response of the Lord Jesus: “Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone.” This indicates that the Lord Jesus did not care to have a large following. Instead of caring for the crowd, He went away. But if we had been there with the Lord, we probably would have been excited to see the multitude following Him. We might have praised God for His blessing on this work, thanking Him for this great following. The Lord Jesus, however, was not excited. He would not allow the people to make Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="292" id="292">[292]</span> their king. The Lord left the crowd and went to the mountain to pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnGEq2fIKdTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> Another example of the Lord’s caring for life and not for a work is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84869" data-verses="John 12:1">John 12</span>. In Jerusalem a great crowd gave a warm welcome to the Lord Jesus. They took palm branches and went out to meet Him, crying, “Hosanna, blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84870" data-verses="John 12:13">John 12:13</span>). Even the Pharisees admitted that the world had gone after Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84871" data-verses="John 12:19">v. 19</span>). Furthermore, when Andrew and Philip told the Lord that the Greeks were seeking Him, He answered, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84872" data-verses="John 12:23-24">vv. 23-24</span>). This indicates clearly that what the Lord Jesus cared for was life, not work. In the four Gospels there are many illustrations of this. Whenever people, according to their concept, thought that the opportunity was right for the Lord to accomplish a great work, He never took advantage of that opportunity. Instead, He departed. He had not come to do a great work. His concern was life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEt2sReYNVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN">QUALIFIED BY LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfAOL-T7ZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> The One who went to the cross to accomplish redemption for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose was not a great worker. It was not an outstanding work that qualified the Lord Jesus to be the Redeemer. What qualified Him was the life He lived. We know from the Gospels that Jesus was not a famous person living in a mansion in a large city. No, He was a man raised in the home of a carpenter from Nazareth, a despised town from the despised district of Galilee. But the life He lived qualified Him to be the Redeemer for the accomplishment of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0_U2yDQRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> It is crucial for us to see that the Lord Jesus was qualified by life, not by work. This matter of the priority of life over work is a very important aspect of the Lord’s recovery today. The Lord wants to recover a life; He is not seeking to accomplish a work of revival. <span class="pg" data-page-id="293" id="293">[293]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNAwoknvQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84880" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:10">4:10</span> Paul says, “Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.” In this verse Paul speaks of “the putting to death of Jesus.” Why does he use this expression here? To answer this question, we need to consider once again who Jesus is. </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAd6ysPZEy_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> The origin, the source, of the man Jesus is God. Jesus is God incarnate, God conceived in a virgin’s womb. Outwardly, Jesus is a man, but inwardly He is God. Thus, Jesus is not simple. This Nazarene is a wonderful person. When He was on earth, outwardly He was lowly in every respect. He was born in a manger, and He grew up in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth. Nevertheless, inwardly Jesus was glorious, for the most high God was in Him. Outwardly Jesus was a lowly man; inwardly He was the most high God. Truly Jesus is wonderful. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKRozUEqAr7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc">THE DEATH OF JESUS</h2><p data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MM4jiosCoCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj"> Now we must go on to see something concerning the death of Jesus. When many Christians mention the death of Christ, their understanding is limited to redemption. According to their concept, the death of Jesus was only for redemption. Often they quote the verse which says, “Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84881" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). It is absolutely true that the death of Christ was for redemption. We believe this just as much as other Christians do, if not <span class="pg" data-page-id="298" id="298">[298]</span> more. However, redemption is just one aspect of Christ’s death. His death also has many other aspects. </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceS26s6ogfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84882" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span> we see the aspect not of redemption and not of the imparting of life, but of destroying, consuming. According to this chapter, the death of Jesus is for the consuming, the wearing out, of our outward man. For this reason, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84883" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">4:16</span> that “our outward man is decaying.” </p>
<p data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TMiobCxQZ3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4"> Although the man Jesus was God incarnate, God becoming a man, it was necessary even for His outward man to be consumed. According to the outward condition, the Lord Jesus was lowly. But in a spiritual sense, the Lord Jesus was not an insignificant man. On the contrary, Jesus equaled the entire old creation. When He was crucified, it was not only a man from Nazareth who died on the cross. When Jesus was crucified, the entire old creation, including all of us, was crucified also. The Lord Jesus died for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose, not merely for the accomplishment of redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwFOLQgneqezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> The first goal in God’s eternal purpose is to terminate the old creation. The Lord Jesus, as God becoming man, was part of the old creation. It was not through incarnation that He became a man in the new creation. Rather, through incarnation He became a man in the old creation, a man who needed to be consumed. </p>
<p data-content-id="uKAggo26VcYIYatm2wE1X7mlIjGB46_tKY4qAUPpKUS9ib9fxDxuiAAHQDKQU_Qdp"> At the age of thirty the Lord Jesus came forth to minister. During the three and a half years of His ministry, He was constantly being put to death. As a mature man of thirty, He was continually under the process of killing. Do not think that Jesus was crucified only for the six hours He was on a material cross. No, for at least three and a half years He was crucified daily. Every day He lived a crucified life. </p>
<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVzZrf4Z2Dyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> The Lord Jesus was nailed to the cross daily. Sometimes He was crucified by His mother. Other times He was crucified by Peter or some other disciple. Jesus was nailed to the cross even by His disciples’ love. For example, the more Peter loved the Lord Jesus, the more he crucified Him. Thus, before He was literally crucified by the Romans, Jesus had been repeatedly crucified by His mother, His brothers, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="299" id="299">[299]</span> His disciples. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84884" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span> we have an example of the Lord’s being crucified by His brothers. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3estRtCsiBS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> Actually, during the three and a half years of His ministry the Lord Jesus was not mainly living—He was dying. He was living a crucified life. This is what Paul means by the putting to death of Jesus. It is a slow, gradual, and continual crucifixion. </p>
<p data-content-id="HBnt4SwtmItWiwiqI0PmS5SoF6HanOgY9G1Nmv9iTfj2hxGvMiNVng7WQlZnI5E96"> Now we can understand that the Lord Jesus was crucified not only during the six hours He was on a literal cross. For at least three and a half years, He was crucified continually, gradually, and slowly. In the words of Paul, this gradual crucifixion is the putting to death of Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWipFj3JOMVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9">DYING DAILY</h2><p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcVOH6nRZrUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> The apostles were appointed by the Lord to be His followers. They were appointed by Him not to do a great work, but to live a certain kind of life. Therefore, they were not to accomplish a work by following a Christ who was great outwardly. They were to follow the man Jesus to live the life of this small man. This is not a life that is welcomed; it is a life that is rejected, a life that is always crucified, always put to death. Jesus lived this kind of life, and His followers, the apostles, did also. This is the reason Paul says that they were always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQt-YVt9arzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> To follow Jesus of Nazareth is to be killed; it is not to accomplish a great work. Moreover, to be martyred in an instant is rather easy. But to be killed gradually, slowly, and constantly is extremely difficult. To die gradually involves more suffering than being martyred instantly. For at least three and a half years the Lord Jesus was gradually put to death. This was also Paul’s experience for an extended period of time. Wherever he went, he experienced in his body the putting to death of Jesus. Referring to this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84885" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:31">1 Corinthians 15:31</span> he says, “Daily I die.” Here Paul seems to be saying, “Instead of living, I am actually dying day by day. I am undergoing a slow, gradual, and continual killing.” This continual killing is what Paul means by the putting to death of Jesus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QP00gez1ADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ">THE CONSUMING OF THE OUTWARD MAN</h2><p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0GXEVR2YkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> The putting to death of Jesus is for consuming the old creation in us. When Jesus, the Son of God, became a man, He had both an outward part signifying the old creation and an inward part signifying the everlasting God. The outward part was consumed, put to death, but the inward part was raised up, resurrected. This was true of the Lord Jesus, it was true of the apostles, and it is also true of all the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0zi2EjM4B_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> Through our natural birth we became persons of the old creation, and through regeneration we have become persons of the new creation. As regenerated ones, we still have an outward part signifying the old creation. This part needs to be consumed, done away, worn out. But at the same time we have an inward part signifying the everlasting God. This part should be developed, resurrected, and renewed. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2silSiOpzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> The putting to death of Jesus is related to the outward man, which needs to be consumed. As genuine believers, we all have a part of our being which Paul describes as the outward man. This outward man is decaying; it is being consumed, being wasted away, being worn out. This wearing out of the outward man is the putting to death of Jesus. Hence, the putting to death of Jesus is actually a synonym for the consuming of the outward man. In the Lord’s recovery we are experiencing the putting to death of Jesus for the consuming of the outward man. We are undergoing a process of killing, a process of putting to death the outward man. </p>
<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8Cnjid3pFYKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> Suppose a certain young brother is very intelligent. In many Christian groups such an intelligent young man might be admired and even exalted. However, in the church life in the Lord’s recovery, instead of being enthroned, he will experience the putting to death of Jesus. In the recovery it seems that the smarter a person is, the more he is nailed to the cross. </p>

<p data-content-id="AE9CEdRlVZ0DfzvVD9YH94VL_i-X9J56-zG9dLzMzjh81ESQHHyJQoNdtgNJws_Lr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84891" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:10">4:10</span> Paul says, “Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84892" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">verse 16</span> Paul goes on to say, “Wherefore we do not lose heart, but if indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.” The experience of the putting to death of Jesus results in the renewing of the inward man. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FXS_xlsr3gzjoDc53zkOKTBo0Wu8y0MncqEm320GX0PDpj4qrLlX-GYZybGMhOX53">THE OUTWARD MAN<br/>AND THE INWARD MAN</h2><p data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwkXdn9nkujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG"> What is the inward man? It is difficult to explain what the inward man is. For more than forty years I have been considering and studying the meaning of the outward man and the inward man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84893" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">4:16</span>. Some writings have said that the outward man denotes our natural man and that the inward man denotes our spiritual man. I do not say that this understanding is wrong; however, it is somewhat vague. </p>
<p data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42R6Nk1q-WYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4"> If you consider the context of this chapter, the outward man primarily means the physical body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84894" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:10">verse 10</span> Paul speaks of “bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84895" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:11">verse 11</span> he mentions the mortal flesh. Bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus is equal to the consuming, the wasting away, of the outward man. Therefore, the outward man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84896" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">verse 16</span> must mainly refer to the body. </p>
<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEt20ReYtVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> Likewise, the inward man in this verse must refer to our <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> regenerated spirit, as indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84897" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:13">verse 13</span>, where Paul uses the expression “the same spirit of faith.” As we have pointed out, the spirit here is the mingled spirit, the regenerated human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit. The body is to be consumed, but the regenerated spirit is to be renewed day by day. According to the context, the outward man is mainly the body, and the inward man is mainly the regenerated spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfAWL-TbZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> The outward man includes our body and our soul, with the body as its organ and the soul as its life and person. The inward man includes our regenerated spirit and our renewed soul with the regenerated spirit as its life and person and the renewed soul as its organ. The life of the soul must be denied (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84898" data-verses="Matthew 16:24-25">Matt. 16:24-25</span>), but the functions of the soul, the mind, will, and emotion, must be renewed and uplifted by being subdued (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84899" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:4-5">2 Cor. 10:4-5</span>) to be used by the spirit, which is the person of the inward man. </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh0_M2yzYRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84900" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">verse 16</span>, the outward man is being consumed, being wasted away, being worn out. By the continued killing, the working of death, our outward man, that is, our material body with its animating soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84901" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:44">1 Cor. 15:44</span>), is being consumed and worn out. The outward man, with the body as its organ and the soulish life as its life and person, must be consumed. </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYpgWwPsR_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> We all have an outward man. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He too had an outward man. His outward man needed to be consumed. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbGXXQd4n5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84902" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">verse 16</span> Paul also says that our inward man is being renewed day by day. This renewing of the inward man takes place as the inward man is nourished with the fresh supply of resurrection life. As our mortal body, our outward man, is being consumed by the killing work of death, our inward man, that is, our regenerated spirit with the inward parts of our being (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84903" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33">Jer. 31:33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84904" data-verses="Hebrews 8:10">Heb. 8:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84905" data-verses="Romans 7:22">Rom. 7:22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84906" data-verses="Romans 7:25">25</span>), is being metabolically renewed day by day with the supply of resurrection life. As the inward man is renewed, the functions of the soul—the mind, the emotion, and the will—are also renewed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="307" id="307">[307]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEfQDPiNrSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu">THE WEARING OUT OF THE OUTWARD MAN</h2><p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2Y6el8exRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> Let us now apply this matter to our daily living, especially to our family life and church life. Suppose a young brother and sister in the church life get married. The brother is strong, healthy, intelligent, and energetic. It will not take very long for the sister to discover that her husband is a strong person with a strong natural life. His outward man is composed of his energetic body and his strong soul. This outward man must experience the putting to death of Jesus. The Lord will use this brother’s wife to consume his outward man. At the same time, He will use the brother to consume the sister’s outward man. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wqQyUisjfcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> The outward man does not deserve to be edified, strengthened, exalted, or enthroned. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He did not need to have His outward man enthroned. On the contrary, what He needed was for the outward man to be put to death. Because we all have a strong outward man, we need to experience the putting to death of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv3nA13P6T6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> In the church life I have discovered that the outward man of the sisters is even stronger than that of the brothers. For this reason, it is usually much more difficult for a sister to be put on the cross than it is for a brother. It seems that more nails are required in the case of sisters. The outward man of the brothers can be compared to glass, but the outward man of the sisters can be compared to rubber. It is much easier to break glass than it is to break rubber. But whether our outward man is like glass or rubber, none of us is easily broken. It seems that certain saints need a crucifixion that is everlasting, since their outward man is so enduring. Some brothers and sisters have been in the church life for twenty years, and still their outward man has not been broken. They do not have any intention of being broken. It seems that they are always able to avoid being put on the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8Xa_LVSNxV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> The more we experience the consuming, the putting to death, of the outward man, the more our inward man is renewed. Our regenerated spirit with our renewed mind, emotion, and will needs to be resurrected, developed, enlarged, <span class="pg" data-page-id="308" id="308">[308]</span> and refreshed. Therefore, as the outward man is being consumed, the inward man is being resurrected, renewed, and developed. </p>
<p data-content-id="123M5cSNMEj-7uz-rGkoC46zlbHtHXa8O4s0Rs-d1iusSytY9NpKTJ_yPM6vOLmNG"> The life that can carry out the ministry of the new covenant is a life of having the outward man put to death and the inward man renewed and resurrected. Actually this kind of life is the new covenant ministry. This life and this ministry are needed for the Lord’s recovery today. Only this kind of ministry can impart life to others, can minister Christ to others as the life-giving Spirit and as righteousness. Gifts, ability, energetic activity, diligent works—none of this avails. The only thing needed is a crucified life, the life with the outward man continually experiencing the putting to death of Jesus so that the inward parts of our being may rise up, be refreshed, and be developed. </p>
<p data-content-id="9y_RCEn53QXJX8AG7BzDo03GiIrcVdFzVLx9VZT6h8fFM7yeaCSVDU7M5P31_v8wC"> I hope that we all shall be impressed with the fact that the new covenant ministry is not a matter of talent or ability. This ministry is altogether a matter of life. In this kind of life the natural being is put to death so that the spiritual being may be resurrected, renewed, and developed. This life is needed in a crucial way for the Lord’s recovery today. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNA0oljPQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W">DIFFERENT KINDS OF SUFFERING</h2><p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAd62sONgy_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> In the foregoing messages and in this message we have had much to say concerning the putting to death of Jesus. I am deeply concerned that some of the saints may have a mistaken understanding regarding this matter. They may think that every kind of suffering is an experiencing of the putting to death of Jesus. When they sing a hymn such as “Each Blow I Suffer” (<em>Hymns,</em> #626), they may not have the proper understanding either of this hymn or of what Paul means by the putting to death of Jesus. Therefore, in order to avoid misunderstanding, I wish to point out that not all of the sufferings experienced by Christians are of the same category. Actually there are at least three kinds of sufferings Christians may experience. Let us now consider these categories. <span class="pg" data-page-id="309" id="309">[309]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVzZjf5tODyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84913" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">2 Corinthians 5</span> Paul covers a number of important points. Let us briefly enumerate these points and then go on to consider them. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3estRlCtG9S_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H">SIX IMPORTANT MATTERS</h2><p data-content-id="HBnt4SwtmItWiwiqI0PmS5SoF6HanOgY9G1FmtpSTfj2hxGvMiNVng7WQlZnI5E96"> First in this chapter Paul covers the longing to be clothed upon with a transfigured body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84914" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1-8">5:1-8</span>). This is related to the redemption of the body. Paul desired to be clothed upon with a transfigured body, with a body in resurrection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84915" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1-2">verses 1 and 2</span> he says, “For we know that if our earthly tabernacle house is taken down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. For indeed in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our dwelling place from heaven.” </p>
<p data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWipNj1N6MVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9"> The second matter covered by Paul in this chapter is the ambition to please the Lord: “Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well-pleasing to Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84916" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:9">v. 9</span>). Here to be ambitious is to be zealous with a strong aim, to strive earnestly to be well-pleasing to the Lord. We all should have the ambition to please the Lord. We should not be ambitious to have some kind of position in the church life, but we should be ambitious to be well-pleasing to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcVOP6nR5rUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> The third point is being constrained to live to the Lord. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="314" id="314">[314]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84917" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:14-15">verses 14 and 15</span> Paul says, “For the love of Christ constrains us, having judged this, that One died on behalf of all; therefore all died; and He died on behalf of all, that those who live may no longer live to themselves, but to Him Who died for them and has been raised.” In these verses Paul speaks of being constrained to live not for the Lord, but to live to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQt-QVt96rzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84918" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:16-17">verses 16 and 17</span> Paul goes on to mention a fourth matter, the new creation: “So that we, from now on, know no one according to flesh; even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer. So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.” </p>
<p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QP08geD9ADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> Fifth, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84919" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:18-20">verses 18 through 20</span> Paul speaks regarding the ministry of reconciliation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84920" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:18">verse 18</span> he says, “But all things are of God, Who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84921" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:19">verse 19</span> he speaks of “the word of reconciliation,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84922" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">verse 20</span> he entreats the saints on behalf of Christ to be reconciled to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0GXMVRGQkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84923" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">verse 21</span> we have the crucial matter of God’s righteousness: “Him Who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God’s righteousness in Him.” </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0zi2MjMIZ_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> Apparently these six matters are of different categories and are not related to one another. Thus, it is possible to read this chapter without seeing any continuation between one point and another. Actually, there is a continuation, and it is not difficult to see it. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2sitSi-xzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> Not only do the important points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84924" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">chapter five</span> continue one another, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84925" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">chapter five</span> is itself a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84926" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>. This is indicated by the fact that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84927" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">5:1</span> begins with the word “for.” “For” indicates that what is to be covered in this chapter is an explanation of what is spoken in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84928" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:13-18">4:13-18</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8Cnjqd3ZNYKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y">LONGING FOR TRANSFIGURATION</h2><p data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVuUOW8mf2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84929" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">5:1</span> Paul speaks of our earthly tabernacle house being taken down. For our body as our earthly tabernacle house to <span class="pg" data-page-id="315" id="315">[315]</span> be taken down is for our outward man to be consumed, wasted away. Toward the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84930" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">2 Corinthians 4</span>, Paul says that our outward man is decaying, that our inward man is being renewed, and that we are not considering the things which are seen, but the things which are not seen. This means that we live and walk by faith. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84931" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">5:1</span> he gives a word of explanation, saying that we know that if our outward man, our earthly tabernacle house, is taken away, we have a better one in the heavens. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84932" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">chapter five</span> there is clearly a continuation of Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84933" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIclLYCmxgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> This continuation indicates that at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84934" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul had become truly mature. He had been regenerated in his spirit and transformed in his soul. His entire being had been renewed. The only thing yet to be completed was the full redemption of his physical body. Paul’s body was still in the old creation; it had not yet been changed, transfigured. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84935" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1-8">5:1-8</span> he expresses his longing, his aspiration, for the transfiguration of his body. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVeyiDmQ-zDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> It was Paul’s desire that he not be unclothed, that is, that he not have his body taken away from him. His desire was to be clothed, that is, to put on a transfigured body. Death involves the separation of a person from his body. Sometimes during a funeral service a minister may say that the deceased has gone away, that he has departed and is no longer with us. Often Christians use the expression “going to the Lord.” It was not Paul’s longing to be without a body. He did not desire to be unclothed, to have his body taken away. His longing was to be clothed with a resurrected body. This means that his longing was to be redeemed in his body. He knew that his spirit had been regenerated and that his soul had been transformed, but he also realized that his body had not yet been transfigured. Therefore, he was longing and waiting for the redemption of his body. This longing is covered in the first eight verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84936" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">chapter five</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_4w9Ar9Vyp0N_HoNrdaOQWC9shEsus7o-4b6MpMungRtO9yGHFVltw-zoF6hLKtMB">SHAPED BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkhEfXiVfkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84937" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:5">verse 5</span> Paul says, “Now He Who has wrought us for this very thing is God, Who has given to us the pledge of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="316" id="316">[316]</span> Spirit.” The Greek word translated wrought also means fashioned, shaped, prepared, made fit. God has wrought us, fashioned, shaped, prepared us, made us fit, for the purpose that our mortal body may be swallowed up by His resurrection life. Thus, our entire being will be saturated with Christ. God has given us the Spirit as the pledge, the earnest, the foretaste, the guarantee, of this wonderful and marvelous part of His complete salvation for us in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18cmoQoZc-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> God intends to clothe us with a body of resurrection. But if we would be clothed with a transfigured body, we need certain qualifications. A sinner is not qualified to be clothed with a transfigured body. He is not fit for such a body. However, God has wrought, shaped, custom-made, us for this. Just as a tailor shapes a jacket to fit our body, so God is shaping us to put on a body of resurrection. God is not shaping a body—He is shaping us. When you buy a new pair of shoes, you select shoes to fit the shape of your foot. God’s way is the opposite: He shapes our feet to match the shoes. He shapes us, prepares us, to fit into a resurrected body. </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i-Dwq51qF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> How does God shape a sinner so that he can put on a resurrected body? He shapes him by forgiving his sins, putting the divine life into him to regenerate his spirit, and then transforming his soul. This is what it means for God to shape us. </p>

This indicates that the main factor of God’s shaping us is His putting Himself into us as the life-giving Spirit to be a pledge. This means that God has pledged Himself to us to accomplish this for us. He has placed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into our spirit to guarantee that one day He will clothe us with a body of <span class="pg" data-page-id="317" id="317">[317]</span> resurrection. We have a pledge that we have been made and qualified for this purpose. This also is included in the ministry of the new covenant.

<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8Cnjud2t9YKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> In the foregoing message we covered a number of important points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84958" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">2 Corinthians 5</span>: the aspiration to have a transfigured body, the ambition to please the Lord, living to the Lord, and being a new creation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84959" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:17">verse 17</span> Paul speaks of the new creation: “So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.” The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does have the divine life and nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84960" data-verses="John 1:13">John 1:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84961" data-verses="John 3:15">3:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84962" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>). Hence, they are a new creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84963" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">Gal. 6:15</span>), not according to the old nature of flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life. The word behold in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84964" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:17">verse 17</span> is a call to watch the marvelous change of the new creation. </p>

On behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as God entreating through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, <span class="pg" data-page-id="322" id="322">[322]</span> Be reconciled to God.” We need to read these verses very carefully. The word “then” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84966" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">verse 20</span> is a connecting word joining <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84967" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">verse 20</span> with the preceding verses. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84968" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">verse 20</span>, the ambassadors of Christ are one with God; they are like God, and they entreat as God. Their word is God’s word, and what they do is God’s doing. Furthermore, the words “on behalf of Christ” mean representing Christ. As those who represent Christ, the apostles were ambassadors of Christ. Today an ambassador is a person authorized to represent his government. In like manner, the apostles were authorized by Christ to represent Him to do the work of reconciliation. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVeymDkUyzDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> Paul’s composition in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84969" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">5:20</span> is unusual. After saying “we are ambassadors,” he says, “as God entreating through us.” Paul seems to be saying, “We are ambassadors of Christ, and we are doing a reconciling work. This is like God entreating you through us. We are one with Christ and one with God. Christ is one with us, and God also is one with us. Therefore, God, Christ, and we, the apostles, are all one.” The ministry of the new covenant is a ministry in which God, Christ, and the ministers are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv3nI13PaT6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84970" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">verse 20</span> is strong and emphatic. He says, “We are ambassadors, as God entreating through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.” God, Christ, and the apostles were one in carrying out the ministry of reconciliation. </p>

These believers had already been reconciled to God partially. However, they had not been fully reconciled to Him. It would not be true to say that the Corinthian believers had not been reconciled to God at all. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84972" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Corinthians chapter one</span> Paul refers to them as saints, as those who had been called by God into the fellowship of His Son. Therefore, they surely had been reconciled to God to some degree. Perhaps they had been halfway reconciled to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="9y_RCEn53QXJX8AG7BzDo03GiIrcVdFzVLx1VZjyh8fFM7yeaCSVDU7M5P31_v8wC"> The books of 1 and 2 Corinthians show that the believers <span class="pg" data-page-id="323" id="323">[323]</span> at Corinth, after being reconciled to God partially, still lived in the flesh, in the outward man. Between them and God there was the separating veil of the flesh, of the natural man. This veil corresponds to the veil inside the tabernacle, the veil that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies, not to the veil at the entrance to the Holy Place. The Corinthian believers may have been in the Holy Place, but they were not in the Holy of Holies. This means they were still separated from the place where God is. Therefore, they had not been reconciled to God in full. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSNA8olTXQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84973" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:19">verse 19</span> it is the world that is to be reconciled to God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84974" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:20">verse 20</span> it is the believers, those who have already been reconciled to God, who are to be reconciled to Him further. This clearly indicates that there are two steps for people to be fully reconciled to God. The first step is as sinners to be reconciled to God from sin. For this purpose Christ died for our sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84975" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:3">1 Cor. 15:3</span>) that they may be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ’s death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross that God might judge them upon Him for us. The second step is as believers living in the natural life to be reconciled to God from the flesh. For this purpose Christ died for us—the persons—that we may live to Him in resurrection life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84976" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:14-15">2 Cor. 5:14-15</span>). This is the subjective aspect of Christ’s death. In this aspect for us He was made sin to be judged and done away with by God that we may become the righteousness of God in Him. By the two aspects of His death He has fully reconciled God’s chosen people to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAd6-sO94y_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. The first veil is called the screen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84977" data-verses="Exodus 26:36">Exo. 26:36</span>, lit.). A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84978" data-verses="Exodus 26:31-35">Exo. 26:31-35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84979" data-verses="Hebrews 9:3">Heb. 9:3</span>) still separated him from God Who is in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that he might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. The Corinthian believers had been reconciled to <span class="pg" data-page-id="324" id="324">[324]</span> God, for they had passed through the first veil and had entered into the Holy Place. But they still lived in the flesh. They needed to pass the second veil, which has already been rent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84980" data-verses="Matthew 27:51">Matt. 27:51</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84981" data-verses="Hebrews 10:20">Heb. 10:20</span>), to enter into the Holy of Holies to live with God in their spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84982" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). The goal of this Epistle is to bring them here that they may be persons in the spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="84983" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:14">1 Cor. 2:14</span>), in the Holy of Holies. This is what the apostle means by saying, “Be reconciled to God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKRo_UG-wr7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc"> In the Old Testament, when a sinner came to God, he first had to come to the altar to have his sins forgiven through the blood of the sin offering. After experiencing the forgiveness of sins, he could enter the Holy Place. This is the first step of reconciliation, the step by which a sinner begins to be reconciled to God. This was the situation of the believers at Corinth, and it is also the situation of most genuine Christians today. They have been reconciled to God in part through the cross upon which Christ died as our sin offering, where He shed His blood to wash away our sins. When we believed in Him, we were forgiven by God, reconciled to Him, and brought back to Him. Formerly, we went astray from God. But through repentance we returned to Him and have been reconciled to Him. However, we have been reconciled to God only partly, halfway. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MM4viqo2oCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj">FULL RECONCILIATION</h2><p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9iRsb0gkGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> Although the Corinthians had been saved and reconciled to God halfway, they still lived in the flesh; that is, they lived in the soul, the outward man, the natural being. The veil of the flesh, of the natural man, still separated them from God. This means that their natural being was a separating veil. Therefore, they needed the second step of reconciliation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="84984" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">2 Corinthians 5</span> Paul was working to accomplish this second step. He was working on the Corinthians to cut the veil of the flesh asunder, to crucify their natural life, to consume their outward man. What the Apostle Paul was doing in 1 and 2 Corinthians was to cleave the separating veil of the flesh so that the believers at Corinth could enter into the Holy of Holies. <span class="pg" data-page-id="325" id="325">[325]</span> </p>

These steps include redemption, regeneration, transformation, and glorification. As God’s creatures, we were created by Him to fulfill His purpose. However, we have become fallen. To be fallen is to be lost. We became lost because of our fall into sin. But God came to be a man in the Person of the Son that He might be our Redeemer. As our Redeemer, Christ died on the cross for our sins. Although we were fallen and lost, God came as a man to accomplish redemption and to bring us back to Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDHI3lolVyIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> Redemption, however, is simply the initial stage of God’s full salvation. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were redeemed to God. But at the same time the Spirit of God, with Christ’s redemption as the basis, entered into our being. In particular, the Spirit came into our spirit to regenerate us, to bring God’s life into our deadened spirit and to make our spirit alive. In this way we were regenerated of God. To be regenerated is not the same as being born of our parents to receive physical life; it is to be born of God to receive spiritual life. This means that the very God who is life came into our spirit to be our life, our nature, and our person. </p>
<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCOinvkPwbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> In our experience redemption and regeneration occur at the same time. We were redeemed, and our sins were forgiven. As a result, we have been justified by God and reconciled to Him. Now that Christ has redeemed us to God, there is no <span class="pg" data-page-id="332" id="332">[332]</span> longer a problem between us and God. At the same time, we were regenerated, born again of God. Through regeneration we have become children of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4hMyExre1zbM0fe_x-GmaBEs6q87iO-T9fxFbnZhqy5h3nbIoZkpmSlQGlIoMTxNS">TRANSFORMATION, CONSTITUTION,<br/>REORGANIZATION</h2><p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIclzYCmRgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> Regeneration, like redemption, is just the beginning, the initial stage, of God’s salvation. Just as birth is the beginning of human life, so regeneration is the beginning of spiritual life. Following regeneration, we need transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVeyaDmQezDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> If we would understand the meaning of transformation, we need to use terms such as constitution and reorganization. Used with respect to transformation, the word constitution means that a certain new element is added into our being and constituted into us. Of course, the element that is added into us is the divine element. Before we were regenerated, we did not have the divine element. Whether we were good or bad, we all possessed only the human element. Those who are fallen and those who are redeemed are the same in that both have the human element. </p>
<p data-content-id="_4w9Ar9Vyp0N_HoNrdaOQWC9shEsus7o-4bCMp8mngRtO9yGHFVltw-zoF6hLKtMB"> We can compare ourselves to a glass of water. Whether the glass is clean or dirty, it contains nothing other than plain water. It has no other contents, no other elements. Therefore, what is in the glass does not have the flavor or color of anything except water. However, if tea is added to this glass of water, another element is put into the water. Then two substances, the water and the tea, the tea and the water, are mingled together. This mingling is what we mean by constitution. The water is constituted into the tea, and the tea, into the water. </p>
<p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkhEnXilXkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> Continuing to use the illustration of water and tea, we would point out that it is impossible for water to become tea without the element of tea added to the water. There is only one way for water to become tea, and that is to put tea into water. When the element of tea is added to water, this element will constitute the water into tea. Once water has become tea, it has two elements: tea and water. Anyone who drinks this tea will receive these two elements. He takes <span class="pg" data-page-id="333" id="333">[333]</span> only one kind of drink into him, but he receives two kinds of elements. He enjoys the water to quench his thirst and the tea to give him a certain taste. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18cmQQopE-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s">NO THIRD SUBSTANCE PRODUCED</h2><p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i-DIq5FyF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> We need to be very clear, however, that the mingling of tea and water does not produce a third substance, a substance which is neither tea nor water. To say that the element of tea is mingled with water does not mean that the two original substances, the tea and the water, are nullified and no longer exist. On the contrary, the water is still water, and the tea is still tea. The difference is that once the tea and the water have been mingled, they are no longer separate. They are distinct, but they are not separate, for they have been mingled together and constituted into one entity, one drink. In the same principle, when divinity is mingled with humanity, both divinity and humanity continue to exist. It would not be true to say that this mingling produces a third substance, something which is neither divine nor human. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dChzg2DUKpIBDLedcWn1ydFKoiHfeFV0KBwiJsET5ldzIRhtliB64uqos5WWmePIs">THE BEGINNING OF THE MINGLING</h2><p data-content-id="Ql5Pg2ZNuykXsyEjASMH8B5GtMoTjCdfD3bFdjGvnWm2lFgAKpLfM_KLzMYyqkpuP"> When we were regenerated, the divine tea was added to us. Prior to that time, whether our behavior was good or bad, we had only the element of humanity. Both a bank robber and a highly ethical person are the same in that neither of them has the divine element as long as they are not regenerated. We praise the Lord that at the time of our regeneration God came into our being. At that time the divine Person with the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine being were added to us. What a tremendous difference this makes! Now as saved and regenerated persons, we have two elements—the human element and the divine element. Furthermore, we have the divine life as well as the human life, and the divine nature as well as the human nature. The element of divinity has been added into the element of our humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSx33WOEbP6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk"> The addition of the divine element to our being at the time of regeneration marks the beginning of the mingling of divinity and humanity within us. Regeneration, therefore, is <span class="pg" data-page-id="334" id="334">[334]</span> simply the beginning of the mingling. When tea is added to water, both the tea and the water work to produce one entity, one drink. We may say that the tea and the water cooperate to produce this drink. In the same principle, once God has been added into our being, He begins to work within us. Now we need to cooperate with God’s work, with His operation. </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDHI3lpBZyIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> From the time we were regenerated, a process of constitution and transformation has been taking place within us. This process also involves reorganization. Through our birth as human beings we were organized in a certain way. But now that a new element, the divine element, has come into our being, there is the need for reorganization. Therefore, we need constitution, transformation, reorganization. </p>
<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCOinvmrYbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> In the first few centuries of church history certain ancient teachers of the Bible saw the matter of mingling, experienced it, and taught it. Some teachers, however, went to an extreme and claimed that in the mingling of divinity and humanity in Christ, the original two natures produced a third nature. This is heretical, and it was condemned by the Council of Chalcedon. Afterward, Christian teachers were afraid to speak of the mingling of divinity with humanity. However, we have learned that some throughout the centuries continued to teach in a proper way concerning the mingling of divinity with humanity. Recently I read two books by Catholic writers which speak of this mingling in a correct way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4hMyExre1zbM0fe_x-GmaBEs6q87iO-T9fxFbltNqy5h3nbIoZkpmSlQGlIoMTxNS">A TYPE OF THE MINGLING</h2><p data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weY0n08Z3AY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx"> The meal offering composed of fine flour mingled with oil is a type of the mingling of divinity with humanity. In some cases the oil was poured upon the fine flour; in other cases it was mixed, or mingled, with the flour. In the case of oil mingled with flour to make a cake to be used in the meal offering two substances—flour and oil—were mingled together. The oil was not simply added to the flour; it was mingled with it. But in this mingling neither of these elements ceased to exist. No, the oil was still oil, and the fine flour was still flour. But through the process of mingling the flour and the oil became one entity. However, neither the <span class="pg" data-page-id="335" id="335">[335]</span> oil nor the flour lost its particular nature because of the mingling. Furthermore, the mingling of the oil with the flour did not produce a third nature, a substance which was neither flour nor oil. The product of the mingling was a cake with two natures, two elements, two substances. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QX2nmFTlP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv">WHAT WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO</h2><p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnGEC2es-dTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85003" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:12">2:12—3:11</span> Paul covers the ministry of the new covenant, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85004" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:12">3:12—7:16</span>, the ministers of the new covenant. The section in this Epistle on the ministers of the new covenant is much longer than the section on the ministry of the new covenant. The reason for this is that God cares much more for the ministers than He does for the ministry. In other words, God cares more for what we are than for what we do. This means that what we are is much more important to Him than what we do. </p>
<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEt2ERcMFVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> Today both in the Christian world and the secular world more attention is given to what people do than to what they are. Christians mainly pay their attention to work or ministry, yet neglect the being of the person who does the work. They pay attention to the work and the ministry much more than to the worker and the minister. But according to the Bible, God pays more attention to what we are than to what we do or to what we can do. He cares for the kind of person we are and for the kind of life we live. Therefore, in 2 Corinthians Paul first presents the New Testament ministry. Then he goes on to show that this excellent, marvelous ministry needs excellent ministers with an excellent life. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHfAmL8X3ZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> We need to be deeply impressed by the fact that God cares much more for what we are than for what we do. What we do must be measured by what we are. Furthermore, our being must match our work; that is, what we are must <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> match what we do. Our being must match our doing. Thus, our being and our doing go together. If we care only for what we do and not for being the right kind of person, then what we do will not be very weighty. Our doing will be weighty only when it is matched by what we are in our being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9iRUb0gEGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ">WORKING BY AN ALL-FITTING LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8bF1ek8I6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85005" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">6:1</span> Paul says, “And working together with Him, we also entreat you that you do not receive the grace of God in vain.” “And” here indicates a continuation. In the last part of chapter five (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85006" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:16-21">vv. 16-21</span>) the apostle told us that they, as the ministers of the new covenant, are commissioned with the ministry of reconciliation for the Lord’s new creation. From this verse to the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85007" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span>, he continues by telling us how they work. They work together with God by a life (not by any gift) that is all-sufficient and all-matured, able to fit all situations, able to endure any kind of treatment, to accept any kind of environment, to work under any kind of condition, and to take any kind of opportunity, for the carrying out of their ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="wNe845Y8ijQ5dKg6d7KErQ-XLlzu45pbRd78Ie7Q12hM0LmqbZ_Oxp9c_fGFhtXWL"> Some who read this may say, “This is a good word for co-workers and ministers, but it does not apply to me. I am a layman, not a minister.” But in the Lord’s recovery there are no laymen. Everyone is a minister, a co-worker, and even has the potential and the capacity of becoming an apostle. Elsewhere we have pointed out that the apostles are examples and patterns of what all believers should be. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85008" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> Paul says that he is less than the least of all saints. Moreover, the name Paul means “little.” If Paul, who thought of himself as less than the least of all the saints, could be a minister and an apostle, how about you? We all have the capacity to be ministers of the new covenant. Concerning this, our emphasis should not be on what we do, but on what we are. Our capacity is not primarily a capacity for doing but for being. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQqlRcKCaH1qNoR9pCwjeaEM_YJjhABbeuIKFqHM4jtib6znl17X3ZC_aTXbYtnrJ"> I would say that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85009" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">6:1—7:16</span> we can see that the apostles work together with God by an all-fitting life. This portion of 2 Corinthians does not indicate that they work together <span class="pg" data-page-id="341" id="341">[341]</span> with God by an all-sufficient power or by an all-wonderful gift. Today’s Christians, however, mainly devote their attention to power and gifts. Some may inquire, “Do you have power? Don’t you know that Dr. So-and-so is a powerful preacher? What gifts do you have? Oh, Dr. So-and-so is very gifted.” But among Christians today there is very little talk about life or about living. Those who do not have genuine power may pretend to be powerful. For example, in a presumptuous way they may pray, “In the mighty name of Jesus I bind all the demons!” But it is most interesting that in 2 Corinthians Paul does not talk like this. Actually he says very little about either gifts or power. As used in 2 Corinthians, gift does not refer to miraculous gifts, and power does not have the connotation commonly given by Christians today. If you read carefully through the entire book of 2 Corinthians, you will see that Paul’s concentration is on life. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85010" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">6:1—7:16</span> we see that he worked together with God by an all-fitting life. </p>
<p data-content-id="muHafN-ILtAYeBa5rCiGrZeAqj5x_pHm3PwDsp6yEwJyH9-WaG0rXZzKN8RdvDILu"> Being a minister of the New Testament does not depend on gifts or power; rather, it depends on having a life which is able to fit into any kind of situation. To be sure, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85011" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1-13">6:1-13</span> the word all-fitting is not used. But if you consider what is contained in these verses, you will see that they describe a life which certainly is all-fitting. As we shall see in a later message, here Paul mentions eighteen qualifications, three groups of items, and seven kinds of persons. Paul, therefore, was qualified to be a minister of the new covenant in all these ways. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZqAjSO9LixKc_F2NRK9fXc76Cf3n_v9KDTxBD08VKKBOTnM6X34wk61RvjbLDfwsH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85012" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1-13">6:1-13</span> Paul does not list among the qualifications such things as philosophy or psychology. If we would be proper ministers of the new covenant, we must have the eighteen qualifications mentioned by Paul and three groups of items, and we need to be seven kinds of persons. Only in this way can we be qualified to be a co-worker with God for His New Testament ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="AE9CEdRlVZ0DfzvVD9YH94VL_i-X9J56-zGNdKH8zjh81ESQHHyJQoNdtgNJws_Lr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85013" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">6:1</span> Paul does not say that the apostles work together with one another. No, he says that they were working together with God. The apostles were not only commissioned <span class="pg" data-page-id="342" id="342">[342]</span> by God with their ministry, but they also worked together with Him. They were God’s co-workers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85014" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Cor. 3:9</span>). Paul and his co-workers were working together with God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FXS_xlsr3gzjoDc53zkOKTBo0Wu8y0MncqEW33QyX0PDpj4qrLlX-GYZybGMhOX53">RECONCILED INTO GOD</h2><p data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwkXtn_zsujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG"> If we would have a proper understanding of what it means to work together with God, we need to recall what Paul said at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85015" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">chapter five</span>. Paul has already said that he has been commissioned by God with the ministry of reconciliation, that is, with the work of reconciling others to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42R69k3uyWYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4"> Many years ago, I had a very limited understanding of reconciliation. My understanding was that before we were saved, we were enemies of God, and there was no peace between us and God. Instead of peace, we were at enmity with God. But when we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, His blood washed away our sins, and we received God’s forgiveness. As a result, we were justified by God and reconciled to Him. Having been reconciled to God in this way, there was no longer enmity between us and God. Instead, we had peace with Him. This understanding of reconciliation falls far short of the full meaning of reconciliation in the New Testament. It is not the full significance of reconciliation as ministered by the Apostle Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="-fHkLKWj9SQ91tLa1G364G4pOcTRoaCMvHerZ1OLM3u8vtBx03384wRIRHSxo1kdf"> What is the reconciliation ministered by Paul? I have read a number of books which refer to this subject, but none of them pointed out that the ministry of reconciliation is not merely to bring sinners back to God, but, even the more, to bring believers absolutely into God. Hence, it is not sufficient simply to be brought back to God; we must also be in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="pbBnT8P58uzq4V0jIiQ68lujBXFx65nhPRbwuWNLsZuuDDkZCUidRP80lkw5FcmBk"> The last verse of chapter five, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85016" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">verse 21</span>, says, “Him Who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God’s righteousness in Him.” According to this verse, we become the righteousness of God not merely through Christ, with Christ, or by Christ; we become the righteousness of God in Christ. From this verse we also see that we become not only righteous before God; we become the very <span class="pg" data-page-id="343" id="343">[343]</span> righteousness of God. To be righteous is one thing, but to become righteousness is something else. For example, a certain thing may be golden, but it may not be pure gold. How wonderful that in Christ we may become the very righteousness of God! </p>

<p data-content-id="9y_RCEn53QXJX8AG7BzDo03GiIrcVdFzVKBpVbnWh8fFM7yeaCSVDU7M5P31_v8wC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85047" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:4">verse 4</span> Paul says, “But in everything commending ourselves as ministers of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85048" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:4-7">verses 4 through 7</span> Paul gives us the first category of qualifications of the ministers of God, the ministers of the new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85049" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">3:6</span>). When I read these verses many years ago, I was bothered by the fact that the first qualification given by Paul is endurance. I thought that in speaking of the qualifications of New Testament ministers, Paul should have begun with something great. Instead, he begins with the words “in much endurance.” If a believer today were to apply to be a medical missionary, surely he would mention his education. Would he instead claim that he possesses the qualification of endurance? Nevertheless, the first qualification listed by Paul is endurance. <span class="pg" data-page-id="350" id="350">[350]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSwHXWOE7P6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk"> Many translators agree that the Greek word rendered endurance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85050" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:4">6:4</span> implies patience. Some versions use the word patience instead of endurance. However, to render the Greek word as patience is not sufficient. There is a difference between patience and endurance. Of course, both patience and endurance are positive virtues. But patience falls short of endurance. Patience does not imply suffering, whereas endurance does imply suffering. If you talk to me for a long period of time, I shall need patience in order to listen to you. But if it is necessary to undergo some kind of suffering, I would need endurance in addition to patience. </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDG4XlpB5yIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> The first qualification of a New Testament minister is the capacity to endure tribulation. Such a minister must be able to endure pressure, oppression, persecution, poverty, and any kind of trial. Brother Watchman Nee once said that the most powerful person is a person who can endure. Endurance requires strength. If we would endure tribulation, we need to be strengthened and become powerful. </p>
<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCPSHvmbQbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> Endurance was manifested in Brother Nee during the twenty years of his imprisonment. It is one thing to be an instant martyr; it is something very different to be in prison for many years. An instant martyr may be arrested, tried, and executed, all within a short period of time. For this, endurance is not necessary. But if one is cast into prison and then made subject to trial over a period of years, endurance is absolutely necessary. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hMyExre1zbM0fe_x-GmaBEs6q87iO-T9eBlbldFqy5h3nbIoZkpmSlQGlIoMTxNS"> Every minister of the New Testament must learn how to endure. The apostles, the elders, and the deacons all need endurance. Certain saints are very good at exhausting the elders. At this point let me say a word to those brothers who aspire to be elders: You must be ready for continual grinding. If you are put into the eldership, you will be placed between the grinding stones. Some brothers and sisters will grind you constantly. They seem to have a “commission” to test the spirituality of the elders. Through them you will be put on the test to see how long you can endure. But when we endure, we minister life to others. Those who have endurance are those who minister life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="351" id="351">[351]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weZEH08pvAY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx">In Afflictions</h2><p data-content-id="3x4y4bH-jSB8_0__dQRX-nn-7_QC7aefq8LIx3t0iw83hJtljo8fD-KpeOzqVxFkY"> Paul refers to his afflictions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85051" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:8">1:8</span>: “For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, as to our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living.” This is another qualification for him to be a minister of the new covenant. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="GBLvlFuZpxpOzPlHECwzEvBrtGtiuqGT35VHcvZbsVtjWxkMb27nu2FPxyYbaMXgd">In Necessities</h2><p data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ2dHM-q0H014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB"> It is difficult to grasp the real meaning of the word rendered necessities. Darby in his translation also uses the word necessities. The Chinese version uses the word poverty. Whenever we are in want, short of food, lodging, or clothing, we are in necessities. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85052" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:10">12:10</span>, where the same Greek word is used, the Chinese version uses a word meaning straits. The Greek word means constraints, urgent needs that press heavily. It refers to sufferings that result from calamities and straits. An example of calamity would be the eruption of Mount Saint Helens some time ago. That was a calamity to those in the vicinity of the volcano. The result of such a calamity is want, shortage of daily necessities. Paul passed through many calamities and straits and, as a result, was in necessities. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_pNpNa3pHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> Today Christians evaluate one who is a servant of God not by his experience in necessities but by his riches. If someone possesses great riches, he is considered blessed by the Lord. But if a believer becomes poor, lacking in food, housing, clothing, or other necessities for daily living, many would say of him, “This brother is not approved by God. Because God is not happy with him or pleased with him, He does not bless him.” What, then, about Paul, who was in necessities? Surely he was approved by God. We should not think that riches are a sign that we are blessed by the Lord or approved by Him. On the contrary, it may be that want, necessity, and poverty are the true qualifications of a minister of the new covenant. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExGtHzfr7LpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF">In Distresses</h2><p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QWGDmEXNP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85053" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:4">verse 4</span> Paul also speaks of distresses. Literally the <span class="pg" data-page-id="352" id="352">[352]</span> Greek word rendered distresses means narrowness of room; hence, straits, difficulties, distresses. It is not easy to explain the difference between afflictions and distresses. Some translators even reverse the order of these words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85054" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:4">verse 4</span>, using distresses for afflictions, and afflictions for distresses. We may say that distresses are the inward sufferings which come as a reaction to the outward afflictions. </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnH0m2f4SdTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> From the various words Paul uses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85055" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:4">verse 4</span> we know that he was in different kinds of troubles. This verse clearly indicates that Paul’s life was a life of affliction, calamity, straits, necessities, and distresses. Do you like to hear about this? Do you still want to be a minister of the new covenant when you hear about Paul’s difficulties and troubles? Today many young men are encouraged to be ministerial students. After graduating from a seminary, they may find a good job as a pastor or minister. They may be provided housing and an adequate salary. Paul, however, was not that kind of minister, and he did not live that kind of life. Instead, his life, the life that qualified him to be a new covenant minister, was a life of endurance, affliction, necessities, and distresses. </p>

<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnH0u2fIadTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> Some believers have been saved to a large degree. Others, however, have been saved only to a very small extent. In these messages I am burdened that we all would have a greater degree of salvation. I am concerned about the percentage of your salvation. To what degree, to what extent, have you been saved? Some who have been under this ministry for years still only have a very limited salvation. Furthermore, the percentage of their salvation is increasing slowly. My point here is that reconciliation and salvation are matters of degree. This is especially true of reconciliation. I am hoping that the degree of our reconciliation into God will increase rapidly. </p>
<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEsGoReY9VYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> What we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85135" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">chapter six</span> is progress related to salvation. According to the context, to be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85136" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:2">6:2</span>) is simply to be reconciled to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHewKL-TLZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> As long as certain parts of us are not saved, in those parts of our being there is a discrepancy between us and God. A more accurate word to describe this condition is enmity. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85137" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> Paul says the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God. But the mind set on the spirit is life and peace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85138" data-verses="Romans 8:6">Rom. 8:6</span>). When we are in spirit, we have life and also peace. Peace is an indication of being reconciled to God. As long as there is something within us that is lacking in peace, some part of us is at enmity with God. This indicates that, at least in certain matters, we have not been reconciled to God, for in these matters there is no peace between us and God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="367" id="367">[367]</span> To be sure, whenever there is no peace, there is enmity. But when peace comes, enmity disappears. We may also say that when enmity goes, peace comes. Whether or not we are at peace depends on our being reconciled to God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh1PQ2yzIRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss">NOT RECEIVING THE GRACE OF GOD IN VAIN</h2><p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYoQKwPsB_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85139" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">6:1</span> Paul says to the Corinthians, “And working together with Him, we also entreat you that you do not receive the grace of God in vain.” Here Paul seems to be saying, “Believers at Corinth, don’t receive God’s grace in vain. God has graced you very much. He has bestowed grace upon grace on you. Since you have received so much of God’s grace, I beg you not to receive it in vain.” To receive the grace of God in vain means to receive grace without making any progress in the matter of being saved. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbHnLQd4X5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> If we would be those who do not receive the grace of God in vain, we need more salvation. This is the reason Paul goes on to say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85140" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:2">verse 2</span>, “For He says, In an acceptable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I helped you; behold, now is a well-acceptable time; behold, now is a day of salvation.” Preachers often use this verse for the preaching of the gospel. In their gospel preaching they say something like this: “Now is the time, the day, of salvation. Don’t miss the opportunity to receive God’s grace.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85141" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">verse 1</span>, however, Paul does not speak about receiving God’s grace; he warns about receiving God’s grace in vain. The Corinthians had already received the grace of God. Their need was to allow this grace to work in them. If they allowed the grace of God to work in them, they would not receive God’s grace in vain. This is to be reconciled to God in full and in every respect. Furthermore, this is to experience a present salvation. Today should be a day of further salvation, a day of progress in being reconciled to God through His grace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEegfPiNbSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu">THE NEED TO BE ENLARGED IN HEART</h2><p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2ZKCl8upRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> If we would be fully reconciled to God, fully saved, we need to be enlarged in our heart. Paul appealed to the Corinthians to be enlarged: “You are not straitened in us, but you <span class="pg" data-page-id="368" id="368">[368]</span> are straitened in your inward parts; now for a recompense in kind, I speak as to children, you also be enlarged” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85142" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:12-13">6:12-13</span>). As we have pointed out, to be enlarged requires the aspects of the all-fitting life covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85143" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:3-10">6:3-10</span>. It requires the eighteen items beginning with “in”: in endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings, in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love, in the word of truth, in the power of God. It also requires the three pairs starting with “through”: through the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report. Finally, it requires all the seven pairs beginning with “as”: as deceivers and yet true, as unknown and well known, as dying and behold we live, as being disciplined and not being put to death, as made sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet enriching many, as having nothing and possessing all things. If we have all these characteristics of the all-fitting life, all the items with “in,” “through,” and “as,” we have truly been enlarged. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wrguUic7fcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> In the past fifty years I have known many dear and precious brothers who were elders and co-workers. A good number of these brothers were very strict and straight. Regarding the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85144" data-verses="Matthew 10:16">Matthew 10:16</span> to be “prudent as serpents,” these straight ones could not at all be “as serpents.” Neither could they be “as deceivers, yet true.” To be true here means to be straight. The brothers to whom I am referring were not only strict; they were extremely straight. For example, one such brother might say, “Oh, that person shouldn’t be in the church. Cast him out! How can we possibly accept him? Oh, that sister is awful. She should be condemned.” Many times we tried our best to convince these straight brothers to be more flexible. We might say, “This one is a real brother in the Lord. No doubt, he is wrong in certain things. But we still must embrace him by forgiving him and by giving him an opportunity to improve.” Nevertheless, sometimes a straight brother would respond by saying, “No! That is not the biblical way!” This attitude is a clear <span class="pg" data-page-id="369" id="369">[369]</span> indication that those who are strict and straight in this way need to be enlarged. </p>
<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv2Xc13_ST6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> We need to be straight and strict. However, we should be strict with ourselves, not with others. In order to be strict with ourselves and not with others, we need to be enlarged. Those who are very straight are usually narrow as well. They need to have their hearts enlarged. </p>

Now let us go on to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85147" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:14">6:14—7:1</span>, a frank exhortation of the reconciling ministry. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0HnYVQi0kVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD">NOT TO BE UNEQUALLY YOKED</h2><p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0zjGYjOch_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85148" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:14">Verse 14</span> says, “Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?” This word about not being unequally yoked was spoken by the apostle based upon his mouth being opened and his heart being enlarged to the believers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85149" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:11">verse 11</span>. Having established the fact that full reconciliation is full salvation resulting in the enlargement of the heart, Paul exhorts the Corinthian believers not to become unequally yoked with unbelievers. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2tS5Sg6Nzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> The word unequally in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85150" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:14">verse 14</span> means diversely; it denotes a difference in kind. This refers to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85151" data-verses="Deuteronomy 22:10">Deuteronomy 22:10</span>, which forbids yoking two different animals together. Believers and unbelievers are diverse peoples. They should not be yoked together, because of the believers’ divine nature and holy standing. This should be applied to all manner of intimate relationships between believers and unbelievers, not only to their marriages and businesses. </p>
<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVyp3f4ZmDyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> This word indicates that the Corinthian believers were unequally yoked with unbelievers. They were not separated <span class="pg" data-page-id="372" id="372">[372]</span> unto God from worldly people. This indicates that they were not fully reconciled to God. Hence, the apostle exhorted them not to be diversely yoked with unbelievers, but to be separated that they might be fully reconciled, brought back, to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3esshxCsiRS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> According to the Old Testament, cattle were of two categories: the clean and the unclean. Those that were clean chewed the cud and had cloven hooves. Sheep and oxen were clean animals, but donkeys, horses, mules, and pigs were not clean. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85152" data-verses="Deuteronomy 22:10">Deuteronomy 22:10</span> says, “Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.” Here we see that the law commanded the children of Israel not to yoke together a clean animal with an unclean one, not to put the clean and the unclean under the same yoke. A clean animal, such as an ox, could be offered to God, but an unclean animal could not be offered to Him. Therefore, the clean and the unclean were unequal. </p>
<p data-content-id="HBnt4SwtmItWiwiqI0PmS5SoF6HanOgY9HFRmv9yTfj2hxGvMiNVng7WQlZnI5E96"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85153" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:14">6:14</span> Paul does not care for the teaching of the law; he cares for the spiritual significance of this requirement. Today we, the believers, are the clean ones. We are the oxen and the lambs to be offered to God. Unbelievers, however, are unclean, and we should not be yoked together with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWjZZj3JeMVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9"> To be yoked together with unbelievers is to be distracted from God. To rid ourselves of such an unequal yoke is to come back to God and to be reconciled into Him. For example, a brother should not marry an unbeliever. For him to marry an unbeliever is to be unequally yoked. That kind of unequal yoke would distract him from God. Likewise, to form a partnership in business with an unbeliever is also to be unequally yoked. Suppose a believer and an unbeliever are partners together in a business and have the same interest and goal. They are actually an unequally yoked pair. This kind of pairing, yoking, needs to be terminated. Anyone who engages in a business partnership in this way will be distracted by his business from God. His business will take him farther and farther away from God. Any brother in that situation needs to cast off that unequal yoke in business and be reconciled, brought back, into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcU-b6nRprUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> Furthermore, friendships with unbelievers can cause us <span class="pg" data-page-id="373" id="373">[373]</span> to be unequally yoked. The young people especially like to make friends. Young brothers and sisters, if you have close friendships with unbelievers, that will cause you to become an unequally yoked pair. That kind of yoking will distract you from God. Your unbelieving friend will not help you to come closer to God; rather, an unbelieving friend will take you away from Him. As long as you maintain such an unequal friendship, you will be distracted from God more and more and taken gradually farther away from Him. Therefore, Paul charges us not to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers for the purpose that we may be kept in God and may be brought back fully into Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQsOEVt9qrzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BELIEVERS<br/>AND UNBELIEVERS</h2><p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QOEogeDtADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85154" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:14-16">6:14-16</span> the apostle uses five illustrations to depict the difference between believers and unbelievers: no partnership, no share, between righteousness and lawlessness; no fellowship, no communion, between light and darkness; no harmony, no concord, between Christ and Belial; no part, no portion, held by a believer with an unbeliever; and no agreement, no consent, between the temple of God and idols. These illustrations also unveil the fact that the believers are righteousness, light, Christ, and the temple of God, and the unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, Belial (Satan the Devil), and idols. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0HnYVRGAkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85155" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:14">verse 14</span> Paul says, “What partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?” There should not be any sort of contact between righteousness and lawlessness. There should be no relationship, no partnership, between them. Likewise, light and darkness have nothing to do with each other. They cannot have any fellowship. As believers, we are in the light. If we have fellowship, or intimate friendship, with unbelievers, that kind of friendship is fellowship between light and darkness. For a believer to marry an unbeliever is for that believer to have fellowship of light with darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0zjGYjMIp_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85156" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:15">verse 15</span> Paul continues, “And what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what part has a believer with an unbeliever?” <span class="pg" data-page-id="374" id="374">[374]</span> Belial is another name for Satan, the Devil. There can be no harmony between Christ and the Devil. We believers are of Christ, and the unbelievers are of Satan. If we have friendship with unbelievers, that means we are making harmony between Christ and Satan. A believer does not have any part with an unbeliever. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2tS5Si-Bzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85157" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:16">verse 16</span> Paul goes on to say, “And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.” Here we see that there can be no agreement between the temple of God and idols. Unbelievers have idols, but we are the temple of God. How then can there be any close relationship between believers and unbelievers? </p>

<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIdVfYCWZgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85159" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span> Paul says that we are the church of the living God. The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church and not merely objective. An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless. The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living. Because He is living, the church is also living in Him, by Him, and with Him. A living God and a living church live, move, and work together. The living church is the house and the household of the living God. Hence, it becomes the manifestation of God in the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVfC2DmgWzDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> God has said, “I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85160" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:16">2 Cor. 6:16</span>).

The words “what is unclean” denote that which belongs to lawlessness, darkness, Belial, and idols, as listed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85163" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:14-16">verses 14 through 16</span>. By not touching such unclean things we are separated to God and reconciled to Him. Therefore, to come out from their midst and be separated is to be brought back to God. When we are separated in this way, God welcomes us. The words, “I will welcome you,” point to God’s glad receiving of the believers who are fully reconciled, brought back, to Him. </p>

In reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85183" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:2-16">7:2-16</span>, the crucial matter is to touch Paul’s feeling and also his spirit.

Every believer who loves the Lord and who wants to come up to God’s standard should become a minister of the new covenant. As long as we are believers in Christ, we should be New Testament ministers, no matter whether we happen to be apostles, evangelists, elders, or deacons. Such a minister is a person who supplies Christ to others for the building up of the church, His Body. When I was young I heard that every believer should be a preacher of the gospel. Now we see that we should be not merely gospel preachers, but ministers of the new covenant, those who minister Christ as life so that the church may be built up as the Body of Christ. This ministry should be carried out not only by apostles and elders; it should be carried out by everyone in the church. </p>

For us all to be church builders, to minister Christ for the building up of the church, we need a ministering life. In order to be new covenant ministers we need such a ministering life. We need to live a life of ministering Christ to others for the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbHnTQd435eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> Many years ago I read various books that encouraged believers to be spiritual, holy, and victorious. But I never read one book charging us to live a ministering life. Many of us have read books on how to be spiritual, how to live a holy life, or how to be victorious. But have you ever read a book telling you how to live a ministering life? I do not believe any of us has read such a book. </p>
<p data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEegHPiN7SeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu"> In my travels over a period of about fifty years, I have met many different kinds of Christians. In particular I have met some who had a reputation for being spiritual. But to my registration even these so-called spiritual ones did not have a proper ministering life. They lived in a very careful manner in order to be “spiritual,” “holy,” and “victorious.” But they did not live in such a way as to be ministering ones. By the Lord’s grace, not by our own efforts, we all should endeavor to live a ministering life. </p>

We may be “spiritual,” “holy,” and “victorious” and yet not be fruitful. There are problems with that kind of spirituality, holiness, and victory. It is questionable whether those qualities are true and genuine. Is it not unusual that one could be “spiritual” without being fruitful? According to the Bible, being spiritual is for the purpose of being fruitful. In the Gospel of John the Lord does not tell us to be spiritual, holy, and victorious. Rather, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85186" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> He charges us to bear fruit, even to bear much fruit, abiding fruit. This is to live a ministering life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="381" id="381">[381]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv2XE13PKT6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> Around my home there are a number of fruit trees—peach, lemon, and orange. For quite a long period of time, certain trees did not bear any fruit. Because of the lack of fruit, we were considering whether we should remove them. Although these trees did not bear fruit, they continued to grow quite well. In fact, they were green and flourishing, full of leaves. Nevertheless, the more they grew in that way, the more bothered I was concerning them. Sometimes when I looked at those trees I said, “What are you trees doing here? You are full of green leaves, and your branches are spreading forth, but you are not bearing any fruit.” We may take this as an illustration of believers who may be “spiritual,” “holy,” and “victorious,” but are fruitless. They do not bear fruit because they do not have a ministering life. It is very important to see that we all must have a ministering life. </p>
<p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8Wq7LVS9xV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> In my early days, I heard several messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85187" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">2 Corinthians 7</span>. The emphasis of those messages was on sorrowing according to God. Those messages pointed out that if we sorrow according to God, we shall not regret being sorrowful. But although I heard some messages on this point, I was not told anything about Paul’s feeling and spirit in this chapter. Here we see his intimate concern. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="123M5cSNMEj-7uz-rGkoC46zlbHtHXa8O5cwRsOF1iusSytY9NpKTJ_yPM6vOLmNG">THE NEED FOR GENUINE CONCERN</h2><p data-content-id="9y_RCEn53QXJX8AG7BzDo03GiIrcVdFzVKB5VZjih8fFM7yeaCSVDU7M5P31_v8wC"> It is possible to become knowledgeable in spiritual matters and powerful in preaching and yet still be unfruitful. In fact, instead of being fruitful and ministering life, such a person may cause others to suffer death. A brother may even visit another locality and hold a conference, but the results of that conference may be that many are killed. They are killed not by wrong words, but by right words. Furthermore, in the shepherding of the saints, it is also possible that we may kill others. The reason for this killing, this fruitlessness, is the lack of intimate concern. A brother who has a conference with a particular church may be concerned only for the giving of messages; he may not have any genuine concern for the church in that locality. Likewise, we may visit a family to <span class="pg" data-page-id="382" id="382">[382]</span> shepherd them, but we may not have any loving concern. Rather, our motive may be to display our knowledge, spirituality, gift, or capability. The result is a killing. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSMwwolTnQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> Some mothers seem to be short of wisdom. Yet even though they are not clever, they raise their children in a very good way because they have a loving concern for them. Such mothers have a tender, intimate concern for their children. On the contrary, some step-mothers may be knowledgeable, gifted, and clever; however, they lack the necessary concern for the children. In taking care of children, what is most important is not knowledge or ability—it is an intimate concern. The same is true in taking care of churches or in shepherding the saints. What is needed is the intimate concern of a ministering life. The brothers who hold conferences with churches must have a genuine concern for the churches. They should not merely be interested in giving excellent messages as a display of their knowledge, talent, or capability. </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAcKysO9Iy_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> When I was young, I was somewhat troubled by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85188" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span> of 2 Corinthians. I regarded the Bible as a sacred, classical book, and it seemed to me that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85189" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">2 Corinthians 7</span> was not a classical writing. I could understand why chapters like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85190" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85191" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> were in the Bible, but I did not know why a chapter like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85192" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">2 Corinthians 7</span> was included. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85193" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:6">verse 6</span> Paul says that he was encouraged by the coming of Titus, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85194" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:7">verse 7</span> he goes on to say, “And not only by his coming, but also by the encouragement with which he was encouraged over you, informing us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal on my behalf, so that I rejoiced the more.” It seemed to me that such a verse should not be in the Bible. Have you ever checked why <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85195" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">2 Corinthians 7</span> is in the New Testament? If you have never thought about it, this may indicate that you are somewhat careless in reading the Word. I can testify that the more attention I pay to this chapter, the more I love it, and the more I learn from it and am affected by it. </p>
<p data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKQYzUGOor7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc"> This chapter reveals that we need an intimate concern. If we have ability to carry on a work but lack an intimate concern, our work will be fruitless. What is needed to establish <span class="pg" data-page-id="383" id="383">[383]</span> a good family life and church life is intimate concern. How fruitful we are, how much fruit we bear, does not depend on what we are able to do. It depends on whether or not we have an intimate concern. </p>

I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.” Paul’s word here reveals his deep, intimate concern for the Corinthians. This utterance is not merely something ethical, religious, spiritual, or even loving. It is possible to say a word of love and feel love for others, but still not have much concern for them. Our love for others must become our concern for them. Paul had such a concern for the believers at Corinth. </p>
<p data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ2dTM_OAH014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB"> A mother has not only love for her child; she also has a deep concern. Only a woman with such a concern is qualified to be a proper mother. A woman may be lacking in education, but if she has a deep concern for her children, she is qualified to be a good mother. Of course, knowledge and ability are helpful, but they are not prerequisites. The unique prerequisite for being a good mother is concern. The same principle is true regarding caring for the church. It is not adequate for the elders simply to love the church. This love must become a deep concern, a concern for all the young ones and weaker ones. This concern causes our labor to be fruitful. We all need this kind of intimate concern for others. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_pN9NYjhHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> Not long ago, when I was working on this chapter, I was wondering what word I could use to describe Paul’s feeling. I realized that Paul’s word here is not something that is merely ethical, moral, religious, or spiritual. What he says <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> here is a matter of intimate concern, of deep, tender, affectionate concern for the believers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85216" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:2">verse 2</span> Paul says, “Make room for us,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85217" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:3">verse 3</span> he declares, “You are in our hearts to die together and to live together.” These are not ordinary human words. Rather, they are words from the heavens, words from the heart of God. Paul’s longing was that just as he had the Corinthians in his heart, so he would be in their heart. The believers at Corinth were in Paul’s heart both to live together and to die together. This surely is a word expressing an intimate concern. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExGtTzdv3LpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85218" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:8">verse 8</span> Paul goes on to say, “Because even if I caused you sorrow by the letter, I do not regret it, even if I did regret it; because I see that that letter, even if for an hour, caused you sorrow.” By the word “letter” Paul refers to his first Epistle to the Corinthians. His word concerning regret indicates that he was not only bold and frank in rebuking the believers in his first Epistle, but also tender and soft toward them. The words “caused you sorrow” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85219" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:8">verse 8</span> show that the apostle’s first Epistle to the believers at Corinth was effective in regard to them. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0zjGAjMIJ_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B">A SOFT, TENDER WORD</h2><p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2tShSi-hzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85220" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:8">verse 8</span> Paul uses the expression “even if” three times. He says “even if I caused you sorrow,” “even if I did regret it,” and “even if for an hour.” Why does Paul keep saying “even if”? According to my understanding, if the words “even if” were removed, Paul’s word in this verse would be too hard. Adding in the phrase “even if” has the effect of softening his word. Furthermore, without the use of this phrase Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85221" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:8">verse 8</span> would be strongly vindicating himself and arguing on his own behalf. By adding “even if” three times, he reduces the impression that he is vindicating himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8CmTmd3ZdYKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> Married brothers may wish to learn of Paul in order to avoid arguments with their wives. As a brother is talking to his wife, he may find that by inserting the words “even if” he may soften his word to her and thereby keep from offending her. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVvkCW8mP2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK"> Moreover, by the phrase “even if” Paul gives a sweet taste <span class="pg" data-page-id="389" id="389">[389]</span> to his words. Paul’s use of “even if” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85222" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:8">verse 8</span> may be compared to adding honey to a cup of tea. Just as the taste of tea may be too strong without honey, so Paul’s words may have been too strong to receive without the repeated use of “even if.” By using this phrase three times, Paul softens his word and sweetens it. </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIdVHYCmBgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> As Paul was writing to the Corinthians, all the facts and the arguments were on his side. The Corinthians had no case whatever. Because Paul had won the case, he could easily have written something that would have been very hard for the Corinthians to accept. Therefore, in writing to them he was both wise and tender. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVfCuDmQOzDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> If we have an intimate concern, we shall be tender with others. A crude, insensitive person does not have an intimate concern. If a husband does not have a proper concern for his wife, he may be very strict and demanding of her. But having an intimate concern will cause him to be tender. Once we become tender, our way of speaking will be soft and sweet. </p>
<p data-content-id="_4w9Ar9Vyp0N_HoNrdaOQWC9shEsus7o-5r2Mp82ngRtO9yGHFVltw-zoF6hLKtMB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85223" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:8">Verse 8</span> definitely has the element of softness. Paul says, “Even if I caused you sorrow by the letter, I do not regret it, even if I did regret it.” There is softness here. But suppose Paul had said, “In writing you the first Epistle I did not do anything wrong and I had no regrets about it.” Surely that way of speaking would have been offensive. Paul, however, did not express himself in such a manner. He softened his words by adding the phrase “even if.” In this way Paul expressed his tender feeling for the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkg0TXilHkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> We need to be impressed by the fact that Paul’s way of speaking in this verse is soft and sweet. Therefore, no matter what he says, he does not cause any offense. The kind of expression Paul uses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85224" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:8">verse 8</span> does not offend others. Instead of being hard and bitter, it is soft and sweet. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18dWkQop0-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> In writing to the Corinthians, Paul did not speak in a hasty manner. Often when we speak in haste we express anger. For example, if a sister complains to her husband about something he has done, he may hastily reply, “What’s wrong with me? Prove to me that I am mistaken!” This kind of word provokes anger. It is better for a brother not to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="390" id="390">[390]</span> hasty in speech in order to calm down the situation with his wife. He needs to speak in a soft, pleasant manner. This is the way Paul wrote to the Corinthians in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85225" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i_z8q5FCF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> In this chapter we do not find theology, ethics, or religion. In a sense, we do not even find spirituality. Without adequate experience, we are not able to describe what is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85226" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">2 Corinthians 7</span>. I have begun to understand this chapter not only through study, but also through experience, even though my experience has been limited. From experience I have realized that what Paul is speaking here is not theology or doctrine, ethics or morality, religion or spirituality. He is conveying a deep, tender, and intimate concern for the Corinthians. His word is very touching. </p>
<p data-content-id="dChzg2DUKpIBDLedcWn1ydFKoiHfeFV0KAAWJs0L5ldzIRhtliB64uqos5WWmePIs"> Because Paul’s expression is tender and filled with intimate concern, it has power and impact. It is able to touch the believers deeply. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85227" data-verses="Proverbs 25:15">Proverbs 25:15</span> says, “A soft tongue breaketh the bone.” Even a hard bone can be broken by a soft word of meekness. In speaking the truth to the Corinthians and presenting the facts, Paul knew it was difficult for him to avoid condemning the Corinthians. But his tender concern for them caused him to speak soft words and sweet phrases. May we all learn of him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ql5Pg2ZNuykXsyEjASMH8B5GtMoTjCdfD2rxdj23nWm2lFgAKpLfM_KLzMYyqkpuP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85228" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:9">verse 9</span> Paul says, “Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to God, that in nothing you might suffer loss from us.” The repentance mentioned here was the result the apostle sought in writing his first Epistle. The apostle’s first Epistle made them sorrowful according to God, not for anything else. This indicates that they have been brought back to God, reconciled to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSwHDWO0zP6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk"> It seems that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85229" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:9">verse 9</span> Paul has only a small point to make, yet he deliberately lengthens his expression. This also shows his tenderness, his intimate concern. </p>

<p data-content-id="tvgSJ2wtiC2ezuQmd48nlA7Rm-nPAdiIbHnbQcMf5eSmDAMtrPrZo36FUj-CL8jFo"> Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians as a loving father. In his first Epistle Paul disciplined the Corinthians. Parents know that in disciplining children we run the risk of alienating them. If a parent disciplines a child without limitation, the child may want to run away from home. After writing 1 Corinthians, Paul was concerned about how the believers at Corinth would react to his discipline. Paul was not at rest about the matter, and he even regretted somewhat writing that Epistle. He was concerned that the entire church in Corinth would be alienated from him. Because of his deep concern, he was eagerly awaiting Titus to bring him news of the response of the Corinthians to his first Epistle. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85256" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:1">chapter two</span> Paul did not have rest in his spirit, for he did not find Titus. But we see from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85257" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span> that Titus came with good news. </p>
<p data-content-id="hmxu1jdArNHu61_riTiUX0v-8dA83UZIEegPPjpXSeiLzE639IvsU7JIN5GK-_mMu"> Paul’s first Epistle had caused sorrow to the Corinthians, but this sorrow produced repentance unto salvation. That salvation was a full reconciliation. When Paul heard this good news, he was beside himself with joy. As he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85258" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:13">7:13</span>, “We rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus.” When he wrote his second Epistle, Paul was in such an atmosphere of encouragement and joy. Thus, as we read <span class="pg" data-page-id="398" id="398">[398]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85259" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span>, we can touch the feeling in Paul’s spirit, a feeling of deep concern for the church in Corinth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2ZKSl-KBRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD">DEEP FELLOWSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wrg-UgoXfcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> All those who would care for the churches or serve the Lord need to be impressed with Paul’s spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85260" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">chapter seven</span>. Here we see the proper attitude in serving the Lord. We also see that in ancient times the fellowship between the believers and the apostles was not as shallow as it is among believers today. In ancient times, the believers were in the hearts of the apostles, and the apostles were in the hearts of the believers. The fellowship among them all was very deep. They lived together in such a deep fellowship that they were even willing to die together. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSMw4olTHQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> The situation among many Christians today is very different. Christians may travel from group to group without having deep fellowship. For them, a Christian group is like a hotel where people come, stay for a while, and then go elsewhere. Our fellowship in the Lord’s recovery should not be like this. The local churches should not be motels for those traveling from place to place. As members of our Father’s family, our fellowship should be deep. We should be in one another’s hearts, and nothing should be able to separate us from one another. Even if we are disciplined by others, we should still love the church family and never forsake it. </p>

Apparently this has nothing to do with what Paul has covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85262" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">chapters six and seven</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85263" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1-2">2 Corinthians 6 and 7</span> we have Paul’s work of reconciliation, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85264" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapters eight and nine</span>, the ministry to the needy saints. Without the reconciliation described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85265" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">chapters six and seven</span>, it is not possible to have the ministry to the needy saints presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85266" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapters eight and nine</span>. Hence, the ministry in these chapters is the issue of the work of reconciliation in the preceding chapters. This means that if we would carry <span class="pg" data-page-id="399" id="399">[399]</span> on a proper ministry to the needy saints, we need to be reconciled to God, brought back to Him in full. We need to be those living in God, those who have no separation between them and God. The ministry to the needy saints recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85267" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapters eight and nine</span> is extraordinary. In order to have this extraordinary ministry, a ministry to the needy saints in other parts of the world, we need a reconciled life, a life fully reconciled to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MNIriqomoCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj"> In his second Epistle, Paul first pointed out to the believers at Corinth that as ministers of the new covenant, the apostles had received the ministry to reconcile God’s people fully back to Himself. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85268" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">chapter six</span> Paul carried on this ministry, doing a fine work to reconcile the distracted Corinthians back to God in full. After accomplishing such a work, he went on to fellowship with them that they should have a ministry to supply the needy saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9jhob0gUGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> The sequence in these chapters is important. If <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85269" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapters eight and nine</span> were at the beginning of this book, they would certainly be out of place. But one chapter follows another like steps in a staircase. I believe that as Paul was writing this Epistle he had the sense that he was taking one step after another. Only after he had done an excellent work to reconcile the distracted saints back to God did he present them with the ministry of caring for the needy saints. Thus, we should not regard these chapters as separated and isolated. Apparently <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85270" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapters eight and nine</span> are on a different subject from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85271" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">chapters six and seven</span>. Actually in Paul’s thought all these chapters are connected. </p>
<p data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8a1Jek8Y6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr"> Through Paul’s reconciling work, the saints in Corinth were brought back to God, repented, and received more salvation. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85272" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">8:1</span> Paul says, “Furthermore, we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia.” The word “furthermore” indicates that certain preparations have been made and that a particular atmosphere and condition exist for the writer to present something further. Thus, Paul goes on to speak of the grace of God bestowed upon the churches of Macedonia. <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> His aim was that the Corinthian believers would participate in supplying the needy saints. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wNe845Y8ijQ5dKg6d7KErQ-XLlzu45pbRcLAIe7A12hM0LmqbZ_Oxp9c_fGFhtXWL">A FOURFOLD GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="LQqlRcKCaH1qNoR9pCwjeaEM_YJjhABbev42FqHc4jtib6znl17X3ZC_aTXbYtnrJ"> Today it is common for Christians to engage in fund raising to meet the need for material supply. Often, fund-raising letters are sent out to encourage Christians to give. If you compare these fund-raising letters with what Paul has written in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85273" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1-2">2 Corinthians 8 and 9</span>, those letters will be exposed as being worthless. Compared to what Paul has written, they are altogether lacking in value, life, and spirit. For the most part, they do nothing more than urge others to give money. In a sense, in these chapters Paul is engaged in fund raising. But his way of handling material needs is absolutely in the Spirit and full of life, altogether different from the practice of today’s Christian organizations. Paul does not merely talk about money; he speaks concerning the grace of God in a way that is full of life and the Spirit. Paul’s writing in these chapters has considerable spiritual weight. </p>
<p data-content-id="muHafN-ILtAYeBa5rCiGrZeAqj5x_pHm3OA_sp6CEwJyH9-WaG0rXZzKN8RdvDILu"> If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85274" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1-15">8:1-15</span> carefully, we shall see that grace here involves four parties: God, the giving ones, the apostles, and Christ. Thus, we may speak of a fourfold grace—the grace of God, the grace of the givers, the grace of the apostles, and the grace of Christ. Actually, Paul is not merely raising funds. Much more, he is seeking to stir up the saints to participate in the ministry to the needy ones. In order to participate in such a ministry to supply the needy saints, we need a fourfold grace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZqAjSO9LixKc_F2NRK9fXc76Cf3n_v9KDSB9D08lKKBOTnM6X34wk61RvjbLDfwsH">THE GRACE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="AE9CEdRlVZ0DfzvVD9YH94VL_i-X9J56-y2xdK3kzjh81ESQHHyJQoNdtgNJws_Lr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85275" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">8:1</span> Paul mentions the grace of God given in the churches of Macedonia. This grace is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85276" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>) to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply. Grace is actually the Triune God becoming life and everything to us. By this grace the Macedonian believers overcame the usurpation of temporal and uncertain riches and became generous in ministering to the needy saints. <span class="pg" data-page-id="401" id="401">[401]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKQY_UHKAr7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85298" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:16-24">8:16-24</span> we have a section of this Epistle showing us what kind of persons the apostles were. In the first half of this chapter, Paul had fellowship with the saints at Corinth concerning the ministry to the needy saints in Judea. As we read this chapter, it may seem to us that this fellowship is finished by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85299" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:15">verse 15</span>, that it is perfect and complete. Paul not only had fellowship with the saints in Corinth concerning this matter, but he also presented to them the description of a situation that assured them that what he was doing was being carried out in a very proper way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MNIvirMCoCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj">MATTERS RELATED TO THE HANDLING OF MONEY</h2><p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9jhsb20sGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85300" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:16-24">Second Corinthians 8:16-24</span> can help us a great deal in our behavior with respect to money. A large proportion of the problems in society are related to money. Therefore, we all must learn to be careful in handling it. </p>
<p data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8a1Nem4k6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr"> It is beyond our ability to imagine the different kind of problems that can arise in relation to the handling of money. Money is a source of temptation. We should not consider ourselves so spiritual that we could never have a problem concerning the handling of money. Certainly none of us is more faithful or spiritual than the Apostle Paul. Nevertheless, he was cautious and careful regarding money. I believe that he was quite thoughtful concerning money matters. For this reason, after having fellowship with the saints in Corinth <span class="pg" data-page-id="410" id="410">[410]</span> concerning the ministry to the needy saints in Judea, he added <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85301" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:16-24">verses 16 through 24</span> to point out some important matters related to the handling of money. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18dWsQopU-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> In these verses we see that Paul recommended certain brothers to the Corinthian believers with respect to the ministry to the needy saints. First he recommended Titus. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85302" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:16-17">Verses 16 and 17</span> say, “But thanks be to God Who is giving the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus. Because he indeed received the entreaty, but being more earnest he went forth of his own accord to you.” The Greek word rendered earnestness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85303" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:16">verse 16</span> also means diligence. It refers to Paul’s diligence, earnestness, for the believers. The entreaty mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85304" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:17">verse 17</span> is the entreaty of the apostle. </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i_z0q5FiF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85305" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:18">Verse 18</span> says, “And we sent together with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85306" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:22">verse 22</span>, Paul refers to yet another brother: “And we sent with them our brother, whom we have proved to be diligent in many things many times, yet now much more diligent through the great confidence he has in you.” These verses indicate that in addition to Titus, two other brothers were recommended to the Corinthians. </p>
<p data-content-id="dChzg2DUKpIBDLedcWn1ydFKoiHfeFV0KAAeJsED5ldzIRhtliB64uqos5WWmePIs"> Money is very much used by the Devil to seduce man into dishonesty, but it is also involved in the ministry of material things to the saints. In order to avoid blame through man’s suspicion in this matter, the apostles sent a reputable brother to go with Titus as a witness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85307" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:22">verse 22</span> we see that another faithful brother was sent with these two, that by the mouth of three witnesses a strong testimony might be established (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85308" data-verses="Matthew 18:16">Matt. 18:16</span>). Of these three brothers, only the name of Titus is given. However, the other brothers were known in the churches, and Paul even spoke of them as apostles of the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85309" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:23">v. 23</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Ql5Pg2ZNuykXsyEjASMH8B5GtMoTjCdfD2r5djG_nWm2lFgAKpLfM_KLzMYyqkpuP">HOW PAUL BEHAVED HIMSELF IN HIS MINISTRY</h2><p data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSwHLWOErP6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk"> In this section of 2 Corinthians there is no doctrine or theology, no mention of spiritual gift or power. What, then, do we have here that is worthy of an entire message? We have a picture of the kind of life Paul lived. The book of <span class="pg" data-page-id="411" id="411">[411]</span> 2 Corinthians is a book on Paul’s life. However, most Christians today pay much more attention to work than to life. Second Corinthians portrays Paul’s life; it does not emphasize his work. Here we have a picture of Paul’s behavior in his ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDG4LlpBpyIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> No doubt Paul was commissioned with the highest portion of this ministry. Therefore, in this book he spontaneously gives us a picture showing how he behaved himself in carrying out his ministry. This does not mean that in 2 Corinthians Paul is telling us how or by what way he carried out his ministry. Rather, he is revealing how he behaved himself. His emphasis is not on the way he ministered; it is on how he conducted himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCPSbvmbAbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> The ministry of the New Testament is altogether a matter of life, not a matter merely of gifts or of working in a particular way. The crucial question is not how we are doing things or how we are working; it is how we are living and conducting ourselves. In the ministry of Christ for the church, the emphasis should be on how we live, not on how we work. I have a strong burden that we all would see that in the Lord’s recovery what matters is not how we do things, but how we live. In these verses Paul’s main emphasis is on how he behaved himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="4hMyExre1zbM0fe_x-GmaBEs6q87iO-T9eB5bldVqy5h3nbIoZkpmSlQGlIoMTxNS"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85310" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:20">verse 20</span>, an abundance of material gifts had been committed to Paul’s care. He had received a large sum of money from saints in different localities for the needy ones in Judea. Realizing that having the responsibility for a large amount of money could cause problems, he behaved in a very careful way. First, he selected Titus to go with him. By reading this book we can see that Titus was a reputable brother, reputable among the co-workers and also among the churches. Therefore, Paul selected such a one to take the lead in ministering the material supply to the needy saints. Yet, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85311" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:18">verse 18</span>, another brother was sent with Titus, one whose praise in the gospel was throughout all the churches and who had been appointed by the churches as a fellow-traveler in this grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85312" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:19">v. 19</span>). This brother was sent by the churches and not only by Paul. By this we see that Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="412" id="412">[412]</span> must have asked the churches purposely to select such a brother. Concerning that one, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85313" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span> say, “And not only this, but who has also been appointed by the churches as our fellow-traveler in this grace which is being ministered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself, and to show our readiness, avoiding this, that anyone should blame us in this abundance which is being ministered by us.” Paul deliberately acted in a careful way to avoid blame concerning the abundance of material gifts. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weZEb08pfAY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx">TAKING FORETHOUGHT FOR WHAT IS HONORABLE<br/>BEFORE GOD AND MAN</h2><p data-content-id="3x4y4bH-jSB8_0__dQRX-nn-7_QC7aefq8LUx3tEiw83hJtljo8fD-KpeOzqVxFkY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85314" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:21">verse 21</span> Paul says, “For we provide for what is honorable, not only before the Lord, but also before men.” The Greek word for “provide for” may also be rendered take forethought for, consider in advance. This is the meaning of the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85315" data-verses="Romans 12:17">Romans 12:17</span>. It must have been quoted from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85316" data-verses="Proverbs 3:4">Proverbs 3:4</span>, where the Septuagint reads, “Take thought for honorable things in the sight of the Lord, and of men.” </p>
<p data-content-id="GBLvlFuZpxpOzPlHECwzEvBrtGtiuqGT35VbcvpDsVtjWxkMb27nu2FPxyYbaMXgd"> Paul realized that a large sum of money was involved in the ministering to the needy saints. He knew that handling that amount of money was not an easy matter. Therefore, he took forethought for what was honorable both before the Lord and before men. We may think that the saints would not have any evil thoughts regarding that money. Perhaps the saints themselves would not have evil thoughts, but the Devil is full of evil thoughts, and he is in them. For this reason, Paul thought about the matter beforehand to avoid blame. </p>
<p data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ2dbM-asH014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB"> Here we see the principle of taking forethought. Whenever we are about to do something or behave in a certain way, we should take forethought for the way others may think about the matter. Yes, the saints are holy. But within them there is someone who is not holy, that is, the Devil. What evil thoughts may come from the Devil about a particular matter? We need to consider this. We need to consider it even in relation to our husband or wife. Our husband or wife may not have a problem with a certain matter, but what <span class="pg" data-page-id="413" id="413">[413]</span> about the Devil? What kind of thoughts about it will come from him? We need to realize that the Devil is crouching, waiting for an opportunity to destroy us. If we realize this, we shall be careful and take forethought concerning things. </p>

It may seem to us that this chapter is not necessary, for we may think that what Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85326" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapter eight</span> is sufficient. According to your understanding, why does Paul give an additional word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85327" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:1">chapter nine</span>? If you read these two chapters again, you may consider that regarding the ministry to the needy saints, the first part alone of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85328" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapter eight</span> is adequate and that the last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85329" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapter eight</span> and all of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85330" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:1">chapter nine</span> are not actually necessary. We need to ask why Paul devoted so much space to this matter. As we shall see, his reason for doing so is related to certain profound thoughts. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42QK5k2K-WYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4">GATHERING AND SOWING</h2><p data-content-id="-fHkLKWj9SQ91tLa1G364G4pOcTRoaCMvGuvZ3qjM3u8vtBx03384wRIRHSxo1kdf"> Paul’s thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85331" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapters eight and nine</span> is profound. The key to understanding Paul’s profound thought is found in two matters. First, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85332" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:15">8:15</span> Paul concludes, “As it is written, He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.” This is a quotation from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85333" data-verses="Exodus 16:18">Exodus 16:18</span> concerning the gathering of manna for the daily supply. Why does the Apostle Paul connect ministering the supply of material things to the saints to the gathering of manna? If we consider this matter thoughtfully, we shall realize that ministering material things to the needy saints <span class="pg" data-page-id="418" id="418">[418]</span> certainly is for their daily supply. Manna was gathered for the daily supply of the children of Israel, and material things were ministered to the needy saints also for their daily supply. Paul’s quotation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85334" data-verses="Exodus 16:18">Exodus 16:18</span> is a crucial factor in our grasping his profound thought. </p>
<p data-content-id="pbBnT8P58uzq4V0jIiQ68lujBXFx65nhPQr0uU5nsZuuDDkZCUidRP80lkw5FcmBk"> The second matter related to Paul’s profound thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85335" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapters eight and nine</span> concerns his word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85336" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:6">9:6</span> about sowing: “But this: he who sows sparingly, sparingly also shall reap; and he who sows with blessings, with blessings also shall reap.” Here Paul likens the ministering of material things to the needy saints to the sowing of seed. The sowing of seed, like the gathering of manna, is for daily supply. Therefore, both the gathering and the sowing are for the same purpose, for both are for our living. </p>

The first way is according to the natural law ordained by God. This is to sow seed and reap a harvest. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85337" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> God ordained that man would till the ground in order to have something to live on. The sowing of the seed is for man’s living. This is the way according to the natural law ordained by God. No race or nationality can survive without sowing, without farming. To farm is to sow the seed and reap a harvest. </p>
<p data-content-id="AE9CEdRlVZ0DfzvVD9YH94VL_i-X9J56-y2JdKHszjh81ESQHHyJQoNdtgNJws_Lr"> The second way for God’s people to live is the way of miracles from the hand of God. When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they lived according to the natural way. But when they came out of Egypt and were wandering in the wilderness, they lived by another way, by the way of God’s miracles. The people did not sow any seed, but they gathered manna. We could say that they reaped without sowing, for their gathering was a reaping. In the wilderness the children of Israel continually reaped without sowing. The raining down of manna from heaven was a substitute for sowing. Human beings can sow seed, but only God can cause manna to rain down. In the wilderness the children of Israel gathered the manna sent by God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="419" id="419">[419]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="FXS_xlsr3gzjoDc53zkOKTBo0Wu8y0Mncr0S33QiX0PDpj4qrLlX-GYZybGMhOX53"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85338" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span>, the children of Israel gathered manna every morning, except for the Sabbath day. On the sixth day they gathered a double portion in order to have a sufficient supply for the Sabbath. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85339" data-verses="Exodus 16:17-18">Exodus 16:17 and 18</span> say, “And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwlnpn_zcujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG">GOD BALANCING THE SUPPLY AMONG HIS PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42QK5k3uCWYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4"> In the wilderness the children of Israel did not do any farming, sowing, or reaping. Instead, they gathered manna. Some may have been greedy and tried to gather a large amount of manna, much more than they needed. However, by the end of the day, what was left was no longer useful. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85340" data-verses="Exodus 16:19-20">Exodus 16:19 and 20</span> say, “And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.” In the case of those who gathered an excess of manna, perhaps wanting to store it up for days and weeks to come, God caused the excess to be taken away. </p>
<p data-content-id="-fHkLKWj9SQ91tLa1G364G4pOcTRoaCMvGuvZ1-TM3u8vtBx03384wRIRHSxo1kdf"> Those who were rather feeble and not able to gather much manna did not have any lack. The divine way is that those who gathered little had no lack and those who gathered much had nothing over. This is God’s heavenly way of balancing the supply among His people. God exercised His miraculous ability to balance the supply of manna among the people. God balances the daily supply among His children by His sovereign and miraculous hand. </p>
<p data-content-id="pbBnT8P58uzq4V0jIiQ68lujBXFx65nhPQr0uW9TsZuuDDkZCUidRP80lkw5FcmBk"> In Paul’s writing of 2 Corinthians, he combines the gathering of manna with the believers’ giving of the material supply to the needy saints. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85341" data-verses="Exodus 16:1">Exodus 16</span> it was a matter of gathering, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85342" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">2 Corinthians 8</span> it is a matter of giving. Concerning the gathering of manna, the result was the same whether the children of Israel gathered more or gathered less. This indicates that in their gathering they should not <span class="pg" data-page-id="420" id="420">[420]</span> have been greedy. Gathering manna was their duty. They were to do their duty without being greedy. </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceTGKs6oAfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> Suppose some of the children of Israel had said, “God is merciful, sovereign, and miraculous. He controls everything. Since I will have no excess if I gather a lot and no lack if I gather a little, then actually I don’t need to go out and gather anything.” If one of God’s people had practiced this, he would not have had anything for that day. God would not fulfill that one’s duty for him. God would neither work for him nor feed him. The children of Israel had to fulfill their duty. As long as they fulfilled their responsibility according to God’s ordination, they had a sufficient supply, no matter how much or how little manna they gathered. </p>
<p data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TNSYbCxwZ3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85343" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">2 Corinthians 8</span> Paul likens our giving to the needy ones to the gathering of manna. To our realization, we are giving, not gathering. But what Paul says indicates that our giving is a gathering. Paul’s word at least implies that as children of God we should not be greedy. We should not think that if we earn a large sum of money, we shall be able to preserve it all for ourselves. We need to see that whether we give or not, eventually the outcome will be the same. </p>
<p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwE-7QgXWqezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> Suppose a brother earns $40,000 a year, but what he actually needs for his living is much less than that amount. Being rather greedy, he wants to reserve a large amount for himself. He tithes ten percent, or $4,000, with the intention of keeping the other $36,000. This tithing is a good practice. However, it is possible for this brother to follow an even better way. According to this better way, the brother should keep what he needs for his living, perhaps $20,000, and give away the remainder. No doubt, humanly speaking, almost everyone would follow the first way, the way of tithing, instead of the second way, the way of giving all that he can. If the brother decides to tithe and keep the extra $16,000 for himself, eventually he will learn that, in His sovereignty, God has many ways to cause this excess money to disappear. There may be illness, accident, or calamity. If the money does not disappear in this generation, it will disappear in the following generation or certainly in the third generation. God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="421" id="421">[421]</span> mighty, sovereign hand will be active to practice a heavenly balancing of the wealth among His people. </p>

The blessings here are first bountiful givings as blessings to others, and then bountiful harvests as blessings from God. It is a natural law ordained by God that if we sow sparingly, we shall also reap sparingly, but if we sow with blessings, we shall also reap with blessings. </p>
<p data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWjZxj2t6MVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85379" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:7">verse 7</span> Paul continues, “Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.” We should not be sorrowful in giving. Instead, we should be joyful. If we are sorrowful in giving, it may be better not to give anything. Furthermore, our giving should not be of necessity. The Greek word rendered necessity here is the same as that used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85380" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">chapter six</span>. It means that we are pressed into something, forced into it. To give out of necessity indicates that giving is a calamity to us. We should not give because we are forced; neither should we give if we feel that giving is a calamity. In the thought of some, giving material possessions is like suffering a calamity. Giving should certainly not be like this with us. As Paul says in this verse, God loves a cheerful giver. The Greek word translated cheerful may also be rendered hilarious or gleeful. In our giving we should be cheerful, gleeful, hilarious. </p>
<p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcU-z6lFRrUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85381" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:8-9">Verses 8 and 9</span> say, “And God is able to make all grace <span class="pg" data-page-id="430" id="430">[430]</span> abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound unto every good work; even as it is written, He scattered abroad, he gave to the poor, his righteousness abides forever.” There are different kinds of grace. Titus was among the Corinthians to bring them the different graces. We today also need to have the various kinds of grace, one of which is the grace of giving. </p>
<p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQsOsVv5WrzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85382" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span> there are a number of dear and precious thoughts. One such thought is that generous giving is righteousness in the eyes of both God and man. This thought is confirmed by the Lord’s word spoken on the mountain and recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85383" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">Matthew 6</span>. The Lord regards generous giving not only as a grace, but also as righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="oWGGtswBbqVJuntCRsys2wWnl7mlT07weZEj08p_AY6yVOrVkkrmxdXgMUkZzjaTx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85384" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:10">verse 10</span> Paul goes on to say, “Now He Who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of righteousness to grow.” Here we see the source of seed: it comes from God who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food. We should not think that the wheat used to make bread comes automatically from reaping a harvest. No, it comes from God. Even though we must sow, we should not trust in our sowing. It is our duty to sow, and we should sow for this reason. However, we should not trust in what we sow. If we trust in our sowing, God may withhold the rain or allow a storm to damage the harvest. Therefore, we must see that God is the One who provides the bread. He gives us the seed for sowing and also bread from the harvest for food. Furthermore, it is He who multiplies our seed and causes the fruits of righteousness to grow. </p>

Paul was not a superficial person. He knew that fellowshipping with the churches concerning the ministry to take care of the needy saints far away in Judea was a very important matter. He realized that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="431" id="431">[431]</span> saints in Macedonia and Achaia were in poverty. This is indicated by his word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85386" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1-2">8:1 and 2</span>: “Furthermore, we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that in much approvedness of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.” Here Paul speaks of the depth of poverty. This expression indicates that the economic situation in Macedonia, and no doubt in Achaia as well, was not good. The saints in Macedonia and Achaia were poor. Since this was their economic situation, how could Paul encourage them, even entreat them, to supply material things to others? This kind of giving would certainly cause them to be even more poor. Moreover, what about the saints’ future? Paul knew some of the poor saints might say, “What about my future? I have very little. If I give away part of what I have, how shall I take care of my living in the future?” Because Paul understood the situation and because he was thoughtful, he handled the matter in a very considerate way. When he fellowshipped with the believers about the material supply for the needy saints, Paul was very considerate. </p>
<p data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ2djM-qkH014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB"> It was risky for Paul to fellowship with the saints about giving and even more risky to entreat them to give. However, Paul had an assurance and a confidence within him that caused him to take the risk. In our opinion, it is rather easy to ask wealthy people to give to those in need. But it is another matter to entreat the poor, those who do not have a sufficient supply for their own living, to give of their possessions. As we have pointed out, they may wonder about their future, especially about how they will earn a living if they give of what they have. Nevertheless, because Paul knew God’s economy and understood God’s way, he had the confidence to risk encouraging the poor saints in Achaia to give to the needy ones in Judea. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_pNNNa3ZHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI">CARED FOR BY GOD IN A MIRACULOUS WAY</h2><p data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExGtjzfrLLpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF"> From his study of the Old Testament, Paul realized that God takes care of His people’s needs. God is able to feed His <span class="pg" data-page-id="432" id="432">[432]</span> people in a miraculous way. There were more than two million children of Israel in a barren wilderness, in a wasteland where nothing grows. The wilderness was not a place suitable for farming or ranching. But throughout a period of forty years, God fed His people by miraculously raining down manna from heaven. I do not believe that anyone can explain what manna was or where it came from. But it is a fact of history that God fed His people with manna in the wilderness for forty years. It certainly was a miracle that more than two million people could survive in the wilderness for such a long time. </p>
<p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QWGnmEnVP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> Both the raining down of the manna and the application of the manna were miraculous. Paul refers to this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85387" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:15">2 Corinthians 8:15</span> where, quoting <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85388" data-verses="Exodus 16:18">Exodus 16:18</span>, he says, “He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85389" data-verses="Exodus 16:18">Exodus 16:18</span>, an omer was used to measure the manna. Both those who gathered much and those who gathered little eventually had an omer. This is God’s heavenly balancing of the manna gathered by His people. No matter how many omers certain ones may have gathered, after the manna was measured, the result was that miraculously there was an omer for every person (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85390" data-verses="Exodus 16:16">Exo. 16:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnH0C2fIKdTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> On the sixth day of the week, the children of Israel were allowed to gather a double portion of manna to provide a supply for the Sabbath. But on other days of the week, they were not allowed to gather more than what they needed for one day. Those who tried to save manna for the next day found that it bred worms. This indicates that it is not God’s principle for His people to save up something for themselves. To save in that way is to be motivated by greed. </p>

However, in the last four chapters of this Epistle Paul covers another crucial matter which is in his heart. This is the matter of his apostolic authority. He said a little about this in 1 Corinthians, but because the time was not right, he did not cover it adequately. When 1 Corinthians was written, the situation was not ready for Paul to come to the matter of his apostolic authority. But by the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85402" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">2 Corinthians 10</span>, the storms have ceased, and everything is calm. Thus, with everyone quiet and at peace, there is a tranquil atmosphere. In such an atmosphere and condition, Paul comes to the question of his apostolic authority. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85403" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">chapters ten</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85404" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:1">eleven</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85405" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:1">twelve</span>, and part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85406" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:1">thirteen</span>, Paul places this matter before the Corinthians and deals with it from different angles. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVfS6Dn0yzDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> Because he is an excellent writer, Paul always deals with any matter thoroughly, not leaving ground for any argument. As we shall see, this principle is true of Paul’s vindication of his apostolic authority. The Corinthian believers needed to be clear about this, and we also need to be clear about it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_4w9Ar9Vyp0N_HoNrdaOQWC9shEsus7o-57iMroGngRtO9yGHFVltw-zoF6hLKtMB">A CONTRAST</h2><p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkgkHXghzkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85407" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">10:1</span> Paul says, “But I myself, Paul, entreat you through the meekness and forbearance of Christ, who as to appearance am indeed lowly among you, but absent am of good <span class="pg" data-page-id="438" id="438">[438]</span> courage toward you.” Notice that this verse begins with the word “but.” “But” here indicates a contrast. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85408" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">chapters eight and nine</span> the apostle spoke pleasantly with the dear saints in Corinth, encouraging them to have fellowship in the ministry to the needy saints in Judea. Immediately after that, he desires to make himself more clear to them by vindicating, with a severe and unpleasant word, his apostleship, even his apostolic authority. This was due to the vague and clouded situation caused by the false, Judaistic apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85409" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:11-15">11:11-15</span>), whose teaching and assertion of what they were had distracted the Corinthian believers from the fundamental teachings of the authentic apostles, especially from the proper realization of Paul’s standing as an apostle. </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceTWqs6ogfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> We need to be impressed with the fact that this section of 2 Corinthians stands in sharp contrast to the preceding section. Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85410" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">chapters six through nine</span> is pleasant, but at times his word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85411" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">chapters ten through thirteen</span> is severe and even unpleasant. As we read the last four chapters of this book, we may wonder if Paul has lost his tender, intimate concern. Some may even criticize him for his severity. Actually, it was because Paul was so spiritual that he could write these chapters in the way he did. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TNC4bCxQZ3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4">PAUL’S WAY OF ENTREATING</h2><p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwEubQgneqezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85412" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">10:1</span> Paul tells us that he entreated the Corinthians through the meekness and forbearance of Christ. But he does not tell us the purpose of his entreaty. He tells us how he entreated, but he does not say why he entreated. If you read through the rest of this chapter, trying to find the purpose of Paul’s entreaty, you will not be able to find it. Paul simply does not state the purpose of his entreaty. Did he, then, make a mistake in writing? No, Paul’s concern is with how he entreats the saints rather than for what purpose he entreats them. This indicates that Paul’s way of entreating is more important than the purpose of his entreaty. For this reason, Paul points out that he entreated the believers through the meekness and forbearance of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="uKAggo26VcYIYatm2wE1X7mlIjGB46_tKZY6AUPpKUS9ib9fxDxuiAAHQDKQU_Qdp"> Suppose a brother who is giving a message cares only for <span class="pg" data-page-id="439" id="439">[439]</span> his purpose in giving that message and not for the way he gives it. That would be a serious mistake. We should learn of Paul to pay even more attention to the way we do something than for our purpose in doing that thing. Actually God cares more for the way we do things than for our purpose, our goal, in doing them. However, many Christians today care hardly at all for the way of doing things; they care primarily for the purpose, the goal, the result. There is a saying that the end justifies the means. Those who heed this saying do not care about the way of doing things; they care only for their purpose. This concept is deplorable and needs to be condemned. </p>
<p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVy57f4Z2Dyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> Christians may think that as long as their intention is to do a work for the Lord, they need not care about the means used to accomplish it. For example, in preaching the gospel they may use worldly methods or entertainment. Therefore, I want to emphasize that in the Bible God shows that He cares more for our way than He cares for our purpose. As a heavenly ambassador, Paul also cared more for the way of doing things than he cared for the purpose. This is the reason he describes the way he entreated the Corinthians, but does not mention the purpose. May we all learn of him in this matter. </p>

This indicates that the apostle, being firmly attached to Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85414" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21">1:21</span>) and one with Him, lives by Him, behaving in His virtues. All the virtues of Christ were becoming Paul’s virtues. Meekness was a virtue in the humanity of Christ by the divine life. Christ’s meekness is not a simple matter, for it is in His humanity and by the divine life. When He was on earth, He lived a human life by the divine life. Through this mingling of divinity and humanity the virtue of meekness was manifested. </p>
<p data-content-id="XXduMxCOjrPmPcmED9LcidhhsUx21ezSWjJVj3JOMVS-if2N2J9Wd6aRYeYABn4q9"> The principle is the same with Christ’s virtue of forbearance. Forbearance is another virtue of Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life. Do you know the difference between meekness and forbearance? To have the virtue of <span class="pg" data-page-id="440" id="440">[440]</span> meekness means that you do not invade others or fight with them. Instead, you are willing to give in. The meek give in to others. But those who are strong in a natural way fight and refuse to give in. At the least, they want to stand their ground. The meek, however, give in, do not fight, and do not invade others’ territory. To have forbearance means that you are willing to allow others to invade you. This means that to have forbearance is to suffer affliction and injury. To have meekness is not to invade others, but to give in to them; to have forbearance means that you are willing to be invaded by others. These are two of the virtues Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcUuX6nRZrUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR"> Because Paul lived Christ, the virtues of Christ became his. The phrase “through the meekness and forbearance of Christ” indicates that Paul was one with Christ and took Christ as his life. Therefore, he entreated the believers not by himself, but entreated them through the virtues of Christ, in particular through Christ’s meekness and forbearance. Paul entreated others by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQseIVt9arzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG">PAUL’S PERSON</h2><p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QOUkgez1ADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> After telling us the way he entreats, Paul goes on to speak of the kind of person he was. He says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85415" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">verse 1</span>, “I myself, Paul,...who as to appearance am indeed lowly among you, but absent am of good courage toward you.” This description of Paul’s person fits in with the subject of 2 Corinthians. The subject of this Epistle is the kind of person Paul was and the kind of life he lived. Paul did not care that much for the work he did; he cared much more for his person and living. As we have pointed out, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85416" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">chapter ten</span> he does not even mention the purpose of his entreaty. He was so concerned about the way he entreated that he did not mention why he entreated. </p>

If anyone has confidence in himself to be of Christ, let him account this again as to himself, that even as he is of Christ, so also are we.” This is a frank word, quite different from the words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85429" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">chapters six</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85430" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">seven</span>. No doubt, the Judaizers were those who had confidence in themselves that they were of Christ. Although these Judaizers were Christians, they were not willing to be one with Paul in his ministry. They claimed to be of Christ. Therefore, Paul sought to make it clear that the apostles were surely of Christ also. This indicates that to be of Christ is an important matter. It is vital to the Christian life and ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="3x4y4bH-jSB8_0__dQRX-nn-7_QC7aefq8bMx1pIiw83hJtljo8fD-KpeOzqVxFkY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85431" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span> Paul says, “For if ever I should boast somewhat more abundantly concerning our authority, which the Lord gave for building up and not for your overthrow, I shall not be put to shame; that I may not seem as if to terrify you through the letters.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85432" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:8">Verse 8</span> indicates that in the past Paul did say something to the Corinthians concerning his apostolic authority. Apostolic authority is not for ruling over <span class="pg" data-page-id="446" id="446">[446]</span> the believers, as in the natural sense, but for building them up. </p>
<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEsWkReYtVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85433" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:9">verse 9</span> Paul speaks of the believers being terrified through letters. This may refer to Paul’s first Epistle to the Corinthians. In that Epistle Paul did refer to his apostolic authority. Some of the Corinthians may have regarded that word as terrifying. But here Paul indicates that it should not be terrifying to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHegGL-TbZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85434" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:10">verse 10</span> Paul goes on to say, “Because his letters indeed, he says, are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible.” This confirms what we said in a previous message about Paul being lowly when present with the Corinthians. He was meek and not at all strong physically. Furthermore, his speech, his utterance, was contemptible, or of no account. The Greek word rendered contemptible means literally “made nothing of.” </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh1fc2yzYRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85435" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:11">verse 11</span> Paul continues, “Let such a one account this, that such as we are in word by letters when absent, such also we are when present in deed.” Although Paul seemed different in presence from what he was in his letters, actually he was the same. We should learn from him not to be political or naturally polite, but to be flexible. When we are present with others, we should not be that bold or strong. This, however, does not mean that we really are weak or unknowing. Rather, we may want to keep from offending others unnecessarily. Nevertheless, at times we may need to utter something which seems bold or strong. Sometimes we need to be strong in writing, but we are not willing to be strong. At other times we should not be so bold in someone’s presence, yet we are bold. This indicates that we are not wise, flexible, or forbearing. Let us all learn to be real, not political. At the same time, we must learn to be flexible. On the one hand, we should try not to hurt others’ feelings; on the other hand, we may need at times to speak frankly in truth with some degree of boldness. </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYoAGwPsR_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85436" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:12">verse 12</span> Paul says, “For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves and comparing <span class="pg" data-page-id="447" id="447">[447]</span> themselves with themselves, do not understand.” Those who are entangled or ensnared in themselves do not have a proper understanding. </p>

This shows that he is under the restriction of the Lord. His boasting is according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure, the ruling God, has apportioned to him. Paul’s ministry to the Gentile world, including Corinth, was according to the measure of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85438" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1-2">Eph. 3:1-2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85439" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85440" data-verses="Galatians 2:8">Gal. 2:8</span>). Hence, his boast is also within this limit, not without measure, as that of the Judaistic teachers. The word rule in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85441" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:13">verse 13</span> literally means a measuring rod, as a rule used by a carpenter. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2ZaOl8exRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> We should never boast without measure. In giving a testimony of what we have learned of the Lord, we should have a limit, a measure. The word measure in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85442" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:13">verse 13</span> indicates being ruled by God. God has allotted us just so much for our work and experience. Furthermore, He has given us just so much to enjoy. Therefore, when we give a testimony about our work, experience, or enjoyment of the Lord, we must testify within measure, that is, within a certain limit. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3Ot7qoWxCHF5y2RpYrDaaUtElgmNVg6wrwiUisjfcnMD_jjvfmgkr2tSIkHqJoof"> In giving a testimony or a report we should never exaggerate. However, the reports in certain Christian publications are exaggerations; those reports go beyond measure, beyond limit, without restriction. Thus, in testifying of our experience, we must stay within the measure God has given us. We should not boast without measure, beyond measure, but according to the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us. There is One who is ruling and measuring. This One is the God of measure, the God who rules. Therefore, we must stay within the limits of God’s ruling, of God’s measuring. Paul’s words “reach even as far as you” indicate that his coming to the Corinthians was under God’s ruling and measuring. </p>
<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv2HQ13P6T6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85443" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:14">Verse 14</span> continues, “For we do not, as not reaching to <span class="pg" data-page-id="448" id="448">[448]</span> you, overstretch ourselves, for we were the first to come even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ.” In contrast to the Judaistic teachers, Paul and the other apostles did not overstretch themselves. They were the first to go to Europe, and hence to the Corinthians, with the gospel. If the Judaizers had gone there first, probably the apostles would not have gone, and that would have been the sign that Europe had not been measured to them under God’s ruling. This is related to Paul’s point in arguing with the Judaizers. </p>
<p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8W6vLVSNxV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85444" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:15-16">verses 15 and 16</span> Paul says, “Not boasting without measure in others’ labors, but having hope, your faith growing, to be magnified among you according to our rule unto abundance, to preach the gospel unto the parts beyond you, not to boast in another’s rule in things made ready.” Here we see that the apostles have hope that through the growth of the faith of the Corinthian believers, their ministry will be magnified (in the sense of praise), by being enlarged and increased abundantly, yet still according to the rule, the measure, that God has apportioned to them. Paul hoped to be magnified among the Corinthians according to the limit of God’s measuring. </p>

Do not expect a spread that is without measure. That kind of spread would certainly not be within the limit of a walk according to Spirit. From experience we can testify that if we spread the work according to the Spirit, there will always be a certain limit. Inwardly we shall have the consciousness that the Lord intends to spread the work only to a certain extent. Furthermore, outwardly, in the environment, the Lord may cause matters to restrict the spread of the work. Therefore, inwardly we do not have the peace to spread the work beyond a certain point, and outwardly the environment does not allow us to go beyond a particular boundary line. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSMgkoljPQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> The young people are not yet very much into the Lord’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="449" id="449">[449]</span> work. Nevertheless, I would encourage them to keep this word within them, for one day they will experience it. We all need to learn that in serving the Lord and in working with God, there is always a limit. This is also true in the service of the church. </p>

<p data-content-id="geZxEpsbnTx6EP55L9Ao13softiCGf0TEsWoRfsFVYD-oEOpjocsNwA3wgD_lwxfN"> As the book of 1 Corinthians indicates, there were many problems among the Corinthians. But through Paul’s first Epistle to the Corinthians, many of them were brought back to the Lord. They experienced a further reconciliation to God. Some may have even been brought back to God in a full way. But although many problems had been solved, one problem still remained—the matter of Paul’s apostleship. The most subtle thing in a local church is having questions concerning the apostles, concerning those who minister Christ to the churches. </p>
<p data-content-id="es7g3bqIW90aGnSwD08FKYB5kAeuTGKkHegKL_33ZDyF7ieeqFvcPVM5-VuUfQjqA"> Paul kept this point until the last because the dealing with other matters was a condition necessary for dealing with this matter. If the saints still had many problems and if the situation among them had not been calmed down, it would not have been appropriate for Paul to speak about his apostleship. It would not have been the right time for him to vindicate his apostolic authority. However, since at least most of the Corinthians had become calm and the problems among them had been solved, Paul realized that the time was now right to deal with the last problem, the problem the believers had with respect to his apostleship. The last problem in any local church is always the problem with the ministering ones, with the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh1fQ2wn4Rc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> Because it is difficult for anyone to vindicate himself, Paul found it difficult to vindicate his apostolic authority. If he had been vindicating the apostolic authority of Peter, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="456" id="456">[456]</span> matter would have been much easier. It is always easier to speak on behalf of someone else than it is to speak directly concerning ourselves. </p>

If this problem were not solved, the church in Corinth would still be sick. Any church that has a problem concerning the apostles is unhealthy. Because the church in Corinth had a problem with Paul, the ministering one, that church was sick. Therefore, the last four chapters of 2 Corinthians were written for the purpose of solving this problem. It would have been much better if someone else, such as Timothy or Peter, could have done this for Paul. However, no one could replace Paul in writing these chapters. </p>

This means that here he is dealing with the Judaizers themselves, who were a serious problem. In dealing with the Judaizers, Paul first says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85452" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">chapter ten</span> that the weapons of the apostles’ warfare are not fleshly, but powerful to God to the overthrow of strongholds. Elsewhere in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85453" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">chapter ten</span> Paul goes on to say that whereas he remained within his limit, the Judaizers went beyond their limit. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QOUsgeD9ADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85454" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">chapter ten</span> Paul first indicates to the Corinthians that they had been indoctrinated, that at least they had been influenced by Judaistic teachings. According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85455" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:5">10:5</span>, those teachings were reasonings and high things rising up against the knowledge of God. Such rebellious thoughts had been injected into the Corinthians and had caused them to be rebellious. Therefore, there was the need of spiritual warfare to tear down the strongholds of the high reasonings and to make every thought captive unto the obedience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0H3cVRGQkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> The source of this rebellion was the Judaizers. The Judaizers had clearly overstepped themselves. God, according to <span class="pg" data-page-id="457" id="457">[457]</span> His sovereignty, had not apportioned the territory of Achaia to the Judaizers. Actually, God had apportioned nothing to them. Nevertheless, overstretching themselves, they went out on their own and as a result interfered with the apostle’s jurisdiction. </p>
<p data-content-id="b7q7Z7S1fZdIcsUBIPeqTttJEGcuV7t0zjWcjMIZ_dA_SruUxZdaafdMAfHybf_7B"> In vindicating himself against the Judaizers, Paul realized that it was not becoming to mention them openly in writing. This is the reason many Christians have a difficult time understanding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85456" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">chapter ten</span>. When I was young, I read this chapter again and again without understanding what Paul was talking about. At that time, I had no idea of the background of this chapter. One day I came to know the history and the background, and this enabled me to know Paul’s feeling and touch his spirit in this chapter. Then I began to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85457" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">2 Corinthians 10</span> in the way explained above. Now we can see that Paul wrote this chapter in order to deal with the Judaizers, who had stirred up rebellion among the believers at Corinth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85458" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:4-6">Verses 4 through 6</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85459" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">2 Corinthians 10</span> do not refer to unbelievers, but refer to the believers at Corinth. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIjgSVkVJA4hyLgNeH_BClcYe52KWBgG2tC9Si-xzua5xeZSQ0bQTiA9H_iVqLUON"> The apostles went out to preach the gospel and to teach the truth within God’s measure and according to His rule. Their activity truly was of God. Then the Judaizers overstepped themselves and violated the apostles’ jurisdiction. That kind of overstepping always brings in rebellion. This was the cause of the rebellion within the believers at Corinth, and made it necessary for Paul to fight against the high thoughts and rebellious reasonings. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85460" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">chapter ten</span> Paul is actually engaging in warfare against this kind of rebellion. In this chapter we see rebellion and also the overstepping of the proper measure. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8CmD6d3ZNYKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y">SOME STRONG WORDS</h2><p data-content-id="8Hhm-YzmdKb47KgUAWLAFviiOtNvbAklVv0eW8mf2FHvvL6g-xCuchJjKldAB3ISK"> Although Paul is strong in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85461" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">chapter ten</span>, he is even stronger in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85462" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85463" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:13-15">11:13-15</span> he says concerning the Judaizers, “For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel <span class="pg" data-page-id="458" id="458">[458]</span> of light. Therefore it is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.” The Greek word rendered “transfiguring” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85464" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:13">verse 13</span> also means fashioning. The false apostles, being deceitful, fashioned themselves into the appearance of the real apostles, who are true in every way. </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIdFbYCmxgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85465" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:14">Verse 14</span> indicates that Satan is the source of the false apostles. They follow him in his deceitfulness to frustrate God’s economy. God is light, and His angels are of light. On the contrary, Satan is darkness, and all his followers are in darkness. There is no fellowship between light and darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85466" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:14">6:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVfSyDmQ-zDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> The ministers of righteousness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85467" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:15">verse 15</span> are the true apostles, those who carry out the ministry of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85468" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">3:9</span>). Whatever the ministers of Satan do is altogether unrighteous. Righteousness has no partnership with lawlessness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85469" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:14">6:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_4w9Ar9Vyp0N_HoNrdaOQWC9shEsus7o-57qMpMungRtO9yGHFVltw-zoF6hLKtMB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85470" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:5">11:5</span> Paul refers to the Judaizers as super-apostles: “For I account that I am inferior in nothing to the super-apostles.” By using the term super-apostles, that is, apostles in surpassing degree, Paul is referring ironically to the false apostles, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85471" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:13">verse 13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85472" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:11">12:11</span>. These false apostles surpass the degree of the genuineness of the apostles. These are the Judaizers who came to Corinth to preach another Jesus with a different spirit and a different gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85473" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:4">v. 4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkgkPXiVfkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> The Corinthians thought that the Judaizers were wonderful and that they did an excellent work in helping the Corinthians. Actually, the Judaizers did exactly the same work as Satan. They transfigured themselves as ministers of righteousness, into apostles of Christ. Therefore, Paul uses four terms to describe them: false apostles, deceitful workers, super-apostles, and ministers of Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18dG4QoZc-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> Paul also refers to the Judaizers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85474" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:4">verse 4</span>: “For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different gospel, which you did not accept, you bear well with him.” Another Jesus means another person; a <span class="pg" data-page-id="459" id="459">[459]</span> different spirit means a spirit of a different nature; and a different gospel means a gospel of a different kind. </p>
<p data-content-id="rem1JlD9w4R9gGb6-tcAlE8dm-EZoe_9i_jgq51qF2VGvVB3qJBDrpN0-QVQmXNrj"> The Judaizers used many of the same terms the apostles used: Jesus, spirit, and gospel. Claiming that they were apostles of Christ, they preached Jesus and ministered a certain kind of spirit. Furthermore, they claimed that what they taught was the gospel. However, they had another Jesus, a different spirit, and a different gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="dChzg2DUKpIBDLedcWn1ydFKoiHfeFV0KAQKJs0b5ldzIRhtliB64uqos5WWmePIs"> No doubt, these Judaizers were eloquent and very appealing. They had much knowledge of the Old Testament, and they also knew the New Testament gospel. But in speaking of them Paul was bold, calling them false apostles, deceitful workers, ministers of Satan. He even gave them the nickname “super-apostles.” </p>

<p data-content-id="123M5cSNMEj-7uz-rGkoC46zlbHtHXa8O5MsRt611iusSytY9NpKTJ_yPM6vOLmNG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85493" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:3">11:3</span> Paul says, “But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts should be corrupted from the singleness and the purity which is toward Christ.” Here the Apostle Paul indicates that the teachings of the Judaizers can be compared to the deceitful word spoken by the serpent to Eve in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85494" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. In other words, Paul likens the activities of the Judaizers to the serpent’s work on Eve. From reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85495" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> we know that the serpent distracted Eve from the enjoyment of the tree of life. The way he turned her away from the enjoyment of the tree of life was to point her to another tree, to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which issues in death. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9y_RCEn53QXJX8AG7BzDo03GiIrcVdFzVKRlVYHWh8fFM7yeaCSVDU7M5P31_v8wC">TWO TREES</h2><p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSMgsonHvQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> We have pointed out a number of times that the tree of life is simple. With this tree, there is just one element, and that element is life. The tree of life issues in life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, on the contrary, is complicated and also complicating. With this tree, we have good, evil, knowledge, and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAcausM5Ey_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> The Bible as a whole is a development of these two trees. The tree of life signifies God in Christ as the Spirit to be life to us. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as death. Satan is the power of death. The tree of knowledge of good and evil signifying Satan as death includes knowledge, good, and evil. The serpent distracted Eve from <span class="pg" data-page-id="466" id="466">[466]</span> the tree of life by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil with its complications. Because Eve was distracted and caught, she lost her singleness and purity toward God. The result was that Eve fell, and death came in through the fall. This is the story of how the serpent distracted Eve from God’s economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv2HY13PaT6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB">SATAN AND THE JUDAIZERS</h2><p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8W6nLVStxV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85496" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:1">2 Corinthians 11</span> Paul applies to the Judaizers and the church in Corinth what the serpent did to Eve. I believe that, deep in his spirit, Paul realized that these two matters were actually one and that what was happening in Corinth was a repetition of what took place in the garden of Eden. Eve was a wife, and the church in Corinth was a pure virgin, betrothed to one husband, Christ. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85497" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:2">11:2</span> Paul says, “For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.” Furthermore, the wife in the garden of Eden was distracted by the subtle serpent. In Corinth the virgin was being distracted by Satan through the Judaizers. Elsewhere in this chapter, Paul associates the Judaizers with Satan. “For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85498" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>). Here Paul indicates that the Judaizers, the false apostles, are ministers of Satan. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85499" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:15">Verse 15</span> says, “Therefore it is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.” For the Judaizers to be ministers of Satan means that they do not minister Christ to others. Instead, what they minister is actually Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="123M5cSNMEj-7uz-rGkoC46zlbHtHXa8O5MsRsOV1iusSytY9NpKTJ_yPM6vOLmNG"> Paul could discern that the Judaizers had another Jesus, a different spirit, and a different gospel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85500" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:4">verse 4</span> Paul says to the Corinthians, “For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different gospel, which you did not accept, you bear well with him.” The Judaizers claimed to preach concerning Jesus. However, Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="467" id="467">[467]</span> discerned that they preached another Jesus, not the Lord Jesus preached by Paul. Moreover, they claimed that they had a spirit. Maybe they claimed that this spirit was the Holy Spirit. Paul also discerned that their spirit was not the Holy Spirit; the Judaizers had a different spirit. Furthermore, the Judaizers claimed that what they preached was the gospel. But Paul declared that their gospel was another gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="9y_RCEn53QXJX8AG7BzDo03GiIrcVdFzVKRlVZjyh8fFM7yeaCSVDU7M5P31_v8wC"> When the serpent came to Eve, he did not openly deny God’s word. Rather, the serpent said to the woman, “Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85501" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Gen. 3:1</span>). Here we see that the serpent asked, “Hath God said?” This kind of question seems, on the one hand, to recognize what God has said. On the other hand, it undermines God’s word. By asking this question, the serpent injected poison into Eve to undermine God’s speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSMgsolTXQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> It was difficult for the Corinthian believers to discern the difference between the Jesus preached by Paul and the one preached by the Judaizers. The name was the same. But there was still the need of discernment. The same was true concerning the gospel. Paul came to the Corinthians with the gospel. The Judaizers also claimed to preach the gospel. But Paul could discern that the gospel preached by the Judaizers was different from that preached by the apostles. It was not the same gospel preached by Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="TaLt_NuX-lT-iPaZS_tV6xLdoX26SXkoAcausO94y_N5gLr-KFgKw_4PqTdB4FdI1"> In principle, our situation today is the same as that of the Corinthians. The terminology, the definitions, and the titles of various matters may be the same. But if we exercise the proper discernment, we shall realize that actually they are not the same. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="n4Y3QE3-ov8ZhE_kVYZP3eBlIz4PHMKwKQIvUG-wr7cSzJuOYaW8LcsC34m6rAGwc">SEPARATED FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="6sWmK8d7zp96V5oD7bEjKxdjAryFO9E0MNY_iqo2oCanyoNbFPMu7NHbq-xflWtbj"> I would like to point out something important related to the genuine gospel, the sincere spirit, and the real Jesus. Whenever there is the preaching of the genuine gospel and the real Jesus with a sincere spirit, the Lord Jesus will be ministered to others so that they may appreciate Him, love Him, follow Him, and take Him as everything. Throughout <span class="pg" data-page-id="468" id="468">[468]</span> the centuries, many have preached from the Bible and taught the Bible, but their preaching and teaching nevertheless distracted the believers from the precious Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. In principle, such ones distract the believers in the same way as that taken by the serpent in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85502" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHHYw4XHP9FjQ_Q_21UInOznGQycz12a9jx8b0gkGOBowlmN8nVxqTNQOuCCc_pFQ"> God’s goal is life. This life, signified by the tree of life, is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit. The way of the enemy, Satan, the serpent, is to distract people from this life. He seeks to turn them to knowledge, good, and evil, the issue of which is death. Death is separation from the enjoyment of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="sEI6rYwI-O8NhWgPnfFfOakJm9d0oJNe8aldek8o6UczIjHsnAVSlHTB1u8z8KCdr"> The proper understanding of death is that it denotes separation from the enjoyment of God. This means that if we do not have the enjoyment of God, we are in death. Likewise, if we are separated from the enjoyment of God, we shall die. This is revealed in a full way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85503" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85504" data-verses="Romans 8:6">Romans 8:6</span> says, “For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.” In this verse death is separation from the enjoyment of God. Life is the opposite, for it is the enjoyment of God. When we have the enjoyment of God, there is no separation between us and God, we are in life, and life operates in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="wNe845Y8ijQ5dKg6d7KErQ-XLlzu45pbRcbUIeLY12hM0LmqbZ_Oxp9c_fGFhtXWL"> In distracting the believers from the tree of life, Satan seeks to separate us from the enjoyment of God as our life. For centuries the subtle serpent has been using teachings to keep God’s chosen people from enjoying Him as their life. For the most part, these teachings are related to knowledge, good, and evil. But such teachings result in separation from God. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQqlRcKCaH1qNoR9pCwjeaEM_YJjhABbevoiFq3E4jtib6znl17X3ZC_aTXbYtnrJ"> From the time of the apostles until today, there have been many teachings related to doctrine, theology, religion, practices, rituals, and the worship of God. Teachings like this are all on the line of the tree of knowledge. They do not bring us into the enjoyment of God. Instead, they separate us from this enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="muHafN-ILtAYeBa5rCiGrZeAqj5x_pHm3OQrspKqEwJyH9-WaG0rXZzKN8RdvDILu"> When the Judaizers came to the churches in ancient times, these Judaizers made a pretense of being genuine. They <span class="pg" data-page-id="469" id="469">[469]</span> could say that they were Hebrews, Israelites, the seed of Abraham. They also claimed to preach Christ and to be ministers of Christ. Furthermore, they had a spirit and said that what they preached was the gospel. If you had been in Corinth when the Judaizers were there, could you have differentiated the genuine Jesus, the pure spirit, and the true gospel from the false ones? If you had been there, as one of the Corinthian believers, you may have been deceived. You should not have the confidence that you can discern what Paul could discern. </p>

In a rather long section of 2 Corinthians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85512" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:16">11:16—12:18</span>) Paul vindicates his authority by a compelled boasting. Although he did not want to boast, it was necessary for him to do so. </p>

<p data-content-id="FXS_xlsr3gzjoDc53zkOKTBo0Wu8y0Mncrki31UGX0PDpj4qrLlX-GYZybGMhOX53"> We need to learn from Paul that there are times when we should not be so wise or political. Our natural politeness may be a kind of subtle wisdom. Instead, we need to be faithful, honest, and frank. But in so doing, we may appear foolish in the eyes of others. </p>
<p data-content-id="00jQCrvPMqeEF90rFnrbmeAX_HFk3m9XIdFDYCmRgkeidt2FoUKefqdKqWlRDz3aw"> In these verses Paul begs the Corinthians to bear with him in his foolishness. He asks them for permission to exercise foolishness in boasting. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85514" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:16">verse 16</span> he says, “Again I say, let no one think me to be foolish; but if otherwise, accept me even as foolish, that I also may boast a little.” Here Paul seems to be saying, “Bear with me in my foolishness. Up to this point I have been wise, but now I must speak in a strong <span class="pg" data-page-id="474" id="474">[474]</span> way. Before I do this, I ask you to bear with me in my foolishness. I am about to tell you something in a very frank way.” Then Paul proceeds to use certain frank expressions and severe utterances. </p>
<p data-content-id="7ghr7puzWM7RCLQMuPh7x7dyqUdof5kVVfSqDmQezDn-inPnzYHiBX1kx8-SlbmwC"> A person exercising wisdom would never speak in this way. Instead, he would be polite and try to cause others to appreciate him. In the foregoing chapters Paul was wise, but here he appears to be foolish, boasting and using ironic expressions. </p>
<p data-content-id="_4w9Ar9Vyp0N_HoNrdaOQWC9shEsus7o-57yMp8mngRtO9yGHFVltw-zoF6hLKtMB"> At times, in order to speak the truth, we may need to appear foolish to others. Martin Luther did this when he declared to degraded Christianity that justification is altogether by faith. When he did this, he exercised foolishness. Anyone who wants to maintain a high position in the religious hierarchy will never do this. </p>
<p data-content-id="BSpAddKIIXbCqKDB9UQZJnowdu0FIFOfkgkXXilXkYAMFgGQJ8s5jBxD02rSE2uE7"> As we have indicated, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85515" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:1">chapter eleven</span> we see Paul’s foolishness. He has already used terms such as false apostles, deceitful workers, and ministers of Satan. When we read such expressions, we all take sides with Paul. However, when he wrote this Epistle, it was not easy for him to use these terms. If you had been Paul, would you have had the boldness to write such an Epistle? Probably most of us would never write in this way. We may have spoken kindly about the Judaizers. We would not have had the boldness to use terms like false apostles, deceitful workers, or ministers of Satan. But because Paul was willing to appear foolish, he had the boldness to speak in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="xYb8SBbhK--OaCGTOIQQYi9TvToujFz18dGgQopE-UaVPgv_cCHBgoHa98I7z3f5s"> Would you not say that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85516" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:16">verse 16</span> is the writing of a foolish person? First Paul says, “Let no one think me to be foolish.” Then he goes on to say, “If otherwise, accept me even as foolish, that I also may boast a little.” What would you think if a person came to your locality and spoke in this way? Would you not regard him as a very foolish person? A wise man would certainly speak differently. </p>

Since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.” Would you not say that Paul seems <span class="pg" data-page-id="475" id="475">[475]</span> to be beside himself when he declares that he will speak something not according to the Lord? We may think that if Paul is not speaking according to the Lord, he should be silent. How could an apostle speak something that is not according to the Lord? Nevertheless, Paul uttered such a word. If we had been present at the time, we may have advised him not to write in that way. </p>
<p data-content-id="dChzg2DUKpIBDLedcWn1ydFKoiHfeFV0KAQSJsET5ldzIRhtliB64uqos5WWmePIs"> What does Paul mean by “this confidence” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85518" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:17">verse 17</span>? This confidence seems related to Paul’s being foolish, to his being beside himself. If he did not have such a confidence, he certainly could not boast. Otherwise, he would have conducted himself like a very cultured person and would not have boasted at all. A person who has the confidence that he is not beside himself will never boast in the way Paul did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85519" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:1">2 Corinthians 11</span>. </p>

I speak by way of dishonor. I don’t care what you think about me. I speak as though I have been weak.” Paul then goes on to compare himself with the Judaizers, saying that he is also a Hebrew, an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, and a minister of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="OXcwJNjQ2ZA9zyWrI_hRUjK0QEcKSNwRCPCXvmrYbxWm0GklnlQZ2vnTt-FZlbYLQ"> In these verses we have a comparison between Paul and the Judaizers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85523" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:23">verse 23</span> Paul speaks of being in labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more abundantly, in stripes excessively, and in deaths often. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85524" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:24-25">verses 24 and 25</span> Paul says, “From the Jews five times I received forty stripes <span class="pg" data-page-id="476" id="476">[476]</span> less one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked; a night and day I have spent in the deep.” The stripes in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85525" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:24">verse 24</span> were from the Jews, and the rods in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85526" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:25">verse 25</span> were used by the Romans (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85527" data-verses="Acts 16:22-23">Acts 16:22-23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85528" data-verses="Acts 22:25">22:25</span>). Not including the shipwreck at Melita (universally recognized as Malta), Paul was shipwrecked three times, none of which is related in the Acts. The Judaizers, of course, did not suffer any of these things. There is no comparison between them and Paul in matters such as these. </p>

The robbers mentioned in this verse were of tribes inhabiting the mountains between the tableland of Asia Minor and the coast, tribes notorious for robbery. The false brothers spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85530" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:26">verse 26</span> refer mainly to the Judaizing Christians. </p>

Hence, they differ from hunger. Hunger may refer to a situation in which there is no way to obtain food; involuntary fasting may refer to a situation of poverty. The cold was due to the weather and insufficient clothing; the nakedness refers to insufficient clothing or nakedness due to scourging or shipwreck. </p>

It denotes a crowd of cares pressing on Paul. This refers to the anxious care for all the churches. The things which are not mentioned are things not mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85533" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:23-27">verses 23 through 27</span>. </p>

The Judaizers labored and were sometimes imprisoned. But Paul was in labors more abundantly and in imprisonments more abundantly. Furthermore, the Judaizers did not have any of the other items. It is certain that they did not have any anxiety for the churches. But the apostles, especially Paul, daily had an anxious care for all the churches. </p>

These verses show that Paul was deep and also profoundly wise. The Judaizers boasted of how much they knew, claiming to be more knowledgeable than the Apostle Paul. Instead of arguing with them, Paul first boasted of his weaknesses. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85544" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:1-10">12:1-10</span> he comes to visions and revelations. Paul’s wise strategy is to defeat the arrogant Judaizers by showing that actually they do not have any vision or revelation. What the Judaizers know is vanity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uKAggo26VcYIYatm2wE1X7mlIjGB46_tKZYuAVrNKUS9ib9fxDxuiAAHQDKQU_Qdp">PAUL’S PURPOSE</h2><p data-content-id="fB3chRGO6sCoLulUcNNgtOT3erS1dpLUVy5vf6NODyl0eBKFRj4fSGaJoHME68qkM"> I believe that Paul’s purpose in writing these ten verses is to show to the believers at Corinth that he was much more knowledgeable than the Judaizers. He had the knowledge not only of human life on earth, but also of the things in Paradise and even in the third heaven. Paul not only knew these things; he also had a vision of them. Paul referred to this so that the follies of the Judaizers would be exposed. </p>
<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3essxpCum9S_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> If the Corinthians compared what Paul knew and what he had seen with the knowledge possessed by the Judaizers, they would say, “The Judaizers are superficial.

He has a knowledge of human life and of things in Paradise and in the third heaven.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="482" id="482">[482]</span> </p>

Apart from the Lord Jesus, has there ever been a person besides Paul who has seen the things in the third heaven and in Paradise? As God, the Lord Jesus was in the heavens. Then He became a man on earth, died on the cross, and went to Hades. Thus, He traveled through the heavens, the earth, and the region under the earth. Paul, a man born on earth, went to the third heaven and saw what was there. He also went to Paradise and beheld the things there under the earth. To be sure, no one in human history can compare with the Lord Jesus and the Apostle Paul. What could the Judaizers possibly say about this? </p>

Though it was not expedient to himself, it was necessary for their profit. He must boast so that they might be brought back, for their building up, to a sober and proper understanding concerning their relationship with the apostle. The word “come” in this verse means that Paul would now come to boast of the visions and revelations he has received of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQqlRcKCaH1qNoR9pCwjeaEM_YJjhABbevo6FqHM4jtib6znl17X3ZC_aTXbYtnrJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85547" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:1">verse 1</span> Paul speaks of both vision and revelation. Revelation is the putting aside of the veil, the unveiling of hidden things. Vision is the sight, the view, seen at the unveiling. So many things concerning God’s economy and administration in the universe were hidden. The Lord has revealed, unveiled, these things to the apostle, and he has received visions of these hidden things. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85549" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">verse 2</span> he says, “I know a man in Christ.” Referring to this man in Christ, he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85550" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:5">verse 5</span>, “On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.” The man in Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85551" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">verse 2</span> is the apostle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85552" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7">v. 7</span>), not as the old creation but as <span class="pg" data-page-id="483" id="483">[483]</span> the new creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85553" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:17">5:17</span>). In this section the apostle desires to boast of the new creation in Christ by boasting of his weaknesses in the flesh, the old creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85554" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:5">vv. 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85555" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="AE9CEdRlVZ0DfzvVD9YH94VL_i-X9J56-ym9dKH8zjh81ESQHHyJQoNdtgNJws_Lr"> The man in Christ mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85556" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">verse 2</span> was not Saul; it was Paul. Saul was the natural man, and Paul is the new man in Christ. It would be good if we all had two names: a name to denote the person before we were saved, what we were in Adam, and a name of the person who is now in Christ. Formerly we were a Saul; now we are a Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="FXS_xlsr3gzjoDc53zkOKTBo0Wu8y0Mncrkm33QyX0PDpj4qrLlX-GYZybGMhOX53"> Some time ago I heard that one writer said that there were two William Laws. The first William Law was a man of doctrine, knowledge, theology, letter, and tradition. The second William Law was a person of the Spirit and in the Spirit. The first William Law did not know anything concerning the Spirit, although he had much knowledge of theology and tradition. But one day he had a new beginning, and he became a person of the Spirit. This was the one who improved upon the teachings of certain mystical writers and made those teachings practical. We may say that eventually William Law became a man in Christ. Later Andrew Murray was helped by the writings of William Law. </p>
<p data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwl3dn_zsujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG"> When Paul speaks of a man in Christ, he is referring to his second man, to his second person. He would boast of this man, but he would not boast of the old self. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85557" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:5">verse 5</span> the word “myself” refers to Paul’s old self, not to his new self. It refers to Saul, not to Paul. Paul’s new self was altogether in Christ. This man in Christ was a new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="PNUAz1BnPGWr9vn3VyfkO4pAt6DsJJN42QaNk3uyWYv13wCria-l50U0YjsjRSAG4"> If we would pay attention to ourselves as believers, we shall see that we also are two persons. On the one hand, we are a person with an old self; on the other hand we are a person with a new self. This person is in Christ and is a new creation. We should no longer care for the first person. Instead, we should follow the second. </p>

Not even Paul was able to tell whether he was in the body or outside the body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85558" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:3">verse 3</span> he says, “Whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know—God knows.” It is certain that Paul did not go into a <span class="pg" data-page-id="484" id="484">[484]</span> trance. We should not think that what is described here is the experience of someone in a trance. What happened to Paul was beyond his ability to express, for not even he himself was altogether clear about it. </p>

First, he was caught away to the third heaven; second, he was caught away into Paradise. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85561" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">verse 2</span> Paul says, “I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know—God knows), such a one was caught away to the third heaven.” The Greek word rendered “caught away” here is the same word as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85562" data-verses="Acts 8:39">Acts 8:39</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85563" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</span>. Literally the Greek word translated “to” means till within, that is, as far as. The visible clouds may be considered the first heaven, and the sky, the second heaven. The third heaven must refer to the heaven of the heavens, the highest heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85564" data-verses="Deuteronomy 10:14">Deut. 10:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85565" data-verses="Psalms 148:4">Psa. 148:4</span>), where the Lord Jesus and God are today (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85566" data-verses="Ephesians 4:10">Eph. 4:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85567" data-verses="Hebrews 4:14">Heb. 4:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85568" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">1:3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="WlDhGpb-o-dfIrfdgIFMl6DMil1fml24TNCsbCBYZ3Xk2mvBGG6vLMDrTrpj2Aah4"> Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85569" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">verse 2</span> does not speak of Paul being caught up; it says that he was caught away to the third heaven. There is an important difference between being caught up and being caught away. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85570" data-verses="Acts 8:39">Acts 8:39</span> Philip was caught away by the Spirit. He knew that he was in the body when he was thus caught away. However, Paul did not know whether he was in the body or outside the body when he was caught away to the third heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwEuPQgXGqezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> The third heaven is a Hebrew expression denoting the highest heaven. As we have pointed out, the clouds may be regarded as the first heaven and the sky beyond the clouds as the second. The third heaven, therefore, must be the heaven above the sky, in biblical terms, the heaven above the heavens. Today the Father and the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, are in this highest heaven. Paul was caught away to this highest heaven. </p>

All the saints in the Lord’s recovery need to understand what these verses reveal, for they apply to all of us, not only to those who are elders or co-workers. We should not think that what Paul speaks of here has nothing to do with us. What Paul was, what he did, and how he conducted himself are a pattern for all believers, not only a pattern for the leading ones. The New Testament reveals that all believers in Christ should, like Paul, live a life for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is revealed emphatically, strongly, and definitely in the book of Ephesians. According to Ephesians, every part of the Body must live a life for the building up of the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="yxcdu93uxq_4UaWJ3d8WCyJu74PulTh8CmDqd1N9YKwTQetSM5JKpVCyIJstwrB0Y"> Unconsciously and subconsciously, we are still very much under the influence of our religious background.

We may think that, as common members of the Body, this chapter has nothing to do with us. Actually, Paul’s word is for us all.

Nevertheless, because of the influence of our religious background, we may think that if we are not apostles, elders, or deacons, Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85608" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:11-18">12:11-18</span> does not apply to us. We need to read these verses with the realization that they are meant for us all. Even the young ones among us should realize that these verses are for them. We are not able to predict how far along the Lord will take our young people and how much He will use them in the future. I say this as an introductory word to our considering what is revealed in these verses. </p>

For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing I am inferior to the super-apostles, even if I am nothing.” Here Paul says that the Corinthians compelled Paul to become foolish. They bore the responsibility for this. They should have commended Paul, but they were distracted and withheld their commendation. Their silence was wrong. They should have done something to commend Paul, for it was not fitting for him to be compelled to speak concerning himself. This, no doubt, was the feeling in Paul’s spirit as he wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85610" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:11">verse 11</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDGoPlpB5yIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> We should learn from this verse that there are occasions when we need to say something on behalf of the elders or those in the ministry. If a certain brother is the target of attack or opposition, he may not be able to say anything to defend himself. In such a situation we need to speak up and commend him. For example, years ago when Brother Nee was the target, I did something to vindicate him. The young ones especially need to learn to commend someone in such a situation. They should be bold to speak out. They should not be silent, and they should not be held back. </p>

It certainly was not pleasant for Paul to say this on his own behalf. It should not have been necessary for such a word to be uttered by him, since he was the target of the opposition. <span class="pg" data-page-id="495" id="495">[495]</span> A number of those in Corinth should have said this for Paul. They should have declared, “You Judaizers must realize that Paul is not inferior to you in any way.” As we have pointed out, Paul had received transcendent visions and revelations. He surely was not inferior to those arrogant, boastful, self-commending Judaizers. But because of the silence of the Corinthians, Paul was compelled to say something on his own behalf. He said forthrightly that in nothing was he inferior to the boastful Judaizers. </p>

Of course, it is not true that Paul was nothing. He really was something. However, he could not say this about himself. Hence, he was compelled to point out that, even if he were nothing, he was not inferior to the Judaizers. </p>

<p data-content-id="GBLvlFuZpxpOzPlHECwzEvBrtGtiuqGT35FfcvZbsVtjWxkMb27nu2FPxyYbaMXgd"> I believe that the expression “the signs of the apostle” was used first by the Corinthians, not by Paul. Perhaps the believers at Corinth were discussing the matter of the signs of an apostle. They may have asked themselves what were the signs of Paul’s being an apostle. If they had not raised this question, Paul would not have mentioned it here. </p>
<p data-content-id="cmiIzxR20Y_dSJklZO45xzLU-6N_Cm3nJ2NfM-q0H014sWP-zJ3t8FxgHnuOo3wxB"> The expression “the signs of the apostle” may sound strange to us, but it did not seem strange to the Corinthians. On the contrary, this expression was familiar to them, since they were probably the ones who invented it. Some of them may have thought that the Judaizers had more of these signs than Paul did. This was the reason in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85614" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:12">verse 12</span> Paul speaks of the signs of his apostleship. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPOLkxFsSoCryZgQt2yzcSvnHE-nZ5w7_pdxNa3pHGj5z1ylAbaA29u77zWaFxAcI"> Regarding the signs of the apostle, the first thing Paul mentions is “all endurance.” This indicates that endurance <span class="pg" data-page-id="496" id="496">[496]</span> is the leading sign of an apostle. With respect to the Corinthians, Paul endured defamation. Some of them went so far as to say that Paul was crafty and with guile took advantage of them. Paul uses the word “guile” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85615" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:16">verse 16</span>. In a note on this verse in his New Translation, Darby points out, “The apostle is not saying that he did this, but is answering a charge that he had kept up appearances by taking nothing himself, but knew how to indemnify himself by using Titus in order to receive from them. The charge was false, as he proceeds to show.” The Corinthians were saying that Paul would not come to Corinth to collect money himself. Therefore, he sent Titus to do this for him and thereby used Titus to cover himself. It is hard to believe that certain of the Corinthians would defame Paul to such an extent. Now we can understand why Paul emphasizes the matter of endurance. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ew9vy6DN0T4t8KNI4FMEgJ3sCrv8NP1ExG9fzfr7LpcE_8Qk7n6afcdDv_6DD5-VF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85616" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:12">12:12</span> Paul seems to be saying to the Corinthians, “You ask me to tell you the signs of my apostleship. The first sign is my endurance. You have criticized me and defamed me, but I have been able to endure it.” Then Paul goes on to mention signs, wonders, and works of power. These are miraculous things. But according to the context, although Paul speaks of these things, he does not emphasize them. Rather, Paul seems to say, “You talk about miracles as signs of apostleship. When I was with you, there were many signs, wonders, and works of power. But instead of emphasizing such things, I would first speak of my endurance.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QWWbmEXNP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv">NOT TREATED AS INFERIOR</h2><p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnHk-2f4SdTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85617" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:13">verse 13</span> Paul continues, “For what is it in which you were treated in an inferior manner to the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not an encumbrance to you? Forgive me this injustice.” The church at Corinth was not treated as inferior to the other churches or weaker than they. After pointing this out, Paul says, ironically, “Forgive me this injustice,” referring to not being an encumbrance to the believers. </p>

Before God, in Christ we speak; but all things, beloved, are for your building up.” Along with the Corinthians, we may think that in these chapters Paul is defending himself. The title of this group of messages even speaks of Paul’s vindication of his apostolic authority. Apparently in these chapters Paul is vindicating himself; actually, he is neither vindicating himself nor defending himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="KQ1cPcfuOvVl4Mmyzz3FpAoayEajAo7wSwXLWMQTP6sCDoYOjSfM0a-39ppdhcTUk"> In this verse Paul says that he speaks before God and in Christ. “In Christ” denotes the life by which the apostles speak; it refers to the means and substance of their speaking. “Before God” denotes the atmosphere in which the apostles speak; it refers to the sphere of their speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="lBjMjt2G8sZ0vHDHYsYqS9f3w7NSP3azDGoLlrFVyIDbgFeFRx11CrRFg3LJ2PAJD"> It may seem that Paul is not consistent. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85631" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:17">11:17</span> he says that he speaks not according to the Lord, but as in foolishness. Now he says that he speaks before God in Christ. I do not think Paul would defend himself against the charge of being inconsistent. Either we understand him or we do not. Paul knew what he was doing and what he was saying. Today we also are accused of being inconsistent and contradictory. </p>
<p data-content-id="CHHUPqbLd9y-7fMuEDalzFELvwBGzuIMwl3Vn_zMujJHd_aBpjomKS4mDyYCHVLiG"> Consider Paul’s situation in 2 Corinthians. When he was speaking as it were in foolishness, he said that he did not speak according to the Lord. In other words, Paul was saying <span class="pg" data-page-id="504" id="504">[504]</span> that his foolishness, and not the Lord, was the motivation of his speaking. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85632" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:19">12:19</span> he says that he speaks in Christ, by Christ as his life. He also says that he speaks before God, that is, in God as the sphere of his speaking. Here Paul seems to be saying, “I am not defending myself. Rather, I am speaking by Christ as my life and before God as my atmosphere. Furthermore, I speak for the sake of your building up. All things, beloved, are not for our vindication, but are for your building up. I would like to spend and be spent utterly for you. I don’t care to defend myself. I care for you and for your building up. This is the focus of my concern. I am not trying to convince you to receive me as an apostle. My concern is that you be built up. As long as you are built up, I will be satisfied. I am willing to give anything for this.” </p>

However, Paul was concerned that when he came to them, he would find them not such as he wished. Moreover, he realized that the Corinthians might find him not such as they wished, for it might be necessary for Paul to be bold toward them and to discipline them. Hence, it would seem that he was not tender or loving. </p>

All these are characteristics of people living in the flesh for their own interests. The Greek word rendered strife also means debate, contention, quarrel. Likewise, the word for backbitings means detractions or evil speakings, and that for whisperings means secret slanders. By “puffings up” Paul means inflated arrogance. In Greek the word is a kindred word to “puffed up” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85635" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>. The word for disorders may also be rendered disturbances. <span class="pg" data-page-id="505" id="505">[505]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vgMaJrWo1aj1izLH19_sOIePrbjQlkWceTW2s6owfDYFI4wPDLhc8PmyLDz9UnLFj"> In this verse Paul is saying to the Corinthians, “If you are such persons, I will be put to shame when I come to you again. I have been serving you and ministering to you. I have already written one epistle to you. If I find that you are full of strife, jealousy, angers, rivalries, backbitings, whisperings, puffings up, and disorders, I will be put to shame. God would humble me, and I would have to ask Him for mercy because of the pitiful result of my ministry. It would surely be a shame to me if these things are still among you when I come.” </p>

What we have in this portion of 2 Corinthians is something related to the practice of the church life. Many of today’s Christians do not pay attention to these chapters, because they do not feel the need for them. The reason they do not sense a need is that they do not have the church life. But these chapters are needed by those in the practical church life. We thank the Lord that, under His mercy, we do know our need for these chapters. To be conscious of our need is a sign that we are under the Lord’s mercy. </p>
<p data-content-id="2QtNSqifrKm6KDKOUl_817ofdSDEhpNdwEuHQgnOqezrNJd72bUKQJS34NS6LR7Dq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85637" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> Paul mentions eleven negative things: strife, jealousy, angers, rivalries, backbitings, whisperings, puffings up, disorders, uncleanness, fornication, and debauchery. Some may wonder how it is possible for such things to be found in the church life. Oh, we need to wake up and not have a dream concerning these matters. Furthermore, we need to consider our own situation. With you is there ever any backbiting or criticizing? Perhaps when a certain person stands up in the meeting, you may say quietly to yourself, “There he is again.” Is this not a kind of whispering? Do you have any strife or jealousy, any anger or rivalry? Can you say that in the church life you have not been in rivalry with others? The items mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85638" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:20">verse 20</span> may be somewhat polite sins rather than gross sins. Those who are more <span class="pg" data-page-id="506" id="506">[506]</span> cultured will criticize others behind their backs. Those who are cultured and refined do not criticize others in a crude way. Instead, they may whisper about them and backbite. Furthermore, we need to check whether or not we are puffed up. Inwardly we may have a puffed-up spirit, and we may display this outwardly in our attitude. Even though you may be educated, refined, and cultured, you cannot hide your arrogant attitude. Along with the more refined sins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85639" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:20">verse 20</span>, Paul names three gross sins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85640" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:21">verse 21</span>. It is possible for all these sinful things to creep into the church life. This was the reason Paul said that he feared coming to Corinth and seeing such things still present among the believers. That would have been a shame to him and to his ministry. </p>

If your life is not a rejoicing life, your Christian life is not normal. To rejoice includes more than just being joyful. It is possible to be joyful without rejoicing. Joyfulness is something inward, but rejoicing means that our inward joy is expressed outwardly. I believe that Paul would say that in order to rejoice we must use our voice; that is, we need to sound out our joy, to give it voice. Thus, to voice out our joy is to rejoice. We should rejoice either by singing, praising, shouting, or calling on the Lord. Therefore, to rejoice is to voice out our inner joy, to sound it out. This rejoicing is an important characteristic of our Christian life. If our Christian life is normal, it will be a life of rejoicing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="516" id="516">[516]</span> </p>

Literally the Greek word rendered “perfected” means completed thoroughly, that is, repaired or adjusted, put in order again, mended, perfectly joined together, thus restored. In Greek it is the root of the word for perfecting in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85686" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:9">verse 9</span> and also the root for perfecting in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85687" data-verses="Ephesians 4:12">Ephesians 4:12</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="DnqbUKjTCw3mfJ1gYjAUgSSLHQrP9o79QWWjmEnFP2k3eVNd4D_rBCWE0rViQZ1vv"> To be perfected is to be restored, mended, repaired, and adjusted. It is to be brought back to the right position and restored to the right track so that we may be built up together with others in the Body. The books of 1 and 2 Corinthians are books of perfecting. The unique goal of these two Epistles is to perfect the damaged, distracted, and divided saints at Corinth. The believers there had been damaged, and the situation among them was unhealthy. Therefore, these two books were written to perform the necessary task of perfecting the believers, of bringing them back to a healthy condition full of life, of edifying them, and of equipping them for the building up of the Body. All this is included in Paul’s charge, “Be perfected.” </p>
<p data-content-id="SjnPqYizNvs9fVSp8Uzyt7roI4LE57xdnHkG2fIadTZoD7crTVtOchDJgOHAImOwi"> We may regard the exhortation “be perfected” as active-passive in voice. Strictly speaking, this is passive. Nevertheless, it also contains an active element. This is the reason we speak of it as being active-passive. God is waiting to perfect us; however, we must take the initiative to be perfected. Moreover, the apostle was used to perfect the Corinthians. This means that a perfecting work was being done. But the Corinthians still had to be perfected. We may liken Paul to a physician and say that he was ready to dispense medicine into the believers, but it was still necessary for them to take the initiative to receive the medicine. The doctor was at hand and the medicine was ready, but the crucial question was this: Were the Corinthians willing to take the medicine and be healed? This was the reason Paul urged them to be perfected. </p>

<p data-content-id="5ksVTOuvT8tpuu6TUFBAE8aqCc6EqY_sh1f42yzIRc9nxS0fOj53YNNO6vegDf7Ss"> If we study the whole book of 2 Corinthians, we shall understand that in this Epistle encouragement is an important matter. For this reason, Paul’s words “be encouraged” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85691" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:11">13:11</span> are very meaningful. Being encouraged means that we are first comforted, then made calm, and then satisfied, strengthened, and enabled. Then as a result of all this we are encouraged. We do not lose heart, and we are not discouraged. Here Paul seems to be saying, “Believers at Corinth, the work of perfecting I have been doing on you should not cause you to be sad. Instead, you should be glad and joyful. You should even voice out your joy. Furthermore, you need to be encouraged. Corinthians, do not lose heart.” </p>
<p data-content-id="NpJFwFGJTKrLpiAuIQyaZZLxjAlDT4YgYoAiwPsB_6O6fxO0OI3Bl2olPVIu2BgnB"> The book of 2 Corinthians is a book of encouragement. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85692" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:1">Chapters one</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85693" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:1">seven</span> are both full of encouragement. As a book of encouragement, this Epistle brings comfort, satisfaction, strength, enablement, and joy. It brings us whatever we need. If we have been satisfied, strengthened, and thereby encouraged, we shall be energized to go on in the Christian life and in the church life without losing heart. </p>

Thinking the same thing should be the main factor for the distracted and confused Corinthians to be perfected, adjusted, put in order, and restored. In his first Epistle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85695" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">1 Cor. 1:10</span>), Paul had already exhorted them to think the same thing: “But I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.” The Greek word translated “attuned” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85696" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span> is the same word that is translated “mending” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85697" data-verses="Matthew 4:21">Matthew 4:21</span>. It means to repair, to restore, to adjust, to mend, making a broken thing thoroughly complete, joined perfectly <span class="pg" data-page-id="518" id="518">[518]</span> together. As a whole, the Corinthian believers were divided, broken. They needed mending to join them perfectly together that they may be in harmony, having the same mind and the same opinion. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHICCchb8mPYx_y1pRpTviTMweRXmCO2Zaql8upRw787Wpsi_i9Y4jRWi6-3v2AD"> We may take as an illustration the keyboard of a piano. Each key needs to be properly in tune in order to be in harmony with all the other keys. Likewise, Paul exhorted the Corinthians to be attuned in the same mind, that is, to think the same thing and not to have peculiar thoughts. We all need to learn by grace to think the same thing. </p>

This means to be at peace with one another and probably with God as well. Paul knew that there had been strife and rivalry among the Corinthians. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85699" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:11">First Corinthians 1:11</span> says, “For it was made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.” This clearly indicates that among the believers at Corinth there was not any peace. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85700" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:11">13:11</span> Paul urges them to be at peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="ia-GMUG9MpDSYCnXWf0oip_HBGzvLkjN8W6LLVilxV6TQw07_DFdBeuP3W4i3nJ51"> The Christian life is a life of rejoicing and also a life of peace. Thus, to strive against others or to have rivalry with them is contrary to a basic principle of the Christian life. Strife and rivalry are characteristics of the life of fallen mankind. Today the world is full of strife and rivalry. In every aspect of human society, rivalry, and fighting are common. The Christian life is absolutely different from this. As a heavenly people, we should always be at peace with one another. </p>

Hence, the apostle <span class="pg" data-page-id="519" id="519">[519]</span> wishes that the God of love and peace shall be with them for their adjusting and perfecting. They need the love and peace of God to fill them that they may walk according to love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85706" data-verses="Romans 14:15">Rom. 14:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85707" data-verses="Ephesians 5:2">Eph. 5:2</span>) and have peace with one another (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85708" data-verses="Romans 14:19">Rom. 14:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85709" data-verses="Hebrews 12:14">Heb. 12:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="jbiiCF4bhvYm7oR22K38ehPbyaI-_CdDSMgAoljfQ5wGqRvUZUD-7T9cr6VewgY2W"> Because the believers at Corinth had strife and rivalry, they certainly were short of love. The book of 1 Corinthians has an entire chapter, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85710" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, devoted to the subject of love. Now in his conclusion of 2 Corinthians Paul emphasizes the God of love. He does not emphasize the God of power or the God of miracles. Here Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians, “You are lacking in love, and therefore you need the God of love. Because of your situation, you do not need the God of power or the mighty God. The One you need is the God of love and peace.” </p>

<p data-content-id="VY-3Uy_Bh_7GW9n6ovuvozf4TeDWZZ0Dv2Hw11byT6VyE8c8z_Z_FFg8NgTH8OwJB"> In the Old Testament we also have a threefold blessing, the blessing pronounced by the Levitical priesthood at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85723" data-verses="Numbers 6:1">Numbers chapter six</span>. In this threefold blessing the Triune God is implied. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85724" data-verses="Numbers 6:24-26">Numbers 6:24-26</span> says, “The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.” First we have the blessing related to the Father: “The Lord bless thee, and keep thee.” Second, we have the blessing related to the Son: “The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee.” Third we have the blessing related to the Spirit: “The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.” The Levitical priests surely treasured this blessing. However, it cannot be compared with the blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85725" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>. What we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85726" data-verses="Numbers 6:24-26">Numbers 6:24-26</span> is a mere blessing, that is, a blessing without enjoyment.

Thus, we have God the Father as love, we have God the Son as grace, and we have God the Spirit as fellowship. This means that we have the Triune God in a direct way as our enjoyment.

<p data-content-id="Iyur14rVUxXIu3hAKTVmrlMSVdgVUM3essxZCsiRS_HvO6HHR2bbHXtT1NksRwo-H"> In the New Testament the real blessing is the Triune God Himself. As we have pointed out, this blessing is threefold, a blessing of grace, love, and fellowship. With love as the source, grace as the course, and fellowship as the transmission, the Triune God reaches us to be our life, our life supply, and our enjoyment.

These are not three separate matters, but three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods, but three “hypostases...of the one same undivided and indivisible” God (Philip Schaff). The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God, for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with <span class="pg" data-page-id="525" id="525">[525]</span> Their divine virtues. Here the grace of the Lord is mentioned first, because this book is on the grace of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85732" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:12">2 Cor. 1:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85733" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:15">4:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85734" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:1">6:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85735" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">8:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85736" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:9">9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85737" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:8">9:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85738" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:14">14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85739" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">12:9</span>). Such a divine attribute of three virtues—love, grace, and fellowship—and such a Triune God of the three divine hypostases—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—were needed by the distracted and confused, yet encouraged and restored, Corinthian believers. Hence, the apostle used all these divine and precious things in one sentence to conclude his lovely and dear Epistle. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kkRUYSlLKcktvYibyxbvtE47BJ7v3mCFcUuz6nRprUzCJE2J1Lt5XWmRiKsrwK7FR">THREE HYPOSTASES</h2><p data-content-id="JDxchtuQA5D2P2QkAZYgiQc0nw370rwsQsesVt9qrzpICcSnqTjx5pVRCFLj9PiQG"> In the preceding paragraph we twice used the word hypostases. This word requires further explanation. The singular form of the word is hypostasis. It is anglicized from the Greek. It is composed of two Greek words: <em>hupo,</em> a preposition that means under, and <em>stasis,</em> a word that means supports or stands forth. Hence, this word refers to a support under, a support beneath, that is, something underneath that supports. The Greek word <em>hupostasis</em> is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85740" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:4">9:4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85741" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:17">11:17</span>. This word means the groundwork on which some superstructure is founded; hence, foundation, ground; thence, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85742" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:4">9:4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85743" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:17">11:17</span>, confidence. If we have the proper groundwork or support underneath, we then can have confidence. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw0YWitKf-Ysjaob4hiWbygg9KABrH0-QOUAgeDtADO_AYwwyzDxMTrqw-9oB9NIZ"> Some dictionaries associate the word hypostasis with the three Persons of the Trinity. This meaning of the word, given in certain dictionaries, is an interpretation. The word hypostasis does not mean person. But theologians have used it to refer to the three Persons of the Godhead, to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Actually, the Father, Son, and Spirit are three hypostases, that is, supporting substances of the Godhead. In other words, the Godhead is composed of the supporting substances of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This means that if these three hypostases were taken away, the Godhead would lose its substance. </p>
<p data-content-id="aC1KixwWTLJdnRKmlEY5c1PLic8pUtke0H3wVRGAkVguSOfyu-0u_fnhTPrv8C_qD"> Certain ancient teachers of the Bible used the word hypostases to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Other theologians spoke of the three hypostases as denoting the three Persons of the Godhead. This use of the word <span class="pg" data-page-id="526" id="526">[526]</span> person has led some into the error of tritheism, the doctrine that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods. As we have pointed out a number of times, W. H. Griffith Thomas has said that we should not press the word person too far, lest we have the doctrine of tritheism. Thus, it is not entirely safe to use the word person in this way. Nevertheless, we may need to use it temporarily. For instance, we use it in one of our hymns (<em>Hymns</em> #608): “What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit, in Person three, in substance all are one.” But even if we use this term temporarily, we wish to make it emphatically clear that we have only one God, the unique God. Nevertheless, God is triune: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The term hypostases is an attempt to convey the truth of the three-one God. </p>

In the Bible the Trinity is never revealed merely as a doctrine. It is always revealed or mentioned in regard to the relationship of God with His creatures, especially with men created by Him, and even more with His chosen and redeemed people. The first divine title used in His divine revelation concerning His creation, <em>Elohim</em> in Hebrew, is plural in number (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85745" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Gen. 1:1</span>). This implies that He, as the Creator of the heavens and the earth for man, is triune. Concerning the creation of man in His own image, after His own likeness, He used the plural pronouns, “us” and “our,” referring to His trinity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85746" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>) and implying that He would be one with man and express Himself through man in His trinity.
