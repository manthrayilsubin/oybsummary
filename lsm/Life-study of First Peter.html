<p data-content-id="xCYRCBsQuw2L-c2XMdJX4w0GGOwSdw_mQ7e0Dzkl6TOAjj70sSbUDgvOuVhrfbbT9"> With this message we begin our Life-study of the Epistles of 1 and 2 Peter and Jude. In the past we have somewhat neglected the writings of Peter. We have spent much time and energy on other books of the Bible, especially the writings of Paul. Perhaps a part of the reason for our neglect of 1 and 2 Peter is the over-exalting of Peter by Catholicism. Catholicism considers Peter their first pope. We do not agree with the claim of Catholicism concerning this. Thus, our Peter, the Peter revealed in the Bible, is in certain respects different from the concept of Peter held by those in Catholicism. Because Catholicism exalts Peter in an improper way, I have paid less attention to Peter’s writings. </p>
<p data-content-id="rjTPLhTT8an5I7cUTTzmydgHDKUxNZQXRg9lnBtbC--nVsKvp_fjOWL62w9JaapYK"> However, I have given a number of messages on 1 and 2 Peter. In 1973 I had a conference on 1 and 2 Peter in Vancouver, British Columbia. Also in the same year I gave messages on grace in the writings of Peter during a conference held in San Francisco. These messages were published in <em>The Stream</em> (in Vol. 12, No. 1, February 1974, and No. 2, May 1974). In those messages I stressed strongly that Peter does have something rich, high, and particular to minister to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dNl6tgRNGfx6EVOqeWt6MZmKxp5SbbPUU4ldkBJC7GGgVM62D66Z7Aowb9mcgKl2v">THE CHARACTER OF PETER’S WRITINGS</h2><p data-content-id="QfakavptTSx9tWovQHAybkDO6VfUOKGQDY-JxCUP4mm7A_CcJcFvQFbMh0TJNMl0F"> Paul wrote fourteen Epistles, but Peter wrote only two, containing a total of eight chapters. Nevertheless, even though Peter’s writings are brief, he uses certain terms that cannot be found in the writings of Paul. For example, Peter speaks of the precious blood of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100215" data-verses="1Peter 1:19">1 Pet. 1:19</span>). Although <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> Paul speaks concerning the blood of Christ, he does not use this particular expression, the precious blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7u_lU_w_mckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> At this point we need to see that a particular characteristic of Peter’s writing is his use of adjectives, especially high adjectives. Along with the precious blood, Peter mentions the incorruptible seed, unfading glory, and divine power. Paul does not use these expressions. Peter, however, had the habit of using such adjectives. But this was more than a habit; it is an indication that something had truly been built into Peter’s character. </p>
<p data-content-id="BuN0Wi41-WaNn4QzIFus7KYsD2UiQU_9Lg-GlSyuVYW03tWNbFC9Yi26QowoiNyuD"> During the years he followed the Lord Jesus, Peter saw many things. But during those years he did not know the significance of what he saw. In fact, as we read the four Gospels, we may think that Peter was foolish. Although Peter did not behave in a clever way, the Lord Jesus selected him and put him ahead of all the other disciples. For this reason, in the Gospels Peter’s name is usually listed as the first of the disciples. </p>
<p data-content-id="xCYRCBsQuw2L-c2XMdJX4w0GGOwSZiPmQ7e0Dzkl6TOAjj70sSbUDgvOuVhrfbbT9"> Peter did not have the spiritual understanding of the things he had seen. He lacked the proper apprehension of them in life. This was why in the message given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100216" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100217" data-verses="John 15:1">fifteen</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100218" data-verses="John 16:1">sixteen</span> of John, the Lord Jesus spoke of the Spirit of reality: “I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100219" data-verses="John 16:12-13">John 16:12-13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rjTPLhTT8an5I7cUTTzmydgHDKUxKLQXRg9lnBtbC--nVsKvp_fjOWL62w9JaapYK"> The Spirit of reality did come on the day of Christ’s resurrection, and Peter was probably the first one to be infused with this Spirit. This explains why the Peter in the first chapter of Acts is so different from the Peter in the Gospels. In the Gospels, Peter often spoke in a nonsensical way. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100220" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span>, however, Peter did not speak like this. Rather, when he stood up to speak, he was transparent, crystal clear. Peter became transparent because the Spirit of reality had entered into him. This wonderful Spirit, who had been infused into Peter, then reminded him of all the things he had seen and heard. This can be proved by Peter’s own writings. For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100221" data-verses="2Peter 1:16-18">2 Peter 1:16-18</span> he refers to the time he, James, and John were <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> with the Lord Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration. This indicates that the Spirit of reality had reminded him of that event and had shown him the significance of it. </p>
<p data-content-id="dNl6tgRNGfx6EVOqeWt6MZmKxp5SdJfUU4ldkBJC7GGgVM62D66Z7Aowb9mcgKl2v"> The Spirit reminded Peter of all the things he saw when he was with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years. Peter saw many things, but he did not have the proper apprehension or understanding of them at the time. But after the coming of the Spirit of reality and through the Spirit’s reminding him of those things, Peter began to understand their significance. Peter may have said to himself, “Oh, now I know why the Lord bothered me so much and why He often exposed me. I recall the way I spoke to the tax collector. He asked me if the Lord paid the poll tax, and immediately I answered, ‘Yes.’ Right after that the Lord Jesus put me to shame by telling me that it was not necessary for Him to pay the half-shekel. Then He sent me fishing and told me I would catch a fish with a shekel in its mouth. Now I know that when I answered with a yes, the Lord would say no, and when I would say no, He would say yes.” After the Lord’s resurrection and after the Spirit of reality had come into Peter, he underwent such a change. </p>
<p data-content-id="QfakavptTSx9tWovQHAybkDO6VfUHZmQDY-JxCUP4mm7A_CcJcFvQFbMh0TJNMl0F"> Through the Spirit of reality something solid, high, rich, and strong was built into the very fibers of Peter’s being. Therefore, when he spoke concerning the Lord’s blood, he added the word “precious.” This adjective touches our feeling. As he uttered this word, Peter must have had a certain feeling within him regarding the preciousness of the blood of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100222" data-verses="1Peter 1:18-19">1:18 and 19</span> he says, “Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.” Do you not believe that Peter expressed a particular feeling when he uttered these words? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100223" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">verse 23</span> of the same chapter Peter goes on to say, “Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.” In this verse Peter speaks of the incorruptible seed and of the living and abiding word. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100224" data-verses="1Peter 1:4">1:4</span> he describes our inheritance as “incorruptible and undefiled and unfading.” Thus, in these <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> verses, as illustrations of Peter’s practice of using adjectives, we have the words precious, incorruptible, living, abiding, undefiled, and unfading. This indicates that in this particular characteristic Peter is stronger, higher, and richer than Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7u_lU3jPmckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100225" data-verses="1Peter 2:21">First Peter 2:21</span> says that Christ suffered on our behalf, leaving us a model that we should follow in His steps. The Greek word rendered “model” is difficult to translate. Some versions use the word “example.” Literally, the Greek word means a writing copy. Thus, the Lord Jesus is our writing copy, an under-writing used by students to trace letters in learning to draw them. A modern term to describe the process of copying is “xeroxing.” Xeroxing does not involve following or imitating. On the contrary, xeroxing is a matter of reproducing an original. (See the message entitled “Spiritual Xeroxing,” published in <em>The Stream,</em> Vol. 12, No. 1, February 1974). Christ is a writing copy not for us to imitate nor merely to follow. Rather, He is a writing copy to be xeroxed into us. This means that we all should become reproductions, xerox copies, of Christ. This is the significance of the Greek word translated “model” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100226" data-verses="1Peter 2:21">2:21</span>, a term not used by Paul in his writings. </p>
<p data-content-id="lstMWBRC66b7v6qyJcYqNzFILcnfj2nmDBhzKVdlvVCbYUbTkcY3VpluEL-g0HaK4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100227" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">3:7</span> Peter uses another unique expression—“grace of life.” We are familiar with the words grace and life, but not with the expression “grace of life.” As weaker vessels, the wives are joint-heirs with their husbands of the grace of life. What a sweet expression! We, however, may be familiar with the grace of salvation or the grace of forgiveness without ever having been impressed with the grace of life. In his writings, Paul does not use this particular precious and sweet expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="OL9AaTfdcQNgWo6E__9gENXi_ekY5Gu_AtnWibxhvo9pWA2k7cDx1vl4hlJzNlNkh"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100228" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">4:17</span> Peter says, “Because it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God.” Here we have a particular expression on the negative side: God’s judgment beginning from His own household. Paul does not tell us this. But Peter is very particular in the matter of God’s judgment beginning from His own household. </p>

Originally, he was Simon, not Peter. The name Simon denotes the old man, the natural man, full of self. But when Peter came to the Lord Jesus, the Lord immediately gave him a new name. The Lord looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100251" data-verses="John 1:42">John 1:42</span>). The Lord Jesus never does anything merely in name. His changing of Simon’s name had a reality behind it. By changing Simon’s name the Lord Jesus indicated that He would change Simon into Peter, into a stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y1KxaLRh8hx0MgtFrlaDNr3aWT9essssEy3Istv7kjGteO8_iFmxZwHWdjP2Mm1f_"> If we read the four Gospels and Peter’s Epistles, we may find it difficult to believe that Simon, a Galilean fisherman, could be such a writer. By the time he wrote his Epistles, Peter had been changed, transformed. One of the hymns in our hymnal begins with the words, “Earthen vessel I was made, Christ in me the treasure laid” (<em>Hymns,</em> #548). The last stanza of this hymn says, “Transformation is my need.” Simon was an earthen vessel; Peter, however, was a transformed person. He had been regenerated and had become altogether new. Therefore, in his two Epistles we cannot see his flesh, the self, or his natural life. Instead, what we see is <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> the new man expressed in his writing. Christ is expressed in Peter’s writing. </p>
<p data-content-id="E5Cs4PZPSSv6OEWz8g7NJx1NyvELiFSordnbo0VyskzAIq8kfKQrWBmYM6YTZqBiW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100252" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1:1</span> Peter refers to himself as an apostle of Jesus Christ. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100253" data-verses="Galatians 2:8">Galatians 2:8</span> we know that Peter was an apostle to the Jews. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DbPKqMhGZ8HsKpWPyG3BaeHvYV8ERj4XrZab9lZvy6A64HpIlS9qdNUlAmm2Bal4_">CHOSEN PILGRIMS OF THE DISPERSION</h2><p data-content-id="LEaEZEVlbby5jrDyOPbM6R6sIYEK_HLiYgQjzgvFr4_C9_bVvJACZ0AXcCqEVMbI5"> The first Epistle of Peter is addressed to “the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion.” These chosen ones were sojourning on the earth, somewhat like the children of Israel sojourning in the wilderness. Although they were chosen ones, they had been scattered and they were sojourning. </p>
<p data-content-id="muFVkpXJoJnc0dsDO0S9EVshDFtJLL9IBNIQfmY9uCiT9k_fZIRoMYXsNsCmWVvlw"> The word “chosen” brings in the thought of God’s government. Both of Peter’s Epistles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100254" data-verses="2Peter 3:1">2 Pet. 3:1</span>) are concerned with the government of God. God’s government is universal; it deals with all His creatures in order that He may have a clean and pure universe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100255" data-verses="2Peter 3:13">2 Pet. 3:13</span>) to express Himself. In the New Testament age, this dealing begins from His chosen people, His elect, His own household (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100256" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">1 Pet. 4:17</span>), especially from His chosen pilgrims who are dispersed and sojourning among the nations, the Gentiles, as His testimony. Hence, these two books emphasize the believers’ being chosen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100257" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">2:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100258" data-verses="1Peter 5:13">5:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100259" data-verses="2Peter 1:10">2 Pet. 1:10</span>). As God’s chosen race, God’s choice, God’s particular possession, the dispersed chosen pilgrims need to see that they are under God’s governmental dealing for a positive purpose, regardless of the situation and environment they are in. Anything and everything that happens to them, whether persecution or any other kind of trial and suffering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100260" data-verses="1Peter 1:6">1 Pet. 1:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100261" data-verses="1Peter 5:9">5:9</span>), is just a part of God’s precious governmental dealing. Such a vision will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100262" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">5:10</span>) that they may grow in grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100263" data-verses="2Peter 3:18">2 Pet. 3:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcaaVHTVCgvGIROFjCd-BQVV-xdBljsz4vwu4bpiV0zCG8Fh4RpvKatN3QN0zME-K"> The Greek word rendered pilgrims can also be translated sojourners. Strictly speaking, this term in this book refers to the Jewish believers who were sojourners, foreigners, dispersed in the Gentile world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100264" data-verses="1Peter 2:11-12">2:11-12</span>). However, the principle of pilgrims can be applied to all believers, both Jewish and Gentile, because all are the heavenly pilgrims sojourning as foreigners on this earth. These pilgrims are God’s elect, <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> chosen by God out of the human race, out of all the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100265" data-verses="Revelation 5:9-10">Rev. 5:9-10</span>), according to His foreknowledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100266" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1 Pet. 1:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Ax-XoUmXRGuNtjUgn0zaCf8sBeAKgbY_bx2QVWud5sj4sJ3E4W0PzhghSZKkIgXk6"> The term “dispersion” was familiar to all the scattered Jews among the nations. This word indicates that this Epistle was written to the Jewish believers. It is from the Greek word that means to scatter or spread abroad, with a root meaning to sow. This implies that the scattered Jews were sown as seeds among the Gentiles. </p>

Here, the divine economy through the operation of the Trinity of the Godhead for the believers’ participation in the Triune God is unveiled. God the Father’s choosing, His selection, is the initiation; God the Spirit’s sanctification carries out the selection of God the Father; and God the Son’s redemption, signified by the sprinkling of His blood, is the completion. Through these steps the believers have been chosen, sanctified, and redeemed into the enjoyment of the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—into whom they have been baptized (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100270" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>) and whose virtues they are enjoying (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100271" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>). </p>

Yes, here we see the operation of the Triune God upon the elect for their participation in His full salvation. </p>

In typology, the sprinkling of the atoning blood ushered the sprinkled people into the old covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100284" data-verses="Exodus 24:6-8">Exo. 24:6-8</span>). Likewise, the sprinkling of Christ’s redeeming blood brings the sprinkled believers into the blessing of the new covenant, that is, into the full enjoyment of the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100285" data-verses="Hebrews 9:13-14">Heb. 9:13-14</span>). It is a striking mark that separates the sprinkled people from the common ones without God. </p>

As used in Peter’s Epistles, the word “salvation” implies full salvation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100286" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">2:2</span> Peter says, “As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation.” On the one hand, we have been saved; on the other hand, we still need to grow unto salvation. This means that there is a further salvation that we have not yet reached. In other words we are short of some kind of salvation. We do not yet have it, and we need to grow unto it. We need to keep on growing until we reach, arrive at, full salvation. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100287" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">1:5</span>, this is the salvation that is “ready to be revealed at the last time.” When the Lord Jesus comes back, this salvation will be brought in. </p>

<p data-content-id="hxMBDypTTZrlXu74HtrBsOo2zD2U1Ogm0XNLbZECSYiOVkeYnRerhlESfi0ONqauL"> In the writings of Peter a single word is often rich in meaning. Take, for example, Peter’s use of the word “sprinkling” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100308" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span>. In this verse Peter speaks concerning the “sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.” As Peter wrote these words, it seems he was saying, “You scattered Jewish believers are familiar with the sprinkling of the blood of sheep and goats described in the Old Testament. However, you must realize that the sprinkling of animal blood is a type of the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. The old sprinkling, the sprinkling of the blood of animals, merely brought God’s people into the Old Testament blessing. But the new sprinkling, the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, brings us into the full enjoyment of God’s new covenant.” By this example we see that in the Epistles of Peter a single word can indicate a great deal. </p>

The unbelieving Jews knew about God. Their God was the One who created the universe. But these Jews would not believe that their God was also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. There <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> is an important difference here. Of course, it is not true to say that the Jews believe in one God and that Christians believe in a different God. The crucial point here is that there is a great difference between the understanding and realization concerning God among Jews and among Christians. According to the understanding of the Jews, God is the Creator of the universe, but He is not the God and Father of Jesus Christ. In our understanding, however, God is both the Creator of the universe and the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100310" data-verses="John 20:17">John 20:17</span>). This is the reason Peter uses the definite article before “God” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100311" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1:3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="VHdJY_o_fao3kO2JrDGWs_GaXzMGfI_C66Se0kl9tbbJLjl5GwFFUJbqKAGXhNLx1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100312" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1:3</span> Peter declares that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has regenerated us unto a living hope according to His great mercy. Here we see that once again Peter uses an adjective: he speaks not merely of God’s mercy, but speaks of His great mercy. Paul also speaks concerning God’s mercy, but he does not use the adjective “great” to describe it. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100314" data-verses="1Peter 1:1-3">1:1 through 3</span> we have four actions in the following sequence: choosing, sanctifying, redeeming, and regenerating. In eternity past God chose us, selected us. Then His Spirit came to us to separate us. Following that, we received the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, the application of His redemption. At the very moment we were sprinkled outwardly by the blood, we were inwardly regenerated by the sanctifying Spirit. Therefore, following God’s choosing, the Spirit’s sanctifying, and Christ’s redeeming, we were regenerated. </p>
<p data-content-id="3Sfgt49N4yqnUk9Ymhzai--1ejUmjEuJSUKY6facN-ragmCO58awdH5H1zP2HCGtX"> Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God’s full salvation. Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God. Regeneration enlivens us with God’s life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God. Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope. Such regeneration takes place through the resurrection of Christ from among the dead. When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him. Thus, we were resurrected with <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100315" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Eph. 2:6</span>). In His resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature. This is the basic factor of our regeneration. </p>
<p data-content-id="GjIWRwpqK7l9xUJ5LpqIMdMOhAGKWK4Fma1VvLFr-tFZ4dW7ECS577LiXyd5A_MMr"> To be regenerated is to receive another life, the divine life, in addition to the human life. We all received the human life from our parents. But because of God’s choosing, the Spirit’s sanctifying, and Christ’s redeeming, God begets us, regenerates us. As a result, we have a second birth. Through regeneration God the Father imparts the divine life into us. Therefore, the first birth was the birth of our human life, and the second birth, the birth of the divine life. We all have been born of the divine life. This is what it means to be regenerated. </p>
<p data-content-id="ck7ZHbdqM24QGnW7JL0wBUosWg5EWCt1X9kzGHSV3YY4pgJDsbMgZhhrhLbkg96gz"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100316" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1:3</span> Peter tells us that we have been regenerated unto a living hope. The Greek word rendered “unto” means issuing in, resulting in, with a view to. God has regenerated us with a view to a living hope. This hope in our pilgrimage today is for the future. It is not a hope of objective things; it is a hope of life, even eternal life, with all the endless divine blessings. It is this hope that we should set completely on the coming grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100317" data-verses="1Peter 1:13">1:13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Y1KxaLRh8hx0MgtFrlaDNr3aWTteq_csEy3Istv7kjGteO8_iFmxZwHWdjP2Mm1f_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100318" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">verse 3</span> Peter speaks not merely of hope, but of a living hope. It is not easy to explain what this living hope is. Some may interpret it to mean a hope that is living and not dead. Yes, it is correct to say that the hope we have is living in contrast to a dead hope. Nevertheless, if we have the skill to interpret this expression according to our experience, we shall realize that more is involved. From experience we know that the life-giving Spirit has come into us to enliven us. Formerly we were dead, and everything related to us, in particular any expectation for the future, was also dead. But the enlivening which we have experienced through the life-giving Spirit results in a living hope, in the hope that everything related to us will become living. </p>
<p data-content-id="E5Cs4PZPSSv6OEWz8g7NJx1NyvULrWSordnbo0VyskzAIq8kfKQrWBmYM6YTZqBiW"> When we were sprinkled with the blood of Christ, immediately the life-giving Spirit came into us to enliven us. Using the word “life” as a verb, we may say that the Spirit came into us to “life” us. Formerly we were dead and altogether without hope, but we have been “lifed” through the life-giving Spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> unto a living hope. Now we have the hope that every part of our being will be lifed. This is the living hope. To have a living hope is to be lifed. </p>
<p data-content-id="DbPKqMhGZ8HsKpWPyG3BaeHvYVsEZwoXrZab9lZvy6A64HpIlS9qdNUlAmm2Bal4_"> The regeneration of God the Father results in the hope that every part of our being and everything related to us will be lifed, enlivened. Everything related to an unsaved person is dead. But with one who has been regenerated by God with the divine life, there is the hope that everything will be enlivened and thus become living. </p>
<p data-content-id="SqEusd6atnyDbypEbKrNMKQvvrhWQN18AgU-DN0LQXDMxLcoM7EJr-9aaH1dofMTI"> In the Gospel of John the apostle John speaks about being born again. Although Paul does not use the word “regenerated” or the expression “born again,” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100319" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:1">1 Corinthians 4</span> he says something that indicates regeneration: he tells the believers that he begot them through the gospel. This is related to regeneration. But Peter is the only one who tells us clearly how we are regenerated and unto what we have been regenerated. We have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God unto a living hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="gZwyu9ibox3tnMS0ktyLXzWYSvYozO7LG8DpYO9SArBZrzjgfEF0yr92qj6BUZ4e_"> Through regeneration God has made us alive. In Adam we all are dead. When we were born of our parents, we were born dead. Furthermore, all unbelievers are dying a little more each day. All of them are marching toward the tomb. Their destination is the tomb, and their destiny is death. Hence, in Adam every man is born dead and is also born to die. According to the Bible the gospel is preached not merely to sinners; it is also preached to those who are dead in Adam. We know from Peter’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100320" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1:3</span> that through the means, the instrumentality, of the resurrection of Christ, God has regenerated us. Through Christ’s resurrection God has made us alive. In Adam we all died, but in Christ we all have been made alive. </p>
<p data-content-id="exrMvHGeCNp1XkMlEOO4nrllVpB9UKcdH9YSPQYcDdaKGjk_ixywap2hEvgBMaiKf"> Do you realize that you were born six thousand years ago, when Adam was created? If Adam had not been created, you would not have been born. Because we were born in Adam, we are all the same age—six thousand years. We also died in Adam. But nearly two thousand years ago, when Christ was resurrected, we were made alive, regenerated. According to the New Testament, when Christ was resurrected, we were resurrected in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100321" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5-6">Eph. 2:5-6</span>). Hallelujah, <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> although we were born with Adam, we have been reborn with Christ in His resurrection! </p>

One of these deep matters is the sanctification of the Spirit; a second is the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. According to this verse, the blood of Jesus Christ is the object both of obedience and of sprinkling. Hence, the obedience is of the blood, and the sprinkling also is of the blood. It is not easy for us to understand how obedience can be of the blood. Furthermore, it is not easy to have a proper understanding of the sprinkling of the blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="R3V846PAgL9uUXzkIwWb8W3isRqhymrIBG2lbvy4b6AK6lLFmxs9AW8X9SmI49ucm"> Recently I have spent much time to study the writings of Peter again. In years past I did not realize that Peter, a Galilean fisherman and an evangelist, as indicated by the book of Acts, could be so deep in doctrine and experience. The Epistles of Peter are a composition of doctrines confirmed by experience. Peter’s writings are mainly on experience, yet the experience is based on doctrines. </p>
<p data-content-id="sIQHD11fFkBgeJsmlyCwB3XM69AHzjnmIZYofsu39phMs8US-jBXoedz9GzFfHq3r"> Humanly speaking, Peter did not have a high education. He was not nearly as learned as Paul was.

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wS3VSJbLtNnxowR0q44PBRyoBUe9xngpz3ls5mcZOlL1-HI2Ou_soTzIbNTEhoHct">THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="pEWFX9DAbL5FbbFHZzCgZNJGC7_Zdbitjs6U5R2GbQT8zoeL_zLo2pvDn2d-mwppZ"> Paul in his Epistles indicates clearly that the sanctification of the Spirit is of two aspects. The first aspect is positional sanctification, and the second is dispositional sanctification. But Paul does not tell us that the sanctification of the Spirit positionally and dispositionally is of two periods of time, the first period before we were justified and regenerated, and the second period afterward. Peter, however, does refer to the two periods of time related to the sanctification of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="vmfpsxk3X-CPOle6XZ_G2a2NE50So37mfN2MSXnyzsmNuic1bchaisP_k3J_ELop6"> According to the general understanding of the sanctification of the Spirit held by Christians today, first God the Father selected us, then Christ redeemed us, and then the Spirit sanctifies us positionally and dispositionally. I have had this understanding of sanctification for many years. The messages I have given concerning sanctification also have pointed out that after the Father selected us and the Son redeemed us, the Spirit comes to sanctify us. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100347" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span> Peter says that sanctification comes after the Father’s selection and before Christ’s redemption. According to this verse, the sanctification of the Spirit is unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ. Surely, this indicates that the sanctification of the Spirit precedes the redemption of Christ. As I prayed over this verse and studied it, I was enlightened to see that not only Christ’s redemption needs to be applied by the Spirit, but the Father’s selection also needs to be applied by the Spirit. Without the application through the Holy Spirit, how could God’s selection have anything to do with us in a practical, experiential way? God’s selection has reached us through the Spirit’s application. This application is what Peter means by the sanctification of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBDClclK4_gpZGd_EEOfeWhPZZFVzbN0j_QDX0NzP4abflyLeRnlIr-xEAgV8mknY"> In eternity past God selected us. But how could this selection be applied to us? In order for it to be applied, there is the need of the Spirit’s application. We all can testify of this from our experience. We were wandering on earth, perhaps as those who never had a thought concerning God. But one day the “wind” of the Spirit “blew” us to a place where we heard the preaching of the gospel. While we were listening to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> preaching of the gospel, faith was infused into us. In this way God’s selection was applied to us. The next thing to be applied was the redemption of Christ. In this sense the sanctification of the Spirit preceded our experience of Christ’s redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="24ImHOq-Ka35kqnAvZR584KYMXJ52psKhAQjGNQHhyNnXU_TOW-D_pXiyRvyfmIm-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100348" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span> Paul says, “But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” As far as sanctification is concerned, this verse is all-inclusive. Paul says here that God’s salvation is in the sanctification of the Spirit. This means that the part played in salvation by the Father and the Son are in the sanctification of the Spirit. Therefore, without the sanctification of the Spirit, there would be no way to apply what the Father and the Son have done for us. What the Father and the Son have done for us is applied to us by the Spirit. Paul refers to this application as sanctification of the Spirit. The salvation of the Triune God, therefore, is carried out in the sanctification of the Spirit. </p>

The obedience of the blood and the sprinkling of the blood are Jewish, Old Testament, dispensational matters. The use of these terms in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100349" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span> implies and indicates that in Peter’s writings the dispensation has changed from the Old Testament to the New Testament. In the Old Testament God gave Moses commandments concerning the law and concerning the blood of animals, a type of the blood of Christ shed for our redemption. Thus, all the Jews, according to the Old Testament economy of God, believed in the law and in the sprinkling of the blood of the animals used for sacrifices. On the day of Atonement in particular, the Israelites put their trust in this blood. In other words, they obeyed the law and the blood. The law and the blood were basic elements of their religion. Judaism is composed mainly of the law and the blood of atonement. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpC8Qktp-F7rbZFY08GkGOG4LAcY0faVgMa7_Ylk3wu7vg1gEFxB-6mfu-zbWYKVc"> With the coming of Christ, the New Testament economy began. The Lord Jesus came to replace the law, and His blood fulfills the type of the animal blood and replaces it. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> components of the New Testament economy, therefore, are the Person of Christ and the blood of Christ. For this reason, the Lord sent the apostles to proclaim that the dispensation of law is over and that we need to believe in Christ. They were also to declare that no longer was there the need for the sprinkling of the blood of animals, for the prevailing blood is the blood of Jesus Christ. Now we need to obey the faith in Christ and also obey Jesus’ blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="HSvfk3GMDRLsoD7QTqaApKYUC_ESnT6Cr7MfFOcc6y1f4UZlI9WNALkrSPDz5oi4Q"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100350" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">First Peter 1:2</span> indicates a change in dispensation.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100351" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">verse 2</span> Peter seems to be saying, “Formerly you accepted the blood of animals and obeyed it. Now God commands you to accept the blood of Christ.” This is what Peter means by the expression “the obedience of the blood.” </p>
<p data-content-id="XlzdwAG6JUiZ9Y8QvU82vVLFSlPEoHVdXtO49bCDdKbvgGKpNmdPYoDEvzpKUnEa0"> Whereas Peter speaks of the obedience of the blood, Paul refers to the obedience of faith. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100352" data-verses="Romans 1:5">Romans 1:5</span> he says, “We received grace and apostleship unto obedience of faith among all the nations on behalf of His name.” He speaks of the obedience of faith again in the last chapter of Romans: “But now has been manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations unto obedience of faith” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100353" data-verses="Romans 16:26">Rom. 16:26</span>). </p>

This means that we need to be kept in the right position. Sometimes we are distracted and moved away from the position necessary to enjoy the heavenly inheritance. In the past we all have experienced, at least to some extent, that when we are carried away from the Lord by something, we lose the enjoyment of the inheritance of eternal life. Therefore, we need to be guarded, protected. </p>
<p data-content-id="vmfpsxk3X-CPOle6XZ_G2a2NE5kSglLmfN2MSXnyzsmNuic1bchaisP_k3J_ELop6"> Thank the Lord that we are being guarded by the power of God through faith. The power of God is the means by which we are being guarded. Faith is the secondary means through which the power of God becomes effective in guarding us. Thus, the power of God is on God’s side, and the faith is on our side. This indicates that we need to cooperate with the power of God. If we cooperate in this way, we shall be kept in the right position to enjoy our heavenly inheritance. </p>
<p data-content-id="SqEusd6atnyDbypEbKrNMKQvvqBWQP18AgU-DN0LQXDMxLcoM7EJr-9aaH1dofMTI"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100372" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">verse 5</span>, we are being guarded, garrisoned (a military term), by the power of God through faith unto salvation. The result of this guarding is salvation. In this verse three prepositions are used concerning our coming salvation: <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> by, through, and unto. By refers to cause, through to the means, and unto to the result. </p>

Specifically, it refers not to salvation from eternal perdition, but refers to the salvation of our souls from the dispensational punishment of the Lord’s governmental dealing. This dispensational punishment of God’s governmental dealing is neglected by most Christians today. They seem to have no light concerning it nor understanding of it. Although such a revelation is found in the Bible, most Christians do not have it in their concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="5h0shcinDUdsRuymjaayLaq2gNOGNoBuJg8lMKkk1Act3b5nn7gt98cprGdFLWXju"> Even though we are saved, we need to ask ourselves if we are now ready to stand before the judgment seat of Christ. If the Lord Jesus were to come back today, would you be ready to appear before His judgment seat? Could you stand before Him there in peace? No doubt, your conscience would tell you that in many things you have not yet been saved. If this is your situation, then the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ may have a negative result as far as you are concerned. However, I hope that the result for us all will be positive. But should the result be negative, we shall experience some kind of punishment. That will not be eternal perdition; rather, it will be the dispensational punishment of God’s governmental dealing. </p>

The first stage, the initial stage, is the stage of regeneration. This stage is composed of redemption, sanctification (positional—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100374" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100375" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:11">1 Cor. 6:11</span>), justification, reconciliation, and regeneration. In this stage, God has justified us through the redemption of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100376" data-verses="Romans 3:24-26">Rom. 3:24-26</span>) and regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100377" data-verses="John 3:3-6">John 3:3-6</span>). Thus, we have received God’s eternal salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100378" data-verses="Hebrews 5:9">Heb. 5:9</span>) and His eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100379" data-verses="John 3:15">John 3:15</span>), and become His children <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100380" data-verses="John 1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span>), who shall not perish forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100381" data-verses="John 10:28-29">John 10:28-29</span>).

This stage is composed of freedom from sin, sanctification (mainly dispositional—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100384" data-verses="Romans 6:19">Rom. 6:19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100385" data-verses="Romans 6:22">22</span>), growth in life, transformation, building up, and maturing. In this stage, God is freeing us from the dominion of indwelling sin—the law of sin and death—by the law of the Spirit of life, through the effectiveness of the death of Christ working subjectively in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100386" data-verses="Romans 6:6-7">Rom. 6:6-7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100387" data-verses="Romans 7:16-20">7:16-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100388" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span>). He is sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100389" data-verses="Romans 15:16">Rom. 15:16</span>), with His holy nature, through His discipline (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100390" data-verses="Hebrews 12:10">Heb. 12:10</span>) and His judgment in His own house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100391" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">1 Pet. 4:17</span>). He is causing us to grow in His life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100392" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6-7">1 Cor. 3:6-7</span>) and transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100393" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">2 Cor. 3:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100394" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17-18">17-18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100395" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100396" data-verses="Ephesians 4:23">Eph. 4:23</span>) through the working of all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100397" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Rom. 8:28</span>).

Thus, we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the soul (the natural life), and individualism into maturity in the divine life for the fulfilling of God’s eternal purpose. </p>

This stage is composed of the redemption (transfiguration) of our body, conformity to the Lord, glorification, inheritance of God’s kingdom, participation in Christ’s kingship, and the topmost enjoyment of the Lord. In this stage, God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100401" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Rom. 8:23</span>) by transfiguring it into the body of Christ’s glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100402" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Phil. 3:21</span>). He will conform us to the glorious image of His firstborn Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100403" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>), making us wholly and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body.

Thus, our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of God’s new creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100418" data-verses="Romans 8:21">Rom. 8:21</span>), and our soul will be delivered out of the realm of trials and sufferings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100419" data-verses="1Peter 1:6">1 Pet. 1:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100420" data-verses="1Peter 4:12">4:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100421" data-verses="1Peter 3:14">3:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100422" data-verses="1Peter 5:9">5:9</span>) into a new realm, full of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100423" data-verses="1Peter 4:13">1 Pet. 4:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100424" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">5:10</span>), sharing and enjoying all the Triune God is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained. This is the salvation, the salvation of our souls, which is ready to be revealed to us at the last time, the grace to be brought to us at the unveiling of Christ in glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100425" data-verses="1Peter 1:13">1 Pet. 1:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100426" data-verses="Matthew 16:27">Matt. 16:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100427" data-verses="Matthew 25:31">25:31</span>).

We should eagerly expect such a marvelous salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100429" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Rom. 8:23</span>) and prepare ourselves for its splendid revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100430" data-verses="Romans 8:19">Rom. 8:19</span>). </p>

The sanctification of the Spirit is of two aspects: the sanctification of the Spirit before justification, the first aspect, and the sanctification of the Spirit after justification, the second aspect. With the second aspect of the Spirit’s sanctification there are two sides—the positional side and the dispositional side. After God justifies us and regenerates us, immediately the sanctifying Spirit continues His separating work upon us and within us. First, the sanctifying Spirit separates us positionally from things that are common and worldly. This positional sanctification is objective. Simultaneously, the sanctifying Spirit also begins to sanctify us dispositionally. This means that the Spirit is sanctifying our disposition. This is the subjective side of the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. The subjective sanctification is what we <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> mean by the work of transformation. Subjective sanctification involves the transformation of our disposition and our inward parts. Therefore, this transformation of our disposition is the dispositional sanctification of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="jUvRomvb09osk353DoIhpMqe_tKPMTm170Q1d3WqqewTMoeFT3ZqxDgmd3WoehIm2"> By now we should be clear concerning the two aspects of sanctification. The first aspect takes place before justification. The second aspect, with its two sides, takes place after justification. After we have been justified and regenerated, the Spirit works to sanctify us positionally and also dispositionally. </p>

We saw from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100452" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">verse 5</span> that we are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto salvation and that this salvation is ready to be revealed at the last time. The power of God is the cause by which we are being guarded, and faith is the means through which the power of God becomes effective in guarding us. We also saw that the salvation spoken of in this verse denotes the full salvation of the Triune God in three stages: the initial stage, the stage of regeneration; the progressing stage, the stage of transformation; and the completing stage, the stage of consummation. This salvation is ready to be revealed at the last time, at the time of the Lord’s coming. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100453" data-verses="1Peter 1:6">verse 6</span>, Peter tells us that we should exult in this last time, though for a while, if necessary, we are made sorrowful by various trials. </p>

We are put into trials because our faith needs to be tested, proved. </p>
<p data-content-id="ztuFLZIElnoCUA6_fxiMtGq9BMCpc-z2cHD9rxUKqRCJm7AHp0J5q55RI8R8if_BJ"> The Greek word rendered “proving” means testing for approval. It is the proving, the testing, of our faith, not our faith itself, that may be found unto praise. This may be compared to an examination in school related to a student’s study. <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> It is not the student’s study itself that is found approved; rather, it is the examination that is found to be approved. Of course, the approval of our faith comes out of the proper faith. The emphasis here is not on our faith; the emphasis is on the proving of our faith by the trials through sufferings. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlzdwAG6JUiZ9Y8QvU82vVLFSlvEoFVdXtO49bCDdKbvgGKpNmdPYoDEvzpKUnEa0"> A good student will actually welcome the opportunity to be examined. An examination will prove how thoroughly he has studied and how much he knows concerning the material on which he is being tested. Without examinations, a superior student would never be proved to be outstanding. A student who studies diligently may look forward to an examination because it will prove, both to the student himself and to others, that he is an excellent student. This is an illustration of what Peter means by the proving of our faith. </p>

This means that the proving of our faith is much more precious than the proving of gold. The comparison here is not that between faith and gold. Many Christians understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100456" data-verses="1Peter 1:7">verse 7</span> in this way; however, this understanding is wrong. The comparison here is that between the proving of our faith and the proving of gold. Gold is proved by the purifying fire. In like manner, our faith is proved by trial. This proving is certainly more precious than the proving of gold. </p>

Christ is present with us today, but He is veiled. The time of His coming will also be the time of His unveiling. Some mistakenly think that the Lord Jesus is not here today. But the Lord certainly is here. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100467" data-verses="Matthew 28:20">Matthew 28:20</span> says, “Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.” Although the Lord is with us, He is with us under the veil. Sometimes, however, in our experience with the Lord, we are not under the veil with Him. But at other times we are with Him under the veil. Are you under the veil with the Lord, or are you outside the veil? </p>
<p data-content-id="qrOESpbJMEncvqRku--VVmIoR4YJs71B1f8cXT2fToyPneqxIoWyEG9nhXcerhwXP"> Do you know what the Lord’s coming back will be? The Lord’s coming back will be His unveiling. When He is unveiled, we who are under the veil with Him will also be unveiled. </p>
<p data-content-id="yMsmCfvQWEcWsi1srSB3xwZmhU_BVhMckziqbJPOHgiEBHZME2iBFY9MxaD41CWPB"> The Lord Jesus actually is present with us today. Do you not believe that the Lord is with us? I must testify that the Lord is in my spirit. But according to the concept of unbelievers, Christ is not with us. Even certain believers who are fundamental and who emphasize the objective aspect of the truth say that Christ is far away in the third heaven on the throne at the right hand of God. Some of these fundamental Christians may not believe that Christ is in us. But we know that the Lord whom we love not only is in the heavens, but also dwells within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="8dbAM2uvWzOhfr7QeOD8nkNCQ9qlsT0v9TFJfIT1G5QGwvPJ2fRWuwDHx406-YT4x"> Because the Lord is now veiled, people cannot see Him. But His coming will be His unveiling. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100468" data-verses="1Peter 1:7">verse 7</span> Peter emphasizes the particular matter that the Lord’s coming back will be the taking away of the veil that now covers Him. At that time, everyone will see Him. Prior to that time, we can see Him in spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="0AIT5_8dHoujFZpQ-fTe4fDNfVCG4R6MiND9JsLc3RqCn7l9pkXE0ElJ0Dz4UaOUu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100469" data-verses="John 14:19-20">John 14:19 and 20</span> the Lord Jesus speaks of being seen by His disciples: “Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also. In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100470" data-verses="John 14:19">John 14:19</span>, the worldly people cannot see the Lord Jesus, but the believers can see Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100471" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span> the Lord Jesus indicates that He and we live together. How can we live together with the Lord without <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> seeing Him? Actually, what we have described for us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100472" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span> is not merely living together with the Lord; this verse actually speaks of a life of co-inherence with Him, that is, a life of the Lord living in us and of our living in Him. Because we live such a life, to us He has already been unveiled. </p>
<p data-content-id="79Rbiepb8tG2mJw_fYlOxaEZ0ffrKCkSUXoR2kFUSEhHP7v1r0wjh6a6HPSVKIIDo"> When the Lord Jesus is unveiled and we are unveiled with Him, those who oppose us will be amazed. Today some oppose us and speak evil concerning us. In some cases, young people may be opposed by their parents. Nevertheless, although their parents oppose them, sometimes the parents are astonished at the young people. They may say, “Sometimes you do things that are marvelous. We don’t understand you. How can you do these things?” Although the parents of some of the young people may not be able to understand them now, they will understand when the veil is taken away from the Lord Jesus and also from us. Then they will know the Lord and they will also know us. When the Lord Jesus is unveiled, the worldly people will see Him, and they will see us with Him. Then they will know Christ, and they will also know us. </p>
<p data-content-id="_vU1T0qIaILjGjSpxcRXGjyM8VurBlYrEGwb4rWavw8dBzOTFLExVgceODNrcAuF-"> Unbelievers and people of the world sometimes regard us as peculiar and strange. According to their understanding, we are not normal. They enjoy different kinds of worldly entertainment, but we do not partake of these things. For example, someone at work may encourage you to participate in a certain form of worldly amusement. If you refuse to do so, he may say that you are strange or abnormal. Unbelievers will see things differently when the Lord Jesus is unveiled. When this veil is taken away and our veil is removed as well, the worldly people will say, “Now I know that this one is a follower of Jesus. When I knew him at work, he was one who loved the Lord and sought Him. Now I understand why I thought he was so strange, so abnormal.” This will be the situation if we love the Lord and follow Him today. However, if we do not love the Lord, follow Him, and seek Him, our situation will be very different when He is unveiled. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="79Rbiepb8tG2mJw_fYlOxaEZ0fPrOQESUXoR2kFUSEhHP7v1r0wjh6a6HPSVKIIDo">GUARDED UNTO SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="_vU1T0qIaILjGjSpxcRXGjyM8V-rE3orEGwb4rWavw8dBzOTFLExVgceODNrcAuF-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100500" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">First Peter 1:5</span> says, “Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time.” Many years ago I was bothered whenever I read this verse. I was troubled by the phrase “unto salvation.” According to this phrase, it would seem that we do not yet have salvation, for we are being guarded by the power of God unto salvation. I could not understand why we are being guarded unto salvation if we have already received salvation. I was certain that I had received God’s salvation and had been saved. Regarding this matter, I was very strong. Whenever someone asked me if I had been saved, I replied, “Yes, I have been saved.” Furthermore, I visited many places preaching the assurance of salvation. I pointed out the verses in the New Testament that indicate that, when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were saved and that we may have the assurance of this salvation. But here is a verse in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100501" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">1 Peter 1:5</span> with the phrase “unto salvation.” I wondered if Peter was correct in his knowledge regarding salvation. I thought that he might have said something wrong according to doctrine. I had such a consideration because I was puzzled, bothered, by this verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="BuN0Wi41-WaNn4QzIFus7KYsD30iZGf9Lg-GlSyuVYW03tWNbFC9Yi26QowoiNyuD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100502" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">1:5</span> Peter says that this salvation is “ready to be revealed.” This means that salvation is not yet here. Therefore, I said to myself, “What does it mean that salvation is ready to be revealed? I have already received God’s salvation. How, then, can salvation be ready to be revealed? Peter says <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> that salvation is ready to be revealed at the last time. What is this last time?” I was bothered not only by the phrase “unto salvation,” but also by the words “ready to be revealed at the last time.” I did not know why salvation had yet to be revealed, and I did not understand when the last time would be. </p>
<p data-content-id="xCYRCBsQuw2L-c2XMdJX4w0GGPQSRw_mQ7e0Dzkl6TOAjj70sSbUDgvOuVhrfbbT9"> I was puzzled by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100503" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">1:5</span> for almost forty years. Only in the last period of my Christian life did I begin to understand it. Now I realize that salvation is not a simple matter. Salvation covers a long span and cannot be enjoyed or experienced all at once. God’s full salvation is of three stages: the initial stage, the progressing stage, and the completing stage. I would encourage all the saints, especially the young people, to gain a thorough knowledge of these three stages of God’s full salvation. In particular, we need to understand what God’s salvation does for us in each stage. We need to know from what we are delivered by each stage of God’s full salvation. We also need to know the items or aspects of this salvation and its results. In each of the three stages of God’s full salvation we are delivered from particular things, we experience certain matters, and we have definite results. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Mgl6dTDv_IZtBSmxxJmUqu6hJE5GUmqjvOS_OerSIuoQIZbGtUoUj4768EFrPfiof">THE FULL SALVATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br/>ACCORDING TO THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="VHdJY_o_fao3kO2JrDGWs_GaXyMGXaPC66Se0kl9tbbJLjl5GwFFUJbqKAGXhNLx1"> The word “salvation” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100504" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">1:5</span> denotes the full salvation of the Triune God. This means that it does not refer only to a part of our salvation, to that initial aspect of salvation that comes through the Savior, Jesus Christ. Rather, this is the full salvation of the Triune God, of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In this full salvation a great part is accomplished by the Father; another great part, by the Son; and yet another great part, by the Spirit. Therefore, this salvation is the full salvation of the Trinity of the Godhead. </p>
<p data-content-id="i09bSPXZl4pb4qG7jIxCesISjySEI94qwm3w4KlfUlb27jT2DLMWjKNNKX1xwzylW"> The full salvation of the Triune God comprises many items in three stages. As we have pointed out, these stages are the initial stage, the progressing stage, and the completing stage. These three stages are not divided according to knowledge or merely according to objective aspects of God’s salvation. On the contrary, these stages are arranged according to life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> Spiritual life, as we all know, begins with regeneration, continues in transformation, and reaches maturity in the stage of consummation. Therefore, these three stages of salvation are divided according to the experience of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1u4RHjJZsxtkegHo76dgMe-A4fDvBmVr-4BAdiflaL9E0PcxKuctHr8dFnVeaZrqv">THE STAGE OF REGENERATION</h2><p data-content-id="9dayeuFKDQTWPTGOkzti5VPn7vc9yg-uXp9KuyPSiQwJYmmIZqVDLa1EEdUTWmQ2K"> The initial stage, the stage of regeneration, is composed of redemption, sanctification (positional—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100505" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100506" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:11">1 Cor. 6:11</span>), justification, reconciliation, and regeneration. Redemption, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation are all for regeneration. Regeneration is the totality of redemption, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation. Regeneration is the result of these four matters. </p>
<p data-content-id="jUvRomvb09osk353DoIhpMqe_tqPPSG170Q1d3WqqewTMoeFT3ZqxDgmd3WoehIm2"> In the stage of regeneration God has justified us through the redemption of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100507" data-verses="Romans 3:24-26">Rom. 3:24-26</span>), and He has regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100508" data-verses="John 3:3-6">John 3:3-6</span>). Thus, we have received God’s eternal salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100509" data-verses="Hebrews 5:9">Heb. 5:9</span>) and His eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100510" data-verses="John 3:15">John 3:15</span>), and we have become His children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100511" data-verses="John 1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span>), who shall not perish forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100512" data-verses="John 10:28-29">John 10:28-29</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="TKuLK-iN4WWAXWP5KjHT9CqtbJ0P0AOZ1mGsG8GNPe630UNpfCxCz71m3bOKKJcjL">Eternal Life and Eternal Salvation</h2><p data-content-id="nTLlhVRI0WZJKFKDQRic6_gB60q58-MTSAl5BEvl5rADl5CES_D0WV0ObUJL8h77e"> God has regenerated us in our spirit. The element, the substance, God used to regenerate us is His own life. Furthermore, this regeneration with God’s life was accomplished by a Person, that is, by God’s Spirit. As a result of this regeneration, we have received God’s eternal salvation and His eternal life. In this sense we have already received God’s salvation. No one can deny that we have received God’s salvation in its first stage. There is no need for us to grow unto this stage, and it is not necessary for us to wait until it is revealed to us. We have received two things that are eternal—eternal salvation and eternal life. This is not my teaching, theology, or opinion; it is the revelation of God’s pure Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="6QMYacwK02nthQCoF0URhKVkQQ4fGbSwiASTsylVaVYoGxKhSC8NjvEvyvfi8NIox"> Because we have been regenerated and have received God’s eternal salvation and eternal life, we have become God’s children. As children of God, we shall never perish. This truth should strengthen us and keep us from the erroneous teaching that says if we sin after we have been saved, we shall perish. That teaching is nonsensical and is absolutely not <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> according to the truth. Once we have received God’s eternal salvation, we are saved forever, for eternity. God’s eternal salvation is not dispensational; it is not temporary. Because it is an eternal salvation, we shall never perish. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="R3V846PAgL9uUXzkIwWb8W3isRah02bIBG2lbvy4b6AK6lLFmxs9AW8X9SmI49ucm">Saved from Condemnation and Perdition</h2><p data-content-id="sIQHD11fFkBgeJsmlyCwB3XM69wH5xHmIZYofsu39phMs8US-jBXoedz9GzFfHq3r"> This initial salvation of God has saved us from God’s condemnation and from eternal perdition (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100513" data-verses="John 3:18">John 3:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100514" data-verses="John 3:16">16</span>). However, although this initial salvation saves us from God’s condemnation and from eternal perdition, it does not save us from God’s discipline. During our lifetime God will discipline us and may even punish us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100515" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">1 Corinthians 11</span> Paul indicates that God judges, disciplines, and even punishes the believers. This does not mean, however, that those who are disciplined by God will lose their salvation. According to Scripture, on the one hand, we have been saved for eternity. We shall never be condemned by God, and we shall never perish. On the other hand, while we are living on earth in the flesh, God will deal with us and discipline us. Sometimes He may even judge us or punish us. By this we see that through the initial stage of God’s salvation, we receive eternal salvation and eternal life. Although we shall never perish, we may experience God’s discipline during our lifetime. But it is altogether contrary to the Bible to teach that to be disciplined by God means that we shall lose our salvation. God may punish us for certain things, but we have been saved for eternity and we shall never lose this eternal salvation. </p>

Not caring for grammar, language, or composition, Peter found a way to express the divine riches in his writings. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100577" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span> Paul says, “But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.” The grace to which Paul refers three times in this verse is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection. Therefore, grace is the Triune God becoming life and everything to us. </p>

The Old Testament prophets were searching into what time and what manner of time the Spirit in them made clear concerning Christ’s marvelous accomplishment through His sufferings and glories. Eventually it was revealed that those marvelous things were ministered not to them, but to the New Testament believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100579" data-verses="1Peter 1:12">v. 12</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> </p>

Although it is easy to understand the meaning of “what time,” it is difficult to know what Peter means by “what manner of time.” This is an unusual expression. Does time have a manner? We may be bothered by this expression and wonder what Peter means by “what manner of time.” </p>
<p data-content-id="QfakavptTSx9tWovQHAybkDO6XPUHamQDY-JxCUP4mm7A_CcJcFvQFbMh0TJNMl0F"> In seeking to understand this, we may substitute “kind” for “manner” and speak of “what kind of time.” In conversation we sometimes refer to a certain kind of time, or ask a person what kind of time he had in doing a certain thing. You may ask someone, “What kind of time did you have with your father today? Did you have a good time with him? Did you enjoy a happy time?” Furthermore, the kind of time or manner of time may denote a particular season. For example, the winter season is a time of cold weather, whereas the summer season is a time of hot weather. These are illustrations that may help us understand Peter’s expression “what manner of time.” </p>
<p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7u91U3gPmckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> Regarding the coming of Christ and His sufferings, the prophets not only searched into what time this would be, but also searched into what manner of time, what kind of time, it would be. A number of verses in the prophecy of the Old Testament indicate that the anointed One of God, the Messiah, Christ, would suffer for the salvation of God’s people and the fulfillment of God’s purpose. According to these prophecies, it was necessary for God’s anointed One, the One appointed to fulfill God’s commission, to suffer. The ancient prophets knew this, and they spent considerable time to find out when the Messiah would suffer. This means that they were seeking to know what time He would suffer. Furthermore, they were also searching into what manner of time this would be. Would it be in a time comparable to the winter season or one comparable to the summer? For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100581" data-verses="1Peter 1:11">1:11</span> Peter speaks concerning what manner of time. </p>
<p data-content-id="lstMWBRC66b7v6qyJcYqNzFILe3fg3HmDBhzKVdlvVCbYUbTkcY3VpluEL-g0HaK4"> We have seen that it is characteristic of Peter to use particular and even peculiar expressions in his writings. He <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> speaks not only of the blood, but of the precious blood; not only of seed, but of incorruptible seed; not only of what time, but of what manner of time. Peter’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100582" data-verses="1Peter 1:11">verse 11</span> is not drawn out of the air. On the contrary, what he says is based upon what he found in the Old Testament. Peter surely has a ground, a basis, for whatever he says. His word regarding what manner of time is based on the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="OL9AaTfdcQNgWo6E__9gENXi_c0Y6HO_AtnWibxhvo9pWA2k7cDx1vl4hlJzNlNkh"> Peter treasured the Old Testament, and we in the Lord’s recovery today certainly treasure the Bible. One striking characteristic of the Lord’s recovery is that we treasure the Word of God and spend a great deal of time reading it and studying it. Many of us have been dealing with the Bible diligently and seriously for years, especially during the years we have been in the recovery. Therefore, let me address a question especially to those who have been serious in their reading of the Bible: What verse in the Old Testament tells us the manner of time of Christ’s suffering and of His glorification? It is easy to find a verse that speaks of what time. For instance, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100583" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">Daniel 9:26</span> says, “After threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off.” The words “cut off” point to Christ’s crucifixion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100584" data-verses="Daniel 9:25">Daniel 9:25</span> mentions “seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks.” Here we have a total of sixty-nine weeks, or four hundred eighty-three years. According to these verses, four hundred eighty-three years after the command to rebuild the city of Jerusalem, the Messiah, Christ, would be cut off, crucified. By this we can know what time Christ would suffer. The time was at the expiration of the sixty-ninth week. </p>
<p data-content-id="43QATuPFb584gkeOZXNScxvOdYAJonV7ADE2bCTUJ-2Td1xSeLh5pXASkI6kA_dPU"> Although we have these verses related to what time Christ would suffer, it is very difficult to find a verse that tells us the manner of time. As I was writing the notes for the Recovery Version of 1 Peter, I was severely pressed by this word “manner” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100585" data-verses="1Peter 1:11">verse 11</span>. It was like a huge stone grinding me. It took a long time and a lot of labor for me to understand this verse. (We shall come to the verses on the manner of time in the next message.) <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100586" data-verses="1Peter 1:10-12">Verses 10 through 12</span> are not shallow. Rather, they are deep and difficult to understand. Thus, we should never look down on Peter as a writer or think that he was shallow. <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> </p>

This means that Christ would bruise the head of Satan and that Satan would bruise Christ’s heel. To bruise the head is to kill, but to bruise the heel is to hurt. This word concerning the serpent bruising Christ’s heel points to His suffering. When Christ came to deal with Satan on the cross, He suffered. If we research <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100605" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> carefully, we shall see that this verse speaks of the suffering of Christ.

This chapter speaks clearly about Christ’s death in plain words, just as the New Testament does. But probably none of us has searched this chapter to find out the manner of time in which Christ died. </p>
<p data-content-id="6QMYacwK02nthQCoF0URhKVkQTYfGZSwiASTsylVaVYoGxKhSC8NjvEvyvfi8NIox"> The first verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100609" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> says, “Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?” This verse indicates that Christ came to suffer at a time that was full of unbelief, at a time when God’s people were not believing in Him. The prophet asked the question: “Who hath believed our report?” The prophet reported, preached, made an announcement, but no one listened to him. This means that when Christ came, the people of God were full of unbelief. That was the manner of time. Christ did not come at a time when the people of God were filled with faith and everyone had a strong belief in God. No, He came at a time when God’s people did not have belief in Him. The prophets knew this. They knew what manner of time Christ would come. </p>
<p data-content-id="R3V846PAgL9uUXzkIwWb8W3isS6h00bIBG2lbvy4b6AK6lLFmxs9AW8X9SmI49ucm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100610" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span> the prophet indicates that God’s people were not willing to listen to His word: “And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100611" data-verses="Isaiah 6:9-10">Isa. 6:9-10</span>). The Lord Jesus quoted this word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100612" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>, and Paul also quoted it in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100613" data-verses="Acts 28:1">Acts 28</span>. The quotation of this word by the Lord Jesus and by Paul indicates that the time Christ came to suffer for the accomplishment of God’s redemption was a time of unbelief. </p>

This is a further indication of the manner of time when Christ would come. It was to be a time of captivity. Christ actually did come at such a time. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100615" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">Daniel 9:26</span>, “after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off.” This refers to the crucifixion of Christ, which was during a time of captivity.

He spent a great deal of time studying the Old Testament. He found out into what the prophets had searched, and he had the boldness to say that while the prophets were searching, the Spirit of Christ was in them. As we pointed out in the previous message, the constitution of the Spirit of Christ is dispensational. This means that the Spirit of Christ was constituted dispensationally through and with Christ’s death and resurrection. However, the function of this Spirit is eternal, because He is the eternal Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100618" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Heb. 9:14</span>). Regarding the constitution of the Spirit of Christ, time is a factor. But regarding the function of the Spirit of Christ, time is not a factor. The Spirit of God was sufficient and adequate for creation, but for the carrying out of God’s full salvation and for the application of this salvation, there is the need of the Spirit of Christ. When the Old Testament prophets were searching into what manner of time Christ would come to suffer, the Spirit of Christ was working in them. This means that the Spirit of the Triune God—the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of Christ—was operating in them. According to function, there is no difference between the Spirit’s work in the prophets and His work in the apostles. It was the same Spirit with the same function. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcaaVHTVCgvGIROFjCd-BQVV-ztBlisz4vwu4bpiV0zCG8Fh4RpvKatN3QN0zME-K"> First and 2 Peter were written to Jewish believers. The Jews knew God, and they trusted in the sprinkling of animal blood. Although they knew God, they did not know Him as the Father of Christ. Furthermore, they knew the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah, but they did not know the Spirit of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100619" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span> Peter purposely uses the expression “sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ” to differentiate this sprinkling <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> from the sprinkling of animal blood in the Old Testament. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100620" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1:3</span> he speaks of “the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” to distinguish the God of the Christians from the God of the Jews. Now we see that he even used the term “the Spirit of Christ” instead of the Spirit of God in order to make yet another distinction. Peter was seeking to convince the Jewish believers that even the Old Testament prophets were the same as New Testament Christians. The Spirit of Christ who is in New Testament Christians was also working in the Old Testament prophets. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ax-XoUmXRGuNtjUgn0zaCf8sBcwKgaY_bx2QVWud5sj4sJ3E4W0PzhghSZKkIgXk6"> As a rule, in the Old Testament times the Spirit was upon the saints, not in them. But here, based on the principle of the eternal function of the Spirit of Christ, is an exception: we are told that the Spirit of Christ was working in the Old Testament prophets. Peter says that the Spirit of Christ in them made the prophets clear concerning what manner of time Christ would suffer. It is a shame that so many of the New Testament believers are not clear about this. Probably only now do you understand what Peter means by what manner of time Christ would suffer. </p>
<p data-content-id="FVdXhiOjWCOU2MQIGN_E1FaCfntZoUl3AER3V25JpQzvWurx6wgDQNFCSNGqcdCkN"> Peter’s expression “what manner of time” implies a great deal. It indicates to the Jewish believers that the manner of time of Christ’s coming was a time of unbelief. This is also the manner of time in which we live today. In Peter’s day not many Jews believed in the Lord Jesus. Rather, those who believed suffered persecution. The unbelieving Jews challenged the Jewish believers, saying, “Look, what a small number believe in your Jesus! Why are you so foolish as to believe in a Nazarene who was put on the cross?” The manner of time of Christ’s coming surely was a manner of unbelief. It is the same today. We should not expect many Jews to believe in the Lord Jesus. The manner of time of Christ’s coming is unbelief. This means that unbelief is a characteristic of the time of Christ’s coming. Isaiah asked, “Who has believed our report?” Peter certainly saw this unbelief in those of his day. Peter reported, but very few Jews responded. That was the manner of time. Many Christians today expect to have a great revival. That, however, is against the principle that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> manner of time of Christ’s coming is characterized by unbelief. </p>

Beginning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100668" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">verse 3</span>, Peter mentions the Lord Jesus Christ, or Jesus Christ, again and again. At the very end of this section, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100669" data-verses="1Peter 1:12">verse 12</span>, Peter speaks of the Holy Spirit.

Hence, a blessing is a well-speaking, and to bless someone is to speak well of him. Therefore, to bless God is to speak well concerning Him and all that He is to us, has done for us, and will do <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> for us. To bless God is to speak in a sweet way of what God is, of what He has done, and of what He will do. This kind of speaking is a blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="QfakavptTSx9tWovQHAybkDO7VPUHYmQDY-JxCUP4mm7A_CcJcFvQFbMh0TJNMl0F"> Many Christians think that to bless God is to praise Him. This understanding of blessing certainly is not wrong. Whenever you are about to praise God, you need to speak something about Him. However, in what way shall we praise God? A child may say, “God, I praise You for giving me a good father, one who loves me and who earns a lot of money. God, I also praise You that my mother buys nice things for me.” Many Christians praise God mainly for material things. They may say, “Oh, blessed be God the Father! Praise Him for giving me a good business, a large house, and a nice family.” This falls far short of the revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100673" data-verses="1Peter 1:3-12">1:3-12</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7v_1U3iPmckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> Gradually the Lord has brought me into the thought of the divine revelation in the Bible. I can testify that when I read such a verse as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100674" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1:3</span>, I realize that to bless God the Father is to speak well of what God is to us subjectively. It is not merely to praise Him for what He has done for us or given to us objectively. To bless God the Father is to speak subjectively of what He is to us, of what He has done for us, and of what He will do for us. This is to bless God according to what is revealed in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="lstMWBRC66b7v6qyJcYqNzFIKc3fj3nmDBhzKVdlvVCbYUbTkcY3VpluEL-g0HaK4"> These ten verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100675" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> of 1 Peter tell us what the Father has done for us through the Son and by the Spirit. The Father has done so much for us through His Son. All that the Father has done for us through the Son is applied to us by the Holy Spirit. We need to speak well regarding all these things. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OL9AaTfdcQNgWo6E__9gENXi-e0Y5Hu_AtnWibxhvo9pWA2k7cDx1vl4hlJzNlNkh">THE BACKGROUND OF PETER’S WELL-SPEAKING</h2><p data-content-id="43QATuPFb584gkeOZXNScxvOcaAJrm17ADE2bCTUJ-2Td1xSeLh5pXASkI6kA_dPU"> It is important for us to realize why Peter uttered such a well-speaking concerning the Triune God in a letter written to scattered saints. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100676" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1:1</span>, this Epistle was written to “the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.” All the five provinces mentioned in this verse were in Asia Minor, between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The fact that the believers to whom this Epistle was addressed were scattered in these <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> provinces of Asia Minor was a significant part of the background of Peter’s well-speaking concerning God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ofUPlCuNAC12hlvQuJ_UoTe23ieat_geBZxGNzkHTjFI2xYHPOXYWjct6OLFz60vb"> At the time this Epistle was written, both Peter and the recipients of this book, the chosen saints scattered in Asia Minor, were under the Roman government. In A.D. 64, the approximate time of the writing of 1 Peter, the Roman Empire was very strong. About thirty years before the birth of Christ, Julius Caesar defeated Egypt and established the Roman Empire in full. Probably there has never been a stronger government in history than the government of the Roman Empire in the first century A.D. The Roman Empire controlled the entire region around the Mediterranean Sea, including territory in Asia, Europe, and northern Africa. As a strong government, the Roman Empire also had very strong laws. It is common knowledge that western culture is built on three pillars: Roman law, Hebrew religion, and Greek culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="3Sfgt49N4yqnUk9Ymhzai--1fjkmjFuJSUKY6facN-ragmCO58awdH5H1zP2HCGtX"> The recipients of the Epistle of 1 Peter not only were under the Roman government, but they were also under the influence of Hebrew religion and Greek culture, in particular, Greek philosophy. The well-speaking concerning the Triune God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100677" data-verses="1Peter 1:3-12">1:3-12</span> is altogether different from both Hebrew religion and Greek philosophy. In these ten verses there is nothing of religion or philosophy. In other words, Peter’s writing here is neither religious nor secular. Here we cannot find any religious thought or any secular concept or philosophy. According to what, then, were these verses written? They were written according to God’s revelation. This revelation, however, is not merely objective. On the contrary, it is a subjective revelation. This means that Peter’s composition of these verses was according to his spiritual experiences. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GjIWRwpqK7l9xUJ5LpqIMdMOgA2KWL4Fma1VvLFr-tFZ4dW7ECS577LiXyd5A_MMr">THE GOD AND FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="ck7ZHbdqM24QGnW7JL0wBUosXgJEWBt1X9kzGHSV3YY4pgJDsbMgZhhrhLbkg96gz"> Because Peter wrote according to his spiritual experience, he covers a great many points in these ten verses. Let us consider how many points are in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100678" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">verse 3</span>: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.” One <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> major point is the title “the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” This title has nothing to do with either religion or philosophy. The matter of blessing is another important point. Other matters are God’s great mercy, regeneration, living hope, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead. None of these points is religious or philosophical. Instead, they all are aspects of the divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y1KxaLRh8hx0MgtFrlaDNr3aXTdeq8csEy3Istv7kjGteO8_iFmxZwHWdjP2Mm1f_"> In reading the Bible we should not take anything for granted. We should not assume that we understand what we read. We need to drop the traditional way of reading the Word, the way that causes us to take it for granted. When we come to a word such as “blessed” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100679" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1:3</span>, we need to say, “What does this word mean? I know this word in my native language, but what does it mean in this verse? What does it refer to?” If we read the Bible in this way and pray regarding what we read, we may find that a chapter such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100680" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1 Peter 1</span> may occupy us for an entire year. I urge you not to take for granted Peter’s words, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” We need to find out what Peter means by “blessed.” </p>
<p data-content-id="E5Cs4PZPSSv6OEWz8g7NJx1NzvkLoXyordnbo0VyskzAIq8kfKQrWBmYM6YTZqBiW"> Writing this Epistle according to his spiritual experiences, Peter intended to annul Jewish religion and Greek philosophy. I believe that if Peter were with us today, he would say strongly that this was his intention. He might say, “The intention in my heart when I wrote the first book was to knock down Hebrew religion and to destroy Greek philosophy.” Many phrases in this chapter indicate that this was Peter’s intention. </p>
<p data-content-id="DbPKqMhGZ8HsKpWPyG3BaeHvZVcEaxIXrZab9lZvy6A64HpIlS9qdNUlAmm2Bal4_"> Peter’s words “the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” were a severe blow to Jewish religion. The Jews would say that such speaking is blasphemy. Furthermore, these words were altogether contrary to Greek philosophy, myths, legends, and superstitions. With Jewish religion and Greek philosophy as the background, Peter declared, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” If the rabbis and the philosophers had read these words, the rabbis would have said, “This is blasphemy!” and the philosophers would have asked, “What is this?” <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> </p>

Based upon this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100712" data-verses="1Peter 1:13">verse 13</span> begins an exhortation to those who are participating in the full salvation operated by the Triune God according to His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="-bV22nWH_FbItmzO6YVHsZY6EDc4vPMr7lvRKtpbd8TOAsIX6A2XE9BWdzvsz9lXK"> To gird up the loins of our mind means not to be loose in our thinking. However, most of us are very loose in our thinking. Our thoughts jump from one thing to another. In a few seconds, in our mind we can travel around the world. We may think about one thing and then suddenly think about something else. For example, while praising the Lord at the Lord’s table, we may suddenly begin to think of something we have just purchased from the store. Because our thoughts can travel so fast, we need to gird up the loins of our mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="pEWFX9DAbL5FbbFHZzCgZNJGD6vZdaitjs6U5R2GbQT8zoeL_zLo2pvDn2d-mwppZ"> Here Peter seems to be saying, “Brothers, I have just presented you a number of marvelous, divine items.

This hope is the living hope which has issued from regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100716" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">v. 3</span>). We need to set our living hope completely on the grace that is being brought to us at the unveiling of Jesus Christ. Surely this grace is not merely unmerited favor. It refers to the salvation of the soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100717" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">vv. 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100718" data-verses="1Peter 1:9-10">9-10</span>), which will be the consummation of God’s full salvation.

In the Bible this is called the foretaste; it is not yet the full taste. This age is an age of foretaste. But when the Lord Jesus comes back, we shall enjoy the full taste. While we are enjoying the foretaste, we set our hope on the coming full taste. The nature, the essence, and the reality of the foretaste are the same as that of the full taste. The difference is one of quantity. Today we are enjoying a small portion as a sample, a foretaste. Eventually we shall enjoy the full portion and experience the full taste. Therefore, on the one hand, we are now enjoying grace; on the other hand, we are expecting the coming full taste. This means that as we are enjoying the foretaste, we are expecting to have the full taste. This causes us to set our hope on the coming full taste. The coming full taste will be the consummation of this unique grace. </p>

It is significant that he uses the word “unveiling” and not advent or some other word. At present, we are enjoying the Lord Jesus as a foretaste under the veil. But the time is coming when the veil will be taken away. Then we shall be able to declare, “Hallelujah, I am enjoying the Lord Jesus outside the veil!” Today we are enjoying grace; however, we are enjoying this grace under the covering of a veil. </p>

Our enjoyment is concealed, and others who do not share the same experience cannot know anything about it. But one day the Lord Jesus will be unveiled.

The phrase “manner of life” is a literal translation of the Greek. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100762" data-verses="1Peter 1:15">1:15</span>, we should not merely be holy and live a holy life; we should become holy in all our manner of life. Others should be able to see a certain manner in our living, and this manner should be holy. This does not mean that we are holy occasionally or that we are holy in certain things. For instance, it is not that in the morning we are holy in one matter, and then later in the day we are no longer holy in that matter. No, we need habitually to have a holy life. This is what constitutes a holy manner of life. If we would have a holy manner of life, we need to be habitually holy in our constitution. This means that we need to become a certain kind of person, a person who is holy in constitution. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpC8Qktp-F7rbZFY08GkGOG4KB8Y9MaVgMa7_Ylk3wu7vg1gEFxB-6mfu-zbWYKVc"> We may use fruit trees as an illustration of what we mean by a holy manner of life. An apple tree produces apples according to the apple-tree manner of life. Likewise, an orange tree produces oranges according to its manner of life. The producing of apples by an apple tree and oranges by an orange tree is not accidental. On the contrary, it is altogether according to the manner of life characteristic of each tree. <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="HSvfk3GMDRLsoD7QTqaApKYUD-kSvAqCr7MfFOcc6y1f4UZlI9WNALkrSPDz5oi4Q"> The same should be true of our becoming holy in our manner of life. Some Christians who emphasize a so-called holiness may sometimes act holy, but at other times they may be very worldly or fleshly. This indicates that they do not have a holy manner of life. To have a holy manner of life is to have a life that is the expression of God. It is to have a living that is the expression of the holy nature of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ck7ZHbdqM24QGnW7JL0wBUosXgpEWDt1X9kzGHSV3YY4pgJDsbMgZhhrhLbkg96gz"> When we were regenerated, the holy nature of the Father was imparted to us. This holy nature that is now within us is the basic factor for us to live a holy manner of life. Once again we may use fruit trees as an illustration. If an apple tree did not have the life of an apple tree, it could not possibly have the manner of life of an apple tree. Suppose someone tried to attach apples to the branches of another kind of tree. After a short period of time, the apples would fall down. But an apple tree, having an apple-tree manner of life, expresses the nature of the apple tree that is within it. The principle is the same with becoming holy in all our manner of life. The Father has imparted His holy nature into us, and this is what makes it possible for us to have a life that expresses the holy God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y1KxaLRh8hx0MgtFrlaDNr3aXT9eq-csEy3Istv7kjGteO8_iFmxZwHWdjP2Mm1f_"> Second, concerning a holy manner of life, the Holy Spirit is doing a sanctifying work within us. The Greek word for sanctify is the verb form of the adjective holy. When the Holy Spirit sanctifies us, He makes us holy. With the Father’s holy nature within us as a basis of operation, the Holy Spirit is working in us to make us holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="E5Cs4PZPSSv6OEWz8g7NJx1NzvELrXSordnbo0VyskzAIq8kfKQrWBmYM6YTZqBiW"> Third, because we are often disobedient, we need God’s discipline. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100763" data-verses="Hebrews 12:10">Hebrews 12:10</span> says that God the Father disciplines us so that we may partake of His holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="DbPKqMhGZ8HsKpWPyG3BaeHvZV8EZxoXrZab9lZvy6A64HpIlS9qdNUlAmm2Bal4_"> To have a holy manner of life, we need three things: the impartation of the Father’s holy nature into our being, the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit to make us holy, and God’s discipline so that we may participate in the holiness of our holy God. These are the three factors for us to live a life of holiness. Our living should not only be holy to a certain extent, but our very manner of life should be holy. This means that we should have a living that is the expression of our holy God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="97" id="97">[97]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SqEusd6atnyDbypEbKrNMKQvurxWQO18AgU-DN0LQXDMxLcoM7EJr-9aaH1dofMTI">KNOWING THAT WE HAVE BEEN REDEEMED</h2><p data-content-id="gZwyu9ibox3tnMS0ktyLXzWYTvIozN7LG8DpYO9SArBZrzjgfEF0yr92qj6BUZ4e_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100764" data-verses="1Peter 1:18">Verse 18</span> says, “Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers.” According to grammar, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100765" data-verses="1Peter 1:18">verse 18</span> is related to “pass the time of your sojourning in fear” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100766" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">verse 17</span>. This indicates that in order to pass the time of our sojourning in fear, we need a deep realization concerning the redemption of Christ. Today many Christians are living in a loose way because their understanding of Christ’s redemption is shallow. </p>
<p data-content-id="exrMvHGeCNp1XkMlEOO4nrllUpR9XL8dH9YSPQYcDdaKGjk_ixywap2hEvgBMaiKf"> When I was a child studying in the elementary school of a Baptist mission, I heard much about the cross of Christ and Christ’s redemption. However, nothing that I heard touched my heart, for that teaching regarding the redemption of Christ was shallow. I do not know why the missionaries and the Chinese ministers did not say something weighty from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100767" data-verses="1Peter 1:18-19">1:18 and 19</span>. I cannot recall hearing any teaching from these verses while I attended that school. All the preaching concerning Christ’s redemption that I heard there was very shallow. </p>
<p data-content-id="5h0shcinDUdsRuymjaayLaq2hM-GNpBuJg8lMKkk1Act3b5nn7gt98cprGdFLWXju"> Peter’s way of speaking about redemption in these verses is far from superficial. I believe that anyone who would read these verses by concentrating his entire being on them would be touched when Peter says, “Knowing that you were redeemed...with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="NAEaBY_x6pYcwk4ARy7Lpg7iHRgFe_lwgvU3PeKk5eHyvPPrOn2R1Uoieyq3fnZXS"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100768" data-verses="1Peter 1:18">verse 18</span>, the blood of Christ has redeemed us from our vain manner of life. This vain manner of life is in contrast to the holy manner of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100769" data-verses="1Peter 1:15">verse 15</span>. According to most other references in Scripture, the blood of Christ redeems us from sins, transgressions, lawlessness, and all sinful things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100770" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">Eph. 1:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100771" data-verses="Hebrews 9:15">Heb. 9:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100772" data-verses="Titus 2:14">Titus 2:14</span>). Here is an exception: Christ’s blood has redeemed us from our old, vain manner of life, because the emphasis here is not on sinfulness, but on the manner of life. The whole chapter emphasizes the holy manner of life which God’s chosen people should have in their sojourn. Not only is the Spirit’s sanctification for this; even Christ’s redemption is for <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> this—to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers. Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we pass the days of our sojourning in fear. </p>
<p data-content-id="tTdiM0wtGZTbyzmpJc9hshU6ikiXbByh7CrYYgW30kDeC5v7EAZJ3WM5CGcOvUqoA"> Our old manner of life, a life in lusts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100773" data-verses="1Peter 1:14">1 Pet. 1:14</span>), had no meaning and no goal; hence, it was vain. But now to live a holy life, to express God in His holiness, is our goal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100774" data-verses="1Peter 1:15-16">vv. 15-16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="hxMBDypTTZrlXu74HtrBsOo2yDmUxcAm0XNLbZECSYiOVkeYnRerhlESfi0ONqauL"> Many precious biblical terms, terms which are very important in the Word, have become common and religious. We may even say that they have been spoiled. The word “redeemed” is an example of a biblical term that has become religious because of the way it is commonly used. Therefore, when we read this word in the Bible, we may not have much feeling within us concerning it. However, when Peter wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100775" data-verses="1Peter 1:18-19">1:18 and 19</span>, he was full of feeling. </p>

Actually this is the meaning of the Greek word. We have been purchased by the precious blood of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="VHdJY_o_fao3kO2JrDGWs_GaWzcGUavC66Se0kl9tbbJLjl5GwFFUJbqKAGXhNLx1"> As fallen human beings, we were in a dreadful situation before we experienced Christ’s redemption: we were merchandise up for sale in an unclean marketplace, the marketplace of the vain manner of life. If the spiritual feelings within you are tender when you are in a shopping center, you will realize that such a place is unclean. Outwardly, it may be very clean; however, spiritually speaking, it is very dirty. Furthermore, nearly everything in a shopping center is related to the vain manner of life. Formerly, we were merchandise up for sale in Satan’s shopping center, in his unclean, worldly market. Today all of human society is an unclean market. </p>

This was done according to God’s eternal purpose and plan; it did not happen accidentally. Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100797" data-verses="Revelation 13:8">Rev. 13:8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="8dbAM2uvWzOhfr7QeOD8nkNCR86llDUv9TFJfIT1G5QGwvPJ2fRWuwDHx406-YT4x"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100798" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span> Peter speaks of the foreknowledge of God the Father, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100799" data-verses="1Peter 1:20">verse 20</span> he says that Christ was foreknown before the foundation of the world as the redeeming Lamb. In the New Testament the root of such words as foreknowledge, foreknow, and foreknown is know. To this root a prefix is attached. The Greek prefix <em>pro</em> means before or beforehand. In New Testament Greek, words such as foreknow, foreknowledge, and foreknown imply more than what we would understand from the English translations. The Greek root for these words includes the meaning of appreciation, approval, and possession. If we approve something, we shall appreciate it. Then we shall want to take possession of it and own it. Sometimes “I do not know” means “I do not own that” or “I do not want that.” Furthermore, in the Bible the word “know” is also used for the relationship between husband and wife. For <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> example, concerning the relationship between Joseph and Mary, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100800" data-verses="Matthew 1:25">Matthew 1:25</span> says that Joseph “did not know her until she brought forth a Son.” This, of course, does not simply refer to Joseph’s knowledge of Mary. It refers to his taking her and owning her as his wife. </p>
<p data-content-id="0AIT5_8dHoujFZpQ-fTe4fDNeUSGwBKMiND9JsLc3RqCn7l9pkXE0ElJ0Dz4UaOUu"> The foreknowledge of God spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100801" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span> implies that in eternity past God approved us and appreciated us. It also implies that in eternity past He took us over, possessed us, owned us. We may even say that, as Joseph married Mary, God in His foreknowledge married us in eternity past. (There is no time element with God.) All of this is included in the connotation of the word foreknowledge. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uj_E8kFY-CqzwHkg4wPi8KVxuiaJHptKZE6A-0wt5hJK0U8YduGxp0egiQIF1x3q0">FOREORDAINED BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="fWYB7XX4w1MoL-aENuz7U9fX9tYVfLFbDk4MQtEZZOLkMNraM6pCPQKufeaBQvtYF"> For Christ to be foreknown means that He was foreordained by God. To foreknow is to foreordain, to ordain beforehand. In his expanded translation of the New Testament, Kenneth S. Wuest uses the words “foreordained” and “foreordination.” According to this translation, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100802" data-verses="1Peter 1:20">verse 20</span> says, “Christ...was foreordained before the foundation of the universe was laid,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100803" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">verse 2</span> says that the believers are “chosen-out ones, this choice having been determined by the foreordination of God the Father.” God’s foreknowledge, therefore, means not only that He knew us in eternity past; it also means that He ordained us. We all were ordained by God the Father in eternity past. We do not need any other kind of ordination. </p>

This means that in eternity past God approved Christ and appreciated Him. Then God also ordained Christ to be His anointed One. God has ordained Christ to be the One commissioned to fulfill in time all that had been planned by God for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose. At the <span class="pg" data-page-id="107" id="107">[107]</span> same time God foreordained Christ, He also foreordained all the believers. </p>

Just as a salesman sells his goods, so this preacher is trying to sell me his concept.” If this is your attitude, I encourage you to wait until we are in the New Jerusalem in eternity. I have the assurance that when we all arrive there, you will praise God and say, “Hallelujah! Now I see that I truly was foreordained by God the Father before the foundation of the world!” </p>
<p data-content-id="knfsL5a82WUv_5LdqzY4eB_cJOvqbum8t2JYykBfWCQWK4guAqyA60qeyB17Qxkmi"> We may say that in eternity past God held a ceremony of ordination. In that ordination ceremony He first ordained His Son to be the Christ. Then He ordained all of us, the believers in Christ, to be Christians. In an eternal ordination ceremony before the foundation of the world, we all were ordained when Christ was ordained. When He was ordained to be the Christ, we were ordained to be Christ-men. He was ordained to be the Anointed of God, and we were ordained to be the little anointed ones. How marvelous that Christ and we were ordained at the same time in eternity past! Christ was foreknown by God the Father, and we also were foreknown by Him. </p>

If you see this and believe it, you should not hesitate to declare it. Perhaps you are reluctant to say that you were ordained before the foundation of the world when Christ was ordained. You may feel uneasy about speaking such a thing; you may think that others would consider you beside yourself if you said this. Oh, we all need to see the revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100804" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1 Peter 1</span> concerning God’s foreknowledge and foreordination! It is a marvelous spiritual fact that we and Christ were foreknown and foreordained by God the Father in eternity past! </p>

Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100807" data-verses="1Peter 1:20">verse 20</span> matches <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100808" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">verse 2</span>. When Christ was ordained, we were <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> foreknown and chosen. This is possible because there is no time element with God. </p>

In a very real sense, all of Adam’s descendants were there before Him. Then God could choose, approve, and ordain certain ones, for no reason that is apparent to us. God could say, “I like this one. Therefore, I choose him, approve him, and ordain him.” God looked at people from countries all over the world. Then He selected some from the United States, from China, and from England, France, Germany, and many other nations. He chose people of different colors—black, white, yellow, brown, and red. What do we have to say concerning this? Actually we should have nothing to say except, “Hallelujah! Praise the Lord for His foreknowledge!” Let us praise God the Father for His selection, approval, and ordination. </p>

Furthermore, the Spirit came to us, worked on us, and brought us to repentance and faith in Christ. In a sense, the Spirit could say regarding us, “Oh, here is one who was ordained by God in eternity past. Now is the time for him to be called and saved.” Because we were foreordained by God, the Spirit came to us and did whatever was necessary to cause us to believe in Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="NAEaBY_x6pYcwk4ARy7Lpg7iHQAFe9lwgvU3PeKk5eHyvPPrOn2R1Uoieyq3fnZXS"> Our soul is composed of mind, emotion, and will, which are also parts of our heart. To have our soul purified is to have our mind, emotion, and will, the parts of our heart, purified from any kind of defilement and contamination. (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100828" data-verses="Acts 15:9">Acts 15:9</span>; <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100829" data-verses="James 4:8">James 4:8</span>). This actually means to have our mind, emotion, and will delivered from all things other than God, and fixed on God as the sole object and unique goal. This kind of purification is accomplished by our obedience to the truth, which is the content and reality of our faith. When we obey the truth, the content and reality of our faith in Christ, our entire soul is concentrated on God and in this way is purified from all things other than God. This is to save our souls from all filthiness by receiving the implanted word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100830" data-verses="James 1:21">James 1:21</span>), which is the sanctifying truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100831" data-verses="John 17:17">John 17:17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="tTdiM0wtGZTbyzmpJc9hshU6ilCXbDyh7CrYYgW30kDeC5v7EAZJ3WM5CGcOvUqoA"> According to Peter’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100832" data-verses="1Peter 1:22">verse 22</span>, we purify our souls by obedience to the truth. Here we have the three matters of the purification of the soul, obedience, and truth. We should not take any of these things for granted. Instead, we should ask what truth is here and also what it means to have obedience to the truth. Furthermore, Peter says that this purification of our souls by obedience to the truth is unto unfeigned brotherly love. Here Peter speaks not merely of love, and not only of brotherly love, but of unfeigned brotherly love. Therefore, in this one verse Peter covers the purification of our souls, obedience to the truth, and unfeigned brotherly love. Then he goes on to urge us to love one another from the heart fervently. It is characteristic of Peter’s writings to put so many points together in one verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="hxMBDypTTZrlXu74HtrBsOo2yCGUycgm0XNLbZECSYiOVkeYnRerhlESfi0ONqauL"> According to the proper understanding of language, the subject of “having purified your souls” is “you.” This means that Peter is telling the believers that they have purified their souls. Therefore, it is possible to translate the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100833" data-verses="1Peter 1:22">verse 22</span> this way: “You, having purified your souls.” </p>
<p data-content-id="UGOJeVq0WoHbHsqfi5JwP4fuYxIxn7WJqN9F77dkanazjb4Zy4jHAGGwqvdH_fvg_"> The way we purify our souls is by our obedience to the truth. This may not be a profound matter like the foreknowledge of God, but it is very practical. Compared to the great matters on the divine side, it is quite small. Nevertheless, it is very important in our Christian life. We need to ask ourselves if in our Christian life we have experienced the purifying of our souls by obedience to the truth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Mgl6dTDv_IZtBSmxxJmUqu6hIEJGUnqjvOS_OerSIuoQIZbGtUoUj4768EFrPfiof">TOUCHING REALITY IN THE WORD</h2><p data-content-id="VHdJY_o_fao3kO2JrDGWs_GaWy8GXbPC66Se0kl9tbbJLjl5GwFFUJbqKAGXhNLx1"> In order to understand what it means to purify our souls <span class="pg" data-page-id="115" id="115">[115]</span> by obedience to the truth, we must be clear concerning the meaning of truth in this verse. Truth here is the sanctifying truth, which is God’s word of reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100834" data-verses="John 17:17">John 17:17</span>). Truth in this verse does not mean doctrine. Truth is the reality contained in God’s word and conveyed by it. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100835" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> says, “God so loved the world.” This is the divine word. This word, however, should not merely be a doctrine to us, as it is with so many readers of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100836" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>. To read this verse only in a doctrinal way is to have a natural understanding. This natural understanding is devilish, for the Devil is behind our natural understanding. If our natural understanding occupies us in full, it becomes devilish. If we are to have more than a natural understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100837" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>, we need to touch the reality contained in this short word and conveyed by it. When we read, “God so loved the world,” we need to ask ourselves if we have experienced this love. We should say, “God so loved the world. Does this ‘world’ include me? Does this word mean that God so loved me?” Anyone who reads <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100838" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> in this way will get saved. Such a one would say, “O God, how I thank You that the world includes me. For You to love the world means that You love me.” This is to take <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100839" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> as truth, as reality, and not merely as a doctrine. </p>
<p data-content-id="i09bSPXZl4pb4qG7jIxCesISiyiEI84qwm3w4KlfUlb27jT2DLMWjKNNKX1xwzylW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100840" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">First Timothy 3:15</span> says that the church is the house of the living God. This verse contains doctrine, but to us it should not be merely a doctrine. Rather, Paul’s word about the church being the house of the living God should be a truth, a reality. We need to ask, “Is the church in my locality the house of the living God?” If we read the verse in this way, we shall contact reality, truth. The truth is the solid content, the reality, contained in the word of God and conveyed by it to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="1u4RHjJZsxtkegHo76dgMe-A5fzvBnVr-4BAdiflaL9E0PcxKuctHr8dFnVeaZrqv"> First Peter is addressed to scattered Jewish believers who had been in Judaism before they were saved. They had much knowledge of the types in the Old Testament. When they heard the gospel and the teaching of the apostles, they contacted reality. Through the preaching of the gospel and the apostles’ teaching, the truth, the reality, in the word of God <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> was conveyed to those Jews. As a result, they heard the reality contained in the word of God. This is the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="9dayeuFKDQTWPTGOkzti5VPn6vs9yj-uXp9KuyPSiQwJYmmIZqVDLa1EEdUTWmQ2K"> We should not only receive doctrine from God’s word—we should touch reality. The gospel and the teaching of the apostles contain realities, and these realities had been conveyed to the Jewish believers. The Jewish believers to whom Peter was writing in his first Epistle had received the truth, the reality, from the gospel and from the teaching of the apostles. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jUvRomvb09osk353DoIhpMqe-taPPRG170Q1d3WqqewTMoeFT3ZqxDgmd3WoehIm2">GIRDING UP OUR MIND AND PURIFYING OUR SOUL</h2><p data-content-id="TKuLK-iN4WWAXWP5KjHT9CqtaJEP3BuZ1mGsG8GNPe630UNpfCxCz71m3bOKKJcjL"> However, after the believers had received this truth, this reality, the Judaizers came to them and reminded them of their background in the Jewish religion. The talk of the Judaizers was distracting and disturbing and caused the mind of the Jewish believers to wander away from the truth. Perhaps one of the Jewish believers said to his wife, “Peter’s preaching is real, isn’t it? Why, then, does it contradict so many things we have heard from our parents? It even seems that some of Peter’s teachings are contrary to those of Moses. We really have a problem. Can you believe that our fathers taught us something wrong? Why does Peter teach us things that are different from what we heard in the past?” This illustrates what was the background when Peter wrote this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="nTLlhVRI0WZJKFKDQRic6_gB70a5__sTSAl5BEvl5rADl5CES_D0WV0ObUJL8h77e"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100841" data-verses="1Peter 1:13">verse 13</span> Peter says, “Wherefore, girding up the loins of your mind, being sober, set your hope completely on the grace being brought to you at the unveiling of Jesus Christ.” The word “wherefore” at the beginning of this verse is based upon all the divine truths contained in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100842" data-verses="1Peter 1:1-12">verses 1 through 12</span>. The matter of our being chosen according to the foreknowledge of God is not merely a doctrine; it is a truth, a reality. It is also a reality that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has regenerated us unto a living hope. Furthermore, it is a truth that this living hope is an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, kept for us in the heavens. In these twelve verses we have a great deal of truth, of reality. </p>

This section clearly reveals that the Triune God operates upon His chosen people to carry out His economy and to bring them into the full participation of Himself so that they may enjoy Him as grace. When God’s chosen people enjoy the Triune God as grace, they have peace. Peace, therefore, is the result of the enjoyment of grace. The first point covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100863" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> is the operation of the Triune God upon His elect to bring them into the enjoyment of Himself as grace so that they may have peace. </p>

First we have God’s operation for His economy, and this operation brings forth God’s full salvation. God’s full salvation includes the Father’s regeneration, the Son’s redemption, and the Spirit’s sanctification. This is the full salvation carried out by the operation of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="gZwyu9ibox3tnMS0ktyLXzWYTu4o7eLLG8DpYO9SArBZrzjgfEF0yr92qj6BUZ4e_"> The full salvation of the Triune God issues, results, in two matters: a holy manner of life for the expression of God, and unfeigned brotherly love toward all the saints. These two matters, a holy manner of life and unfeigned brotherly love, are a picture of the genuine church life. On the one hand, in the real church life we see the expression of God; on the other hand, in such a church life there is unfeigned love for one another. Therefore, holiness and love are the result of the full salvation carried out by the operation of the Triune God upon <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> His elect.

If we have a bird’s-eye view of this chapter, we shall love it very much. I can testify that in these days I have come to love Peter’s writings more than ever before.

Furthermore, I hope that all of us will come to love <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100867" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> of 1 Peter and the three major points revealed there concerning the operation of the Triune God for His economy, the full salvation carried out by the operation of the Triune God upon His elect, and the result of this full salvation in a holy manner of life to express God and in unfeigned brotherly love toward the believers.

Three main things accomplished in the believers by the Triune God are emphasized in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100871" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span>: the Father’s regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100872" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">vv. 3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100873" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">23</span>), the Son’s redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100874" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100875" data-verses="1Peter 1:18-19">18-19</span>), and the Spirit’s sanctification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100876" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">v. 2</span>) to make the believers a holy people, living a holy life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100877" data-verses="1Peter 1:15-16">vv. 15-16</span>). Based <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> upon this, Peter charges the believers to grow in life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100878" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">2:2</span>) for the building up of a spiritual house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100879" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">2:5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="8dbAM2uvWzOhfr7QeOD8nkNCR9alsQ0v9TFJfIT1G5QGwvPJ2fRWuwDHx406-YT4x"> Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100880" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> is complete in itself, Peter, according to his experiences, still has more to say. Therefore, with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100881" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> as his basis, he proceeds to give the charge found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100882" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">chapter two</span>. He begins by telling the saints to put away all malice, guile, hypocrisies, envyings, and evil speakings. Of the hundreds of sinful things, Peter selects five: malice, guile, hypocrisy, envy, and evil speaking. I would ask you to spend some time to consider what these are. </p>
<p data-content-id="0AIT5_8dHoujFZpQ-fTe4fDNeVyG4S6MiND9JsLc3RqCn7l9pkXE0ElJ0Dz4UaOUu"> According to the sequence of these five matters, malice is the root, the source, and evil speaking is the expression. We may have malice as a root within us. Then there will eventually be evil speaking as the expression of this malice. The development from malice to evil speaking includes guile, hypocrisies, and envyings, three downward steps from malice toward evil speaking. If we have guile, we shall also have hypocrisies; and if hypocrisies, then envyings as well. Hence, the root is malice, the development includes guile, hypocrisy, and envy, and the final expression is evil speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="79Rbiepb8tG2mJw_fYlOxaEZ1fvrJDESUXoR2kFUSEhHP7v1r0wjh6a6HPSVKIIDo"> Not even a verse such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100883" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">2:1</span> should be read in a careless way. We should not take any verse for granted or neglect to study it seriously. Rather, we should study every verse with the goal and expectation of getting into the depths of it. Actually, the depths of the Word are the reality of the Word. This reality is the truth. If we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100884" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">verse 1</span> carefully, we shall see the root, the development, and the expression.

The milk of the word is not milk for the body, but is milk for the soul, the inner being. It is conveyed in the word of God to nourish our inner man through the understanding of our rational mind, and it is assimilated by our mental faculties. </p>

The Recovery Version may be unique in using “guileless milk” in the translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100895" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">verse 2</span>. Other versions have “pure milk” or “sincere milk.” It may be that Peter intended guileless to include the meaning of pure and sincere. However, the purpose of Peter’s writing here is to show a contrast between guilelessness and the guile that proceeds out of malice. </p>

Therefore, the milk of the word is guileless milk. </p>

The purpose of putting away the evil root of malice is that we may long for, desire, the milk of the word. I believe that Peter wrote this not according to doctrine, but according to his spiritual experiences. If we do not have adequate experience, we shall not be able to understand what Peter is saying. </p>

First, we need to put away all malice, guile, hypocrisies, envyings, and evil speakings. Second, we need to long for the guileless milk of the word so that by it we may grow in life. As we have seen, the genuine growth in life is the increase of the measure of life. </p>

The Greek word rendered “unto” also means resulting in. To grow in life results in salvation. Salvation here, as the result of growth in life, is not initial salvation. God’s full and complete salvation has a long span—from regeneration, including justification, to glorification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100905" data-verses="Romans 8:30">Rom. 8:30</span>). At regeneration we received initial salvation. Then we need to grow by feeding on Christ as the nourishing milk in the word of God unto full salvation, unto maturity for glorification. This will be the salvation of our soul, which will be revealed to us at the unveiling of the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100906" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">1:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100907" data-verses="1Peter 1:9-10">9-10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100908" data-verses="1Peter 1:13">13</span>). However, according to the context, “unto salvation” here refers directly to “being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100909" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">verse 5</span>, and to telling out “the virtues of Him” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100910" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">verse 9</span>. </p>

To be saved from malice, guile, hypocrisies, envyings, and evil speakings is not accomplished by effort of our own. This cannot be done by self-improvement, adjustment, or correction. On the contrary, to be saved from these negative things is an inward matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="9dayeuFKDQTWPTGOkzti5VPn6vM9yh-uXp9KuyPSiQwJYmmIZqVDLa1EEdUTWmQ2K"> As an illustration, suppose someone has bacteria that cause disease in his body. These bacteria are in his blood and in the fibers of his being. What would be the use of trying to solve this problem by washing the person with a strong soap? This could do nothing more than cleanse the outer layer of his skin. But that cleansing would not be effective against the bacteria in him. In order to deal with the bacteria, that person needs to receive an antibiotic. He also needs to take in the proper nourishment for his physical body so that it may grow. This growth will help to heal him of his illness. In like manner, it is by the inner growth unto salvation that we are saved spontaneously from the “germs” of malice, guile, hypocrisies, envyings, and evil speakings. </p>
<p data-content-id="jUvRomvb09osk353DoIhpMqe-t6PPTG170Q1d3WqqewTMoeFT3ZqxDgmd3WoehIm2"> Fifty years ago, it was difficult for me to overcome my temper. But now after more than fifty years’ experience with the Lord, I can testify that it is difficult for me to lose my temper. Some may say that it is because I am now an elderly man that I no longer have a problem with my temper. Such a suggestion is not accurate. Actually, a person’s temper usually increases with age. For this reason, older people are often critical of others and impatient with them. Naturally speaking, the older we get, the more of a problem we shall have with our temper. In the Lord and before the Lord I can testify that the older I get, the less temper I have. The reason for this change is that over the years I have experienced growth in life unto salvation from my temper. This is an illustration of the fact that, in a practical way, we all need to grow unto salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKuLK-iN4WWAXWP5KjHT9CqtaJkP0BOZ1mGsG8GNPe630UNpfCxCz71m3bOKKJcjL"> The salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100912" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">verse 2</span> is not salvation in the initial stage or in the stage of consummation; it is salvation in the progressing stage, in the stage of transformation. It is correct to understand this verse as saying that we need to grow unto <span class="pg" data-page-id="133" id="133">[133]</span> transformation. Of course, the word transformation is not used here. Nevertheless, salvation in this verse implies transformation. Regeneration is in the stage of initial salvation; transformation, in the stage of progressing salvation; and glorification, in the stage of consummation. We are not in the initial stage or in the stage of completion. We are in the progressing stage of salvation; that is, we are in the stage of transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="nTLlhVRI0WZJKFKDQRic6_gB70658_MTSAl5BEvl5rADl5CES_D0WV0ObUJL8h77e"> Transformation is different from a mere change. Transformation involves a change from one form into another form. However, it involves an inward change in nature or constitution, not simply an outward change in form. For example, suppose a person is ill, and his complexion does not look healthy. He may try to improve his appearance by putting some kind of coloring on his face. I do not like that kind of skin coloring, for it makes me think of the work of a mortician, who tries to make the face of a dead person appear as attractive as possible. Today both disciples of Confucius and many Christians are involved in outward works of self-improvement, works that can be compared to those of a mortician. Such an outward change is altogether different from living, inward transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="6QMYacwK02nthQCoF0URhKVkRQofGYSwiASTsylVaVYoGxKhSC8NjvEvyvfi8NIox"> Recently, I was somewhat ill. But day by day my wife served me nourishing food. Eventually that food made me healthy and restored a healthy color to my face. When my wife saw my complexion, she was happy. There was no need for me to color my face, because the healthy color came out of the inward nourishment. I ate, digested, and assimilated nourishing food. The nourishment was transmitted into my cells, fibers, and even into my skin, and caused me to have healthy skin color. This is an illustration of transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="R3V846PAgL9uUXzkIwWb8W3itRKh01bIBG2lbvy4b6AK6lLFmxs9AW8X9SmI49ucm"> Peter charges us to long for the guileless milk of the word that by it we may grow unto transformation. We do not grow unto outward correction or outward adjustment or outward improvement. On the contrary, we grow unto inward transformation by life and in life. </p>

If you try to give nourishment to something lifeless and inorganic, that thing would become corrupt and unclean. It is impossible for something lifeless to receive help from nourishing food. Obviously it is useless to try to feed a dead person. No doubt, the guileless milk in the word can feed us and nourish us. However, it can only feed and nourish those who are living and organic. Without life, there would not be anything in us to cooperate with this nourishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="LEaEZEVlbby5jrDyOPbM6R6sJZEK_FLiYgQjzgvFr4_C9_bVvJACZ0AXcCqEVMbI5"> Peter begins <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100913" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">2:2</span> with the words “As newborn babes.” The word “newborn” indicates a living organism. A newborn babe is living and organic. As such newborn babes, we need to drink the guileless milk of the word. Then the milk will afford us living, organic nourishment. Spontaneously the life within us will work together with the nourishment of the milk so that we may grow. However, if we did not have a living, organic element in us through regeneration, the nourishment in the milk of the word would not have any effect, for there would not be any cooperation on our part. </p>
<p data-content-id="muFVkpXJoJnc0dsDO0S9EVshCEtJLJ9IBNIQfmY9uCiT9k_fZIRoMYXsNsCmWVvlw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100914" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">1:23</span> Peter says that we have been regenerated. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100915" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">2:2</span> he urges us to be as newborn babes longing for milk. Both regeneration in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100916" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">1:23</span> and the newborn babes in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100917" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">2:2</span> point to the same matter—regeneration with the divine life. This regeneration is the base for our growth in life and for the purification of our inner being. We all have within us the divine life that we received in regeneration as the basis of all spiritual growth. In order to grow and be purified, we must have this base. Therefore, as newborn babes, we should long for the guileless milk of the word so that by it we may grow unto transformation. </p>

If we have tasted Him, we shall long for the nourishing milk in His word. The Greek word rendered “good” in this verse also means pleasant, kind. </p>

<p data-content-id="sIQHD11fFkBgeJsmlyCwB3XM79wH9jnmIZYofsu39phMs8US-jBXoedz9GzFfHq3r"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100948" data-verses="1Peter 2:4">2:4</span> Peter says, “To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor.” We have pointed out that a living stone not only possesses life but also grows in life. The living stone in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100949" data-verses="1Peter 2:4">verse 4</span> is Christ for God’s building. Here Peter changes his metaphor from the seed of the vegetable life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100950" data-verses="1Peter 1:23-24">1:23-24</span>) to the stone. The seed is for life-planting, whereas the stone is for building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100951" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">2:5</span>). Peter’s thought has gone on from life-planting to God’s building. As life to us Christ is the seed. For God’s building He is the stone. After receiving Him as the seed of life, we need to grow that we may experience Him as the stone living in us. Then He will make us living stones, transformed with His stone nature, so that we may be built together with others a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation and the cornerstone. Let us go on to consider what Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100952" data-verses="1Peter 2:6-8">verses 6 through 8</span> regarding Christ as the stone for God’s building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wS3VSJbLtNnxowR0q44PBRyoAUu9_ngpz3ls5mcZOlL1-HI2Ou_soTzIbNTEhoHct">CHRIST CHOSEN BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="LEaEZEVlbby5jrDyOPbM6R6sJZUK2VriYgQjzgvFr4_C9_bVvJACZ0AXcCqEVMbI5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100953" data-verses="1Peter 2:6">First Peter 2:6</span>, quoting <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100954" data-verses="Isaiah 28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, says, “Because it is contained in Scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a chosen stone, a cornerstone held in honor, and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame.” Although this living stone was <span class="pg" data-page-id="142" id="142">[142]</span> rejected by the leaders of God’s people, this stone was chosen by God. God’s choosing of Christ as the living stone is of two aspects. First, as we have seen, Christ was chosen by God in eternity past. That was God’s initial choosing of Him. Then God chose Christ the second time in resurrection. Resurrection is a strong proof that God has chosen Christ. This second choosing was a confirmation of God’s first choosing. Therefore, in resurrection God confirmed the choice He had made concerning Christ in eternity past. </p>
<p data-content-id="muFVkpXJoJnc0dsDO0S9EVshCE9JDZNIBNIQfmY9uCiT9k_fZIRoMYXsNsCmWVvlw"> When Christ was on the cross, apparently He was rejected by God. To the Pharisees and to all the others who opposed Him, the crucifixion of Christ was a sign that God had rejected Him. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100955" data-verses="Matthew 27:42-43">Matthew 27:42 and 43</span>, the chief priests, with the scribes and the elders, said, “He is king of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe on him. He trusted upon God; let Him rescue him now if He wants him; for he said, I am God’s Son.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100956" data-verses="Luke 23:35">Luke 23:35</span> says, “And the rulers were even sneering and saying, He saved others, let him save himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!” The religious leaders thought that God had rejected Christ. However, on the third day Christ was resurrected, and that resurrection was a sign of God’s choosing, a proof that God had chosen Christ to be the stone for His building. </p>
<p data-content-id="BuN0Wi41-WaNn4QzIFus7KYsC30iQU_9Lg-GlSyuVYW03tWNbFC9Yi26QowoiNyuD"> From the time of Christ’s resurrection, Christ has been held in honor. The Greek word rendered “honor” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100957" data-verses="1Peter 2:6">verse 6</span>, the same word that is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100958" data-verses="1Peter 2:4">verse 4</span>, also means precious. It differs from the Greek word translated “precious” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100959" data-verses="1Peter 1:19">1:19</span>. There the word denotes preciousness in essence; here it indicates preciousness as recognized and held in honor. </p>
<p data-content-id="xCYRCBsQuw2L-c2XMdJX4w0GHPQSZiPmQ7e0Dzkl6TOAjj70sSbUDgvOuVhrfbbT9"> The statement, “Behold, I lay in Zion a chosen stone,” refers not only to Christ’s resurrection, but also to His ascension. After God resurrected Christ, He lifted Him up to the heavens. Therefore, Christ’s ascension was a further sign and confirmation that God had chosen Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="rjTPLhTT8an5I7cUTTzmydgHCL0xKLQXRg9lnBtbC--nVsKvp_fjOWL62w9JaapYK"> The Zion spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100960" data-verses="1Peter 2:6">2:6</span> is not the Zion on earth; it is the Zion in the heavens. In the New Testament there are two Zions, one earthly and the other heavenly. The earthly Zion is a reflection of the heavenly one. The Jewish people may have <span class="pg" data-page-id="143" id="143">[143]</span> an earthly Zion, but we Christians, those who believe in Christ, have a heavenly Zion. For this reason, we are not coming to an earthly Zion; we are coming to the heavenly Zion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100961" data-verses="Hebrews 12:22">Heb. 12:22</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="dNl6tgRNGfx6EVOqeWt6MZmKwoZSdJfUU4ldkBJC7GGgVM62D66Z7Aowb9mcgKl2v"> God’s choosing of Christ in eternity past was not seen by anyone, not even by the angels. When God chose Christ, nothing had been created, for that choice was made before the foundation of the world. Only God knew that Christ was His chosen One. But this choice has been manifested in Christ’s resurrection and ascension. Soon after Christ’s ascension, Peter realized clearly that Christ is the Messiah chosen by God. This was the reason Peter said to the religious leaders in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100962" data-verses="Acts 4:1">Acts 4</span>, “Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100963" data-verses="1Peter 2:10-12">vv. 10-12</span>). There is salvation in no other name because God has chosen Christ, and this choice has been manifested in and confirmed by Christ’s resurrection and ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="QfakavptTSx9tWovQHAybkDO7U_UHZmQDY-JxCUP4mm7A_CcJcFvQFbMh0TJNMl0F"> Along with the other apostles, Peter could testify that he had seen the resurrected Christ. Furthermore, they had all witnessed His ascension. These two acts, resurrection and ascension, prove and confirm that Jesus of Nazareth is the One whom God has chosen to be the head of the corner for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7v-FU3jPmckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> As such a chosen One, Christ is now held in honor. Christ is not only in glory; He is also on the throne at the right hand of God. This means that He is in a position of honor. Because Christ is now in such an honorable position, He is precious, highly valued. </p>

The very Christ chosen by God as a stone, even a cornerstone held in honor, is the preciousness to His believers. But to the unbelieving, He is a rejected, despised stone. Christ’s preciousness is not only a matter of condition, but also a matter of His position. For Him to be precious means that He is held in honor, that He occupies an honorable position. </p>
<p data-content-id="ofUPlCuNAC12hlvQuJ_UoTe23juat8geBZxGNzkHTjFI2xYHPOXYWjct6OLFz60vb"> In this verse we are told that the builders rejected Christ as the living stone. These builders were the Jewish leaders in Judaism, who were supposed to build the house of God. They rejected Christ to the uttermost, as the Lord had predicted (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="100968" data-verses="Matthew 21:38-42">Matt. 21:38-42</span>). Nevertheless, Christ became the head of the corner in resurrection. As we have seen, in his early preaching Peter declared this fact to the Jews. </p>
<p data-content-id="3Sfgt49N4yqnUk9Ymhzai--1fiUmgEOJSUKY6facN-ragmCO58awdH5H1zP2HCGtX"> To the unbelieving, Christ is a stone rejected by the builders. Nevertheless, this rejected stone has become the head of the corner. Hence, Christ is a stone of two aspects. With Him as the stone for God’s building, there is the aspect of honor and also the aspect of rejection. On the one hand, Christ was rejected; on the other hand, He has been honored. He was rejected by the Jewish builders, but He has been honored by God. How do we know that Christ was rejected by the Jewish leaders? We know it by the fact that they put Christ on the cross. That was their rejection of Him. How do we know that Christ has been honored by God? We know this by the fact that God resurrected Him and exalted Him. Therefore, the resurrection and exaltation of Christ are strong signs both that God has chosen Him and that He is held in honor by God. </p>

The main part of the sentence in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100997" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">verse 5</span> is this: “You...are being built up a spiritual house.” Hence, the main thought here is that of the building. This thought continues the thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100998" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">verse 2</span> of growing unto salvation. This means that following salvation we have the building. Growing unto salvation is for the building. This indicates that here salvation involves not only transformation, but also includes being built up. As a totality, salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="100999" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">1 Peter 2</span> indicates transformation for building up. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBDClclK4_gpZGd_EEOfeWhPYaFV6JN0j_QDX0NzP4abflyLeRnlIr-xEAgV8mknY"> Salvation at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101000" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">verse 2</span> is related to transformation for the building. Notice that at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101001" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">verse 2</span> there is a comma, not a period. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101002" data-verses="1Peter 2:3">verse 3</span> we have a condition related to drinking the milk of the word: “If you have tasted that the Lord is good.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101003" data-verses="1Peter 2:3">Verse 3</span> concludes with a semicolon, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101004" data-verses="1Peter 2:4">verse 4</span> ends with a comma. Therefore, the punctuation indicates that the main clause in the second part of the sentence is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101005" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">verse 5</span>. Actually, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101006" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">verse 5</span> is the direct continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101007" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">verse 2</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101008" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">Verse 2</span> ends with the thought of growing unto salvation, which implies that salvation includes transformation. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101009" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">verse 5</span> continues by indicating that this transformation <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> is for the building. For this reason we say that salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101010" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">verse 2</span> is a matter of transformation for building. </p>
<p data-content-id="24ImHOq-Ka35kqnAvZR584KYNUJ5-78KhAQjGNQHhyNnXU_TOW-D_pXiyRvyfmIm-"> I believe that we have touched the thought in Peter’s mind and heart as he was writing. In these verses Peter seems to be saying, “You believers have all been regenerated, and now you are as newborn babes. As newborn babes, you should hunger and thirst for the milk in the word so that you may grow unto salvation. This salvation is transformation for building up.” These must have been Peter’s thoughts as he was writing this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="LEaEZEVlbby5jrDyOPbM6R6sJakK_HLiYgQjzgvFr4_C9_bVvJACZ0AXcCqEVMbI5"> Whenever we write a letter or article, we first have certain thoughts within us. Then gradually we write according to these thoughts. This was Peter’s situation when he wrote this Epistle. He had the thought that the believers had been regenerated to become newborn babes. Now they should long for the milk in the word. By the guileless milk in the word they could grow unto a salvation that was transformation for their building up. Having these thoughts within him, Peter went on to compose this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="muFVkpXJoJnc0dsDO0S9EVshCHNJLL9IBNIQfmY9uCiT9k_fZIRoMYXsNsCmWVvlw"> On the one hand, Peter’s composition may not seem very good. But, on the other hand, spiritually speaking, Peter’s composition is excellent. If Peter had not written the way he did, not all of the points covered could have been included. However, because it is sometimes difficult to understand Peter, we need help to grasp the various points he covers in his writings. This is the reason we are having this Life-study. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcaaVHTVCgvGIROFjCd-BQVV_z9Bljsz4vwu4bpiV0zCG8Fh4RpvKatN3QN0zME-K"> I can testify that for more than fifty years I have been digging into the Word of God. In 1956 the Lord began to show me His building. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101011" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">First Peter 2</span> is a very important section in the New Testament related to God’s building. When I was in Manila in 1956, I began to see from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101012" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">1 Peter 2</span> that salvation includes transformation and that this transformation is for the building. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ax-XoUmXRGuNtjUgn0zaCf8sAcgKgbY_bx2QVWud5sj4sJ3E4W0PzhghSZKkIgXk6"> Few Christians have a proper understanding of the building. Furthermore, many have not seen the matter of transformation. Before you came into the Lord’s recovery, did you ever hear a message on transformation? But in the recovery many messages have been given on the subject of transformation. In December 1962, I gave a conference on the all-inclusive <span class="pg" data-page-id="151" id="151">[151]</span> Christ. Then in 1963 I began to speak in this country on transformation. That year I gave at least twenty messages on transformation. Although the light concerning transformation and building was given to me years ago, this light has never left me. Rather, it has always been with me. It took me years of study to see these things. Therefore, I can say that without the help rendered through these messages, you may find it difficult to understand what Peter is saying about salvation, transformation, and building. </p>
<p data-content-id="FVdXhiOjWCOU2MQIGN_E1FaCen9ZoXl3AER3V25JpQzvWurx6wgDQNFCSNGqcdCkN"> Praise the Lord that regeneration has made us newborn babes! As newborn babes, we all should long for the guileless milk of the word. Then by this milk we shall grow unto salvation. This salvation is transformation, and transformation is the building. Feeding on Christ by the nourishing milk in the Word of God is not only for growing in life; it is also for building up. Growing is for building up. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CqM6w5pYHgbjWvf7luLWug9zED2JdizuhdAv8tHckPQSzMQTKqDBZHhBtpVegg1bt">TRANSFORMED INTO LIVING STONES</h2><p data-content-id="PsefQ1FZ6fc7Xp3AqPkSQInhjNQNhSm28kOMitPscxA9jxQEoHmNCZnuSP1Cpudkc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101013" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">verse 5</span> Peter indicates that the believers are living stones. We, the believers in Christ, are living stones, like Christ, through regeneration and transformation. We were created of clay (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101014" data-verses="Romans 9:21">Rom. 9:21</span>). But at regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growth in us transforms us into living stones. At Peter’s conversion the Lord gave him a new name, Peter—a stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101015" data-verses="John 1:42">John 1:42</span>). When Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He also was the rock—a stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101016" data-verses="Matthew 16:16-18">Matt. 16:16-18</span>). Peter was impressed by these two incidents that both Christ and His believers are stones for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="-bV22nWH_FbItmzO6YVHsZY6EBM4vOMr7lvRKtpbd8TOAsIX6A2XE9BWdzvsz9lXK"> By our natural birth we are clay, not stones. Do you realize that you were made of clay? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101017" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Genesis 2:7</span> says that man was made from the dust of the ground. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101018" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span> reveals that we are vessels of clay. How, then, can we become stones? We become stones through the process of transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="pEWFX9DAbL5FbbFHZzCgZNJGD4_ZdZitjs6U5R2GbQT8zoeL_zLo2pvDn2d-mwppZ"> When Peter first met the Lord Jesus, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Peter. Referring to the Lord Jesus and Peter, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101019" data-verses="John 1:42">John 1:42</span> says, “Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone).” According to biblical principle, <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> whatever the Lord speaks will be. Therefore, when the Lord called Peter a stone, that meant that he would certainly become a stone. Whatever the Lord says to us will be fulfilled. If He says, “You are gold,” then you will be golden. The Lord knew that when He changed Simon’s name to Peter, a stone, he would become a stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="vmfpsxk3X-CPOle6XZ_G2a2NF60So17mfN2MSXnyzsmNuic1bchaisP_k3J_ELop6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101020" data-verses="John 1:42">John 1:42</span> Peter was told that he was a stone. Then sometime later, in Caesarea Philippi, in answer to the Lord’s question, “Who do you say that I am,” Peter, receiving the revelation from the Father, said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” To this the Lord Jesus replied, “And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church...” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101021" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matt. 16:18</span>). Here the Lord indicates that He is the rock upon which the church is built and that Peter is a stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBDClclK4_gpZGd_EEOfeWhPYaFVwbt0j_QDX0NzP4abflyLeRnlIr-xEAgV8mknY"> No doubt, these two incidents, the one recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101022" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> and the other in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101023" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span>, were deeply impressed into Peter’s being. He could never forget those events. It must have been from these experiences that Peter obtained the concept of living stones for the building of the spiritual house, which is the church. When Peter wrote this portion of 1 Peter, he wrote it according to the impression these events made upon him. </p>
<p data-content-id="24ImHOq-Ka35kqnAvZR584KYNUJ51pMKhAQjGNQHhyNnXU_TOW-D_pXiyRvyfmIm-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101024" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">First Peter 2:5</span> says that we, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house. However, we all are clay. How can we be built up? In order to be built up a spiritual house, we need to become stones. But how can we actually become living stones? We become living stones by coming to Christ as the living stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101025" data-verses="1Peter 2:4">v. 4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="uj_E8kFY-CqzwHkg4wPi8KVxugqJEpNKZE6A-0wt5hJK0U8YduGxp0egiQIF1x3q0"> We may use petrified wood as an illustration of transformation. In Arizona there is a place called the petrified forest, an area that contains much petrified wood. Petrified wood is wood that has been changed into stone. Over a long period of time, water has been flowing over wood and through it. By means of this flow of water, the substance of the wood is changed into stone. On the one hand, the element of wood is carried away; on the other hand, the element of stone is brought in to replace the element of wood. In this way the wood becomes stone. <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> </p>

God wants a built up house and a priesthood for His expression. Both the house and the priesthood must be corporate. This is indicated by the four collective nouns used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101062" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">verse 9</span>: race, priesthood, nation, and people. First, God wants a house in which to dwell. As we all know, a house cannot be built of a single piece of material. On the contrary, a house can be built only of many different materials put together. In addition to a house for His dwelling, God wants a priesthood for His service. God does not desire individual priests; He desires a priesthood, a corporate body of priests, for His service. </p>
<p data-content-id="aZn_BmdJnw08BKUBEZGTChsBMonm36wuwhI8Hy5ddoS3NDItxAjd7omZbH1-okflf"> The house and the priesthood, both of which are corporate entities, are for God’s expression. This is indicated clearly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101063" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">2:9</span>: “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.” Telling out the virtues of Him is a matter of expressing Him. To tell out the Lord’s virtues simply means to express Him according to what He is. God is rich in virtues. For example, He is loving and kind. Both His love and His kindness are virtues. Actually, all of God’s attributes are His virtues, and we should tell out these virtues. Whenever we preach the gospel and teach the truth concerning the <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> Lord, we should tell out His virtues. But unlike the practice of many Christians today, this telling out should be a corporate matter, not an individual one. </p>
<p data-content-id="bIX-6kISXyy1XG1dStqEZl25o8lh18t-D_UerZen8a2WySCsxlwHoL--lUiJeySET"> We need to turn from traditional, religious teachings and come back to the pure Word. We grow by taking in the guileless milk of the Word so that we may be transformed. Then we shall be built up into a house for God’s dwelling and a priesthood for His service. Furthermore, we shall become God’s expression in His virtues. These are the main points of the second section of this Epistle, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101064" data-verses="1Peter 2:1-10">2:1-10</span>. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101066" data-verses="1Peter 1:1-2">1:1-2</span> we see that the pilgrims in dispersion are under the operation of the Triune God. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101067" data-verses="1Peter 1:3-25">1:3-25</span> we have the full salvation of the Triune God and its issues. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101068" data-verses="1Peter 2:1">chapter two</span> we see the matter of growth in life and its results (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101069" data-verses="1Peter 2:1-10">2:1-10</span>). First we grow by feeding on the milk of the Word unto full salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101070" data-verses="1Peter 2:1-3">2:1-3</span>).

<p data-content-id="ofUPlCuNAC12hlvQuJ_UoTe23gOat-geBZxGNzkHTjFI2xYHPOXYWjct6OLFz60vb"> Peter may have been a fisherman, but he was very intelligent.

<p data-content-id="ck7ZHbdqM24QGnW7JL0wBUosXiZEWCt1X9kzGHSV3YY4pgJDsbMgZhhrhLbkg96gz">In the introduction to this Epistle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101103" data-verses="1Peter 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>) we see that the operation of God’s economy is to bring us into the full enjoyment of the Triune God. What a great matter this is! Then in the first section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101104" data-verses="1Peter 1:3-25">1:3-25</span>) we have the full salvation of the Triune God and its issues. God’s full salvation includes the regeneration of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Spirit. The issues of this full salvation are a holy manner of life and an unfeigned brotherly love. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y1KxaLRh8hx0MgtFrlaDNr3aXRNeq_csEy3Istv7kjGteO8_iFmxZwHWdjP2Mm1f_"> The second section of this Epistle covers the growth in life and its results (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101105" data-verses="1Peter 2:1-10">2:1-10</span>). In order to grow in life, we need to long for the guileless milk of the Word. It is by this milk that we grow. The result of the growth in life is transformation, building up, and the expression of God. By the growth in life we are transformed and built up, and then we become God’s expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="E5Cs4PZPSSv6OEWz8g7NJx1Nzt0LrWSordnbo0VyskzAIq8kfKQrWBmYM6YTZqBiW"> The third section of this Epistle, concerned with the Christian life and its sufferings, is the longest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101106" data-verses="1Peter 2:11">2:11—4:19</span>). Peter takes more than two whole chapters to cover this subject. In this portion of his Epistle he does not speak of the Christian life and its enjoyment; he speaks concerning the Christian life and its sufferings. In the messages to come we shall see what these sufferings are. </p>
<p data-content-id="DbPKqMhGZ8HsKpWPyG3BaeHvZXMEZwoXrZab9lZvy6A64HpIlS9qdNUlAmm2Bal4_"> After the lengthy section on the Christian life and its sufferings, Peter has two short sections on the elders’ shepherding and its reward (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101107" data-verses="1Peter 5:1-4">5:1-4</span>) and the mighty hand of God and its goal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101108" data-verses="1Peter 5:5-11">5:5-11</span>). Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101109" data-verses="1Peter 5:12-14">5:12-14</span>, we have the conclusion. <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SqEusd6atnyDbypEbKrNMKQvupBWQN18AgU-DN0LQXDMxLcoM7EJr-9aaH1dofMTI">FIVE MAIN POINTS</h2><p data-content-id="gZwyu9ibox3tnMS0ktyLXzWYTt4ozO7LG8DpYO9SArBZrzjgfEF0yr92qj6BUZ4e_"> If we consider Peter’s thought according to this outline printed above, we shall see that in this Epistle he covers five main points: full salvation, growth in life, the Christian life, the elders’ shepherding, and the mighty hand of God. If we get into the depths of this book, we shall see that these are the basic matters Peter was seeking to cover as he wrote. Furthermore, with each of these five matters there is an issue, a result, some kind of suffering, a reward, or a goal. With God’s full salvation, we have a twofold issue, a holy manner of life and brotherly love. With the growth in life, we have transformation, building up, and the expression of God. With the Christian life, we have sufferings. With the elders’ shepherding, we have the reward. With the mighty hand of God, we have a goal. This understanding of the structure of 1 Peter is clear and also logical. </p>
<p data-content-id="exrMvHGeCNp1XkMlEOO4nrllUrh9UKcdH9YSPQYcDdaKGjk_ixywap2hEvgBMaiKf"> If you consider the brief sketch of this book presented in the outline, you will see that this Epistle covers the full salvation of the Triune God and its issues, growth in life and its results, the Christian life and its sufferings, the elders’ shepherding and its reward, and the mighty hand of God and its goal. God will reward all the elders for their shepherding. In this book the mighty hand of God is emphasized because the subject of this Epistle is the Christian life under the government of God. The mighty hand of God is for the carrying out of His governmental administration, and with this administration there is a goal. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BuN0Wi41-WaNn4QzIFus7KYsB2EiXGf9Lg-GlSyuVYW03tWNbFC9Yi26QowoiNyuD">A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="xCYRCBsQuw2L-c2XMdJX4w0GEOgSfw_mQ7e0Dzkl6TOAjj70sSbUDgvOuVhrfbbT9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101161" data-verses="1Peter 2:13-20">2:13-20</span> we have several matters related to our daily life. Toward the end of this portion Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101162" data-verses="1Peter 2:19">verse 19</span>, “This is grace,” and at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101163" data-verses="1Peter 2:20">verse 20</span>, “This is grace with God.” The way Peter uses the word grace in these verses has been a problem to translators. If the Greek word is translated literally, the reader may find it difficult to understand what Peter is saying. Nevertheless, in the Recovery Version we adopt a literal translation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101164" data-verses="1Peter 2:19">Verse 19</span> says, “For this is grace, if anyone because of conscience toward God bears sorrows, suffering unjustly.” Thinking that the common reader of this verse would not be able to understand the meaning if the word grace were used in the translation, some translators have used the word “acceptable.” Certain versions use the word “thankful.” However, neither of these translations is exact according to the Greek text. Furthermore, they do not satisfy the inner sense in the spirit. Therefore, these translations do not “strike home.” This was the reason we decided to make a literal translation in the Recovery Version. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101165" data-verses="1Peter 2:19">verse 19</span> says, “This is grace,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101166" data-verses="1Peter 2:20">verse 20</span> says, “This is grace with God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="rjTPLhTT8an5I7cUTTzmydgHBKExDZQXRg9lnBtbC--nVsKvp_fjOWL62w9JaapYK"> Now that we have an accurate translation of these verses, how shall we understand them? In particular, how shall we interpret what Peter says about grace? I can testify that I found it very difficult to write the notes on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101167" data-verses="1Peter 2:19">verse 19</span>. I wanted to say something, but at first I did not have anything to say. Eventually, the light came from the Lord, and I saw that <span class="pg" data-page-id="178" id="178">[178]</span> grace here refers to the motivation of the divine life within us and its expression in our life becoming in our behavior something gracious and acceptable in the eyes of both man and God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101168" data-verses="1Peter 2:20">v. 20</span>). What is grace in our manner of life? It is the motivation of the divine life which we received at our regeneration inwardly and the expression of this life outwardly. Then this motivation and expression become gracious, acceptable, in our behavior. When others observe this, they may say that this is grace in our manner of life. Day by day we should give others the impression that grace is with us. This means that they should be able to see grace in our daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="dNl6tgRNGfx6EVOqeWt6MZmKzppSVbPUU4ldkBJC7GGgVM62D66Z7Aowb9mcgKl2v"> We have often seen grace in the lives of saints who have been in difficulty or hardship. For example, a sister becomes ill. Everyone is concerned for her because she seems to be dying. However, as she lies in bed in the hospital, she is full of joy. This is surprising to the doctors and nurses. The sister is able to bear sufferings that others cannot bear, and she is not afraid of dying. The life that motivates her inwardly is expressed outwardly, even in the midst of her illness. This is grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="pEWFX9DAbL5FbbFHZzCgZNJGA6_Zdbitjs6U5R2GbQT8zoeL_zLo2pvDn2d-mwppZ"> We have also seen grace expressed in this way at a funeral. A certain sister has lost her husband. But even at the time of the funeral, her face is glowing. Using Peter’s word to describe this sister’s experience, we would again say, “This is grace.” </p>
<p data-content-id="vmfpsxk3X-CPOle6XZ_G2a2NG40So37mfN2MSXnyzsmNuic1bchaisP_k3J_ELop6"> Grace is the divine life for our enjoyment. First, grace is an inward motivation; then it finds an outward expression in our living. Both the inward motivation and outward expression become something sweet, gracious, and also acceptable. I believe that this is the correct understanding of Peter’s word regarding grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101169" data-verses="1Peter 2:19-20">2:19 and 20</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBDClclK4_gpZGd_EEOfeWhPbYFVzbN0j_QDX0NzP4abflyLeRnlIr-xEAgV8mknY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101170" data-verses="Hebrews 12:28">Hebrews 12:28</span> says, “Let us have grace.” To have grace is to possess grace, take grace, and apply grace. Grace has come and is now with us. What is this grace? Grace is the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit in us. In all circumstances and situations we should take grace and apply it. </p>
<p data-content-id="24ImHOq-Ka35kqnAvZR584KYOWJ52psKhAQjGNQHhyNnXU_TOW-D_pXiyRvyfmIm-"> We all need to learn how to have grace, that is, how to use grace. If we do this, something wonderful, excellent, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="179" id="179">[179]</span> pleasant will motivate us from within. Then we shall be able to bear things, forbear things, and do things that others cannot. Spontaneously, as the result of the motivation within us, there will be a certain expression upon us. This motivation and expression is the Triune God experienced by us and lived out by us. To others, this is something sweet, gracious, acceptable, and worthy of thanksgiving. </p>
<p data-content-id="uj_E8kFY-CqzwHkg4wPi8KVxtiqJHotKZE6A-0wt5hJK0U8YduGxp0egiQIF1x3q0"> I appreciate what Peter says concerning grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101171" data-verses="1Peter 2:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span>. Paul had much to say about grace, but he never wrote a word like we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101172" data-verses="1Peter 2:19-20">2:19 and 20</span>. Peter’s word here is unique. As we have seen, the grace spoken of in these verses is actually the processed Triune God, who is now the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit for our experience and enjoyment. Inwardly He motivates us, and outwardly He is the expression upon us. As such a One, He becomes sweet, lovely, gracious, and acceptable. This is grace. How great this is! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fWYB7XX4w1MoL-aENuz7U9fX-toVfKFbDk4MQtEZZOLkMNraM6pCPQKufeaBQvtYF">CALLED TO SUFFER UNJUSTLY</h2><p data-content-id="IpC8Qktp-F7rbZFY08GkGOG4JBcY0faVgMa7_Ylk3wu7vg1gEFxB-6mfu-zbWYKVc"> Based upon what he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101173" data-verses="1Peter 2:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span>, Peter goes on to say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101174" data-verses="1Peter 2:21">verse 21</span>, “For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps.” Christ’s living on earth was a model of this grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="HSvfk3GMDRLsoD7QTqaApKYUA-ESnT6Cr7MfFOcc6y1f4UZlI9WNALkrSPDz5oi4Q"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101175" data-verses="1Peter 2:21">Verse 21</span> opens with the words, “For to this you were called.” Have you ever thought that you were called to suffer unjustly? The word “this” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101176" data-verses="1Peter 2:21">verse 21</span> refers to the unjust sufferings, the suffering for doing good, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101177" data-verses="1Peter 2:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span>. We would be happy to hear that we have been called to the kingdom and to God’s glory. These are marvelous things. But probably very few of us, whether young or old, have realized from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101178" data-verses="1Peter 2:21">verse 21</span> that we have been called to suffer unjust treatment. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlzdwAG6JUiZ9Y8QvU82vVLFQkPEoHVdXtO49bCDdKbvgGKpNmdPYoDEvzpKUnEa0"> As the context indicates, some of the believers to whom this Epistle was written were called to suffer unjustly under crooked masters. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101179" data-verses="1Peter 2:18">verse 18</span> Peter says, “The household servants, subject yourselves in all fear to your masters, not only to the good and forbearing, but also to the crooked.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101180" data-verses="1Peter 2:19">verse 19</span> Peter continues, “For this is grace, if anyone because <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> of conscience toward God bears sorrows, suffering unjustly.” As we have pointed out, conscience toward God means consciousness of God—the consciousness of our relation to God. This consciousness indicates that we are living in intimate fellowship with God and that we are keeping a conscience toward God that is good and also pure (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101181" data-verses="1Peter 3:16">3:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101182" data-verses="1Timothy 1:5">1 Tim. 1:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101183" data-verses="1Timothy 1:19">19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101184" data-verses="1Timothy 3:9">3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101185" data-verses="2Timothy 1:3">2 Tim. 1:3</span>). Deep within us, there is a consciousness before God, and this consciousness regulates and guides us. If anyone bears sorrows, suffering unjustly, because of this inward consciousness, this is grace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101186" data-verses="1Peter 2:20">Verse 20</span> is very similar in content to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101187" data-verses="1Peter 2:19">verse 19</span>: “For what credit is it if sinning and being buffeted you shall endure it? But if doing good and suffering you shall endure, this is grace with God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="knfsL5a82WUv_5LdqzY4eB_cKOfqbtm8t2JYykBfWCQWK4guAqyA60qeyB17Qxkmi"> Now we see that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101188" data-verses="1Peter 2:21">verse 21</span> indicates that we have been called to this. We have been called to enjoy grace and to express God, as described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101189" data-verses="1Peter 2:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span>. This means that we have been called to suffering so that in it we may have the enjoyment of God as grace and express Him. Whatever the circumstances may be, God is our grace, our inner enjoyment. This God is our grace. This enjoyment motivates us and then becomes our outward expression, an expression visible to others. Those who observe this grace expressed from within us will be able to see something attractive on our face, in our attitude, or in the atmosphere around us. They will feel that what they see expressed is pleasant and acceptable. As we have pointed out again and again, this is grace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="J9jHTayOBt5hilCvGvbDHaayMSrfdmR7k1OAM7w8d8qw30j6U-mQvl_Z5o5llU6Yw">SPIRITUAL XEROXING</h2><p data-content-id="ztuFLZIElnoCUA6_fxiMtGq9DNipXsD2cHD9rxUKqRCJm7AHp0J5q55RI8R8if_BJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101190" data-verses="1Peter 2:21">Verse 21</span> clearly says that we have been called to suffer unjustly because Christ suffered on our behalf and left us a model so that we should follow in His steps. Actually, I do not like the word “model,” because it has been spoiled by common usage. Literally, the Greek word means a writing-copy, an under-writing for students to use in tracing letters as they learn to draw them. In ancient times teachers would write letters on writing material, and those letters became a master copy. Another piece of writing material was put upon the master copy. Then the children would practice writing by tracing the letters from the master copy onto their copy. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> Greek word for “model” is the word that denotes such a master copy used in the teaching of writing. The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing for us to copy by tracing and following His steps. </p>

<p data-content-id="3Sfgt49N4yqnUk9Ymhzai--1cj0mkWuJSUKY6facN-ragmCO58awdH5H1zP2HCGtX"> In the previous message we considered what it means for Christ to be our model.

Consider how many mistakes you make in one day because of the things you say. Because we in ourselves cannot be without guile, Peter specifically says that no guile was found in the Lord’s mouth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ck7ZHbdqM24QGnW7JL0wBUosUgZEfRN1X9kzGHSV3YY4pgJDsbMgZhhrhLbkg96gz">A LIFE UNDER GOD’S GOVERNMENT</h2><p data-content-id="Y1KxaLRh8hx0MgtFrlaDNr3aUTNeisssEy3Istv7kjGteO8_iFmxZwHWdjP2Mm1f_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101198" data-verses="1Peter 2:23">verse 23</span> Peter goes on to say concerning the Lord, “Who being reviled did not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten, but kept committing all to Him who judges righteously.” According to the usage of the verb “kept committing” in Greek, “all” needs to be inserted here as its object. This word refers to all the sufferings of the Lord. He kept committing all the insults He suffered and all His injuries to Him who judges righteously in His government, to the righteous God, to whom He submitted Himself. This indicates that the Lord recognized God’s government while He was living a human life on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="SqEusd6atnyDbypEbKrNMKQvtrBWQP18AgU-DN0LQXDMxLcoM7EJr-9aaH1dofMTI"> I am somewhat concerned that in your reading of this verse you may not pay attention to the word “judges.” We are <span class="pg" data-page-id="186" id="186">[186]</span> accustomed to saying that we commit things to the Lord who is faithful or merciful or kind. Have you ever said, “I commit everything to God who judges righteously”? I do not think that many of us have had this practice. The reason we do not pray like this is that our prayer, expression, and utterance are still too traditional. This keeps us from applying many of the thoughts and utterances in the pure Word. Therefore, in reading a verse such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101199" data-verses="1Peter 2:23">2:23</span>, we may take it for granted and fail to get into the real meaning. </p>
<p data-content-id="gZwyu9ibox3tnMS0ktyLXzWYQv4ozM7LG8DpYO9SArBZrzjgfEF0yr92qj6BUZ4e_"> While the Lord Jesus was on earth suffering, He kept committing all to the One who judges righteously. This brief word indicates not only that the Lord lived a life that was a model for us, but also that He lived a life absolutely under God’s government. He Himself was always under the government of God, and He committed everything related to Him to God’s judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="exrMvHGeCNp1XkMlEOO4nrllXph9XK8dH9YSPQYcDdaKGjk_ixywap2hEvgBMaiKf"> Peter has already referred to God’s judgment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101200" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">1:17</span>: “And if you call upon as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear.” Here Peter “is not speaking of the final judgment of the soul. In that sense ‘the Father does not judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son’ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101201" data-verses="John 5:22">John 5:22</span>). The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God’s government in this world, exercised with regard to His children. Accordingly it says, ‘The time of your sojourning’ here” (Darby). This is God’s judgment on His own household. </p>
<p data-content-id="5h0shcinDUdsRuymjaayLaq2iMOGNoBuJg8lMKkk1Act3b5nn7gt98cprGdFLWXju"> Since these two Epistles are concerned with the government of God, the judgment of God and of the Lord is referred to repeatedly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101202" data-verses="1Peter 2:23">2:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101203" data-verses="1Peter 4:5-6">4:5-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101204" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101205" data-verses="2Peter 2:3-4">2 Pet. 2:3-4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101206" data-verses="2Peter 2:9">9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101207" data-verses="2Peter 3:7">3:7</span>), as one of the essential items. It began from the angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101208" data-verses="2Peter 2:3-4">2 Pet. 2:3-4</span>), and passed through the generations of man in the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101209" data-verses="2Peter 2:5-9">2 Pet. 2:5-9</span>). Then in the New Testament age it begins from the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101210" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">1 Pet. 1:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101211" data-verses="1Peter 2:23">2:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101212" data-verses="1Peter 4:6">4:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101213" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">17</span>) and continues until the coming of the day of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101214" data-verses="2Peter 3:10">2 Pet. 3:10</span>), which will be a day of judgment on the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles before the millennium. After the millennium, all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and perish (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101215" data-verses="1Peter 4:5">1 Pet. 4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101216" data-verses="2Peter 3:7">2 Pet. 3:7</span>), and the heavens and the earth will be burned up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101217" data-verses="2Peter 3:10">2 Pet. 3:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101218" data-verses="2Peter 3:12">12</span>). The results of the varied <span class="pg" data-page-id="187" id="187">[187]</span> judgments are not the same. Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition. However, by all these judgments, the Lord God will clear up and purify the entire universe so that He may have a new heaven and a new earth for a new universe filled with His righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101219" data-verses="2Peter 3:13">2 Pet. 3:13</span>) for His delight. </p>

This means that He governs in a righteous way. Christ put His trust in this righteous One. For this reason, Peter says that when Christ was on earth, He kept committing all to God the Father, who judges righteously. </p>

As our Savior, Christ “carried up our sins in His body onto the tree.” The “tree” is the cross made of wood, a Roman instrument of capital punishment for the execution of malefactors, as prophesied in the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101222" data-verses="Deuteronomy 21:23">Deut. 21:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101223" data-verses="Galatians 3:13">Gal. 3:13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UGOJeVq0WoHbHsqfi5JwP4fubwYxn6WJqN9F77dkanazjb4Zy4jHAGGwqvdH_fvg_"> Literally, “having died to sins” means being away from sins; hence, having died to them.

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101231" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>, the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent, and the serpent would bruise the heel of the woman’s seed. The bruising in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101232" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> is related to the bruise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101233" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">2:24</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="VHdJY_o_fao3kO2JrDGWs_GaVzsGXYPC66Se0kl9tbbJLjl5GwFFUJbqKAGXhNLx1"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101234" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">verse 24</span>, we have been healed by Christ’s bruise. This is the healing of death. We were dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101235" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Eph. 2:1</span>), but Christ’s suffering of death healed our death so that we may live in His resurrection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> </p>

When Christ carried up our sins onto the cross and died, that death accomplished many things. The death of Christ terminated us, and this termination can keep us away from sin. The best way for people to be kept from sins or from sin is for them to be put to death. No matter how many sins a person may commit, once he has died, death separates him from sins. Peter speaks of being away from sins; Paul speaks of the one who has died being free from sin. Through Christ’s death we can be kept away from sins so that we may live to righteousness. Apparently, being kept away from sin terminates us; actually, it enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="9dayeuFKDQTWPTGOkzti5VPn5u89xheuXp9KuyPSiQwJYmmIZqVDLa1EEdUTWmQ2K"> As we have pointed out, by Christ’s bruise we have been healed. This means that His death heals our death. </p>
<p data-content-id="jUvRomvb09osk353DoIhpMqe9sKPMTm170Q1d3WqqewTMoeFT3ZqxDgmd3WoehIm2"> Most of us are accustomed to Paul’s terms, but we are not familiar with many of Peter’s expressions. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101236" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">verse 24</span> alone, Peter uses a number of unusual expressions: the carrying up of our sins in Christ’s body onto the tree, being away from sin to live to righteousness, and being healed by Christ’s bruise. Christians do not use many of Peter’s expressions in conversation. I hope that after reading these messages, you will begin to use Peter’s terms and expressions in your fellowship and prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKuLK-iN4WWAXWP5KjHT9CqtZIUP3AuZ1mGsG8GNPe630UNpfCxCz71m3bOKKJcjL"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101237" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">Verse 24</span> indicates that, as fallen human beings, we were dead and full of sins. But Christ put our sins upon Himself and carried them up onto the tree, the cross, where He suffered God’s righteous judgment for all our sins. Christ’s death on the cross was a bruise, and that bruise, that death, has healed our death. Now we have become alive. On the one hand, Christ’s bruise that heals us keeps us away from sins through His death; on the other hand, this healing enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness. </p>

Christ is the grace within us, and He is the model for our spiritual direction. Furthermore, Christ is also our Savior, Shepherd, and Overseer. He saves us, He shepherds us, and He cares for us, thus accomplishing a threefold work concerning us. We all need this gracious, threefold work of Christ for us. We need His saving, shepherding, and overseeing. </p>
<p data-content-id="hxMBDypTTZrlXu74HtrBsOo2xDmU7Ogm0XNLbZECSYiOVkeYnRerhlESfi0ONqauL"> Peter did not write this Epistle merely according to the knowledge of doctrine, but according to his rich experiences of Christ. Peter experienced Christ as grace, as the model, and as the Savior, Shepherd, and Overseer. He experienced the motivation of the divine life within him and its expression in his living becoming something gracious and acceptable in the sight of both God and man. As we have pointed out, when others see such an expression in our living, they may say, “This is grace. This is something worthy of thanksgiving to God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="UGOJeVq0WoHbHsqfi5JwP4fubwoxvpGJqN9F77dkanazjb4Zy4jHAGGwqvdH_fvg_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101257" data-verses="1Peter 2:21">2:21</span> Peter says, “For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps.” The very Christ who is the grace within us has become a model, a master copy, the original copy, to be used in the process of spiritual xeroxing. As we have pointed out, through this process, we become a reproduction of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="XlzdwAG6JUiZ9Y8QvU82vVLFQkvEoFVdXtO49bCDdKbvgGKpNmdPYoDEvzpKUnEa0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101258" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">2:24</span> we have a picture of Christ as our Savior, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101259" data-verses="1Peter 2:25">verse 25</span> Peter says, “For you were as sheep being led astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.” Christ died to sins so that we might live to righteousness, that is, live rightly under the government of God. Furthermore, through Christ’s bruise, a suffering that resulted in death, we have been healed of our death, so that we may live in His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="knfsL5a82WUv_5LdqzY4eB_cKO_qbvm8t2JYykBfWCQWK4guAqyA60qeyB17Qxkmi"> Now we have Christ as the Shepherd and Overseer caring for our souls. Christ’s shepherding does not mainly take care of our body or our spirit; it primarily takes care of our soul. However, as the Shepherd and Overseer, Christ takes care of us from within our spirit. He does not shepherd us or oversee us from the heavens. Today our Shepherd and Overseer is in our spirit, indwelling us as the life-giving Spirit. His shepherding and overseeing begin from our spirit and then spread to every part of our soul. This means that from our spirit Christ reaches the parts of our soul—the mind, emotion, and will—and takes care of all our problems, needs, and wounds. How wonderful! This is our Christ! </p>

What makes this chapter difficult to understand is Peter’s word concerning Christ making a proclamation to the spirits in prison (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101261" data-verses="1Peter 3:19-20">vv. 19-20</span>) and his word concerning baptism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101262" data-verses="1Peter 3:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>). Throughout the centuries, there has been much debate over what Peter says in this chapter concerning these two matters. The debate continues to this day, for it seems that the problems of interpretation have not been solved. Furthermore, both matters are very deep. </p>

We know that Paul has much to say regarding the all-inclusive death of Christ. But there is at least one aspect of Christ’s death that Paul does not cover in his Epistles. This does not mean that Paul did not know of this aspect. I would not presume to say this of Paul, for he received a complete, universal revelation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="197" id="197">[197]</span> He knew the things on earth, and according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101264" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:1">2 Corinthians 12</span>, he was taken to the third heaven and also to Hades, to Paradise. Therefore, Paul had a full view of the three sections of the universe—heaven, earth, and the region under the earth. But for some reason he does not mention in his writings the matter of Christ’s making a proclamation to the spirits in prison. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101273" data-verses="1Peter 3:1-7">3:1-7</span> Peter is concerned with marriage life, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101274" data-verses="1Peter 3:8-13">3:8-13</span>, with common life. </p>
<p data-content-id="0AIT5_8dHoujFZpQ-fTe4fDNdUCG4R6MiND9JsLc3RqCn7l9pkXE0ElJ0Dz4UaOUu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101275" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> Paul gives a word concerning married life that is familiar to every reader of the New Testament. But Peter’s writing concerning married life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101276" data-verses="1Peter 3:1-7">3:1-7</span> also has some very good points, even the topmost point. The most outstanding point is what Peter says about a husband and wife being “joint-heirs of the grace of life.” Paul does not say anything about the grace of life, much less about a married couple being joint-heirs, or co-heirs, of the grace of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101277" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">3:7</span> Peter says, “The husbands, in like manner, dwelling together with them according to knowledge, assigning honor as to the weaker, female vessel, as also joint-heirs of the grace of life, <span class="pg" data-page-id="198" id="198">[198]</span> that your prayers may not be hindered.” Peter wanted the husbands and wives to realize that they are heirs together, not of property or material possessions, but of the grace of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="79Rbiepb8tG2mJw_fYlOxaEZ2efrKCkSUXoR2kFUSEhHP7v1r0wjh6a6HPSVKIIDo"> Perhaps you have been a Christian for many years and yet do not have any understanding of what Peter means by the grace of life. Some may not even know that there is such an expression in the New Testament. Christians are familiar with the grace of salvation or the grace of forgiveness. Actually, it is not even necessary for us to read the Bible in order to have the concept of the grace of forgiveness. But the term, the grace of life, is a uniquely biblical expression. The problem is that, when we read about this, our mind may be veiled, or we may not pay adequate attention to this term. By the Lord’s mercy, we would place a proper emphasis on this matter so that we may all appreciate it. I hope that we all shall see the wonderful matter of the grace of life. The grace of life is something real and substantial that we can inherit. This is not merely unmerited favor; it is solid, substantial, spiritual property that can be inherited by a husband and wife. Hallelujah for the grace of life! </p>
<p data-content-id="_vU1T0qIaILjGjSpxcRXGjyM-UurBlYrEGwb4rWavw8dBzOTFLExVgceODNrcAuF-"> We have pointed out that in this Epistle Peter has much to say about grace. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101278" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span> he says, “Grace to you and peace be multiplied.” Peter desired not only that grace be with the saints, but that grace be multiplied to them. With the thought of multiplied grace as the base, Peter goes on in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101279" data-verses="1Peter 4:10">4:10</span> to speak of varied grace: “Each one according as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.” We all should be good stewards of this varied grace in different aspects and of different categories. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101280" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">5:10</span> Peter speaks of the God of all grace. Therefore, in 1 Peter we have four unique expressions concerning grace: multiplied grace, grace of life, varied grace, and all grace. Although Paul has a great deal to say concerning grace, he does not use the unique expressions Peter uses in his first Epistle. I deeply appreciate what Peter says in this book concerning grace, in particular his word regarding the grace of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="199" id="199">[199]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="TKuLK-iN4WWAXWP5KjHT9CqtZI0PzTOZ1mGsG8GNPe630UNpfCxCz71m3bOKKJcjL"> In the previous message we considered <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101313" data-verses="1Peter 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>, Peter’s word to the wives concerning married life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101314" data-verses="1Peter 3:1">verse 1</span> Peter indicates that, as household servants are subject to their masters, so the wives should be subject to their own husbands. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101315" data-verses="1Peter 3:3-4">verses 3 and 4</span> Peter points out that what is costly in the sight of God is the adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is the hidden man of the heart. Let us now go on to consider Peter’s word to husbands. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nTLlhVRI0WZJKFKDQRic6_gB41q56tcTSAl5BEvl5rADl5CES_D0WV0ObUJL8h77e">A BALANCING WORD</h2><p data-content-id="6QMYacwK02nthQCoF0URhKVkSR4fPLywiASTsylVaVYoGxKhSC8NjvEvyvfi8NIox"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101316" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">Verse 7</span> says, “The husbands, in like manner, dwelling together with them according to knowledge, assigning honor as to the weaker, female vessel, as also joint-heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.” Peter’s word to husbands is quite different from Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101317" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101318" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">Colossians 3</span>. Peter uses the phrase “in like manner,” a phrase that has bothered me. This phrase seems to indicate that as servants are subject to their masters, and wives to their husbands, so the husbands, in like manner, should be subject to their wives. I believe that Peter intends this phrase to mean that not only are wives to be in subjection to their husbands, but also husbands to their wives. (As we shall see, Peter’s word about husbands honoring their wives implies at least a certain amount of subjection to them.) </p>
<p data-content-id="R3V846PAgL9uUXzkIwWb8W3iuQah8mrIBG2lbvy4b6AK6lLFmxs9AW8X9SmI49ucm"> Some may think that saying that husbands are to be subject to their wives contradicts the word that wives should subject themselves to their husbands. Actually, as we shall see, this is not at all a matter of contradiction; it is a matter of <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> balance. Neither Peter nor Paul says clearly that husbands should be subject to their wives. But Peter says that husbands should honor their wives, and Paul, that husbands should love their wives. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101319" data-verses="Ephesians 5:21">Ephesians 5:21</span> Paul says, “Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.” This seems to indicate that a husband and wife are to be subject to each other. </p>
<p data-content-id="Mgl6dTDv_IZtBSmxxJmUqu6hLF5GUmqjvOS_OerSIuoQIZbGtUoUj4768EFrPfiof"> The Bible is much wiser than we are. In particular, it is wiser than those who say they are concerned about human rights. The Bible is full of wisdom, for it always keeps things balanced. </p>
<p data-content-id="VHdJY_o_fao3kO2JrDGWs_GaVzMGXaPC66Se0kl9tbbJLjl5GwFFUJbqKAGXhNLx1"> What Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101320" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">verse 7</span> is a balance to what he says in the preceding six verses. Regarding married life, it would be pitiful to have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101321" data-verses="1Peter 3:1-6">verses 1 through 6</span> without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101322" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">verse 7</span>. That may cause some to think that the females should be slaves of the males. But if we read the book of Genesis, we shall see that Abraham highly appreciated his wife, Sarah. Yes, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101323" data-verses="1Peter 3:6">3:6</span> Sarah did call Abraham lord. However, she did not say this directly to him. Rather, this word was uttered before the Lord. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101324" data-verses="Genesis 18:12">Genesis 18:12</span> says, “Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?” This word was not spoken directly to Abraham. There is no record in Genesis that Sarah ever called Abraham lord directly. </p>
<p data-content-id="i09bSPXZl4pb4qG7jIxCesIShzSEI94qwm3w4KlfUlb27jT2DLMWjKNNKX1xwzylW"> The proper practice between husbands and wives is that the wife should respect her husband as lord and subject herself to him, but the husband should not assume the position as being the lord over his wife. This means that a husband should not say, “Don’t you know that I am your lord? Even you yourself recognize me as lord.” It is wrong for a husband to have this attitude or to speak this way. Peter’s word is balanced. When he speaks concerning the husbands, he indicates by the phrase “in like manner” that the husbands should subject themselves to their wives. </p>
<p data-content-id="1u4RHjJZsxtkegHo76dgMe-A6eDvBmVr-4BAdiflaL9E0PcxKuctHr8dFnVeaZrqv"> Some readers of this book may think that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101325" data-verses="1Peter 3:1-7">3:1-7</span> we have two extremes. They may think that the first extreme is Peter’s word about wives being in subjection to their husbands, and the second, the indication that, in like manner, the husbands should be in subjection to their wives. Actually, <span class="pg" data-page-id="207" id="207">[207]</span> what we have here is a word of balance. If our married life is to be balanced, we need to have two poles, or, if you prefer to say it this way, two extremes. One pole should be the wife’s subjection to the husband, and the other pole, the husband’s subjection to the wife. If we have these two poles in our married life, we shall be balanced, and we shall live our married life in a “temperate zone.” I enjoy living in a place where the climate is temperate, neither too hot nor too cold. The “climate” of our married life should also be temperate, moderate. In order to have such a climate, we need the two poles indicated clearly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101326" data-verses="1Peter 3:1">3:1</span> and implied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101327" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">3:7</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9dayeuFKDQTWPTGOkzti5VPn5uc9yg-uXp9KuyPSiQwJYmmIZqVDLa1EEdUTWmQ2K">DWELLING TOGETHER ACCORDING TO KNOWLEDGE</h2><p data-content-id="jUvRomvb09osk353DoIhpMqe9sqPPSG170Q1d3WqqewTMoeFT3ZqxDgmd3WoehIm2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101328" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">verse 7</span> Peter says that the husbands should dwell together with their wives according to knowledge. The phrase “according to knowledge” can easily be misinterpreted. Men who have more knowledge or education than their wives may fail to respect their wives. Peter is not referring to the knowledge of human education. For a husband to dwell together with his wife according to knowledge is to live with her in an intelligent and reasonable way. It is to be governed by spiritual knowledge that recognizes the nature of the marriage relationship and the weakness of the female, not governed by any passion or emotion. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKuLK-iN4WWAXWP5KjHT9CqtZI0P0AOZ1mGsG8GNPe630UNpfCxCz71m3bOKKJcjL"> Husbands, your relationship with your wife should be governed by spiritual knowledge; it should not be governed by the knowledge you have gained through your college education. Spiritual knowledge recognizes the nature of the marriage relationship. In married life, husbands need to have a spiritual knowledge that recognizes the weakness of the female. If we have this knowledge, we shall know that God created woman the weaker vessel simply for the nature of the marriage relationship. If there is to be a proper marriage relationship, both parties should not be equally strong. One party should be stronger than the other. Therefore, the brothers should not think that the weakness of their wives is something to be despised. No, we must realize that our wives’ weakness was created by God specifically for the purpose of the marriage relationship. Therefore, we need to understand <span class="pg" data-page-id="208" id="208">[208]</span> the reason for the weakness of the female, and we need to understand the nature of the marriage relationship. This is to have our married life governed not by the knowledge from human education but by spiritual knowledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="nTLlhVRI0WZJKFKDQRic6_gB41q58-MTSAl5BEvl5rADl5CES_D0WV0ObUJL8h77e"> A husband’s relationship with his wife is certainly not to be governed by any passion or emotion. This means that in married life a husband should be governed neither by worldly knowledge nor by fleshly emotion. Instead, he must be governed by spiritual knowledge that recognizes that the weakness of the female was designed by God to fit in with the nature of the marriage relationship. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6QMYacwK02nthQCoF0URhKVkSR4fGbSwiASTsylVaVYoGxKhSC8NjvEvyvfi8NIox">ASSIGNING HONOR</h2><p data-content-id="R3V846PAgL9uUXzkIwWb8W3iuQah02bIBG2lbvy4b6AK6lLFmxs9AW8X9SmI49ucm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101329" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">verse 7</span> Peter also says that the husbands should assign honor to their wives as to the weaker, female vessel. The Greek word rendered “assigning,” <em>aponemo,</em> means to apportion, to portion out; hence, to assign to. The Greek word for honor is <em>time</em> and means preciousness, valuable worth. The husbands should appreciate the preciousness, the valuable worth, of the wives, and apportion it, assign it, as honor to them duly and reasonably as to the weaker, female vessel. </p>
<p data-content-id="sIQHD11fFkBgeJsmlyCwB3XM48wH5xHmIZYofsu39phMs8US-jBXoedz9GzFfHq3r"> Man, including woman, was made a vessel to contain God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101330" data-verses="Romans 9:21">Rom. 9:21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101331" data-verses="Romans 9:23">23</span>), and believers in Christ are vessels to contain Christ as the treasure (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101332" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:7">2 Cor. 4:7</span>). The female, according to nature in God’s creation, is weaker than the male physically and psychologically. Although the wives, as female vessels, are weaker, they are still vessels of the Lord and can be vessels unto honor (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101333" data-verses="2Timothy 2:21">2 Tim. 2:21</span>), deserving a certain honor. </p>
<p data-content-id="wS3VSJbLtNnxowR0q44PBRyoDVu961Qpz3ls5mcZOlL1-HI2Ou_soTzIbNTEhoHct"> Peter tells the husbands to assign honor to their wives. A husband must give at least a certain measure of honor to his wife. If we see that a husband should honor his wife, we should realize that this implies some kind of submission to her. Submission always goes with honor. If you do not submit to a particular person, how can you honor that one? This would be impossible. Honoring someone always implies a certain degree of submission. As we have already pointed out, this is a word of balance. Husbands must honor their wives, and, no doubt, the wives must also honor their husbands. <span class="pg" data-page-id="209" id="209">[209]</span> </p>

Therefore, in suffering persecution we should show others that we have Christ within us as Lord. This is to sanctify Him, to separate Him, from the false gods, not degrading Him to be as the lifeless idols. </p>
<p data-content-id="-bV22nWH_FbItmzO6YVHsZY6HCM4ndcr7lvRKtpbd8TOAsIX6A2XE9BWdzvsz9lXK"> The hope spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101354" data-verses="1Peter 3:15">verse 15</span> is the living hope of the inheritance of eternal life.

The fear mentioned by Peter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101355" data-verses="1Peter 3:15">verse 15</span> is a pious fear, a holy fear. Peter speaks of fear a number of times in this Epistle <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> because the teaching of this book concerns the government of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8dbAM2uvWzOhfr7QeOD8nkNCS9KlsR0v9TFJfIT1G5QGwvPJ2fRWuwDHx406-YT4x"> In sufferings that come from opposition and persecution, we should sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts. The word “sanctify” in Greek means to set apart, to separate from things that are common. This is to make something particular and even outstanding. In our suffering of persecution, we should make Christ particular; we should show that He is magnificent, absolutely different from idols. Sanctifying Christ as Lord in our hearts is not a matter of outward activity to set Him apart from what is common. It is an inward matter. To sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts means that when we are under persecution, we have the Lord in our hearts. If we allow the Lord to be the Lord in our hearts when we suffer persecution, we shall express Him. This expression spontaneously will sanctify Christ and set Him apart from idols. </p>

What a shame that would be to Him! It will appear as if we do not have the Lord in our hearts. Whenever we suffer persecution, others must realize that we have Christ within us as Lord. But if we are timid and fearful, others will think that we do not have anything within us. They will have the impression that we do not have the living Lord in us. But if we are bold, sanctifying the Lord in our hearts and expressing Him in our faces, others will realize that we do have something within us. This is to sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts. </p>

This particular incident took place in Peking. Because of the Boxer movement, all the businesses in the city were closed. A young man who was learning a certain business did not dare to open the door of the building where he was. Peeking through a crack in the door, he saw the Boxers parading down the street. He heard the crying and shouting. He saw some of the Boxers, with swords in their hands, threatening a young woman. She was a Christian. She was sitting in a wagon that was carrying her to the place where <span class="pg" data-page-id="215" id="215">[215]</span> she would be martyred. Although the Boxers surrounded her, shouting, crying, and threatening, she was not afraid. Her face was glowing, and she was rejoicing in the Lord and praising Him. That young man was deeply impressed by what he saw. An unbeliever at the time, he decided then that he would learn about the Christian faith. He thought to himself, “If this is nothing more than a Western religion, why is this young woman not frightened by the threatening and the shouting? Why is she not afraid of death? Why is her face glowing, and why is she rejoicing?” This young man did not then realize that she was praising the Lord. Later he believed in the Lord and became a preacher. Long after that, when he became old, I met him in my home town, and we enjoyed a pleasant conversation. He told me the story of what he experienced that day in Peking. </p>
<p data-content-id="_vU1T0qIaILjGjSpxcRXGjyM-VOrCl4rEGwb4rWavw8dBzOTFLExVgceODNrcAuF-"> That young woman who was martyred during the Boxer Rebellion truly sanctified Christ as Lord in her heart. The glow on her face, the rejoicing, the praising—all this was an expression that the Lord was in her heart. Spontaneously, she sanctified Christ as Lord. Her sanctifying Christ in this way influenced that young man to believe in the Lord. </p>

<p data-content-id="rjTPLhTT8an5I7cUTTzmydgHBLExKKQXRg9lnBtbC--nVsKvp_fjOWL62w9JaapYK"> The Christian good manner of life should be one that is in Christ. It is a living, a daily life, in our spirit. This is higher than a life which is merely ethical and moral. </p>
<p data-content-id="dNl6tgRNGfx6EVOqeWt6MZmKzopSdIfUU4ldkBJC7GGgVM62D66Z7Aowb9mcgKl2v"> If we would have a good manner of life and sanctify the Lord in our daily life, we must take care of our conscience. It is not sufficient for us to be justified by others. We need to be justified by our own conscience. We should not be satisfied that we are justified by the community, by the brothers, or even by the entire church. No one knows us as thoroughly as our conscience does. This is especially true of the enlightened <span class="pg" data-page-id="216" id="216">[216]</span> conscience of the regenerated spirit. A renewed conscience enlightened by the indwelling Spirit is trustworthy in its testimony and accurate in its judgment. The judgment of our enlightened conscience is more accurate than someone else’s judgment of us. </p>
<p data-content-id="QfakavptTSx9tWovQHAybkDO4UPUHamQDY-JxCUP4mm7A_CcJcFvQFbMh0TJNMl0F"> The enlightened conscience of our regenerated spirit is an inner judge. This inner judge, our conscience, cooperates with the indwelling God. The reason the enlightened conscience of the regenerated spirit can be an inner judge is that it cooperates with the indwelling God. For this reason, the judgment of the enlightened conscience is thorough and accurate. Therefore, we must take care of our conscience. </p>
<p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7s-1U3gPmckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> A brother, for example, should take care of his conscience in his relationship with his wife. In the sight of man, it may appear that he is not wrong with his wife in any way. But his enlightened conscience may tell him that he has been wrong with her in many ways. Likewise, in the church life apparently we may be honest and faithful. However, our conscience may know that in certain things we have not been altogether honest and faithful to the church. Therefore, it is very important that we take care of our conscience. </p>

He covered this point earlier in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101360" data-verses="1Peter 2:18-21">2:18-21</span>, where he says that Christ is a model to us of One who suffered unjustly and that we should follow in His steps. </p>

<p data-content-id="IpC8Qktp-F7rbZFY08GkGOG4JAMYzMaVgMa7_Ylk3wu7vg1gEFxB-6mfu-zbWYKVc"> In the previous message we covered the matters of sanctifying Christ as Lord in our hearts, having a good conscience, Christ dying concerning sins, the righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, and Christ, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in spirit and going in His enlivened and empowered spirit to make a proclamation to the spirits in prison, to the rebellious angels. In this message we shall pay special attention to what Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101390" data-verses="1Peter 3:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> concerning baptism. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HSvfk3GMDRLsoD7QTqaApKYUA_UShAqCr7MfFOcc6y1f4UZlI9WNALkrSPDz5oi4Q">THE ARK AND THE WATER</h2><p data-content-id="XlzdwAG6JUiZ9Y8QvU82vVLFQlfEhX1dXtO49bCDdKbvgGKpNmdPYoDEvzpKUnEa0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101391" data-verses="1Peter 3:20">Verse 20</span> says, “To those once disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101392" data-verses="1Peter 3:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span>, Christ made a proclamation to “those once disobedient.” These disobedient ones are different from the eight souls spoken of in this verse. The disobedient ones are angelic beings, not human beings. </p>
<p data-content-id="knfsL5a82WUv_5LdqzY4eB_cKPPqT9W8t2JYykBfWCQWK4guAqyA60qeyB17Qxkmi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101393" data-verses="1Peter 3:20">verse 20</span> Peter says that in the ark prepared by Noah eight souls “were brought safely through by water.” The Greek means to “arrive safe into a place of security through difficulty or danger,” as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101394" data-verses="Acts 27:44">Acts 27:44</span> (Darby). The Greek words rendered “by water” literally mean through water. Water was the medium through which the saving was accomplished. The ark saved Noah and his family from God’s judgment, the destruction of the world by the flood. But the water saved them from the corrupted generation and <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> separated them unto a new age, just as the water of the Red Sea did to the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101395" data-verses="Exodus 14:22">Exo. 14:22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101396" data-verses="Exodus 14:29">29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101397" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1-2">1 Cor. 10:1-2</span>) and the water of baptism to the New Testament believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101398" data-verses="1Peter 3:21">1 Pet. 3:21</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="6QMYacwK02nthQCoF0URhKVkSQYfGZSwiASTsylVaVYoGxKhSC8NjvEvyvfi8NIox"> In the Old Testament the waters of the flood at the time of Noah and the waters of the Red Sea both typify baptism. The ark saved Noah and his family from God’s judgment, from the punishment of God’s condemnation that came by the flood. But the water saved them and separated them from that corrupted age and brought them into a new age to begin a new life on a new earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="R3V846PAgL9uUXzkIwWb8W3iuR6h00bIBG2lbvy4b6AK6lLFmxs9AW8X9SmI49ucm"> In the book of Exodus the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea. The waters of the Red Sea were a judgment upon Pharaoh and his Egyptian army. Pharaoh and his armies were drowned in that water of judgment. But that same water separated the children of Israel from Egypt, separated them from the corrupted world. As Noah and his family were separated from their corrupted generation by the waters of the flood, so the children of Israel were separated from the corrupted world, typified by Egypt, by the waters of the Red Sea. </p>
<p data-content-id="sIQHD11fFkBgeJsmlyCwB3XM49QH6xnmIZYofsu39phMs8US-jBXoedz9GzFfHq3r"> In the New Testament we also have water, the water of baptism. Baptism saves us from the world and separates us from it. </p>
<p data-content-id="wS3VSJbLtNnxowR0q44PBRyoDUO951wpz3ls5mcZOlL1-HI2Ou_soTzIbNTEhoHct"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101399" data-verses="1Peter 3:21">verse 21</span> Peter says, “Which figure also now saves you, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” As we shall see, this verse does not teach baptismal salvation. Therefore, we do not hold the belief that the waters of baptism put away the filth of the flesh. But, according to this verse, baptism is the appeal of a good conscience unto God. </p>
<p data-content-id="LEaEZEVlbby5jrDyOPbM6R6sKZ0K_GLiYgQjzgvFr4_C9_bVvJACZ0AXcCqEVMbI5"> The words “which figure” refer to water in the preceding verse, which is a figure of the water of baptism. This indicates that Noah and his family’s being in the ark and passing through the flood was a type of our going through baptism. The water of the flood delivered them out of the old manner of life into a new environment. In like manner, the water of baptism delivers us out of the inherited vain manner of life <span class="pg" data-page-id="223" id="223">[223]</span> into a manner of life in resurrection. This is the main emphasis of this book. Christ’s redemption for us was for this (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101400" data-verses="1Peter 1:18-19">1:18-19</span>). This was accomplished by His death and accepted and applied to us in baptism by the Spirit through His resurrection. Now our daily walk should be in the Spirit of the resurrected Christ, a walk that lives Christ in resurrection through the life power of His Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101401" data-verses="Romans 6:4-5">Rom. 6:4-5</span>). This is a new and excellent manner of life that glorifies God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101402" data-verses="1Peter 2:12">1 Pet. 2:12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="muFVkpXJoJnc0dsDO0S9EVshBEdJLK9IBNIQfmY9uCiT9k_fZIRoMYXsNsCmWVvlw"> Baptism itself does not and cannot put away the filth of our flesh—the dirt of our fallen nature and defilement of fleshly lust. The erroneous teaching concerning baptismal salvation based upon this verse and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101403" data-verses="Mark 16:16">Mark 16:16</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101404" data-verses="Acts 22:16">Acts 22:16</span> is corrected here. Baptism is only a figure. Its reality is Christ in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, who applies to us all that Christ has passed through in His crucifixion and resurrection, making these things real in our daily life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZcaaVHTVCgvGIROFjCd-BQVV8wtBlisz4vwu4bpiV0zCG8Fh4RpvKatN3QN0zME-K">THE APPEAL OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE</h2><p data-content-id="Ax-XoUmXRGuNtjUgn0zaCf8sDfwKgaY_bx2QVWud5sj4sJ3E4W0PzhghSZKkIgXk6"> The Greek word rendered “appeal” is <em>eperotema,</em> a question, an inquiry. Its meaning is very much disputed. The right meaning of the phrase seems to be, as Alford said, “the seeking after God of a good and pure conscience,” which governs the proper Christian life. This kind of question, asking for something, may be considered an appeal or demand. Peter’s thought here may be that baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized one for a good conscience unto God. Baptism, as a symbol, a counterpart of our belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, testifies that all the problems we have before God and with God have been solved. Hence, it is also a testimony, witnessing that in our conscience there is no more offense, but rather we are full of peace and confidence that we have been baptized into the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101405" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>) and organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life. Without the Spirit of Christ as its reality, baptism by water immediately becomes an empty and dead ritual. </p>
<p data-content-id="FVdXhiOjWCOU2MQIGN_E1FaCdktZoUl3AER3V25JpQzvWurx6wgDQNFCSNGqcdCkN"> In this verse we see that baptism is first our appeal, the appeal of the baptized ones, to God for a conscience that is <span class="pg" data-page-id="224" id="224">[224]</span> both good and pure. A proper baptism will always bring the baptized one into such a situation. Before we believed in the Lord and were baptized, we were sinners. But when we were enlightened through the preaching of the gospel, we came to realize that we are very sinful. Both before God and toward man we have had many transgressions, trespasses, and offenses, and we had a great deal of guilt. Then we repented, believed in the Lord, received His forgiveness, and were saved. But our repentance and believing need an outward expression. This expression is baptism. Therefore, baptism and our believing, our faith, are two aspects of one thing. For this reason the New Testament speaks of believing and being baptized (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101406" data-verses="Mark 16:16">Mark 16:16</span>). Believing and being baptized can be compared to using our two feet to take a single step. First we believe, and our believing can be compared to the half-step forward of one foot. Then we are baptized. Our baptism can be compared to the completion of the step with the other foot. Together, believing and baptism make one complete step. </p>
<p data-content-id="CqM6w5pYHgbjWvf7luLWug9zHAmJdhzuhdAv8tHckPQSzMQTKqDBZHhBtpVegg1bt"> As we have pointed out elsewhere, believing is our reflection of all that Christ has accomplished. First, what Christ has accomplished for our salvation is preached to us as the gospel. As we listen to this preaching, the Spirit works upon us and within us to cause us to reflect what we have heard in the gospel, a reflection of what we have heard regarding Christ’s accomplishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="PsefQ1FZ6fc7Xp3AqPkSQInhgOANiTG28kOMitPscxA9jxQEoHmNCZnuSP1Cpudkc"> This experience of reflecting Christ’s accomplishment can be compared to taking a picture with a camera. A camera is focused on a certain scene, and then a reflection of the scene is impressed on the film. We may compare Christ’s accomplishments to a scene to be photographed with a camera. The proper preaching of the gospel brings the view of this “scenery” into us, and the Holy Spirit enlightens us. Then the scenery is imprinted on the “film” of our spirit. The result is that, from within, we believe in Christ. Therefore, in our being there is a reflection of Christ’s accomplishments, and this reflection is our believing in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="-bV22nWH_FbItmzO6YVHsZY6HCc4sPsr7lvRKtpbd8TOAsIX6A2XE9BWdzvsz9lXK"> We have pointed out that believing in Christ requires <span class="pg" data-page-id="225" id="225">[225]</span> an expression, and that this expression is baptism. Baptism, therefore, is the counterpart to our believing in Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="79Rbiepb8tG2mJw_fYlOxaEZ2ffrAQESUXoR2kFUSEhHP7v1r0wjh6a6HPSVKIIDo"> One main purpose of this book is to encourage and exhort the believers to follow the footsteps of Christ in their persecution (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101424" data-verses="1Peter 1:6-7">1:6-7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101425" data-verses="1Peter 2:18-25">2:18-25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101426" data-verses="1Peter 3:8-17">3:8-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101427" data-verses="1Peter 4:12-19">4:12-19</span>). They should have the same mind Christ had in His suffering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101428" data-verses="1Peter 3:18-22">3:18-22</span>). The main function of our mind is to understand and realize. To live a life that follows the footsteps of Christ, we need a renewed mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101429" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>) to understand and realize the way Christ lived to fulfill God’s purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="_vU1T0qIaILjGjSpxcRXGjyM-VurK3orEGwb4rWavw8dBzOTFLExVgceODNrcAuF-"> In our practical daily life, the strongest part of our being is our mind. Whatever we do in our living is directed by our mind. It is not the will but the mind that directs our life. All our activities are under the direction of our mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="QfakavptTSx9tWovQHAybkDO4UvUHYmQDY-JxCUP4mm7A_CcJcFvQFbMh0TJNMl0F"> Because the mind directs our living, the preaching of the Word must change a person’s thoughts. One goal of preaching and teaching is to change people’s mind. If we think in a certain way, we shall be directed in that way. But if we change our mind and think in another way, our living will then have a different direction. What we think governs what we do, say, and practice. For this reason, Peter charges the believers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101430" data-verses="1Peter 4:1">4:1</span> to arm themselves with the mind of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="230" id="230">[230]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7s-VU3iPmckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> To arm ourselves with the mind of Christ is to be armed with the thought and concept of Christ. This implies that we change our way of thinking. Many Christians think that as long as we love God and do His will, we shall be under His blessing, and we shall not suffer in any way. It is common for Christians to have the concept that those who love the Lord should not expect suffering. But consider the life of Christ. Did He not love God? Did He not do the will of God? Christ loved God to the uttermost, and He did God’s will fully and absolutely. But what happened to Him in His living? It seems that throughout His life on earth there was not any blessing, but only suffering. He was born into a poor family, a family not considered of a high class. Of course, that family was descended from David and so was of royal lineage. But when the Lord Jesus was born, that royal family was very poor economically. Furthermore, this family did not live in Jerusalem, but in the despised town of Nazareth in Galilee. Galilee can be compared to one of the poorer states in the United States, a state that cannot compare with other states that are wealthy and have a large population. The Lord Jesus lived in Nazareth for more than thirty years. At the beginning of His life, He was put into a manger, and at the end of His life, He was put on the cross. Where do we see God’s blessing in the life of the Lord? He endured suffering upon suffering. He did not have a good name, and He did not have a place to lay His head. This is the way the Lord Jesus lived when He was on earth. His life was a life of suffering. </p>
<p data-content-id="lstMWBRC66b7v6qyJcYqNzFIJdXfj3nmDBhzKVdlvVCbYUbTkcY3VpluEL-g0HaK4"> The concept that the Christian life is a life of suffering is versus the natural, religious mentality, especially the natural mentality of many Christians. A great many Christians think that as long as we belong to God, are the people of God, love God, and do God’s will, everything concerning us will be fine. According to this concept, we shall be blessed and may have a good job, a nice house, and an excellent family life. Christians who hold this concept may expect all their children to become well-educated, wealthy professionals. Some Christians who are successful and wealthy may say, “What blessings I have received from the Lord! All that I have and all that I have <span class="pg" data-page-id="231" id="231">[231]</span> attained is because I love the Lord Jesus and do the will of God. Look how God has blessed me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="OL9AaTfdcQNgWo6E__9gENXi9fUY5Hu_AtnWibxhvo9pWA2k7cDx1vl4hlJzNlNkh"> This concept of a Christian life is altogether contrary to Peter’s teaching in this Epistle. Peter knew that the more we love the Lord, the more we shall be deprived of things. He also knew that the more we do the will of God, the more trouble we may have. We may have trouble with our job, with our finances, and with our family life. When some hear this, they may say, “Brother Lee, don’t say these things. This kind of teaching will frighten Christians away.” This is the reason we all need to pay attention to Peter’s charge to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="43QATuPFb584gkeOZXNScxvOfbgJrm17ADE2bCTUJ-2Td1xSeLh5pXASkI6kA_dPU"> What kind of mind is the mind of Christ? If we have the mind of Christ, we shall realize that we are living in a rebellious age and in a crooked, perverted generation. Because the age is rebellious and the generation is perverse, the more we love God and do His will, the more we shall suffer. We shall suffer because we cannot go along with the trend of this age. We care to do the will of God, but the will of God is absolutely contrary to the trend or tide of this age. We would love the Lord Jesus, but this is utterly against the trend of this corrupted world. Therefore, if we love the Lord and do God’s will, we are bound to suffer. This will be our outlook if we have the mind of Christ. </p>

Suffering is the portion of God’s children in this age.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101431" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">1 Thessalonians 3</span> Paul tells the believers that God has appointed us to suffering and persecution. God has not appointed us to material blessing; He has appointed us to suffering. Therefore, knowing that Christ suffered in the flesh, we also need to arm ourselves with the same mind. We should not have the mind to pray for material blessing. That is to have the wrong kind of mind. <span class="pg" data-page-id="232" id="232">[232]</span> </p>

Pleasure heats up the lusts of our flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101433" data-verses="1Peter 4:2">v. 2</span>); suffering cools them down. The purpose of Christ’s redemption is to deliver us from our inherited vain manner of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101434" data-verses="1Peter 1:18-19">1:18-19</span>). Suffering responds to Christ’s redemption in this purpose, preserving us from the sinful manner of life, from the flood of dissipation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101435" data-verses="1Peter 4:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). Such suffering, mostly from persecution, is God’s discipline in His governmental dealing. To undergo such suffering is to be judged, dealt with, and disciplined by God in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101436" data-verses="1Peter 4:6">v. 6</span>). Hence, we should arm ourselves with a sober mind to endure such suffering. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y1KxaLRh8hx0MgtFrlaDNr3aUS9eq8csEy3Istv7kjGteO8_iFmxZwHWdjP2Mm1f_"> In God’s economy suffering accomplishes a good work for God’s children. Suffering very much restricts our lusts. The more material enjoyment people have, the more they will exercise their lusts and indulge in them. But if we suffer poverty, persecution, or illness, this suffering will restrict the indulgence of lust. It is common knowledge that the rich commit more lustful sins than the poor. If you have vast riches and do not need to work, you will be able to spend your time indulging yourself in your lusts. You may travel around the world seeking pleasure. But the Lord may limit you financially so that you hardly have enough money for the necessities of life. You have to labor long hours to earn a living. As a result of your labors, you have neither the time nor the energy to indulge yourself in your lusts. Even the desire to pursue lustful pleasure is killed by your poverty. </p>

According to Peter’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101466" data-verses="1Peter 4:1">4:1</span>, we need to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ in order to fight against the flesh with its lusts. </p>

What does it mean to say that the “gospel was preached also to the dead”? <span class="pg" data-page-id="241" id="241">[241]</span> The dead refers to the dead believers in Christ, who suffered persecution because of their Christian testimony, as referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101487" data-verses="1Peter 1:6">1:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101488" data-verses="1Peter 2:18-21">2:18-21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101489" data-verses="1Peter 3:16-17">3:16-17</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101490" data-verses="1Peter 4:12-19">4:12-19</span>. This kind of persecution is considered by Peter in this book as God’s judgment, according to the government of God, which begins from the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101491" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">v. 17</span>). The gospel was preached to these dead believers while they were living, in order that they might on one hand be judged, dealt with, by God through the opposers’ persecution according to men in the flesh, but, on the other hand, live by believing in Christ according to God in the spirit. This shows how strict and serious is the judgment of God in His governmental administration. If the believers, who have been obedient to the gospel, are dealt with by God’s governmental judgment, how much more will those who oppose the gospel and blaspheme the believers be judged by God’s dealing! </p>
<p data-content-id="WBDClclK4_gpZGd_EEOfeWhPbZ1VzaN0j_QDX0NzP4abflyLeRnlIr-xEAgV8mknY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101492" data-verses="1Peter 4:6">verse 6</span> “spirit” denotes the believers’ spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101493" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101494" data-verses="Romans 8:10-11">Rom. 8:10-11</span>). In this way the believers’ spirit becomes a mingled spirit, in which they should live and walk (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101495" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Rom. 8:4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="24ImHOq-Ka35kqnAvZR584KYOX552osKhAQjGNQHhyNnXU_TOW-D_pXiyRvyfmIm-"> The word “dead” is used in both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101496" data-verses="1Peter 4:5">verse 5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101497" data-verses="1Peter 4:6">verse 6</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101498" data-verses="1Peter 4:5">verse 5</span> the dead refers to all those unbelievers who have died and who will be judged by the Lord at the white throne after the millennium. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101499" data-verses="1Peter 4:6">verse 6</span> the same word refers to dead believers. By the time Peter wrote this Epistle, a good number of the Jewish believers had died. The gospel had been preached to these believers while they were alive. Therefore, “the gospel was preached also to the dead” means that it was preached to certain believers who had died before this Epistle was written. </p>
<p data-content-id="uj_E8kFY-CqzwHkg4wPi8KVxtjaJHrtKZE6A-0wt5hJK0U8YduGxp0egiQIF1x3q0"> Peter says that the gospel was preached to the dead so that they might be judged according to men in the flesh.

The whole book of 1 Peter is on God’s government, <span class="pg" data-page-id="242" id="242">[242]</span> and God’s government is carried out mainly by His judgment. God’s judgment began from the rebellious angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101501" data-verses="2Peter 2:3-4">2 Pet. 2:3-4</span>) in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101502" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span>. Then it passed through the generations of man in the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101503" data-verses="2Peter 2:5-9">2 Pet. 2:5-9</span>). For example, God’s judgment was exercised upon the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. The judgment of God was also exercised a number of times upon the children of Israel in the wilderness. Nearly two million Israelites died in the wilderness under God’s judgment. In a sense, even Moses died under God’s judgment. Aaron, Miriam, and Moses all died under the judgment of God, for they all had done certain things that were wrong, against God’s government. It is a serious matter that even a man of God like Moses could die under God’s judgment. The two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, were judged by God and died (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101504" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1-2">Lev. 10:1-2</span>). Furthermore, in one day more than twenty thousand Israelites were slain because of God’s judgment. Eventually, of all those who came out of Egypt at the time of the exodus, only two persons, Joshua and Caleb, entered into the good land. Because they had been faithful throughout the journey, they did not come under judgment but rather were allowed to enter into the land of Canaan. But all the others, those who experienced the Passover, drank of the living water from the cleft rock, witnessed the miracles of God, and ate manna, became disobedient and died under God’s judgment. Even a small degree of disobedience shown by Moses caused him to suffer God’s judgment. All these instances should cause us to realize how serious God’s judgment is. </p>
<p data-content-id="HSvfk3GMDRLsoD7QTqaApKYUA_0SkSaCr7MfFOcc6y1f4UZlI9WNALkrSPDz5oi4Q"> In the New Testament age God’s judgment begins from the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101505" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">1 Pet. 1:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101506" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">4:17</span>) and will continue until the coming of the day of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101507" data-verses="2Peter 3:10">2 Pet. 3:10</span>), which will be a day of judgment on the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles before the millennium.

Peter considered the persecution the believers suffered as such a burning furnace used by God to purify their life. This is God’s way to deal with the believers in the judgment of His governmental administration, which begins from His own household (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101546" data-verses="1Peter 4:17-19">4:17-19</span>). The Greek word for strange in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101547" data-verses="1Peter 4:12">verse 12</span> is <em>xenizo,</em> the same as the word used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101548" data-verses="1Peter 4:4">verse 4</span>. Fiery persecution is common to the believers. They should not think it is strange or alien to them and be surprised and astonished by it. This persecution is a trial, a testing. </p>
<p data-content-id="5h0shcinDUdsRuymjaayLaq2iOeGF6RuJg8lMKkk1Act3b5nn7gt98cprGdFLWXju"> Peter’s use of the metaphor of a burning furnace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101549" data-verses="1Peter 4:12">verse 12</span> indicates that today the Lord is using persecutions and trials as a furnace to serve a positive purpose. The positive purpose served by persecution and trial is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> purification of our life. We can be compared to gold and silver. However, we still have some amount of dross. Therefore, we need purification. As gold and silver are purified through burning, we also need to be purified in this way. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101550" data-verses="1Peter 4:12">verse 12</span> Peter tells the believers not to regard the fiery ordeal as strange. As Christians, we should realize that fiery ordeals are common. Persecutions and trials are the common experience of Christians. Such things are not strange, alien, foreign, to us. On the contrary, they are common, for we have been appointed to them. It is our destiny to suffer in this age. Of course, this is not our eternal destiny. God has not destined us to suffer in eternity, but He surely has destined us to suffer in this age. </p>

Here Peter is saying that it is possible for the sufferings a Christian undergoes to be the sufferings of Christ. How can the persecutions suffered by us be the sufferings of Christ? If we were not Christians, we certainly would not suffer the kind of persecution described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101552" data-verses="1Peter 4:12-13">verses 12 and 13</span>. Such persecutions are due to the fact that we are Christians, men of Christ. Because we believe in Christ, love Christ, live Christ, bear testimony to Christ, witnessing of Him in this age, the world rises up against us. This age is under the hand of the evil one, and for this reason unbelieving ones persecute those who believe in Christ and witness of Him. In the sight of God this kind of suffering is regarded as the sufferings of Christ. For example, a certain brother may have had the opportunity to become rich. But because he believes in Christ, loves Christ, and follows Christ, his business may suffer, and he may lose the opportunity to become wealthy. Actually, he may even be in poverty. This kind of poverty is the suffering of Christ. Those sufferings <span class="pg" data-page-id="249" id="249">[249]</span> that are for Christ are counted by God as the sufferings of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="E5Cs4PZPSSv6OEWz8g7NJx1NwtkLrXSordnbo0VyskzAIq8kfKQrWBmYM6YTZqBiW"> Christ lived a life of suffering, a suffering life. Now we are His partners living the same kind of life. According to the book of Hebrews, we are not only partakers of Christ but are also His partners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101553" data-verses="Hebrews 3:14">Heb. 3:14</span>). We cooperate with Him in living a life of suffering. We follow Him along the way of suffering. This means that what Christ suffered, we also suffer. Therefore, when we suffer for Christ in this way, our sufferings are counted by God as the sufferings of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="DbPKqMhGZ8HsKpWPyG3BaeHvaXcEZxoXrZab9lZvy6A64HpIlS9qdNUlAmm2Bal4_"> We should not be discouraged because we must suffer as Christians. These sufferings are positive and very precious. What a privilege it is to experience the sufferings of Christ! Paul could even say that he made up what was lacking of the sufferings of Christ for the sake of His Body, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101554" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">Col. 1:24</span>). He also speaks in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101555" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Philippians 3:10</span> concerning the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings. Today we should be Christians, followers of Christ, who undergo the sufferings of Christ. We need to participate not only in the riches of Christ, but also in the sufferings of Christ. If we take this point of view, we shall be encouraged whenever we suffer for Christ. We may even welcome this kind of suffering. Yes, we may face fiery ordeals, but these are the sufferings of Christ in which we have the privilege to participate. </p>

In this verse Peter speaks of rejoicing exultingly. According to my understanding, this means that we shall not only be joyful inwardly, but we shall sound out our joy. At the same time, we may stretch forth our arms and also leap for joy. This is to exult and to rejoice exultingly. At the time of the unveiling of the Lord’s glory, we shall exult. I believe that we shall shout, rejoice, and perhaps even leap for joy. We shall be excited to the uttermost, beside ourselves <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> with joy. Today we may rejoice, but when the Lord is unveiled we shall rejoice exultingly. </p>

The believers, having believed into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101558" data-verses="John 3:15">John 3:15</span>), and having been baptized into His name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101559" data-verses="Acts 19:5">Acts 19:5</span>), that is, into Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101560" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>), are in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101561" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>) and one with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101562" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>).

<p data-content-id="NAEaBY_x6pYcwk4ARy7Lpg7iETAFe_lwgvU3PeKk5eHyvPPrOn2R1Uoieyq3fnZXS"> The reason the persecutions we suffer are the sufferings of Christ is that we suffer in the name of Christ. According to Peter’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101564" data-verses="1Peter 4:14">verse 14</span>, we are blessed if we are reproached in the name of Christ. Do not think that it is a curse to be reproached in the name of Christ. This is to be blessed. However, it may be a curse if people appreciate us too highly. Regarding this matter, we need to have a change of concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="tTdiM0wtGZTbyzmpJc9hshU6hmCXbByh7CrYYgW30kDeC5v7EAZJ3WM5CGcOvUqoA"> Today the opposers spread rumors concerning us and accuse us of teaching heresy. I can testify that I am a fundamental Christian and that I love the holy Word very much. I do not teach anything except the Bible with Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, I am accused of teaching heresy. In a sense, I welcome this kind of reproach, for it is actually a blessing, not a curse. </p>

The sufferings they undergo in fiery persecution are used by Him as a means to judge them that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from the unbelievers and not have the same destiny as unbelievers. Such disciplinary judgment begins from the house of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="jUvRomvb09osk353DoIhpMqe9uKPHB2170Q1d3WqqewTMoeFT3ZqxDgmd3WoehIm2"> The Greek word rendered “house” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101593" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">verse 17</span> also means household. Here the house, or household, refers to the church composed of the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101594" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">2:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101595" data-verses="Hebrews 3:6">Heb. 3:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101596" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Tim. 3:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101597" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19">Eph. 2:19</span>). From this house, as His own house, God begins His governmental administration by His disciplinary judgment over His own children so that He may have strong ground to judge, in His universal kingdom, those who are disobedient to His gospel and rebellious to His government. This is for the establishment of His kingdom, which is covered in the second book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101598" data-verses="2Peter 1:11">2 Pet. 1:11</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> </p>

This question indicates that the unbelievers, who disobey the gospel of God, will undergo a judgment more severe than that which the believers have undergone. </p>
<p data-content-id="IpC8Qktp-F7rbZFY08GkGOG4JDMY0eaVgMa7_Ylk3wu7vg1gEFxB-6mfu-zbWYKVc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101600" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">verse 17</span> the word “disobey” has a particular and specific meaning. Many Christians, however, do not realize this. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101601" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">4:17</span> “disobey” is used with regard to the unbelieving Jews mainly, not to the unbelieving Gentiles. As God’s people, the Jews had received the Mosaic law and also the ordinances and rituals of the Old Testament. But by the time this Epistle was written, the dispensation had changed. The Old Testament was the old dispensation, and the New Testament is the new dispensation of God. The dispensation first began to change at the coming of John the Baptist. Of course, it changed even the more with the coming of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="HSvfk3GMDRLsoD7QTqaApKYUA8USnS6Cr7MfFOcc6y1f4UZlI9WNALkrSPDz5oi4Q"> John the Baptist was the son of the priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101602" data-verses="Luke 1:5">Luke 1:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101603" data-verses="Luke 1:13">13</span>). This means that he also should have been a priest serving in the temple by offering the sacrifices, lighting the lamps, and burning the incense on the incense altar. That was the way the priests served God according to the old dispensation. However, this son of a priest did not stay in the temple. Instead, he went out to the wilderness. Furthermore, as a priest, he should have worn the priestly garment, which was mainly made of fine linen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101604" data-verses="Exodus 28:4">Exo. 28:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101605" data-verses="Exodus 28:40-41">40-41</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101606" data-verses="Leviticus 6:10">Lev. 6:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101607" data-verses="Ezekiel 44:17-18">Ezek. 44:17-18</span>). But in the wilderness, he wore a “garment of camel’s hair and a leather girdle” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101608" data-verses="Matthew 3:4">Matt. 3:4</span>). John should have eaten priestly food, which was composed mainly of fine flour and the meat of the sacrifices offered to God by His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101609" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1-3">Lev. 2:1-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101610" data-verses="Leviticus 6:16-18">6:16-18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101611" data-verses="Leviticus 6:25-26">25-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101612" data-verses="Leviticus 7:31-34">7:31-34</span>). However, John ate locusts and wild honey. For a priestly person to wear camel’s hair was an especially drastic blow to the religious mind, for the camel was considered unclean under the Levitical regulations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101613" data-verses="Leviticus 11:4">Lev. 11:4</span>). All this indicates that John had altogether abandoned the Old Testament dispensation. John did not offer sacrifices, he did not light the lamps in the temple, and he did not burn the incense on the incense altar. Instead, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> went to the wilderness and called upon God’s people to repent. Those who repented he baptized in water. From the point of view of Judaism, what John did was heretical. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlzdwAG6JUiZ9Y8QvU82vVLFQmfEoEVdXtO49bCDdKbvgGKpNmdPYoDEvzpKUnEa0"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101614" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>, John preached in the wilderness, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” John the Baptist’s preaching was the initiation of God’s New Testament economy. He did this preaching not in the holy temple within the holy city, where the religious and cultured people worshipped God according to their scriptural ordinances, but in the wilderness, not keeping any regulations of the old dispensation. This indicates that the old way of the worship of God according to the Old Testament was repudiated, and a new way was about to be brought in. </p>
<p data-content-id="knfsL5a82WUv_5LdqzY4eB_cKMPqbum8t2JYykBfWCQWK4guAqyA60qeyB17Qxkmi"> Actually, the preaching of the gospel began not with the Lord Jesus but with John the Baptist. John said to those who came to be baptized by him, “I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance; but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire; whose winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101615" data-verses="Matthew 3:11-12">Matt. 3:11-12</span>). Here John seems to be saying, “The One who comes after me will baptize you either in the Spirit or in fire. He will put you either into the Spirit or into the lake of fire. Only He has the power to do these things. Therefore, you must genuinely repent.” </p>
<p data-content-id="J9jHTayOBt5hilCvGvbDHaayMQ7fenx7k1OAM7w8d8qw30j6U-mQvl_Z5o5llU6Yw"> The Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes, elders, and chief priests among the Jewish people did not obey the preaching of John the Baptist or that of the Lord Jesus. This is made clear both in the Gospels and in the book of Acts. On the day of Pentecost, Peter and the eleven preached the gospel to the Jewish people. Most of those who believed were scattered Jews who had returned to Jerusalem for the feast of Pentecost. But the local ones, in particular the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the leaders of the people, were not willing to believe. This means that they would not obey the gospel. Furthermore, when Paul was raised up by the Lord, he went forth to preach the gospel <span class="pg" data-page-id="262" id="262">[262]</span> in the Gentile cities. Wherever he went, he was persecuted, troubled, and opposed by the Jews. Therefore, in their writings the apostles used the word “disobey” with respect to the unbelieving Jews who did not obey the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="ztuFLZIElnoCUA6_fxiMtGq9DPypUtj2cHD9rxUKqRCJm7AHp0J5q55RI8R8if_BJ"> We have pointed out that the book of 1 Peter was written to Jewish believers. In particular, this Epistle was written to the “chosen pilgrims of the dispersion” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101616" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1:1</span>). The word “dispersion” was a term familiar to all the scattered Jews among the nations. This term clearly indicates that this Epistle was written to Jewish believers. These believers, who had been scattered throughout the Gentile world, were suffering persecution. It is important for us to realize that this persecution did not come mainly from the Gentiles; most of it came from the opposing Jews, the Jews who did not obey the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="aZn_BmdJnw08BKUBEZGTChsBPonm-qQuwhI8Hy5ddoS3NDItxAjd7omZbH1-okflf"> Words such as “dispersion” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101617" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1:1</span> and “disobey” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101618" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">4:17</span> indicate that Peter’s writing has a strongly dispensational aspect. Peter indicated clearly that he was writing to the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion. The word “dispersion” is a Jewish term. At the time this Epistle was written, many Jews were scattered in dispersion. Whereas the Gentile believers lived in their own cities, the Jewish believers were in dispersion, for they had been scattered, dispersed, among the Gentiles, separated from their fatherland. Hence, these scattered Jews were pilgrims in dispersion. </p>
<p data-content-id="bIX-6kISXyy1XG1dStqEZl25r8lh9sd-D_UerZen8a2WySCsxlwHoL--lUiJeySET"> The Judaistic terms used in this book are an indication that it was written to Jewish believers. One of these terms is the “sprinkling of the blood” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101619" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span>). In typology, the sprinkling of the atoning blood ushered the sprinkled people into the old covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101620" data-verses="Exodus 24:6-8">Exo. 24:6-8</span>). Likewise, the sprinkling of Christ’s redeeming blood brings the sprinkled believers into the blessing of the new covenant, that is, into the full participation of the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101621" data-verses="Hebrews 9:13-14">Heb. 9:13-14</span>). Expressions such as “chosen pilgrims of the dispersion” and “sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ” show that this Epistle was written to Jewish believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="qrOESpbJMEncvqRku--VVmIoT7oJv6VB1f8cXT2fToyPneqxIoWyEG9nhXcerhwXP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101622" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">4:17</span> “those who disobey the gospel of God” refers mainly to unbelieving Jews. In the sight of God, the unbelieving Jews were disobedient. God gave them the law through <span class="pg" data-page-id="263" id="263">[263]</span> Moses, and they accepted it. But when God’s dispensation changed and He wanted to give them the gospel, the Jews disobeyed the gospel and rebelled against it. If we would understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101623" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">verse 17</span>, we need to realize that “disobey the gospel” refers mainly to the disobedience of the unbelieving Jews. </p>
<p data-content-id="yMsmCfvQWEcWsi1srSB3xwZmjXPBWgsckziqbJPOHgiEBHZME2iBFY9MxaD41CWPB"> In his synopsis J. N. Darby points out a number of times that 1 Peter is a dispensational book written to Jewish believers. Because of this dispensational aspect of 1 Peter, certain verses are not fully applicable to Gentile believers. </p>

The concept of God’s governmental judgment is a basic thought in Peter’s composition of this Epistle. God’s judgment as seen in 1 Peter may be likened to the hub of a wheel. If the hub were taken away from a wheel, all the spokes would collapse. Likewise, if the thought of God’s judgment were removed from the books of 1 and 2 Peter, these Epistles would lose their basic structure. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcaaVHTVCgvGIROFjCd-BQVV9x9Bsxsz4vwu4bpiV0zCG8Fh4RpvKatN3QN0zME-K"> Many Christian readers of these Epistles may not pay adequate attention to the matter of God’s governmental judgment. The reason most readers may pay attention to things other than God’s judgment is that their mentality has not been trained to concentrate on this subject in the Word of God. However, John Nelson Darby was an exception. In his treatment of 1 and 2 Peter he focuses his attention on God’s governmental judgment. Whether or not we pay attention to this matter in the Epistles of Peter depends on whether or not we have a mind trained to pay attention to such a subject. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ax-XoUmXRGuNtjUgn0zaCf8sCegKoJI_bx2QVWud5sj4sJ3E4W0PzhghSZKkIgXk6"> Many years ago, some of us were having fellowship concerning the main subject of the books of the New Testament. We all knew that Matthew is on God’s kingdom; Mark, on service to God; Luke, on God’s salvation; and John, on life. When someone asked about the subject of the Epistles of Peter, much to my surprise Brother Nee said that these two books <span class="pg" data-page-id="268" id="268">[268]</span> are on God’s government. From that time onward I began to consider what God’s government is. I said to myself, “Isn’t the kingdom in Matthew God’s government? What is the difference between the kingdom of God and the government of God?” Gradually I began to understand the difference between kingdom and government. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAEaBY_x6pYcwk4ARy7Lpg7iFRAFe9lwgvU3PeKk5eHyvPPrOn2R1Uoieyq3fnZXS"> Of course, in 1 and 2 Peter we cannot find the word “government.” But in these two books we see the means by which God carries out His government. The means by which God carries out His government is by judging. Eventually, after God’s judgment has been completed, there will be a new heaven and a new earth wherein righteousness dwells. The new heaven and the new earth are the consummation of 1 and 2 Peter. We all need to see this. </p>
<p data-content-id="tTdiM0wtGZTbyzmpJc9hshU6gkCXbDyh7CrYYgW30kDeC5v7EAZJ3WM5CGcOvUqoA"> As we have already pointed out, at the beginning of 1 Peter we have a word concerning the foreknowledge of God before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past. In the last chapter of 2 Peter we have a word concerning the new heaven and the new earth in eternity future. This means that the scope of these two Epistles extends from eternity past to eternity future. These two books consummate with the new heaven and the new earth with righteousness as their contents. This is related to the government of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="hxMBDypTTZrlXu74HtrBsOo2wDGUycgm0XNLbZECSYiOVkeYnRerhlESfi0ONqauL"> God’s judgment began to be exercised in the Old Testament, and it has been continually exercised throughout the generations. Today God is still judging. In the New Testament we see that God’s judgment begins from His own household and ends with the burning of the old heaven and the old earth. That burning will be the last step of God’s judgment. When that last step of judgment has been completed, the new heaven and the new earth will appear. This means that when God has thoroughly cleansed the universe through judgment, there will be a new heaven and a new earth wherein righteousness will dwell. This is a matter of God’s governmental judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="UGOJeVq0WoHbHsqfi5JwP4fuawIxn7WJqN9F77dkanazjb4Zy4jHAGGwqvdH_fvg_"> I am burdened that all the saints, especially the young ones, have a clear understanding of 1 and 2 Peter. In particular, we need to see that the subject of these two books is God’s government carried out by His judgment. <span class="pg" data-page-id="269" id="269">[269]</span> </p>

In that sense ‘the Father does not judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son’ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101659" data-verses="John 5:22">John 5:22</span>). The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God’s government in this world, exercised with regard to His children. Accordingly it says, ‘the time of your sojourning’ here” (Darby). This is God’s judgment on His own household (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101660" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">1 Pet. 4:17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="i09bSPXZl4pb4qG7jIxCesISgziEI84qwm3w4KlfUlb27jT2DLMWjKNNKX1xwzylW"> Since these two Epistles are concerned with the government of God, the judgment of God and of the Lord is referred to repeatedly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101661" data-verses="1Peter 2:23">2:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101662" data-verses="1Peter 4:5-6">4:5-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101663" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101664" data-verses="2Peter 2:3-4">2 Pet. 2:3-4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101665" data-verses="2Peter 2:9">9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101666" data-verses="2Peter 3:7">3:7</span>), as one of the essential items. It began from the angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101667" data-verses="2Peter 2:3-4">2 Pet. 2:3-4</span>), and passed through the generations of man in the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101668" data-verses="2Peter 2:5-9">2 Pet. 2:5-9</span>). Then in the New Testament age it begins from the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101669" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">1:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101670" data-verses="1Peter 4:6">4:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101671" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">17</span>) and continues until the coming of the day of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101672" data-verses="2Peter 3:10">2 Pet. 3:10</span>), which will be a day of judgment on the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles before the millennium. After the millennium, all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and perish (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101673" data-verses="1Peter 4:5">1 Pet. 4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101674" data-verses="2Peter 3:7">2 Pet. 3:7</span>), and the heavens and the earth will be burned up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101675" data-verses="2Peter 3:10">2 Pet. 3:10b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101676" data-verses="2Peter 3:12">12</span>). The results of the varied judgments are not the same. Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition. However, by all these judgments the Lord God will clear up and purify the entire universe, that He may have a new heaven and a new earth for a new universe filled with His righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101677" data-verses="2Peter 3:13">2 Pet. 3:13</span>) for His delight. </p>
<p data-content-id="1u4RHjJZsxtkegHo76dgMe-A7ezvBnVr-4BAdiflaL9E0PcxKuctHr8dFnVeaZrqv"> The fear spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101678" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">1:17</span> is a holy fear, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101679" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">Philippians 2:12</span>. It is a healthy, serious caution for us to behave holily. Such fear is mentioned a number of times in this book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101680" data-verses="1Peter 2:17">2:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101681" data-verses="1Peter 2:18">18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101682" data-verses="1Peter 3:2">3:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101683" data-verses="1Peter 3:15">15</span>) because its teaching concerns the government of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="9dayeuFKDQTWPTGOkzti5VPn4us9yj-uXp9KuyPSiQwJYmmIZqVDLa1EEdUTWmQ2K"> We need to be impressed by the fact that God’s government differs in dispensation. There are different judgments for different cases, and these judgments have different <span class="pg" data-page-id="270" id="270">[270]</span> results. It is important for us to realize that, in Darby’s words, the judgment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101684" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">1:17</span> is not “the final judgment of the soul.” As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101685" data-verses="John 5:22">John 5:22</span> reveals, that judgment has been given to the Son. What we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101686" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">1:17</span> is the daily judgment of God’s government in the world, a judgment that is exercised with regard to His children. This is not the final judgment at the white throne, but the daily judgment of God in the world. The daily judgment of God is not exercised upon fallen sinners; instead, it is exercised upon God’s children. </p>
<p data-content-id="jUvRomvb09osk353DoIhpMqe8saPPRG170Q1d3WqqewTMoeFT3ZqxDgmd3WoehIm2"> Those who oppose this teaching from the Word may say, “How is it possible for us, God’s children in grace, to be judged by God? God is our Father, and He loves us and gives us grace. How could He do something to judge us?” Because the truth of God’s judgment is opposed in this way, I am burdened that we all grasp the pure thought regarding it in the Bible. Today all of us are under God’s judgment. God is not only gracing us, giving us grace. He is also judging us. This is the reason we have many sufferings. We have sufferings because God is judging us. On the one hand, God is gracing us to live a life that suits His righteousness under His government. On the other hand, He judges anything that does not match His government. Therefore, in this age we the believers are under the daily judgment of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKuLK-iN4WWAXWP5KjHT9CqtYIEP3BuZ1mGsG8GNPe630UNpfCxCz71m3bOKKJcjL"> Darby points out that because the judgment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101687" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">1:17</span> is the daily judgment of God’s government exercised with regard to His children, this verse speaks of passing the time of our sojourning in fear. This kind of judgment is exercised upon us, the children of God, while we are passing the time of our sojourning on earth. Therefore, this judgment is not in the future; it is a judgment that we experience today. The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101688" data-verses="John 5:22">John 5:22</span> refers to eternal judgment, to the judgment of unbelievers at the white throne. But the judgment here is the present judgment of God upon His children, not on unbelievers. </p>

The sufferings they undergo in fiery persecution are used by Him as a means to judge them that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from the unbelievers and not have the same destiny as the unbelievers. Hence, such disciplinary judgment begins from God’s own household. God’s house, or household, is the church composed of the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101733" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">2:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101734" data-verses="Hebrews 3:6">Heb. 3:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101735" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Tim. 3:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101736" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19">Eph. 2:19</span>). From this house, as His own house, God begins His governmental administration by His disciplinary judgment over His own children, that He may have strong ground to judge, in His universal kingdom, those who are disobedient to His gospel and rebellious to His government. This is for the establishment of His kingdom, which is covered in the second book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101737" data-verses="2Peter 1:11">2 Pet. 1:11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="fWYB7XX4w1MoL-aENuz7U9fX_t4VXZ1bDk4MQtEZZOLkMNraM6pCPQKufeaBQvtYF"> We need to be deeply impressed from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101738" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">4:17</span> that judgment begins from the household of God. This is God’s governmental administration carried out by His disciplinary judgment over His own children. The purpose of this disciplinary judgment that begins at God’s house is that God may have a strong <span class="pg" data-page-id="278" id="278">[278]</span> ground to judge, in His universal kingdom, all those who are disobedient to His gospel and rebellious against His government. This applies in particular to the unbelieving Jews. The result of this judgment will be the establishment of God’s kingdom. </p>

This question indicates that the unbelievers, who disobey the gospel of God, will undergo a judgment more severe than that which the believers have undergone. </p>

<p data-content-id="yMsmCfvQWEcWsi1srSB3xwZmiVPBVgMckziqbJPOHgiEBHZME2iBFY9MxaD41CWPB"> The word “difficulty” refers to judgments, persecutions, and hardships. This may even include illness. Many believers have the concept that because they believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved, everything in their lives should be smooth. Actually, the very opposite is true. In the Christian life we have one difficulty after another. However, some may think that because they are in the church life, they should not have any problems. They imagine that they will be in perfect health, have a high income, and be well spoken of by others. Actually, both in the Christian life and in the church life there are many difficulties. Hence, Peter says that the righteous is saved with difficulty. </p>
<p data-content-id="8dbAM2uvWzOhfr7QeOD8nkNCT8alsQ0v9TFJfIT1G5QGwvPJ2fRWuwDHx406-YT4x"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101745" data-verses="1Peter 4:18">4:18</span> “saved” is not from eternal perdition through the Lord’s death, but from the coming destruction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101746" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:3">1 Thes. 5:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101747" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:8">8</span>), through the trials of persecution as God’s disciplinary judgment.

The Lord Jesus had prophesied concerning this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101748" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">Matthew 24:2</span>, when He said of the temple that not one stone would be left upon another. The Lord had predicted that judgment would come upon the disobedient and unbelieving Jews. Peter, along with all the other apostles, knew this. </p>
<p data-content-id="79Rbiepb8tG2mJw_fYlOxaEZ3evrJDESUXoR2kFUSEhHP7v1r0wjh6a6HPSVKIIDo"> We need to remember that this book was written in particular to Jewish believers. Peter warned these believers regarding the coming destruction. However, he told them that those who believed in the Lord would be saved from that destruction, but they would be saved through difficulty, that is, through persecution and sufferings. This difficulty is a kind of governmental judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="_vU1T0qIaILjGjSpxcRXGjyM_UerCk4rEGwb4rWavw8dBzOTFLExVgceODNrcAuF-"> Among the early apostles there was a strong belief that the Lord Jesus would come back soon to judge the unbelieving sinners, who are ungodly and disobey His gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101749" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:6-9">2 Thes. 1:6-9</span>). Peter’s word here refers to this. In God’s government, if the righteous, who has obeyed His gospel and lives a righteous life before Him, is saved with difficulty, suffering persecution as the means of His disciplinary punishment to purify his life, where will the ungodly, who disobeys His gospel and lives a sinful life against His government, stand when the destruction by His wrath comes? </p>

Persecution is a suffering in the old creation. God as our Creator can preserve our soul, which He created for us. He has even numbered our hairs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101758" data-verses="Matthew 10:30">Matt. 10:30</span>). He is loving and faithful. His loving and faithful care (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101759" data-verses="1Peter 5:7">1 Pet. 5:7</span>) accompanies His justice in His governmental administration. While He is judging us, as His household, in His government, in His love He cares for us faithfully. In suffering His just disciplinary judgment in our body, we should commit our souls to His faithful care. </p>

It is easy for us to pay attention to the Christian life and to neglect God’s government. Actually, the Christian life and the government of God go together. The Triune God has passed through a long process and has become the life-giving Spirit to indwell us. This is for our Christian life. At the same time, the Triune God is still the Creator of the universe and its ruler. On the one hand, we have been reborn to have a spiritual life, the divine life. On the other hand, we are still in the old creation. For this reason, we need God’s governmental dealings. In order for the Christian life to grow, we need the discipline of God’s government. </p>
<p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7t_lU0ivmckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> The preciousness of Peter’s writings is that he combines the Christian life and God’s government. Paul did the same thing, but he did not do it in such a clear way as Peter did. Peter’s writings show us that the Christian life and the government of God go together as a pair. If we would carefully read the two Epistles of Peter, we would see that Peter is quite deep in the matter of life. The first chapter of 2 Peter, in particular, is rich, deep, and profound in the matter of life. But at the same time in his writings Peter gives a serious word regarding God’s governmental dealings with His <span class="pg" data-page-id="281" id="281">[281]</span> regenerated people. Therefore, in the Epistles of Peter we need to see the Christian life and God’s government and also see how the two go together. </p>

The apostle entreats them first, expecting that they will take the lead to nobly suffer for Christ. </p>

Peter and the early apostles were witnesses of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101783" data-verses="Acts 1:8">Acts 1:8</span>), not only as eyewitnesses testifying what they had seen of Christ’s suffering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101784" data-verses="Acts 5:32">Acts 5:32</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101785" data-verses="Acts 10:39">10:39</span>), but also as martyrs vindicating their testimony by suffering martyrdom for Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101786" data-verses="Acts 22:20">Acts 22:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101787" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:8-9">2 Cor. 1:8-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101788" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:10-11">4:10-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101789" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:23">11:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101790" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:31">1 Cor. 15:31</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span>). This is to share the sufferings of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101791" data-verses="1Peter 4:13">1 Pet. 4:13</span>), to participate in the fellowship of His sufferings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101792" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="9dayeuFKDQTWPTGOkzti5VPn4uM9yh-uXp9KuyPSiQwJYmmIZqVDLa1EEdUTWmQ2K"> Peter also says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101793" data-verses="1Peter 5:1">5:1</span> that he is a partaker of the glory about to be revealed. Peter was first a witness, a martyr, a partaker of the sufferings of Christ. Then he was a partaker of His glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101794" data-verses="Romans 8:17">Rom. 8:17</span>). Christ Himself had gone the same way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101795" data-verses="1Peter 1:11">1 Pet. 1:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101796" data-verses="Luke 24:26">Luke 24:26</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="jUvRomvb09osk353DoIhpMqe8s6PPTG170Q1d3WqqewTMoeFT3ZqxDgmd3WoehIm2"> In Greek witness and martyr are the same word. This indicates that we need to bear testimony as a witness even at the risk of being a martyr, of sacrificing our lives. This is what Peter did. On the day of Pentecost Peter gave a strong testimony, witnessing of the sufferings of Christ. He boldly told the Jews that they had crucified the Lord Jesus. Before the day of Pentecost, however, Peter was not bold. Rather, he was timid. The night the Lord Jesus was betrayed Peter denied that he was one of His followers. In the presence of the Lord, Peter denied the Lord. Actually, that was not Peter, a stone; it was Simon, a lump of clay. But on the day of Pentecost Peter had the boldness to rebuke the Jews for crucifying the Lord Jesus. After that, Peter began to suffer persecution. He was arrested and put into prison. He was willing to risk his life to be a witness for the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKuLK-iN4WWAXWP5KjHT9CqtYIkP0BOZ1mGsG8GNPe630UNpfCxCz71m3bOKKJcjL"> Peter, no doubt, remembered the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101797" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> about witnesses. When the disciples asked the Lord about the restoring of the kingdom to Israel, He replied, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101798" data-verses="Acts 1:7-8">Acts 1:7-8</span>). Peter was the first to become such a witness. He was a leading witness, a martyr, one who was willing to sacrifice his life to testify of the sufferings of Christ. Eventually, Peter himself was martyred. He sacrificed his life as part of his witness for Christ. This was the fulfillment of the Lord’s word to him in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101799" data-verses="John 21:18">John 21:18</span>, a word concerning “by what kind of death he would glorify God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101800" data-verses="John 21:19">John 21:19</span>). When Peter wrote his first Epistle, he was quite old. When he wrote his second Epistle, he knew that the time of his martyrdom was near: “Knowing <span class="pg" data-page-id="289" id="289">[289]</span> that the putting off of my tabernacle is imminent, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101801" data-verses="2Peter 1:14">2 Pet. 1:14</span>). When Peter wrote these Epistles, he was reminded of the words of the Lord’s prophecy concerning him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101802" data-verses="1Peter 5:1">5:1</span> we see that Peter had a threefold status. He was a fellow-elder, he was a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and he was a partaker of the glory about to be revealed. </p>
<p data-content-id="nTLlhVRI0WZJKFKDQRic6_gB51658_MTSAl5BEvl5rADl5CES_D0WV0ObUJL8h77e"> Every elder needs to be a witness of the sufferings of Christ. This means that the elders should be ready to sacrifice their lives as part of their testimony. If a brother is not willing to risk his life, he is not qualified to be an elder. Every elder should be a martyr, one who sacrifices his life for Christ. Being a partaker of Christ’s glory depends on being such a martyr. If the elders are willing to be martyred, if they are willing to risk their lives, then surely they will be partakers of the glory about to be revealed. But if the elders are not willing to sacrifice their lives, then instead of partaking of glory at the Lord’s coming, they will probably be rebuked by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="6QMYacwK02nthQCoF0URhKVkTRofGYSwiASTsylVaVYoGxKhSC8NjvEvyvfi8NIox"> As we have seen, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101803" data-verses="1Peter 4:19">4:19</span> Peter says, “Wherefore, let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in welldoing to a faithful Creator.” Here, “welldoing” refers to doing right, good, and noble deeds. Committing our souls to a faithful Creator is effective only if we are engaged in welldoing, that is, if we are doing noble deeds. Nothing is more noble than dying as a martyr for the Lord. Polycarp was an example of a noble martyr. One who had learned from the apostle John, Polycarp was martyred when he was more than eighty years of age. Before he died, he was given an opportunity to save himself by denying the Lord. Polycarp refused, saying that he could not deny the One who had always been faithful to him. Surely Polycarp was not only bold and courageous—he was noble. At the cost of his life, he nobly confessed the Lord before his persecutors. </p>
<p data-content-id="R3V846PAgL9uUXzkIwWb8W3ivQKh01bIBG2lbvy4b6AK6lLFmxs9AW8X9SmI49ucm"> When we act in such a noble way, we have the ground to commit our souls to a faithful Creator. He is altogether faithful. But are we faithful? Are we doing noble deeds? Do we care for His testimony in a noble way? When the Lord Jesus was being tried before His crucifixion, Peter was not at all <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> noble. But later, in the book of Acts, Peter witnessed for Christ before his persecutors in a noble way. For example, Peter and John said to the persecutors, “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101804" data-verses="Acts 4:19-20">Acts 4:19-20</span>). Peter and the other apostles committed their souls in welldoing to a faithful Creator. Surely Peter was able to say, “Lord, You are faithful to me. Now I would be faithful to You. I would be faithful to You at the cost of my life.” Certainly the Lord would honor such a noble commitment. </p>
<p data-content-id="sIQHD11fFkBgeJsmlyCwB3XM58gH6wnmIZYofsu39phMs8US-jBXoedz9GzFfHq3r"> Because Peter was a noble witness, a noble martyr, he had the assurance that he would be a partaker of the coming glory. I would like to ask a question of the elders: Do you have the assurance that you also are partakers of the glory to be revealed? I question whether most of the elders have this assurance. Perhaps the elders can say that they are witnesses. However, whether an elder will be a partaker of the glory to come depends upon how noble and faithful he is as a witness. The point here is that an elder must be willing to sacrifice himself. </p>

Wives are to be subject to their husbands, and servants, to their masters. As we have pointed out, to some extent at least, husbands should subject themselves to their wives. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101838" data-verses="1Peter 5:5">5:5</span> Peter goes on to say that in the church life the younger men should be subject to elders. </p>
<p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7t_FU_w_mckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> Although the Greek word rendered “elders” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101839" data-verses="1Peter 5:5">verse 5</span> is the same as that used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101840" data-verses="1Peter 5:1">verse 1</span>, here it should, in principle, refer to all older men. This means that the younger men should be subject not only to the elders of the church, but to all older brothers. I believe that the principle is the same concerning the younger sisters subjecting themselves to older sisters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BuN0Wi41-WaNn4QzIFus7KYsA20iQU_9Lg-GlSyuVYW03tWNbFC9Yi26QowoiNyuD">GIRDED WITH HUMILITY</h2><p data-content-id="xCYRCBsQuw2L-c2XMdJX4w0GFOQSZiPmQ7e0Dzkl6TOAjj70sSbUDgvOuVhrfbbT9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101841" data-verses="1Peter 5:5">5:5</span> Peter says that all of us should gird ourselves with humility toward one another. Everyone in the church, including the elders, should gird himself with humility.

<p data-content-id="rjTPLhTT8an5I7cUTTzmydgHAK0xKLQXRg9lnBtbC--nVsKvp_fjOWL62w9JaapYK"> The Greek word for “gird” here is derived from a noun meaning a slave’s apron, which girds up his loose garments in the service. It is used here as a figure of speech, signifying the putting on of humility as a virtue in service. This figure comes evidently from Peter’s impression of how the Lord girded Himself with a towel when He humbled Himself to wash the disciples’ feet, especially Peter’s (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101843" data-verses="John 13:4-7">John 13:4-7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="dNl6tgRNGfx6EVOqeWt6MZmKypZSdJfUU4ldkBJC7GGgVM62D66Z7Aowb9mcgKl2v"> Today carpenters and printers often wear aprons while they are working. In ancient times the people wore clothing that was loose. Therefore, because this loose clothing made it difficult to work, the slaves wore an apron to bind up their loose clothing. Peter uses this as a metaphor to indicate that in the church life we all must learn how to gird up ourselves. We should not be loose in any way. If we are loose, we may automatically become proud. We need to gird ourselves with humility. If we are girded with humility, we shall become humble, careful persons. We shall not be loose or careless. In the church life we all should put on the apron of humility. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QfakavptTSx9tWovQHAybkDO5V_UHZmQDY-JxCUP4mm7A_CcJcFvQFbMh0TJNMl0F">THE PROUD RESISTED BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="KBJmTq7rFLwhOIeK_OqE12g7t_FU3jPmckDwONix7gsZAscaLdBovdhg2IBNo4xc4"> According to Peter’s word, we should be girded with humility “because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” The Greek word translated “resist” is a strong word for an army preparing to resist the enemy. Peter uses this word to show how strong God is in resisting those who are proud. </p>
<p data-content-id="lstMWBRC66b7v6qyJcYqNzFIIcHfj2nmDBhzKVdlvVCbYUbTkcY3VpluEL-g0HaK4"> The Greek word rendered “proud” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101844" data-verses="1Peter 5:5">verse 5</span> literally means showing above (others). To be proud is to show ourselves above others. God resists the one who lifts himself above others and regards himself as better than others. Instead of being proud and showing ourselves above others, we should gird ourselves with the apron of humility. Putting on such an apron will always bring us down and cause us to be lowly. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OL9AaTfdcQNgWo6E__9gENXi8eEY5Gu_AtnWibxhvo9pWA2k7cDx1vl4hlJzNlNkh">GRACE GIVEN TO THE HUMBLE</h2><p data-content-id="43QATuPFb584gkeOZXNScxvOeawJrl17ADE2bCTUJ-2Td1xSeLh5pXASkI6kA_dPU"> Peter says that God not only resists the proud, but gives <span class="pg" data-page-id="299" id="299">[299]</span> grace to the humble. Strictly speaking, this grace refers to the Triune God Himself as the life supply being multiplied in the humble believer. We have seen that the multiplied grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101845" data-verses="1Peter 1:2">1:2</span>) corresponds to the varied grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101846" data-verses="1Peter 4:10">4:10</span>) and all grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101847" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">5:10</span>). The believers have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in them that they may participate in all grace. The varied grace of God, as the all grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101848" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">5:10</span>, is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101849" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101850" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">12:9</span>). God gives Himself as grace, as life supply, to humble believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="ofUPlCuNAC12hlvQuJ_UoTe21iuat8geBZxGNzkHTjFI2xYHPOXYWjct6OLFz60vb"> The Greek word for “humble” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101851" data-verses="1Peter 5:5">5:5</span> also means lowly, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101852" data-verses="Matthew 11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>, where the Lord Jesus says, “I am meek and lowly in heart.” To be proud is to be high, but to be humble is to be low. If we would humble ourselves in the church life, we need to become lowly. Instead of uplifting ourselves, we should always keep ourselves low. Then we shall be in a position to receive the Triune God as our life supply. We shall receive the grace God gives to humble believers. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3Sfgt49N4yqnUk9Ymhzai--1djUmgEOJSUKY6facN-ragmCO58awdH5H1zP2HCGtX">HUMBLED UNDER THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="GjIWRwpqK7l9xUJ5LpqIMdMOiAGKVKYFma1VvLFr-tFZ4dW7ECS577LiXyd5A_MMr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101853" data-verses="1Peter 5:6">verse 6</span> Peter says, “Therefore, be humbled under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.” The words “be humbled” here are passive voice, indicating to be made humble by God, mostly through the sufferings of persecutions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101854" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">v. 10</span>). This, however, needs our cooperation with God’s operation. We must be willing to be made humble, lowly, under the mighty hand of God. Hence, <em>be</em> humbled. We may say that “humbled” is passive, but “be” is active. While God is acting to operate on us, we need to take the initiative to be operated on by Him. To take the initiative is active; to be operated on is passive. This is our willingness to be under the hand of God, which is mighty to do everything for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ck7ZHbdqM24QGnW7JL0wBUosVg5EVDN1X9kzGHSV3YY4pgJDsbMgZhhrhLbkg96gz"> Persecution may be used by God to humble us. Actually, any kind of suffering may be used by God for this purpose. When good things happen to us, we may become proud. But suffering or persecution may help us to be humble. For example, a brother may be humbled as a result of losing his job. A student may be humbled by receiving a lower grade than he expected. If this student receives a high grade, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> may be somewhat uplifted. But if he receives a lower grade, he may be humbled. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y1KxaLRh8hx0MgtFrlaDNr3aVTtep-8sEy3Istv7kjGteO8_iFmxZwHWdjP2Mm1f_"> We may also experience being humbled in our family life. If the children of a certain brother and sister are outstanding, the parents may become proud. But if the children cause them problems or difficulty, this will make the parents lowly. Likewise, if a young brother’s father has a very high position in his work, this brother may be proud. Suppose his father is the president of a corporation or the chancellor of a great university. Surely this brother would be proud of his father’s position. But suppose his father were a janitor with a very limited education. Knowing that his father had such a lowly position may cause this young brother to be lowly. He is humbled by the fact that his father does not have a high position. </p>
<p data-content-id="E5Cs4PZPSSv6OEWz8g7NJx1NxvULoWyordnbo0VyskzAIq8kfKQrWBmYM6YTZqBiW"> I would like to emphasize the fact that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101855" data-verses="1Peter 5:6">verse 6</span> Peter tells us to “be humbled.” We cannot make ourselves humble. Rather, we need to be made humble by God. Nevertheless, God’s humbling of us requires our cooperation with God’s operation. This means that we must be willing to be made humble, lowly, under the mighty hand of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="DbPKqMhGZ8HsKpWPyG3BaeHvbVsEawIXrZab9lZvy6A64HpIlS9qdNUlAmm2Bal4_"> We may say that “be humbled” is active-passive: “be” is active, pointing to our initiative to be humbled, and “humbled” is passive, pointing to God’s operation to humble us. Although God’s hand is mighty to do whatever is necessary for us, His hand still needs our cooperation. God’s operation needs our cooperation. Therefore, we need to be humbled. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SqEusd6atnyDbypEbKrNMKQvsrhWTOV8AgU-DN0LQXDMxLcoM7EJr-9aaH1dofMTI">EXALTED IN DUE TIME</h2><p data-content-id="gZwyu9ibox3tnMS0ktyLXzWYRvYowNbLG8DpYO9SArBZrzjgfEF0yr92qj6BUZ4e_"> Peter says that if we are humbled under the mighty hand of God, He will exalt us in due time. To be submissive to God’s mighty hand, willing to be made lowly, is to take the God-honoring way that gives Him the ground to exalt us in His time. Willing to be made low by God’s humbling hand in His discipline is a prerequisite to being made high by God’s exalting hand in His glorification. Here we have the God-honoring way, God’s humbling hand, and God’s exalting hand. Whether God will humble us or exalt us depends on our attitude. We may take a way that forces God to humble us, or we may take another way, the God-honoring way, that helps <span class="pg" data-page-id="301" id="301">[301]</span> God to exalt us in due time. The words “due time” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101856" data-verses="1Peter 5:6">verse 6</span> refer to the time God considers right to exalt us. </p>

As a result, this verse concerning the mighty hand of God has been misused. </p>
<p data-content-id="E5Cs4PZPSSv6OEWz8g7NJx1NxukLiFSordnbo0VyskzAIq8kfKQrWBmYM6YTZqBiW"> We have seen that the entire book of 1 Peter is on God’s government, and that God’s government is administrated through His judgment. God’s judgment is carried out in the environment arranged according to His sovereignty. For example, in order to judge Noah’s generation, God arranged a great catastrophe, the flood. Only God could have done such a thing. The flood that terminated the human race at the time of Noah was brought about by the mighty hand of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101876" data-verses="1Peter 5:6">5:6</span> the mighty hand of God refers to God’s administrating hand seen especially in His judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="DbPKqMhGZ8HsKpWPyG3BaeHvbUcERj4XrZab9lZvy6A64HpIlS9qdNUlAmm2Bal4_"> God’s hand is more mighty in His judgment than in His salvation. Of course, in saving us, God’s hand is mighty. But we see much more of the might of His hand in His judgment. Suppose a certain brother continues to enjoy worldly entertainment long after he has been saved. Although he has truly been saved, he still loves the world. But one day he has a car accident, an accident arranged by the mighty hand of God, and that accident causes him to seek the Lord in a deeper way than he ever did before. This is an illustration of God’s hand exercised in judgment. <span class="pg" data-page-id="308" id="308">[308]</span> </p>

First, we should humble ourselves under God’s mighty hand. Second, we should cast all our anxiety on Him. Third, we need to be sober and watch. Everything that happens to us is under God’s mighty hand. There is no need for us to worry or be anxious. We should simply humble ourselves under God’s mighty hand and not resist it. Then we should cast all the troubles that cause our anxiety upon the Lord. Along with this, we need to be sober and watchful. If we cast all our anxiety on God, we shall have a sober mind, and we shall be clear about our situation. Furthermore, we shall be watchful regarding our adversary, the Devil, who walks about as a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. If we are watchful, we shall not be deceived when Satan incarnates himself in the form of anxiety. On the contrary, the adversary, the roaring lion, will be defeated by us. This is the proper understanding of this portion of the Word. </p>

The contrast is between the sufferings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101879" data-verses="1Peter 5:9">verse 9</span> and the God of all grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101880" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">verse 10</span>. If we had <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101881" data-verses="1Peter 5:9">verse 9</span> without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101882" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">verse 10</span>, we would be lacking in hope and encouragement. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101883" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">5:10</span> Peter seems to be saying to the suffering believers, “You and your brotherhood are suffering your adversary’s threatening, the Devil’s lion-roar, only for a little while. But the God of all grace, of the bountiful and gracious supply of life that exceeds all your need, will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you.” </p>
<p data-content-id="FVdXhiOjWCOU2MQIGN_E1FaCck9ZoXl3AER3V25JpQzvWurx6wgDQNFCSNGqcdCkN"> In this verse all grace refers to the riches of the bountiful supply of the divine life in many aspects ministered to us in many steps of the divine operation on and in us in God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="309" id="309">[309]</span> economy. The initial step is to call us, and the consummate one is to glorify us, as mentioned here, “who called you into His eternal glory.” Between these two steps are His loving care while He is disciplining us, and His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us. In all these divine acts, the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences. The God of such grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground the persecuted believers after they suffer a little while. </p>
<p data-content-id="CqM6w5pYHgbjWvf7luLWug9zGA2JdizuhdAv8tHckPQSzMQTKqDBZHhBtpVegg1bt"> The term “the God of all grace” is unique, found in the New Testament only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101884" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">5:10</span>. It may be common for Christians to speak of the God of mercy. But do you know of anyone who uses the expression the God of all grace? Peter does not say merely that God is the God of grace; he says that God is the God of <em>all</em> grace. In this expression once again Peter shows his characteristic use of adjectives. The suffering believers should be encouraged by the fact that, although they are suffering, their God is the God of all grace. Furthermore, He has called us into eternal glory, a glory that is unlimited in both space and time. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PsefQ1FZ6fc7Xp3AqPkSQInhhOQNhSm28kOMitPscxA9jxQEoHmNCZnuSP1Cpudkc">CALLED INTO ETERNAL GLORY IN CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="-bV22nWH_FbItmzO6YVHsZY6GCM4vOMr7lvRKtpbd8TOAsIX6A2XE9BWdzvsz9lXK"> Peter says that God has called us into His eternal glory in Christ. “In Christ” indicates that the God of all grace has gone through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish the complete and full redemption so that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself. Thus they may participate in the riches of the Triune God as their enjoyment. All the steps of the divine operation are in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us. It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101885" data-verses="1Peter 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>) as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain unto His glorious goal. What a miracle that fallen sinners can be brought into God’s eternal glory! And how excellent is His <span class="pg" data-page-id="310" id="310">[310]</span> perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us! This is all accomplished through His “all grace” which is the “true grace” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101886" data-verses="1Peter 5:12">5:12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="pEWFX9DAbL5FbbFHZzCgZNJGB7_ZdZitjs6U5R2GbQT8zoeL_zLo2pvDn2d-mwppZ"> According to what Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101887" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">5:10</span>, our sufferings are only for a little while, but God’s glory is eternal. After we have suffered a little while, the God of all grace will personally perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us. </p>
<p data-content-id="vmfpsxk3X-CPOle6XZ_G2a2NH50So17mfN2MSXnyzsmNuic1bchaisP_k3J_ELop6"> The word “Himself” indicates God’s personal activity in the work of grace. The Greek word rendered “perfect” literally means restore. It implies repairing, adjusting, putting in order again, mending, perfectly joining together, thoroughly equipping, well furnishing, and, thus, perfecting, completing, educating. In Greek the word “establish” literally means to set fast, to confirm. The same word was used by the Lord in His charge to Peter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101888" data-verses="Luke 22:32">Luke 22:32</span>. The meaning of “strengthen” is very close to that of establish. Literally, the Greek word rendered “ground” means to lay a basis for. It is a derivation of the word that means foundation. Hence, it is to ground solidly, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101889" data-verses="Matthew 7:25">Matthew 7:25</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101890" data-verses="Ephesians 3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101891" data-verses="Hebrews 1:10">Hebrews 1:10</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBDClclK4_gpZGd_EEOfeWhPaZFVwbt0j_QDX0NzP4abflyLeRnlIr-xEAgV8mknY"> There is a progress in the four divine acts of grace.

<p data-content-id="24ImHOq-Ka35kqnAvZR584KYPXJ51pMKhAQjGNQHhyNnXU_TOW-D_pXiyRvyfmIm-"> First God perfects us. Through the suffering of persecution we are perfected.
