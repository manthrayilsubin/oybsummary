In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94623" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:1-2">1:1 and 2</span> Paul says, “Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” This Epistle and the First Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians were both addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia. This church was composed of all the believers in Christ in that city. Such a local church is of the believers and is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that such a local church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is united with the Lord Jesus Christ organically in all He is and has done. On the one hand, it is of human beings, in this case the Thessalonians; on the other hand, it is in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ. The organic union in the divine life and nature is the vital base for the believers to live a holy life for the church life, which is the theme of the two Epistles to the Thessalonians. </p>
<p data-content-id="-tmZ7zb6Iz2RRh_Lv0dg3New9btPRXEyRLV1MaKLBpQLf1f7KhddgW1O7dcJDEZbv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94624" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">chapter one</span> of 1 Thessalonians we see the structure of a holy life for the church life. This structure is composed of faith, love, and hope. As we shall see, 2 Thessalonians also has the same structure. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pdf92jB8fAvtrgeE6wLHUBsRuSDWn3OYABmNB-kFBUTqoxVMrWVdR8cSV2VoktwKQ">ENCOURAGEMENT AND CORRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="vckU8Pa7Na64q3WdiTrUbc1iZVbvl2LSOjKohnXtgx8Rb9RTW9-i65evn5IdOziHv"> Second Thessalonians is a book of encouragement and correction. The young believers in Christ at Thessalonica needed further encouragement; they also needed some correction. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> Paul encouraged these believers in his first Epistle. Nevertheless, in the second Epistle he gives them a further word of encouragement. While he is encouraging them, he also corrects them in certain matters. </p>
<p data-content-id="W5CeSNbZsRTgQ48Ch9dy0bOvAchR6cKoeDQznkA7NqX9_ICjYpfwuSuyGm-FDc5Ov"> Actually, 2 Thessalonians is more a book of correction than a book of encouragement. Paul was wise, gentle, and kind. Therefore, he does not directly give a word of correction. Rather, first he encourages the believers and then goes on to correct them. If we read this Epistle carefully, we shall see that a word of encouragement is followed by a word of correction. Then there is some further word of encouragement and after that another word of correction. This book, therefore, is composed of two sections of encouragement and two of correction, in addition to the introduction and the conclusion. In this message let us consider Paul’s first word of encouragement to the believers at Thessalonica. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gkirf6jqq1Opty6bcjwhQUGRhv6gmMzSuwKpDgLOgdCVoEMcq_4KVLq19w10ZXQBF">FAITH, LOVE, AND HOPE</h2><p data-content-id="eocYGXR0AYEX3IQ7DynS6ASeJKctFP9hJllixuaPfFlHO0NeWbrBZ1GZpirQG6ok1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94625" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:3">1:3</span> Paul says, “We ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers, even as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all to one another is increasing.” We have emphasized the fact that the basic structure of the genuine Christian life is constituted of faith, love, and hope. Such a life does not originate from the ability of the believers’ natural being; it originates from the infusion of what God is into the believers. It is carried out by their sacrificial love toward their Lord, who loved them and gave Himself for them, and toward His members, whom He has redeemed through His death in love. This life lasts and stands unchanging by the sustaining power of the hope that looks for their beloved Lord, who promised that He would come to take them to Himself. Such a life is the content of 1 and 2 Thessalonians. </p>
<p data-content-id="5co62Vu8uSHAaS_vDbh2JXI3G-q3lY4QxvvYqsqoRyBYynADM62ivcKy_oBesnoS0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94626" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:3">1:3</span> Paul mentions the Thessalonians’ faith and love. In the first Epistle faith and love are regarded as part of the structure of the believers’ life for the church. Here, in the second Epistle, faith and love are growing and increasing in their Christian life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="N3IWAERqJ7ltG-hqURXRWdOPftDOXONcDYLsmP41P3cTR-zRHFd6Yaxk7ijLeyz9P"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94627" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:4">verse 4</span> Paul continues, “So that we ourselves boast in you in the churches of God for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which you are bearing.” The endurance spoken of here issued from the hope of the Lord’s coming back and was supported by this hope. Such endurance of hope is always accompanied by faith. Hence, it says here “your endurance and faith.” Both are needed in persecutions and afflictions. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tGMWwDGLxfSvO5ACMgOJl9ieQLCaPeqKOrZgx_Bd9LNsWoxXdZ0BUvc2hvUV_OFXr">SUFFERING FOR THE KINGDOM</h2><p data-content-id="h6RUd25GbdpHboHyApPW2Nwb2vHiyrR2fleVNk2jUMmu-KvThHZL8EX_tXiciGCj7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94628" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:5">verse 5</span> Paul goes on to say, “A plain indication of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you are suffering.” God’s judgment is righteous and just upon all men. It will be finalized in the future (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94629" data-verses="Romans 2:5-9">Rom. 2:5-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94630" data-verses="Revelation 20:11-15">Rev. 20:11-15</span>). How God deals in this age with different people is an indication, a token, a proof, of the future execution of His righteous judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uu739O4A64ExeW21oMNRdXPps7a0lLPevH2DGULpgGDUfoxE6oRezjaSsN0qVBv5g"> The believers have been called into the kingdom of God and glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94631" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:12">1 Thes. 2:12</span>). To enter into this kingdom we need to pass through sufferings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94632" data-verses="Acts 14:22">Acts 14:22</span>). Hence, the persecutions and afflictions are a plain indication of God’s righteous judgment that we may be accounted worthy of the kingdom. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MHran90qcP0lcXT3fU1sygYvLAt6QDYAt-VBwbT246-KojXdmDdpoRxK6WchljVpe">THE GOAL OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="Vc5Ww3948XRmmm_e5NR3dhn-mhAlRUkw8mOG_Ms7MNYctJlbSdCzyhaTBqCu-MhuT"> The kingdom is the goal of the Christian life. Today we are living in the church life with the goal that one day we shall enter into the kingdom of God. The New Testament emphasizes the cross, the church, and the kingdom. The cross produces the church, and the church ushers in the kingdom. As we are living in the church life, our goal is to enter into God’s kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="iD_OUXd8PeBpNuGTri-OSaMlxd2PzrIECtNR8MaKJQYHsZeu25HeUBM5wHszBhtex"> This goal is neglected by many Christians. If you were to ask certain Christians what the goal of their Christian life is, they would probably say that their goal is to go to heaven. This kind of answer is very poor. The church life does not usher the believers into heaven; it ushers us into the kingdom. Actually, the church life is preliminary to the kingdom. <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> It is a preliminary stage of the kingdom. This is the reason that, in a very real sense, the New Testament considers the church life to be the kingdom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94633" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Romans 14:17</span> says, “For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.” Because <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94634" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span> speaks concerning the church life, the kingdom of God in this verse signifies the church life. According to Paul’s understanding, the church life is the kingdom. Of course, the church life today is not the kingdom in full. Rather, it is the kingdom in a developmental stage, a preliminary stage. We are in this preliminary stage of the kingdom with the kingdom in full as our goal. We are proceeding from the preliminary stage to the stage of fullness. This is the correct understanding of the proper goal of the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="1E7MEZnndpwcbqBjn7NbZLaOg-gHDb1CoIzN3A8ucNc5St_ELKfmuJ8cy8oxHiMcw"> Many Christians, including us, are dull in understanding the genuine revelation of the New Testament. For this reason, though many read the Bible, they do not see anything. Their situation can be compared to that of the Israelites, who, in the words of Paul, have a veil upon them whenever they read the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94635" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:14-15">2 Cor. 3:14-15</span>). Because they are veiled, they do not see anything when they read the Bible. Because many Christians are veiled, they do not understand what Paul means when he says that God has called us into His kingdom and glory. Some Christians interpret the kingdom to mean a heavenly mansion. According to their understanding, to enter into the kingdom is to go to heaven. They hold this concept of the kingdom because they are veiled. They read the Bible, but they do not see God’s revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="94zNr4qXLaFmR6FPMGNhG3Kden_Swr1BgDdkWyY6sJjU9-AMDFsgxFVMbgait73ZC"> In His mercy, the Lord has removed at least a great part of the veil from our eyes. We surely have seen something of God’s revelation, and we shall not be cheated any longer. We know that to go to heaven is not our goal. There is not such a thing revealed in the Bible. God’s goal is that we live a church life that will usher us into the kingdom. This means that we should live a life in the preliminary stage of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> kingdom that will lead us into the full manifestation of the kingdom. </p>

Here Paul gives the Thessalonians a word of correction of the misconception concerning the day of the Lord’s coming. Because the misconception corrected by Paul is common among many Christians today, Paul’s correcting word is needed as much today as when it was first written, if not more so. Before we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94662" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:1-12">2:1-12</span> verse by verse, I would like to speak briefly about the different schools of teaching regarding the Lord’s coming. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JCqaKDQ0RnTy92uQXTNQ47efpTot_zg3PkYZTGBEMwkwareX4qDrqBimbo7S-2uYn">THREE SCHOOLS OF TEACHING<br/>CONCERNING THE LORD’S COMING</h2><p data-content-id="zw2kr8RDurnNkN6TzSVBffllvTpi2FBPtuevaYsBC1uMtiHfxWJYeOUDxpvaTSOKM"> Apart from teachings that are definitely heretical, there are among fundamental believers three main schools concerning the Lord’s coming and the rapture of the believers. One of these schools is called the pretribulation school. This is the teaching that the coming of the Lord Jesus will take place before the great tribulation. The word “tribulation” is a special term in the study of prophecy. It denotes a period of time at the end of the church age. At the end of the church age there will be a period of seven years, the last of the seventy weeks prophesied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94663" data-verses="Daniel 9:1">Daniel 9</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94664" data-verses="Daniel 9:1">Daniel 9</span> speaks of seventy weeks of years concerning the history of Israel. First we have seven weeks, then sixty-two weeks, and finally, after a long interval, the last week, the last seven years. </p>
<p data-content-id="aoIKQ0ArlquROO0aGTuy7qENQhPKDjWbCCzqGKArXo32KXtOQgMY-xTrU-ncd-S_R"> Just before the beginning of these seven years, a powerful man will rise up—the Antichrist. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94665" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:1">2 Thessalonians 2 </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> Antichrist is called the man of lawlessness. According to prophecy, this powerful person will restore the Roman Empire and will become the last Caesar of that empire. Then Antichrist, the man of lawlessness, will make a covenant, an agreement, with the Jews. This agreement will be intended to last for seven years. Because Antichrist will be so powerful, the Jews will be afraid of him; they will fear that he will persecute them in the practice of their religion. For this reason, the Jews will make an agreement with him, and in that agreement he will promise them freedom of worship. The Jews will be very pleased with this agreement, happy to have the freedom to worship the God of their fathers. However, after three and a half years, in the middle of the last seven years of the church age, the man of lawlessness will break his agreement with the Jews and begin to persecute them. </p>
<p data-content-id="kZubgiXIc9oqhXV3mItCyoSFomNtHm-idbBZqpleRPSezxXlB8ETi2F4IwSZO9A69"> The last seven years may be divided into two periods, each three and a half years in length. In the Bible the second period of three and a half years is also called forty-two months, or 1260 days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94666" data-verses="Revelation 11:2-3">Rev. 11:2-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94667" data-verses="Revelation 13:5">13:5</span>). From our study of the Bible we can say strongly and definitely that these last three and a half years will be the time of the great tribulation. This means that the great tribulation will be the second half of the last week; it will last three and a half years, or forty-two months, or 1260 days. </p>
<p data-content-id="JCqaKDQ0RnTy92uQXTNQ47efpTot_zg3PkYZTGBEKiUwareX4qDrqBimbo7S-2uYn"> Many teach that the Lord’s coming will take place before the great tribulation. However, when they speak of the tribulation, they usually mean the entire last seven years. According to their understanding, the whole of the last week of Daniel’s seventy weeks will be the period of the great tribulation. They teach that Christ will come back to rapture the believers before this time of tribulation, that is, before the last seven years of this age. For this reason, this school of teaching is called the pretribulation school. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw2kr8RDurnNkN6TzSVBffllvTpi2FBPtuevaYsBLnuMtiHfxWJYeOUDxpvaTSOKM"> A second school is the school of post-tribulation. This is the teaching that Christ’s coming will be after the great tribulation. Those who teach that the coming of Christ will be after the tribulation use many verses from the Bible as a <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> strong basis for their teaching. Those of this school teach that Christ will come back at the very end of the tribulation. Therefore, their teaching is called the post-tribulation school. </p>
<p data-content-id="aoIKQ0ArlquROO0aGTuy7qENQhPKDjWbCCzqGKArf6n2KXtOQgMY-xTrU-ncd-S_R"> A third school of teaching, represented by Bible teachers such as Pember, Govett, and Panton, teaches in a more detailed way concerning the Lord’s coming back than those in either the pretribulation or post-tribulation schools. Those in this third school say that neither the pretribulation school nor the post-tribulation school is fully correct. Rather, each of these schools is only partially correct. The teaching of the first two schools can be compared to a city map that shows only main streets, whereas the teaching of the third school can be compared to a city map that shows not only main streets but also small streets, lanes, and alleys. Therefore, the teaching of those in the third school is more detailed and more accurate. </p>
<p data-content-id="b-gKAUrui-86GnGYStnUh91Qz591UgstCFEhjdfhTKZWZRlyXjuf9WpskOHZsPGI-"> According to the third school, Christ’s <em>parousia</em> (presence) will probably begin a little before the middle of the last seven years and will last nearly to the end of this period. Christ will leave the throne in the third heaven and descend to the air concealed in a cloud and remain there for about three and a half years. During this period of time, a number of things will happen. The man-child in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94668" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> will be raptured just before Antichrist begins to persecute every kind of religion, including Judaism and Catholicism, and he will exalt himself above every object of worship. The man-child will be raptured not to the air but to the throne of God. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94669" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span>, the one hundred forty-four thousand will also be raptured during this time as the firstfruits, before the second half of the last seven years. We should not make the mistake of regarding the one hundred forty-four thousand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94670" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> as identical to the man-child in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94671" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span>. These are two different groups of overcomers. The man-child and the one hundred forty-four thousand will be raptured to the throne of God. Then the Lord Jesus will begin His <em>parousia;</em> He will descend from the throne of God to the air. It seems certain that the man-child and the one hundred forty-four thousand will descend with Him. Then at the end of <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> the last seven years, the Lord Jesus will come to earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94672" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:8">Second Thessalonians 2:8</span> refers to this: “And then the lawless one shall be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of His coming).” The Greek word rendered “coming” is <em>parousia,</em> presence. The appearing of the Lord’s <em>parousia</em> will be at the end of the last seven years, after Antichrist, the lawless one, has been revealed. </p>

During the Lord’s <em>parousia,</em> the majority of believers will be raptured to meet the Lord in the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94682" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:17">1 Thes. 4:17</span>). “The day of the Lord” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94683" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> refers, according to the context, to the period of time of the Lord’s <em>parousia</em> (coming), in which the rapture of the majority of the believers will take place. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94684" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:3">Verse 3</span> tells us definitely that before this period of time Antichrist will be revealed to play the greatest role in the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94685" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:4">v. 4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94686" data-verses="Revelation 13:1-8">Rev. 13:1-8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94687" data-verses="Revelation 13:12-15">12-15</span>).

These are the schools of pretribulation, post-tribulation, and the school that considers the entire <em>parousia</em> in detail. We also saw that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94734" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:1-12">2:1-12</span> Paul gives a word of correction of the misconception concerning the day of the Lord’s coming. </p>
<p data-content-id="BdcPlLsxRfZnz4euWxKctqnU5LQr_rblmEtuEq9pD9gc1E7zETNzsWla6JvWXepa1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94735" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:1">2:1</span> Paul speaks of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94736" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:2-3">2:2 and 3</span> Paul tells the believers not to be quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by spirit, by word, or by letter, as from the apostles, that the day of the Lord is present. He also charges them not to allow anyone to deceive them. Then Paul goes on to say that the day of the Lord will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness, Antichrist, is revealed in his own time. At present, although the mystery of lawlessness is already working, there is a restraining factor, but one day this factor will be removed. Then the lawless one will be revealed. However, the Lord Jesus will slay him by the breath of His mouth and bring him to nothing by the appearing of His coming (<em>parousia,</em> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94737" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:8">v. 8</span>). The coming of the lawless one will be according to the operation of Satan, with all power, signs, and wonders of a lie and with all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> saved. Because of this, God will send them an operation of error that they might believe the lie. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xw0Zv1s8yLYqEh7mc22kX4gtDkviwUJ7QGIqvB9S6UjTyW_zSV2rQbBEA7EhyiNir">THE SEVENTY WEEKS</h2><p data-content-id="rdzqJMoXKmGmb6KBql3W4BJ-vT887TWRSIQu2sktuT8bV0B4vCJ2tCevXql86SWzc"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that the man of lawlessness, Antichrist, will be manifested in the middle of the last of the seventy weeks mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94738" data-verses="Daniel 9:1">Daniel 9</span>. In this message I would like to give a further word regarding the seventy weeks in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94739" data-verses="Daniel 9:1">Daniel 9</span> in relation to Paul’s word of correction in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94740" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:1-12">2 Thessalonians 2:1-12</span>. </p>

Seventy weeks, therefore, are seventy times seven years or four hundred ninety years. Daniel was told that these seventy weeks are determined upon “thy people and upon thy holy city.” This means that the seventy weeks are related to Daniel’s people, the children of Israel, and to the holy city, Jerusalem. This verse also speaks of finishing the transgression, making an end of sins, making reconciliation for iniquity, bringing in everlasting righteousness, sealing up the vision and the prophecy, and anointing the Most Holy. If we read this verse carefully, we shall see that it speaks of the ending of this age. The bringing in of everlasting righteousness refers to the millennium, to the thousand-year kingdom, when there will be righteousness on earth. Therefore, this one verse indicates that the seventy weeks will reach unto the end of this age and will bring in the thousand-year kingdom. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="1E7MEZnndpwcbqBjn7NbZLaOg-gHDb1CoIzN3AcufN85St_ELKfmuJ8cy8oxHiMcw">Unto Messiah the Prince</h2><p data-content-id="94zNr4qXLaFmR6FPMGNhG3Kden_Swr1BgDdkWy46vJDU9-AMDFsgxFVMbgait73ZC"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94742" data-verses="Daniel 9:25">Daniel 9:25</span> says, “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.” The seven weeks in this verse denote forty-nine years. If you study the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, you will see that from the time that the king of Persia gave the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem unto the completion of this rebuilding was forty-nine years. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94743" data-verses="Daniel 9:25">Verse 25</span> also speaks of a period of threescore and two weeks, or sixty-two weeks. This is equal to four hundred thirty-four years. The first seven weeks and the sixty-two weeks yield a total of four hundred eighty-three years. This leaves the last week, a period of seven years, for the future. The first forty-nine years go from the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem to the completion of the rebuilding. The four hundred thirty-four years extend from the building of Jerusalem to Messiah the Prince. The last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94744" data-verses="Daniel 9:25">verse 25</span> says that the “street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.” This refers to the building that took place during the first seven weeks, that is, during the first period composed of forty-nine years. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="j4nCXC9x1AuuNrFhkz3sH8YBkTrIjErxnM5XtDZVdRCm-idaDQHRj1fG3aCOTfz4Q">The Prince That Shall Come</h2><p data-content-id="ThvmPKPIZKKf8RTbKq-4bESYwjoIgHRKOaYqSI6QoDfUjQAiloQURz8QRcC2_3R7O"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94745" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">Verse 26</span> says, “And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.” The words “cut off” refer to the crucifixion of Christ, the Messiah. Christ was cut off not for Himself but for us. He was crucified for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="nOy_T6_o4z-aPBlF7bE1ZYMWzI-gR5fH4JjteJ1Mce1YHoWpUijhSFlf1KvS3XWRT"> The “people of the prince that shall come” is a reference to the people of Titus, a prince of the Roman Empire. In A.D. 70 the Roman army under the leadership of Titus thoroughly destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, the sanctuary. The history written by Josephus describes this terrible destruction. </p>
<p data-content-id="6yNCPAAmuExORtzVOeWIpsaFdcJ6inOQzLbtndvwFa9MC3zxyAhc6M1I8ZXrGjExK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94746" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">Verse 27</span> says, “And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.” In this verse the pronoun “he” refers to “prince” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94747" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">verse 26</span>. However, this “he” will actually be the coming Antichrist. In typology, Titus was a prefigure of Antichrist. What he did in A.D. 70, Antichrist will repeat in the future. Hence, the prophecy here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94748" data-verses="Daniel 9:1">Daniel 9</span> regards the two as one: the first, Titus, is the prefigure; the second, Antichrist, is the fulfillment. </p>
<p data-content-id="RaCKsZDKcv6pxqznPA9OjfbTDTEAflrl_rAMfKLuR3-m4zXQ6nSjQfX6rlbglNU8U"> The Antichrist, the one typified or prefigured by Titus, will according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94749" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">verse 27</span> “confirm the covenant with many for one week.” This covenant will be an agreement that is intended to last for a period of seven years. This seven years is the last of the seventy weeks mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94750" data-verses="Daniel 9:24">Daniel 9:24</span>. In the midst of the last week, the last seven years, Antichrist will “cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.” This means that he will stop the Jews from offering sacrifices on the altar in the temple and will begin to persecute every kind of religion. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="s6J99aRqcVwSqHqz17K6YUnzucrrW3dFVgYPDI7hPqU8uVtrvMbn4B7cCCoSysmj1">The Church Age as an Insertion</h2><p data-content-id="w4xGUl7f34QCdF0Mj8XzOWRSq57Zrngyoa1KU7zrym-E3jdY0X4Fym43kVF1CwX5a"> From the time the commandment was given to rebuild the city of Jerusalem until the completion of this rebuilding was forty-nine years, or seven weeks. Then the time from this completion to the crucifixion of Christ was sixty-two weeks, or four hundred thirty-four years. After the crucifixion of Christ, the seventy weeks were suspended. This suspension will continue until the beginning of the last seven years of this age. </p>
<p data-content-id="LzkrMbA1aFevZS8FqWV7OJW5EkC7R3eRTv3P3ubtmgOpcA2jhLgxJNYIu2CR68iW2"> In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus said that because of His crucifixion God would give up the children of Israel. Therefore, their history was suspended at the cross, and from that time onward they have been forsaken by God. God has temporarily set them aside, put them away. The divine history then comes to the church. This means that the history of the church occupies the period of time between the end of the sixty-ninth week and the beginning of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> seventieth week. In other words, the church age is equal to the time during which the seventy weeks are suspended. We may also say that the age of the church, the entire history of the church, is an insertion wedged in between two parts of the history of the children of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="mPEPnzMqg-awE3RG6rFwkik_f0zv_eL1xREjmh13qBJ48ikkJlB3kr2nYWyvOD_51"> This understanding corresponds fully to what is revealed in certain of the parables uttered by the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. For instance, the parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94751" data-verses="Matthew 21:33-46">Matthew 21:33-46</span> speaks of the transfer of the kingdom of God. In this parable the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem, and the husbandmen are the leaders of the Israelites. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94752" data-verses="Matthew 21:41">Matthew 21:41</span> says, “They say to Him, He will miserably destroy those evil men, and will lease the vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render the fruits to him in their seasons.” This was fulfilled when the Roman prince, Titus, and his army destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. </p>

In these verses Paul covers a number of very precious matters. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94769" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2:13</span> Paul says, “But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” God loved us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94770" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:16">v. 16</span>), chose us from the beginning, and called us through the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94771" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:14">v. 14</span>). He chose us unto His salvation, which is by sanctification of the Spirit, and He called us to the obtaining of the Lord’s glory. Now He is taking us on with eternal encouragement and good hope in grace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oC_B6oqiERD6J9qh7NNGTj2rPVvkVNJSlucOgK-2uGy0wAu6xSHA3t7xh7AQSbB3i">GOD’S CHOICE</h2><p data-content-id="374jeXjOqsFcEa5VthFALjN9cSgQr_6LxVx6-lEX4zUvcE-BWmy2RMUaX4JPiDFay"> In his word of encouragement Paul reminds the young believers of God’s selection, God’s choice. He tells them that from the beginning, that is, from eternity past (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94772" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">Eph. 1:4</span>), God chose them. It certainly is encouraging to know that before time began God chose us. This means that our being saved did not begin in time; rather, it began in eternity. In eternity past God considered us and selected us. From the beginning God chose us unto salvation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GI6N7oZv4QISG5S2T04tiobmdg6AMU1WUQKOLqcSRrEQyMY942SFMRQ1ACeECXUwq">SALVATION IN SANCTIFICATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="cQre85aUb7jz_rTHccJFcdUkw8V10NaloYNZdLIjGmuUCxPoI7dfERRPh7DOInpfS"> The salvation unto which we were chosen by God is salvation in sanctification of the Spirit. Sanctification of the Spirit is the divine transformation. By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord’s glory. <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="0TVqsA5_vho3oDBPcVW_FaeWCo-PgjAFwcoVO5rf92x9-uhacZJRbD_na7GWUg33m"> Sanctification is a matter of transformation, and transformation involves a process. Now, as saved ones, we are all in the process of being sanctified, transformed. </p>
<p data-content-id="70YI74pR07Uzrl40vW7pH1d-YXnI8p7YXaPr2FA5U-GSsPnlYnvCAsUdO57cV_RtA"> We may use cooking to illustrate the process of sanctification. The church life can be compared to a kitchen. When God called us and saved us, He purchased us as “groceries” from a large “supermarket.” In His “shopping” God called us. Now we are undergoing the process of being “cooked” in the “kitchen” of the church. This process of cooking is sanctification, transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="_vB7ThFq6l55uQDfgNdVYduyqSrd5xkU-VE8Lgsbnxpna5KpGys5Ny8IR4mxbdTf2"> Because the church life is a kitchen for God’s cooking, the church will not always have an appearance that is neat and orderly. This is usually the situation in a kitchen when a good meal is being prepared. Do not expect your local church to be perfect. A kitchen is a place of process. Because of this process, many things are not ready, but they are in the process of being made ready. Sometimes I am asked how I can tolerate the situation in the church. I reply, “Why should I not tolerate it? The church is a kitchen. Wait for another period of time and you will see the results of the work that is taking place now in the kitchen.” </p>
<p data-content-id="BdcPlLsxRfZnz4euWxKctqnU5LQr_rblmEtuErNpFvwc1E7zETNzsWla6JvWXepa1"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94773" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2:13</span>, salvation is in sanctification. This means that salvation does not immediately result in our going to heaven. No, God’s salvation is now in sanctification. God is sanctifying us. This should remind us of Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94774" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>, where he says, “And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly.” At present we are all undergoing the process of sanctification in the kitchen of the church life. We know what it means to be cooked in this kitchen. However, those outside the kitchen do not understand what we mean when we speak of the process of being cooked. </p>
<p data-content-id="xw0Zv1s8yLYqEh7mc22kX4gtDkviwUJ7QGIqvANSzHDTyW_zSV2rQbBEA7EhyiNir"> Do not expect that everything in the church life will be marvelous and orderly. This is not the situation of any local church on earth. Furthermore, we should not think that the local churches at Paul’s time were better than the churches today. On the contrary, because our cooking has <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> been improved, the local churches in the Lord’s recovery today may be better than the churches in Paul’s day. </p>
<p data-content-id="rdzqJMoXKmGmb6KBql3W4BJ-vT887TWRSIQu2tUtmAMbV0B4vCJ2tCevXql86SWzc"> Often the messy condition of a kitchen indicates that an excellent meal is being prepared. The kitchen may be messy, but the food that is being cooked will be very tasty. If you want the food in your local church to be flavorful, you must be willing for your kitchen to be messed up. </p>
<p data-content-id="dYFt-SIXvF8b6WvKCbVwdyy8LWq3DaCi4W-BW0G2n6376UVZ15yRniePjceZIU68b"> Suppose you invite me to your home for a meal. If I see that everything in your kitchen is neat and orderly, I may be disappointed, for I shall realize that there may not be much to eat. But if I see that your kitchen is messy because of all the preparations for the meal, I shall know a feast is being prepared. When no one is cooking, the kitchen may be neat. But when a good meal is being prepared, the kitchen will not be so orderly. If everything in a church is neat and orderly, this may indicate that no one is doing any cooking. This means that there is a shortage in the process of sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q34nhZiwb3eMCcIk9xn0TMR6tdIFs39gKtvi4iBzgNJN-gjGRk4Aw7AYFfgQQtMTB"> I can testify that the kitchen of the church in Anaheim is messy. This proves that in Anaheim we are in the process of sanctification. God, according to His selection, has placed us into the process of sanctification. In the church in Anaheim we are experiencing a great deal of cooking; we are being sanctified and transformed. Sometimes when I am being cooked, I may wonder what is happening. Then the Lord reminds me that I have prayed for transformation and have ministered concerning it. In Anaheim I may say that I cook the elders, and the elders cook me. Furthermore, the elders are being cooked by the saints. Certain brothers and sisters seem to be especially given to cooking the elders. Actually the cooking in the kitchen of the church life is not done by any human hand. Rather, it is done by the Lord according to His wisdom and sovereignty. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ksn_qbe9yE_G4B7lc-L8ltl2jm7-GjFJj8ft2ejSDPOTaSf6vSIzC3PqA3DTVTHqQ"> God has selected us unto salvation in sanctification and not merely to have our sins forgiven. There is no need to be cooked in order to experience the forgiveness of sins. We simply need to pray, “Lord Jesus, I repent. I confess that I am a sinner. But, Lord, I believe in You, and I thank You for <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> dying on the cross for my sins.” A person who prays in this way can be saved and have the forgiveness of sins. But this is not sanctification. After we experience forgiveness, we need to undergo the process of sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="lSh6ddoLRcmZXrMYx5Ut_uJG8mUfiZjmFgQv_5aCDPDNKwM5LG1eGbS_1xDijWgHR"> The Lord intends to sanctify us, to transform us. Transformation is a process that is not necessarily enjoyable. Nevertheless, we need to learn how to enjoy the Lord even when we are being cooked. </p>
<p data-content-id="Oheq2qM0gz9BUWu6-vun5ZLNwJjYNYvaE-b-Jkxd20rT5Pz0poZ7MQo6jeqaEWYoM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94775" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">verse 13</span> Paul tells us that sanctification is of the Spirit. Do you know where the Spirit is? You need to realize that the Spirit is in you to sanctify you. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94776" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">1 Thessalonians 4</span> Paul speaks of sanctification, and this sanctification is of the Spirit. The indwelling of the Spirit is actually our sanctification. The Spirit indwells us with just one goal—to sanctify us, to transform us, to change us metabolically. This is sanctification of the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="42YjIFWmbNKZvD5t6Z6A1vN8mzBuIDoFluEvfcdkzGicDeywquonxcdVZrKS2Jk93">BELIEF OF THE TRUTH</h2><p data-content-id="oC_B6oqiERD6J9qh7NNGTj2rPVvkVNJSlucOgK-2qUy0wAu6xSHA3t7xh7AQSbB3i"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94777" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">verse 13</span> Paul also speaks of belief of the truth. In this verse the word “belief” actually means faith. The faith of the truth comes before salvation in sanctification of the Spirit. God chose us from the beginning unto the faith of the truth and unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="374jeXjOqsFcEa5VthFALjN9cSgQr_6LxVx6-lEX9hEvcE-BWmy2RMUaX4JPiDFay">CALLED UNTO THE OBTAINING OF THE GLORY<br/>OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="GI6N7oZv4QISG5S2T04tiobmdg6AMU1WUQKOLqcSb4kQyMY942SFMRQ1ACeECXUwq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94778" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:14">verse 14</span> Paul goes on to say, “To which also He called you through our gospel unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.” The words “to which” refer to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94779" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">verse 13</span>. In eternity God chose us unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, and then in time He called us unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord. Salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth are the procedures. Obtaining the glory of our Lord is the goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="cQre85aUb7jz_rTHccJFcdUkw8V10NaloYNZdLIjN1eUCxPoI7dfERRPh7DOInpfS"> First God chose us and then He called us.

Then through the gospel He called us unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. The glory of the Lord is that He is the Son of God the Father, possessing the Father’s life and nature to express Him. To obtain the Lord’s glory is to be in the same position as sons of God to express Him. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5co62Vu8uSHAaS_vDbh2JXI3G-q3lY4QxvvYqtqoWgBYynADM62ivcKy_oBesnoS0">A HOLY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="N3IWAERqJ7ltG-hqURXRWdOPftDOXONcDYLsmO41JlMTR-zRHFd6Yaxk7ijLeyz9P"> The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians contain a total of eight chapters. All these chapters are on the same subject: a holy life for the church life. Whenever we read 1 and 2 Thessalonians, we should not be distracted by other matters. No doubt, in the eight chapters of these two books a number of other points are covered. We need to be careful in our reading not to be distracted by these points. As we read 1 and 2 Thessalonians, we need to keep in mind that the central thought of these Epistles is a holy life for the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="tGMWwDGLxfSvO5ACMgOJl9ieQLCaPeqKOrZgx-Bd0YtsWoxXdZ0BUvc2hvUV_OFXr"> This holy life for the church life is constructed of faith, love, and hope. The way to carry out such a life is to be sanctified wholly. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94830" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span> Paul says, “And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” If we would be sanctified wholly, we need to have our heart established blameless in holiness, and we need to preserve our vessel, our body, in sanctification and honor. Furthermore, all the parts of our being—our spirit, our soul, and our body—need to be preserved complete. This is to sanctify our entire being to have a holy life for the proper church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="h6RUd25GbdpHboHyApPW2Nwb2vHiyrR2fleVNl2jcfWu-KvThHZL8EX_tXiciGCj7"> In 2 Thessalonians Paul repeats much of what he has said in 1 Thessalonians. Like a father with a loving heart toward his children, Paul is repetitious. This is characteristic of <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> parents, especially as they grow older. Again and again, they may say the same thing to their children. Therefore, 2 Thessalonians is a repetition and a further development of 1 Thessalonians. It is a repetition with warnings and corrections. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94831" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:1">2 Thessalonians 2</span> Paul warns the believers not to be misled. He also corrects them in order to bring them back to the right track. Nevertheless, the main subject—the holy life for the church life—is the same in both books. Furthermore, in both 1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians we see the basic structure of the Christian life, a structure that includes faith, love, and hope. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RaCKsZDKcv6pxqznPA9OjfbTDTEAflrl_rAMfLruR1-m4zXQ6nSjQfX6rlbglNU8U">FAITH GROWING AND LOVE INCREASING</h2><p data-content-id="s6J99aRqcVwSqHqz17K6YUnzucrrW3dFVgYPDJbhPoU8uVtrvMbn4B7cCCoSysmj1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94832" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:3-4">2 Thessalonians 1:3 and 4</span> Paul says, “We ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers, even as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all to one another is increasing, so that we ourselves boast in you in the churches of God for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which you are bearing.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94833" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:3">verse 3</span> Paul speaks of the believers’ faith and love. He says that their faith is growing and that their love is increasing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94834" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:2">1 Thessalonians 3:2</span> Paul says that he sent Timothy to establish and encourage the Thessalonians for the sake of their faith. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94835" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:10">1 Thessalonians 3:10</span> we learn that Paul was eager to see them again in order to perfect what was lacking in their faith. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94836" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:12">1 Thessalonians 3:12</span> Paul also urged the believers to increase in love: “And the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we also to you.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94837" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:9">1 Thessalonians 4:9</span> Paul goes on to tell the believers that they have been taught of God to love one another. Therefore, in 1 Thessalonians Paul was concerned that the believers’ faith would be perfected and that their love would increase and abound. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94838" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:3">2 Thessalonians 1:3</span> Paul encourages the new believers at Thessalonica by saying that the apostles thank God because their faith grows exceedingly and because their love is increasing. This indicates that, as Paul repeats the matter of faith and love, he adds a word of encouragement. <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="w4xGUl7f34QCdF0Mj8XzOWRSq57Zrngyoa1KU6TrxmeE3jdY0X4Fym43kVF1CwX5a">ENDURANCE OF HOPE</h2><p data-content-id="LzkrMbA1aFevZS8FqWV7OJW5EkC7R3eRTv3P3v7tlgupcA2jhLgxJNYIu2CR68iW2"> But where does Paul speak of hope in 2 Thessalonians? Paul’s first reference to the believers’ hope is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94839" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:4">1:4</span>, where Paul says that he boasts of their endurance and faith in all their persecutions and afflictions. Hope is implied by the word “endurance.” Their endurance issued from the hope of the Lord’s coming back and was supported by it. Such endurance of hope is always accompanied by faith. For this reason, Paul speaks of their endurance and faith. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94840" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:16">2:16</span> Paul again speaks of hope: “Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and good hope in grace.” Paul, an excellent writer, could not forget the basic structure of his Epistles to the Thessalonians with the elements of faith, love, and hope. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mPEPnzMqg-awE3RG6rFwkik_f0zv_eL1xREjmgV3pAp48ikkJlB3kr2nYWyvOD_51">HOLINESS AND SANCTIFICATION</h2><p data-content-id="ZuRiLK9nz3K4jzvvDx1AQ2DySLk3lNFocne-NobHDfYx5xyTZJQ2Az6vVzJL3VwcB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94841" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">1 Thessalonians 3</span> Paul speaks of holiness; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94842" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span> of sanctification; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94843" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1">chapter five</span>, of being sanctified. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94844" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span> he says, “That He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94845" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</span> he says, “This is the will of God, your sanctification,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94846" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:4">verse 4</span>, “That each one of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94847" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span> Paul says, “And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” This is the holiness and sanctification spoken of in 1 Thessalonians for the carrying out of a holy life for the church life with the three elements of faith, love, and hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="A1sM1luJ2rP_9HPtSrjrVadelfx26oQ2-4vd-z2DteOejqCLkFGrPNPSGpKc29bpt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94848" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span> Paul gives a further word concerning sanctification: “But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” God has chosen us unto salvation in sanctification, and this sanctification is of <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> the Spirit. Paul’s word about sanctification here implies all that he has said regarding holiness and sanctification in 1 Thessalonians. This means that it implies what Paul has said about having our heart established blameless in holiness, about preserving our body in sanctification, and about being sanctified wholly by the God of peace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FD5wMhKNj2Huej-D7E-dyKNKX_x7SOE1sL4V2CAk8maspa7jKZrOxRtFdjFAyS5AP">THE BRIDGE OF SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="CiuJkM8myLj3gRaotttDm2qJrZ5XXbSC3bDayCwwXbVkPgDgFsLfc-obOAEMXVMIO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94849" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2:13</span> neither sanctification nor salvation is a simple matter. When I was young, I regarded God’s salvation as something that was very simple. First I was eager to know definitely whether I had been saved. Eventually I came to know for sure that I had been saved. After that, I made salvation a major subject in my conversation with others. Whenever I met a person, I was eager to find out whether or not he was saved. Gradually I came to realize that salvation is not such a simple matter. Now if you would ask me if I have been saved, I would reply, “I have been saved, I am still being saved, and I shall be saved. Eventually, I shall be wholly, fully, and thoroughly saved.” </p>
<p data-content-id="PEFnGVjh4LKGapKMM5g-UE_QO2bCKW8Y2VXo5A7tlrWKoPMkP6nMEz4auOa2GQ2Bx"> Another way to ask about my experience of salvation would be to say something like this: “Brother Lee, you said that you have been saved, that you are now being saved, and that you will be saved thoroughly. Please tell us how much you have been saved. Also, how much are you being saved day by day? We know that you have been a Christian for more than fifty years. Please tell us how much of you has been saved and how much still needs to be saved.” I use these questions as an illustration of the fact that salvation is not a simple matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="-tmZ7zb6Iz2RRh_Lv0dg3New9btPRXEyRLV1MbKLF7wLf1f7KhddgW1O7dcJDEZbv"> If someone asks you if you have been saved and how much you have been saved, you should say, “I know that I have been saved. However, I cannot tell you how much I have been saved. But I do know that I need to be saved much more. I have participated in God’s salvation to some degree, but I need to participate in it to a far greater degree.” </p>
<p data-content-id="pdf92jB8fAvtrgeE6wLHUBsRuSDWn3OYABmNB_kFEGjqoxVMrWVdR8cSV2VoktwKQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94850" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2:13</span> Paul says that God chose us <em>unto</em> salvation. This salvation has a long span. According to what we are able to <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> understand, this span begins with regeneration and ends with glorification. Although we were fallen, sinful, and deadened, God came to regenerate us. Through regeneration, we began to participate in God’s salvation. However, regarding this salvation we have a long way to go. </p>

These two Epistles can be compared to writings that are for students in elementary school. However, even in elementary writings there may be certain basic elements. </p>
<p data-content-id="ThvmPKPIZKKf8RTbKq-4bESYwjoIgHRKOaYqSJqQuQvUjQAiloQURz8QRcC2_3R7O"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94858" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span> Paul speaks of salvation in sanctification of the Spirit. Here we have three basic elements: salvation, sanctification, and the Spirit. All these terms refer to basic elements of God’s salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="nOy_T6_o4z-aPBlF7bE1ZYMWzI-gR5fH4JjteIlMVN1YHoWpUijhSFlf1KvS3XWRT"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94859" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2:13</span>, God has chosen us unto salvation. The word “unto” means with a view to. Here Paul is saying that God has chosen us with a view to salvation; He has chosen us so that we may enter into salvation. In the foregoing message we pointed out that salvation here can be compared to a long bridge, to a bridge with a very long span. The bridge of God’s salvation reaches from time to eternity; it brings us out of this present age into eternity. God has chosen us with a view of bringing us onto this bridge. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6yNCPAAmuExORtzVOeWIpsaFdcJ6inOQzLbtnc_wNJtMC3zxyAhc6M1I8ZXrGjExK">CHOSEN FROM THE BEGINNING</h2><p data-content-id="Ksn_qbe9yE_G4B7lc-L8ltl2jm7-GjFJj8ft2eDSDNOTaSf6vSIzC3PqA3DTVTHqQ"> In order to understand these elementary writings to the Thessalonians, let us analyze some of the words and expressions used by Paul. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94860" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">Second Thessalonians 2:13</span> says, “But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” The phrase “from the beginning” in this verse refers to eternity past. God’s choosing is His selection. God the Father chose us, selected us, in eternity past. Paul speaks of this selection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94861" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>: “According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love.” God the Father in eternity had a plan, a purpose. For the fulfillment of this purpose He has selected us. We all have been selected by God. We have been chosen according to His foreknowledge. Long before we were born, even before the foundation of the world, God the Father saw us and knew us. When God saw us, He was happy with us. He may have said to Himself concerning you, “I want this one for My eternal purpose.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="lSh6ddoLRcmZXrMYx5Ut_uJG8mUfiZjmFgQv_56CDNDNKwM5LG1eGbS_1xDijWgHR">Jacob and Esau</h2><p data-content-id="Oheq2qM0gz9BUWu6-vun5ZLNwJjYNYvaE-b-JkRd10LT5Pz0poZ7MQo6jeqaEWYoM"> The case of Esau and Jacob is an illustration of God’s selection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94862" data-verses="Romans 9:13">Romans 9:13</span> says, “As it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” As God considered the twins, Esau and Jacob, He could say to Himself, “I don’t like Esau, the first one. I am not happy with him. I prefer the second one, Jacob, the supplanter.” </p>
<p data-content-id="42YjIFWmbNKZvD5t6Z6A1vN8mzBuIDoFluEvfc9kwGCcDeywquonxcdVZrKS2Jk93"> If you ask me to explain why God loves Jacob and hates Esau, I would have to answer that I am not able to explain it. I do not know why God loves Jacob, but hates Esau. Only He knows the reason. God has His own desire. The Bible tells us that God loved Jacob and hated Esau, but it does not give us the reason. </p>
<p data-content-id="oC_B6oqiERD6J9qh7NNGTj2rPVvkVNJSlucOgKe2pVS0wAu6xSHA3t7xh7AQSbB3i"> When I was young, I thought that God was unfair. It seemed to me that Esau was much better than Jacob. Jacob was a thief and a deceiver. Eventually, I had no choice but to accept what the Bible says regarding God’s loving Jacob and hating Esau. </p>
<p data-content-id="374jeXjOqsFcEa5VthFALjN9cSgQr_6LxVx6-lkX-gkvcE-BWmy2RMUaX4JPiDFay"> As those who have been selected by God the Father, we all are Jacobs. None of us is an Esau.

Because you were selected by God in eternity past, there is no point in trying to run away from Him. In a very real sense, God is a great fisherman, and He has “hooked” you. God hooked you in eternity. Therefore, there is no way you can get off His hook. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ya6HCXNJTegbGZE_s-yv69KWL6W28b31L_NZ-iTjwAwxW6U9d0mAFCJv1zZtp-s53"> In eternity past God spread many hooks attached to long strings.

Therefore, God the Son came to redeem us and accomplish what God had planned. Following that, God the Spirit came to apply what God had planned and what Christ, the Son of God, had accomplished. This application is sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="SOoxKfap_09mcKQ2b6aTIww5_w3Di-kerYYWeIo-6LVcm3aGBljukfIvQo4TOjtR7"> We may not have had any thought concerning God or any heart toward Christ. Nevertheless, one day we were caught by the Spirit, and the Spirit began to apply what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished. As a result, for no apparent reason, we came to believe in the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkirf6jqq1Opty6bcjwhQUGRhv6gmMzSuwKpDh7OjdiVoEMcq_4KVLq19w10ZXQBF"> Even though our friends, neighbors, schoolmates, and associates may not believe in Christ, we cannot help believing in Him. I can testify of this from my own experience. One day I began to love the Lord Jesus. I have never seen Him, but I love Him. He is so good to me! Others may say that this is superstitious and regard Jesus as nothing. To them I would say, “You may not care for the Lord Jesus, but I love Him.” This is not any kind of superstition. It is the application of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="eocYGXR0AYEX3IQ7DynS6ASeJKctFP9hJllixvqPcFFHO0NeWbrBZ1GZpirQG6ok1"> As we have pointed out, the application of the Spirit is what Paul means in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94863" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2:13</span> by sanctification. When we receive the application of the Spirit, we are separated to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="5co62Vu8uSHAaS_vDbh2JXI3G-q3lY4QxvvYqtaoSzhYynADM62ivcKy_oBesnoS0"> My friends and classmates could not understand what had happened to me, and I myself could not explain it. I only <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> know that, at the age of nineteen, I suddenly lost my interest in other things and cared only for the Lord. I loved to pray, call on the Lord’s name, read the Bible, go to meetings, and tell others how lovable the Lord Jesus is. Certain people wondered who hired me to do this. I told them, “I have not been hired by anyone. Rather, I am willing to spend as much money as possible to print tracts that I myself have written.” This was my early experience of the sanctification of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="N3IWAERqJ7ltG-hqURXRWdOPftDOXONcDYLsmOI1M28TR-zRHFd6Yaxk7ijLeyz9P"> When I was a young person, I loved to play soccer. One day, after I was saved, I was playing soccer. At a certain time, when the ball came to me, something within said, “Stop! Don’t play any longer. Leave the soccer field.” All the players were shocked; they did not know what had happened to me. Then I walked off the field and told them that I would not play soccer any longer. That was an experience of the sanctification of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="tGMWwDGLxfSvO5ACMgOJl9ieQLCaPeqKOrZgx-xd-LtsWoxXdZ0BUvc2hvUV_OFXr"> Many of us can give testimonies concerning the Spirit’s sanctification.

<p data-content-id="h6RUd25GbdpHboHyApPW2Nwb2vHiyrR2fleVNlGjXMGu-KvThHZL8EX_tXiciGCj7"> Because we have experienced the application of the Spirit, we do not have the freedom to do certain things that others are able to do. This is not a matter of teaching; it is a matter of God the Spirit living within us. </p>

<p data-content-id="MHran90qcP0lcXT3fU1sygYvLAt6QDYAt-VBwaj275eKojXdmDdpoRxK6WchljVpe"> I believe that many of the sisters can testify that being sanctified by the Spirit affects their shopping. Because they have been sanctified by the Spirit, their shopping has become different. As they are considering the purchase of a particular item, the Spirit within them may say, “Don’t touch that.” The Spirit may say no much more than He says yes. No one teaches the sisters to change their way of shopping. The different way of shopping is the result of the sanctification of the Spirit.

After speaking concerning profound matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94873" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2:13—3:5</span>, Paul goes on to give a word concerning correction of the disorderly walk. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94874" data-verses="2Thessalonians 3:6">3:6</span> he says, “Now we charge you, brothers, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the tradition which you received from us.” A disorderly walk is not only according to the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94875" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Rom. 8:4</span>), but is also against the building up of the church life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94876" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:11">1 Thes. 5:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94877" data-verses="Romans 14:19">Rom. 14:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94878" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:23">1 Cor. 10:23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="CiuJkM8myLj3gRaotttDm2qJrZ5XXbSC3bDayCQweL1kPgDgFsLfc-obOAEMXVMIO"> It may seem that walking disorderly is a small point. Nevertheless, it certainly is practical. I believe that the disorderliness in Thessalonica came from the misconception regarding the Lord’s coming back. Some believers thought that the Lord Jesus would be coming back soon, and therefore it was not necessary for them to work. Their concept may have been that as long as they had something to eat and could survive, that was adequate. Those who have such a concept become “superbelievers.” They go above the level of proper spirituality. </p>
<p data-content-id="PEFnGVjh4LKGapKMM5g-UE_QO2bCKW8Y2VXo5Abtt7mKoPMkP6nMEz4auOa2GQ2Bx"> Several years ago, a number of the young people thought that as long as they loved the Lord Jesus and were living the church life, it was not necessary for them to have a higher education. They thought it was adequate to do some kind of <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> simple work. I came to know the situation and realized that this concept is absolutely wrong. We live in an age when it is necessary to have an education. In order to live properly in this age, we need a good education. Without the right kind of education, it would not be easy for us to make a living. I gave a strong word to the young people encouraging them to complete college and, if possible, to go on to graduate school. Furthermore, I encouraged them to study subjects such as medicine or law. I am thankful that this word was widely accepted by the young people. During the years that followed, many completed their education. Now they can testify how much help they received from that word. </p>
<p data-content-id="CiuJkM8myLj3gRaotttDm2qJrZ5XXbSC3bDayCQwXZVkPgDgFsLfc-obOAEMXVMIO"> Do not think that as long as we are spiritual, seek the Lord, and are for the Lord’s testimony and recovery, there is no need for us to be prepared for work through good education. We live in an age of education, knowledge, science, and industry. If the young people do not have a proper education, it will be difficult for them to have a proper human living. Therefore, I encourage all the young people to gain a good education. </p>
<p data-content-id="PEFnGVjh4LKGapKMM5g-UE_QO2bCKW8Y2VXo5AbtlpWKoPMkP6nMEz4auOa2GQ2Bx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94879" data-verses="2Thessalonians 3:6">verse 6</span> Paul charges the believers to keep away from any brother who walks disorderly. This indicates that Paul considers it a serious matter to walk disorderly, for this is a damage to the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="-tmZ7zb6Iz2RRh_Lv0dg3New9btPRXEyRLV1MbqLG7QLf1f7KhddgW1O7dcJDEZbv"> At this point I would like to say that it is better not to do anything with which the brothers would not agree. If you want to do a certain thing and the brothers do not feel good about it, you should hesitate and reconsider. The fellowship of the brothers is a protection and a safeguard. It will preserve you in the church life. Perhaps you think that you know more than the brothers. This may actually be the situation. Nevertheless, it is always safe to listen to the brothers. This is a good protection and safeguard. </p>
<p data-content-id="pdf92jB8fAvtrgeE6wLHUBsRuSDWn3OYABmNB_EFHGDqoxVMrWVdR8cSV2VoktwKQ"> Paul tells us not to keep company with one who is disorderly. If you keep company with such a one, you may encourage him to continue in his disorderly living. Staying away from him will serve as a warning to him. It will also help to keep you from making the same kind of mistake. <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vckU8Pa7Na64q3WdiTrUbc1iZVbvl2LSOjKohm3tpicRb9RTW9-i65evn5IdOziHv"> Walking disorderly is upsetting to the church life. If we would have a proper church life, we need to learn to walk in an orderly way and to stay away from anyone who walks disorderly. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="W5CeSNbZsRTgQ48Ch9dy0bOvAchR6cKoeDQznlg7F5n9_ICjYpfwuSuyGm-FDc5Ov">THE PATTERN OF THE APOSTLES</h2><p data-content-id="2_LZ0fqqAgn2B6_EnBmqfXmCDCIR2hGJPRfyYj-DS1M6xJl3S3hPg4RI9UDbVn6xy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94880" data-verses="2Thessalonians 3:7-9">verses 7 through 9</span> Paul reminds the Thessalonians that, in the matter of orderly living, the apostles were a pattern to them: “For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not disorderly among you; nor did we eat bread as a gift from anyone, but in labor and hardship we worked night and day that we might not be burdensome to any of you; not that we do not have the right, but that we might give ourselves to you as a pattern to imitate us.” The apostles were for the building up of the church in all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94881" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:19">2 Cor. 12:19</span>). They were absolutely not disorderly among the believers, but were a pattern for the believers to imitate. </p>
<p data-content-id="ut_4HR9tQBJrODh_JvNb8dbzq10TU3HVA1mzV1NCcJXU4VSPQpvEB_J-sylttpEVy"> Because of the influence of the religious background, Christians often say, “We do not follow a man. We are following the Lord. You should not imitate any man. Instead, you need only to imitate the Lord.” In a sense, this is right. However, it is not easy to follow the Lord directly, since none of us has ever met Him physically. Some who insist on following only the Lord may reply, “We should study the four Gospels and see how the Lord Jesus walked. Then we shall be able to follow in His footsteps.” However, in many things related to our human living, there are not any footsteps of the Lord to follow. For example, He was never married. How, then, can you follow Him in your married life? We can follow Him indirectly by following other believers. There were practical reasons for Paul to charge the Corinthian believers to follow him as he followed the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94882" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:1">1 Cor. 11:1</span>). Because Paul was an imitator of Christ, we should be imitators of Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="fscvgkEkxhNpM8Vc5vkFpzARE33UVFjxKagU6wIuO0JrBqimu4Nxmb8q3y7jaLTpS"> Of course, following another believer depends on the situation. Suppose an archbishop comes to us and tells us to follow <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> him. We would have to say, “Dear archbishop, we cannot follow you or imitate you in being an archbishop.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Iem6ViKW3i4IuA6uYQpxLleMPSubStgYZ9nsEtpBQtRkq-60KLQHr6YB3f88jMoTi"> Many believers today are confused concerning whom to follow and whom not to follow, whom to imitate and whom not to imitate. But in the Lord’s recovery we have been enlightened through the Lord’s speaking. I would not encourage you to follow any particular person. Using Paul’s word, I would encourage you to follow “the tradition which you received from us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94883" data-verses="2Thessalonians 3:6">2 Thes. 3:6</span>). By tradition Paul means teachings and instructions, given verbally or in writing. We cannot deny that in the Lord’s recovery we have His speaking, teaching, and instruction. Although I would not ask you to imitate a particular person, I would urge you to pay heed to all of the speaking, teaching, and instruction you have received. These are the traditions from the Lord, and we should follow them. Because these traditions are free from the influence of the religious background, it is safe for anyone to follow them. </p>
<p data-content-id="Hb93lhUGWTZUHDTLb3G3XijLui3YIpaBX1_SMbvyRXObuVPlFg6HhWX8UvvzGW7XW"> In this chapter, Paul encourages the believers not simply to follow his walk, but especially to follow his instructions, his teachings. This is to walk according to the tradition the believers received from the apostles. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XR35ae1JSCOtRZ1kuqCxCbi--lC6yLoTsys3-xBeZauey8lUuttoH3KuKmGIkEbY5">THE MEANING OF WALKING DISORDERLY</h2><p data-content-id="kZubgiXIc9oqhXV3mItCyoSFomNtHm-idbBZqo1eSPyezxXlB8ETi2F4IwSZO9A69"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94884" data-verses="2Thessalonians 3:7-8">Verses 7 and 8</span> indicate what it primarily means to walk disorderly. According to the context, to walk disorderly here is not to work and yet to still eat. If anyone does not work and yet eats, he walks disorderly. But because the apostles were not disorderly, they did not eat bread as a gift from anyone. Rather, they worked night and day in order not to be burdensome to the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="JCqaKDQ0RnTy92uQXTNQ47efpTot_zg3PkYZTHREJi0wareX4qDrqBimbo7S-2uYn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94885" data-verses="2Thessalonians 3:10">verse 10</span> Paul goes on to say, “For even when we were with you, we gave you this charge, that if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.” It is disorderly not to work and yet to eat. However, a brother would be walking orderly if he did not work and also did not eat. It is not working and yet eating that causes one to be disorderly. </p>
<p data-content-id="zw2kr8RDurnNkN6TzSVBffllvTpi2FBPtuevaZ8BImOMtiHfxWJYeOUDxpvaTSOKM"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94886" data-verses="2Thessalonians 3:11">Verse 11</span> says, “For we hear of some walking among you disorderly, working at nothing, but busybodies.” They were <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> busy but “working at nothing,” busy only with what was not their own business. Busybodies are nobody, and with them there is no Body of Christ. None of us should be busybodies. We all must learn to be busy, that is, to do our own work properly. </p>
