<h1 class="title" data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPcMxpPqcwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm">A FOREWORD</h1><p data-content-id="LsMUGHoOAyglcgXHKOT_7NAP5Q-wBBYWGd_3K1-drcYapSz78FtH6UNrSlSq3kKsG"> The book of Hebrews is profound and rich. It is profound in the heavenly concepts and rich in the heavenly inheritance. In our Life-study of Hebrews, we shall be concerned with the profound concepts of this book and with its heavenly inheritance. We need to plunge into the depths of this book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6CS1FvM6XM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX">I. THE BACKGROUND</h2><p data-content-id="Z-QbeF7eFSCsrR20PWwNDndXjOdizFUNBnmIQqNZgJ_0WMRdgwQ1A7MTTYXlofxbP"> If we are to enter into the concepts and riches of the book of Hebrews, we must understand the background of its writing. This is crucial. It is difficult for anyone to gain information concerning Hebrews. We are not told the name of the author and it is not clearly mentioned to whom the book was written. Hebrews is absolutely different from all of the other Epistles. It has its own peculiar character. All of the other Epistles begin by telling us by whom and to whom they were written. However, Hebrews begins in this way: “In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96256" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>). Who wrote this book? The Bible does not tell us. To whom was it written? It is altogether a mystery, for the Bible does not tell us that either. This is the reason that very few Christians know this book well. </p>
<p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCarJPt7-2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> The Epistle to the Hebrews is not superficial. It is exceedingly deep. So, I say again that we need to plunge into this book. Do not stand on the surface and gaze at it. Dive into it and discover the treasures that are beneath the surface. Whenever you read one verse of this book, you must <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> read its context. For one verse you probably will need to read a few chapters. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssARDSgXngzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr">A. The Receivers Were Hebrew Believers</h2><p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7NjwIEiZ8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> Although the book of Hebrews does not itself say to whom it was written, it was written to the Hebrew believers. The saints who collected the divine writings in the early days entitled this book “the Epistle to the Hebrews.” This is very interesting. Why does it say “to the Hebrews” and not to the Jews or Israelites? </p>
<p data-content-id="Nra_GgDpimpsPAo0RrC1bOLHewU642dTAWC_1CYoST56PQUyLyIACiL2qjOnKIM8F"> For many years I was troubled by this word Hebrews. I studied much in the attempt to learn the meaning of this word. I became familiar with different schools of opinion. One school says that the word <em>Hebrew</em> denotes a descendant of Eber, a son of Shem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96257" data-verses="Genesis 10:21">Gen. 10:21</span>). Since Eber may be spelled Heber in Greek, some Bible students have thought that the Hebrews are descendants of Eber. Although I adopted this school for a while, I did so with a question mark. Later, after further study, I could no longer agree with this school because Eber had more than one son. Eber had two sons, Peleg and Joktan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96258" data-verses="Genesis 10:25">Gen. 10:25</span>), and Abraham was a descendant of Peleg. If you say that Abraham’s descendants should be called Hebrews because they are the descendants of Eber, the same should be true of the descendants of Joktan, Eber’s second son. Thus, this school of opinion is illogical. Furthermore, the Bible says that Abraham had two sons, Isaac and Ishmael. If Abraham’s descendants are called Hebrews because they are the descendants of Eber, then all the Arabs, who are also descendants of Abraham, should be called Hebrews. But this is ridiculous! Therefore, this interpretation is illogical; it is neither believable nor trustworthy. </p>
<p data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCH7rKOnvQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv"> After further study, I learned that the word <em>Hebrew</em> was first used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96259" data-verses="Genesis 14:13">Genesis 14:13</span>, at the time when Abraham was about to fight for the rescue of his nephew Lot. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96260" data-verses="Genesis 14:13">Genesis 14:13</span> says, “And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew.” Abraham was a Hebrew. As a result of considerable study, we discovered that the root of the word <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> <em>Hebrew</em> means “to pass over.” It especially means to pass over a river from one region to another and from one side to another. Therefore, the word <em>Hebrew</em> means a crosser, a river crosser, one who crosses a river. Abraham was a river crosser. He crossed that great flood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96261" data-verses="Joshua 24:2-3">Josh. 24:2-3</span>). Abraham crossed the Euphrates. The Euphrates is the modern name of that great river which in Hebrew is called Perath. That great river separated the old region out of which Abraham was called from the new land into which he entered. </p>
<p data-content-id="hZwxam6lXwmH0E7Nl83pZkiEtLda-ocuqHw2FtYp_6HHqSCdwcI5BmEdEnDTEQuNB"> Abraham was born in Chaldea, the site of ancient Babylon, Babel. Between Chaldea and the good land of Canaan was a great river flowing from north to south. This is very meaningful. All things, including the land, were created by God to fulfill His purpose. The land of Chaldea became satanic, devilish, and demonic. It was a land filled with idols, a land totally usurped by God’s enemy and possessed by the evil one. So God intervened to call Abraham out of that idolatrous land, out of that land which had been usurped, possessed, poisoned, corrupted, and ruined by Satan. God simply called Abraham out without telling him where he should go (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96262" data-verses="Hebrews 11:8">11:8</span>). Abraham had to look to the Lord step by step, saying to Him, “Lord, where should I go?” Abraham knew what he had to leave, but he did not know where he was to go. Eventually God led him to that great river, and Abraham crossed it. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96263" data-verses="Joshua 24:2-3">Joshua 24:2-3</span> says that Abraham “dwelt on the other side of the flood” and that the Lord took him from “the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan.” Therefore, a Hebrew is a person from the other side of the water. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzeKpxpvQVUylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> Now we can understand the real meaning of baptism. Why must all repentant people be baptized? Because the world in which we are has been usurped, possessed, corrupted, and ruined by God’s enemy. It is no longer good for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. God’s salvation is not merely to rescue us from hell to heaven. God’s salvation is to bring us out of the land that has been possessed and ruined by Satan. How can we pass out of it? By being baptized. Every baptistery is a great river, a great flood. After you <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> have been baptized, you come out on the other shore. Hallelujah! I am one who has crossed over from the other side. Are you still on the other side? You may be on the other side, but I am on this side. I have crossed the great river. I am a Hebrew, a river crosser. What are you—American, Chinese, British, German, New Zealander, Japanese, Filipino, Mexican? We must all declare, “We are Hebrews! We are typical Hebrews.” We are not Jews, but we are Hebrews. We are the true, genuine Hebrews because we have passed over the river. Everyone among us is a real river crosser. </p>
<p data-content-id="MIJlxkLQwGUFWpXbCXJwGvlpzdFJswqiU3Ejc76p9XUT9kubZPaV9POS3G28RP-sM"> As we have seen, the first river crosser, the first Hebrew, was Abraham. Abraham was called by God and passed over the great river Euphrates, entering into the land where God eventually built His temple. The land which Abraham entered was a good land, a holy land, the land in which God’s house was built. God stayed there in His house. It was not His motel; it was His habitation on earth. On the other side were the idols, the devilish things, and all the works of Satan. On this side was God’s temple with His shekinah glory. What separated these two sides? A great river. </p>
<p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-nYaYCFGzlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> Even before the time of Abraham there was a man who was a flood crosser—Noah. Noah passed over the flood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96264" data-verses="1Peter 3:20-21">1 Pet. 3:20-21</span>). That flood separated him from the old, crooked, perverse, and evil generation. The flood separated him from the devilish world and ushered him into a new land where he built an altar and offered sacrifices. Noah passed over the flood, and Abraham crossed over the great river. The principle in each case is the same. </p>
<p data-content-id="iP_bgkHD-VyM-lbYNnOmns4Nq2-wBR5Dynf2bHQ8WpjrkRIRPrECHRAQWFcx0WQUb"> What about Abraham’s descendants? The children of Israel crossed the water of the Red Sea. The principle was the same. After they had crossed the sea and reached the other side, they sang and danced. They could say, “Egypt, you are on the other side. We are on this side!” What did they do after they reached the other side? They built God’s tabernacle. They did not engage in business, not even farming, for a period of forty years. There were no schools, sanctuaries, cathedrals, seminaries, or Bible institutes. There <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> was nothing but the tabernacle. What was on the other side of the sea? All the Egyptian, worldly things. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGH8MvfFQsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_">GOD HAS SPOKEN</h1><p data-content-id="W1iZtRdq2EaOvu-m8SfI_jqybQ9_rOlrXR3fm3GUzcPU0O7qbBBiKxEFUeCJG_ERL"> The book of Hebrews begins with God speaking. The divine speaking is the opening point of this book. God has spoken! Praise Him! It is absolutely not a small thing that God has spoken. Without speaking God is mysterious. But He has revealed Himself in His speaking. He is no longer mysterious. Now He is the revealed God. </p>
<p data-content-id="2p-Clb9asquxf4mQ9n64l4FN-fz_IFbKGR1gkxbP1RjXC1oK7CumV6zeFKsjKYYc6"> The emphasis of this book is that God, not man, has spoken. Therefore, it does not mention who the writer of this book is, nor, in all its quotations from the Old Testament, does it mention the speakers’ names. According to the concept of this book, the entire Scripture is the speaking of God. Hence, when it refers to the Old Testament, it always says that it was the Holy Spirit’s speaking (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96310" data-verses="Hebrews 3:7">3:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96311" data-verses="Hebrews 9:8">9:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96312" data-verses="Hebrews 10:15-17">10:15-17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="u4VI6PwMV9YLyodQonZhQg1Swt-vTx71vxZI3U8v6Kn8u6sybJckax5dbxTnzWMOb"> We need to consider this matter of God’s speaking. If there were a God in the universe, what would be the first thing that He would do? Certainly, before doing anything else, He would speak. If God is living, He must certainly speak. If He is real, His speaking testifies His reality. If He is moving, He will move by speaking. If He is working, He will surely work by speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="fuOTOIbl26ICXoDfOfmOyeE28x-5N_EbrL-zVhjSApM5ECRzMvL1jcqgw8vvh-fDb"> A living person is a speaking person. If you are a living person, I do not believe that you will be able to be silent for even one hour. If you are at home alone, you will find that you simply must speak. If you do not speak to the angels, you may speak to something or to yourself. A living person must speak. </p>
<p data-content-id="IUDJqdl9X6vy3Vq-crvLcerhlKVwghlxQoAehr9Bor-YhLUZxsqlKZZQEkrirqIrE"> Our God is living! So our God is speaking, and His speaking testifies that He is living. We know that our God is living <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> because He speaks. How foolish it is to say that there is no God! Have you not heard His speaking? God has spoken! Since eternity, this speaking God has spoken millions of times. If He never spoke, then where did the Bible come from? No one can deny the wisdom expressed in the Bible. If not every sentence, then at least a great many sentences in the Bible could never have come out of a human mind. One great French philosopher has said that if the four gospels were falsehoods and there were no Christ, then the person who wrote the gospels is fully qualified to be Christ. If you do not believe that the writer of the gospels is qualified to be Christ, then you try to write such books. Who can utter things in such a profound and wise way? Peter was a Galilean fisherman and John was a mender of nets. They did not graduate from a university. Where did they get their wisdom? “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96313" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96314" data-verses="John 1:4">4</span>). Who can utter such simple yet such profound words? Certainly not a little mender of nets from Galilee. Only God Himself can speak in this way. How can you say that there is no God? Can you find another book to compare with the Bible? There is no other book that can compare with it. The Bible is the book among all books because it bears profound wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="H4ftD0nM_HqTnTBTZI6vl_7DUR-OM11qPJmRIviZqwZm5FkPIartulj8dlWnhx9NX"> The Bible also bears light. No other book enlightens people as does this book. Many of you who are reading these messages are very well educated. You have read many books and newspapers. Please tell me, have you been enlightened by any of those books or newspapers? Whenever people read the newspapers, they are darkened, veiled, drugged, doped, and befuddled. However, so many of us can testify that whenever we come to the Bible, regardless of the chapter, the light shines upon us. Light may even shine through such a verse as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96315" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3:1</span>, a verse that speaks about the serpent. Perhaps light may not shine immediately because you are not ready. The light is ready to shine, but you are not ready to open up to it. Eventually, however, the light comes. </p>
<p data-content-id="afNFn9OFFhiGx4i5yPayuXbQJUgPwOHF65dbAP4BbUq6H0aWVC2NiuPeDe_39lWHN"> Let us use <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96316" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3:1</span> as an example. “Now the serpent <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.” One morning, a young sister read through this verse and it got into her. As she read that verse early in the morning, she had no understanding of it. Later on in the day, one of her schoolmates came to her with a certain kind of temptation. Immediately, the word came to that young sister, “The serpent was more subtle.” The more her schoolmate talked, the more this word came to her. Eventually this sister said within herself, “Little serpent, get away from me.” Throughout my ministry I have heard hundreds of these kinds of testimonies. </p>
<p data-content-id="bL3_vIKwgozM1X2VsKZqF2ALVG0mDEIoUOwwkTFE2jCXoezsRLTSk_IdHBfxVvI3_"> People are enlightened by reading the divine Word. Can anyone testify of being enlightened as a result of reading a magazine or newspaper? There are no such testimonies, because such writings are not the Word of God. But the whole Bible is a composition of the speaking of God. If you put the word <em>Satan</em> in a newspaper, it means nothing, but when you read it in the Bible, especially when you pray-read over it, you are enlightened and Satan is exposed. </p>
<p data-content-id="qKxtcI35M3YEACqdkwu3E4IAhTXcUUjY_hyL2HgqHBT9dM7ruT_ZFMeT5R17JOoOA"> Many times we are not only enlightened by the Word, but are enlivened, quickened, and made alive. Try to pray with the words of a newspaper and see what happens. The more you repeat the words, the more you will be darkened and killed. However, when you pray-read the Bible, you are made alive. This is a strong proof that the Holy Bible is God’s speaking. God has spoken! More than a hundred times I have seen great sinners saved just by reading one verse of the Bible. In an instant their whole life was changed. That was the result of the working of the Holy Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="ypPAS58zX4Yp4txU9VRAT6eABFSToz5xsxInBUpzhFwkU2SoOph-gkqdH4Klv2TIx"> God has spoken and He is still speaking today. He is speaking to your heart and in your spirit. How do we know that our God is living? Because He speaks to us. How do we know that He is moving and working? Because He speaks. Consider your experience in the past forty-eight hours. Can you say that during that time God has not spoken to you? So many of us can testify that during the past forty-eight hours we have heard God speaking. We know that He is real, <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> living, and moving because He speaks. Where is God? God is in His speaking. He is speaking day by day. </p>
<p data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LDCcRH-pwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR"> What is God’s speaking? God’s speaking is not only the Word; it is also His breathing. When God speaks, He breathes Himself into us. Whenever God speaks to you, He gets into you. Therefore, whenever you listen to God’s speaking or take the Word of God, you will be involved with God. He bothers us constantly by His speaking. I do not know how many times I have been bothered by Him. If you do not want to get involved with God, you had better close your ears when He is speaking. His speaking is constant. He will never swallow His words. Once He breathes His Word out, He will never take it back. Suppose God says to you, “Go to your wife and apologize to her.” You may argue, saying, “Why must I go to her and apologize? I can’t do it.” But the word continues to come to you, “Go and apologize.” Some who have not obeyed such a word from the Lord have testified that even in their dreams they have expressed His word to go and apologize. The wife is awakened and says, “What do you mean, ‘Go and apologize’?” God spoke to that brother to go and apologize to his wife. He did not do it. So eventually in his dreams he spoke the words, “Go and apologize.” God’s speaking is that constant. </p>
<p data-content-id="0LzTaf-UCCdfAz45OTRuafhTMmpWe9bD9g-xeDycbaQml7QnmCMyvs8NwZmgFWFwe"> In 1925 I began to hear the Lord’s speaking to me. Although for eight years I did not obey Him, that word never left me. Week after week, I argued with God and reasoned with Him. I said to Him, “No, I can’t do it.” He did not argue with me. When I reasoned, He was quiet. When my reasoning ceased, He began to speak again. I said, “Lord, I’ve heard this already.” Nevertheless, although He did not say a word when I argued with Him, when I was quiet, He spoke again and again for a period of eight years. Eventually I had no choice except to listen to Him and surrender. I obeyed and the speaking stopped. Once we obey, that speaking stops. </p>

He is altogether a mystery. But this mystery has been revealed by God’s speaking. Without the divine speaking, God would remain forever unknowable. But our God no longer is mysterious. He is not a mystery, but a story. The story of God is absolutely a matter of speaking. God has a history, and His history is a speaking story. We can tell the story of God. The story of God is a matter of continual speaking; it is a speaking history. </p>
<p data-content-id="bL3_vIKwgozM1X2VsKZqF2QLRUEmDEIoUOwwkTFE2jCXoezsRLTSk_IdHBfxVvI3_"> Firstly, God spoke through some people who were chosen and moved by Him. He spoke in various ways through Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham. After Abraham, God spoke through Moses and many other chosen ones—priests, kings, and prophets. Everyone who spoke for God, whether he was a king or a prophet, was motivated by God’s Spirit. Therefore, the history of God is a history of speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="qKxtcI35M3YEACqdkwu3E4YAmBXcUUjY_hyL2HgqHBT9dM7ruT_ZFMeT5R17JOoOA"> After God spoke through so many different kinds of people, through high and low, educated and uneducated, kings and shepherds, His speaking was still insufficient. Regardless of how much these people were used to speak for God, their speaking was not adequate. God had to speak by Himself directly. So He came in the person of the Son. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96353" data-verses="Hebrews 1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> says that God has spoken to us in the Son. According to the Recovery Version of Hebrews, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96354" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1">1:1</span> there is a definite article before the word <em>prophets.</em> However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96355" data-verses="Hebrews 1:2">1:2</span> the definite article before <em>Son</em> is in italics, indicating that this word is not in the Greek text, but that it is necessary for the sake of English idiom. In the English language it is difficult to say, “God spoke to us in Son.” Some of the better <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> versions say, “God has spoken to us in the person of the Son.” Even the Amplified Version uses the phrase <em>in the person of a Son.</em> This means God Himself speaks in the person of the Son. Formerly He spoke through the prophets; now He speaks in the Son. We must see that the Son is different from all the prophets. All of the prophets were men used by God to speak for Him, but the Son is God Himself speaking. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96356" data-verses="Hebrews 1:2">Verse 2</span> says that God has spoken to us in the Son, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96357" data-verses="Hebrews 1:8">verse 8</span> tells us that the Son is God. This indicates that God speaks in Himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96358" data-verses="Hebrews 1:2">verse 2</span> it seems that God and the Son are two, for it says that God spoke in the Son. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96359" data-verses="Hebrews 1:8">verse 8</span> it is evident that the Son and God are one, for the Son is addressed, “O God.” To say that God has spoken in the Son means that God speaks in Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="ypPAS58zX4Yp4txU9VRAT6OAHXCToz5xsxInBUpzhFwkU2SoOph-gkqdH4Klv2TIx"> In the four gospels the Son came. He came to speak God, not only with clear words, but also with what He was and what He did. He is altogether the Word of God and the speaking of God. Sometimes He spoke with words and other times He spoke with actions. All that He was and all that He did spoke God. “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96360" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LDCMROtJwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR"> The Son is the Word, the speaking, the expression, and the definition of God. When the Son speaks, His word is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96361" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>). Eventually, to the churches, He is the speaking Spirit. At the beginning of each of the seven epistles in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96362" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span>, the Son speaks, but at the end of each epistle, it is the Spirit speaking to the churches. God speaks in the Son, and when the Son speaks to the churches, He is the speaking Spirit. By His speaking the churches will become one with Him. At the end of Revelation the Spirit and the church speak as one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96363" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Rev. 22:17</span>). God speaks in the Son, the Son becomes the speaking Spirit, and the speaking Spirit is one with the church speaking for God. This is the speaking history of our God, a history that is a speaking story. </p>
<p data-content-id="0LzTaf-UCCdfAz45OTRuafxTE1ZWe9bD9g-xeDycbaQml7QnmCMyvs8NwZmgFWFwe"> This speaking story is recorded in the Bible. The entire Bible is a history of God. As we have seen, this history is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> speaking story. When God created all things, He did so by speaking. When He contacted humanity in the Old Testament times, He did it by speaking in the prophets. When He came to mankind in the New Testament age, He spoke in the Son, in the Person of the Son as His Word. How does He come into the churches today? By speaking as the speaking Spirit. By speaking as the Spirit, He makes Himself one with the churches. Eventually, this speaking story not only consists of Himself, but also of all the churches. Meeting after meeting, the church life is a speaking story. We are a speaking people. By this speaking God is transfused into people. By this speaking so many human beings are being infused and saturated with the divine element. This is the church life. This is God speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41ZwkZ9mIMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg"> The book of Hebrews is a book of God’s speaking. The essence of the letter to the Hebrews is God speaking in the Son. God speaks in the Son, the Son speaks as the Spirit to the churches, and ultimately the Spirit speaks with the church. It is altogether by this speaking story that God is brought into man and man is brought into God. God and man, man and God, become one. This is the wonderful church life. </p>

The Effulgence of God’s Glory</h2><p data-content-id="6ZZlu4J5HfdMhfEfUJ3LkNT5uSWBO4c3a__L7gn1p3skFN8-BJcPmokYabiuqvwyt"> The writer of the letter to the Hebrews, being absolutely in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, had the wisdom to say that the Son is the effulgence of God’s glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96365" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">1:3</span>). The effulgence of God’s glory is like the shining or brightness of the rays of the sun. The Son is the shining, the brightness of God’s glory. Can you separate the effulgence from the glory? This is like separating the shining of the sun from the rays of the sun. It cannot be done, for the shining and the rays are one. Consider the example of electric lights. Can we say <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> that light is one thing and electricity is another? Absolutely not. Light is simply the expression of electricity. Electricity is a mystery. Has anyone ever seen electricity? Although it is a mystery, it is nevertheless a reality. How can you tell that electricity is in a certain room? By looking at the lights. Light is the effulgence of the glory of electricity. Likewise, we should never consider the Son as separate from God. The Son is the expression of God Himself. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dnsjqiii8WCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0">CHRIST AS THE SON OF GOD—AS GOD<br/>SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS</h1><p data-content-id="r-B8nUhR9J6hUII4QNKnBknltEL3T1u_Sm-0_l_AMtHeXEMBTrWU2cmFAvJnaebii"> The book of Hebrews is a book of comparisons. It compares God’s economy in Christ with the Old Testament things. A good number of the Hebrew believers, to whom this book was written, appreciated faith in Christ and the salvation in Christ, but they also appreciated their old religious background, which was established by God according to the Old Testament. It was not heathen or pagan. It was not an invention of human imagination; it was established according to God’s oracles. God had told their forefathers to set up the temple rites and rituals and the Levitical service. Thus, it was commanded, established, and even blessed by God. The Hebrew believers came out of such a background. But since they had also seen something in Christ, they were troubled. We would feel the same way if we were in their situation. The Hebrew believers were bothered by these two ends—Christ and their old background. Both were of God and now they had to make a choice between them. The Hebrew believers were hesitating on the bridge. They had not left the other side, but rather were on the edge of the border. They were being called to go on, to cross the river, to pass over. They were not involved in idolatry, for the holy temple had been erected for the purpose of worshipping the God of their forefathers. In the Levitical service, the priests offered the sacrifices ordained by God and burned the incense as He had required. It was difficult for the Hebrew believers to completely give this up. They held these two ends with their two hands, holding Christ in the one <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> hand and their forefathers’ religion in the other. This was the background of their situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="dY63Ns4YQPAy0AY63eLj4ewJuvKw209Dd3yRfmCJvmFRPo7bCwFO5qUAj0SHHhN9d"> In addition to this, they faced problems in their environment. A persecution was raised up against them. Although they loved their old religion, the high priest in that religion took the lead to persecute them, making their situation very clear. Perhaps he said to them, “If you want to be an Israelite, stay with us. Forget about Christ and the Christians. If you want to be with the Christians, you must leave us. Get out! We will not even allow you to have your living among us.” That was the situation of the Hebrew believers when the book of Hebrews was written to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qpdn89MhLxfVrIv8GWTBcUSsTZw55oZqOEuk2qvXDTa4ELyWoRmN1r_WYV01cf7Lc"> In this letter we see the wisdom of the Lord’s Spirit. He did not rebuke them. There is no rebuking spirit, no rebuking word, and no rebuking tone. Rebuking does not work very well. The Lord the Spirit chose the best way to help them—the way of making a comparison. The best way to help our children is to give them a comparison. Let them compare white with black, Christ with religion, the church with the world, heaven with hell, and then let them make their choice. This was the way taken by the writer of this book. In a full way, he presents what is in God’s economy, showing the superiority of Christ as compared with their old religion. That religion served as a black background. Without a black background, the white will not appear to be so white. In order to show the whiteness of white you need a black background. Remember this principle: in the book of Hebrews there is always a comparison. </p>
<p data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw5S27tNjq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF"> What are the main items in Judaism, the things that the Jewish forefathers held as treasures? In Judaism, the typical and genuine religion formed and established according to the Old Testament, the major item is God. God is their boast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96402" data-verses="Romans 2:17">Rom. 2:17</span>). In no other religion do people have such a God. Buddhism, for example, is nonsense and should not even be called a religion. Religion helps people to worship God, to serve God, and to behave in a manner pleasing to God. There is no God in Buddhism, only a dumb Buddha. According to Buddhism, everyone can become a Buddha. Buddhism teaches <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> that if you behave yourself, eventually you will become a Buddha. This is absolutely devilish. </p>
<p data-content-id="lkvZM26z559Bj3lTSOUy6cZugokXSx0PljTjoOkXjCBX2Rdfb66sdAUBGOBf9pyrf"> Likewise, the teachings of Confucius should not be considered as a religion. Confucius never taught religion. His teachings are altogether ethical. In his teachings on ethics and morality, Confucius only mentioned God a few times. He simply advised people not to offend God, for, if they did, there was no way to be forgiven. </p>
<p data-content-id="ONTNfoex8_cVo12DfRG59lXGCVfSxsp3NoQW_8wi-97vKUKUb_GzJXFfUITjZc8rP"> We may now consider Islam. The Koran, the sacred book of Islam, is a counterfeit of the Old Testament. It is subtle. It mentions God and contains the history of Genesis. But it is altogether a counterfeit. </p>
<p data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0MkIZMcNUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW"> The genuine and true God is with the Jewish religion, for it is the genuine and typical religion. In a sense, they have the real God. This God is their boast. Even today Judaism still boasts in its God. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dnsjqigwMWCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0"> Secondly, Judaism has angels. The heathen religions all have demons. There is no comparison between the angels and the demons. The Bible indicates that the angels are very close to God. When the Lord appeared to Abraham, He appeared with two angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96403" data-verses="Genesis 18:1-2">Gen. 18:1-2</span>). They looked very much alike. By this we can see how high the angels are. Even the law was given through the mediation of angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96404" data-verses="Acts 7:53">Acts 7:53</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96405" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">Gal. 3:19</span>). So the Jewish religion boasts in them. </p>
<p data-content-id="r-B8nUhR9J6hUII4QNKnBknloWL3T1u_Sm-0_l_AMtHeXEMBTrWU2cmFAvJnaebii"> Thirdly, the Jewish religion boasted in Moses through whom God’s law was given. In nearly every race, especially in ancient times, there were outstanding leaders. But he was the foremost leader among all human leaders. No one’s writings can compare with his writings. There is no need to consider all of the books of the Pentateuch written by Moses; it is sufficient to present only one, Deuteronomy. This book is incomparable; it is in the third heavens. All other books outside the Bible are either on the surface of the earth or are in the lowest hell. The writings of Moses are high. I truly love all the books that he wrote, especially Deuteronomy which is so sweet and tender. What depths there are in the five books written by Moses! These books are gold mines. <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> The more you dig in them, the more treasures you find. They are fathomless. So all Jewish people boast in Moses. </p>
<p data-content-id="dY63Ns4YQPAy0AY63eLj4ewJq9aw209Dd3yRfmCJvmFRPo7bCwFO5qUAj0SHHhN9d"> The fourth item is the priesthood with Aaron, the elder brother of Moses, as the head. Moses was not a priest; he was an Old Testament apostle. Aaron was a high priest. Moses was sent from God to the people, and Aaron went from the people back to God. Moses typified Christ coming from God to the people, and Aaron typified Christ going from the people to God. The Jews have such a priesthood which serves God and takes care of the peoples’ needs in the presence of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qpdn89MhLxfVrIv8GWTBcUSsUKQ55oZqOEuk2qvXDTa4ELyWoRmN1r_WYV01cf7Lc"> In a sense, the priests were not only ministers, but also attorneys of law in the heavenly court. How good it is to have an attorney to take care of your case continually. The Jewish people had their priestly attorneys. Today, if people do not have an attorney, they have no protection, but if they are under the care of a good attorney, they can be at peace. The heathen had no attorney before God to take care of them, but the Jews had priests before God as their attorneys. Those priests served God and took care of the cases of the children of Israel. Therefore, the Jews could boast in their priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw5S27reTq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF"> The fifth and last main item of which Judaism could boast was the old covenant made by God with the Jewish people. The Jews are God’s people according to God’s covenant made according to God’s law. They are God’s covenanted people. No other people on the earth has such a divine covenant that they may be God’s people according to God’s desires and requirements. Only the Jews have such a divine covenant that makes them a particular people to God. So they hold it as a treasure and boast in it. </p>
<p data-content-id="lkvZM26z559Bj3lTSOUy6cZup7kXSx0PljTjoOkXjCBX2Rdfb66sdAUBGOBf9pyrf"> The intention of the book of Hebrews is to show the Hebrew believers the superiority of God’s economy over Judaism. In Judaism the boast was God, angels, Moses, Aaron the high priest, and the old covenant with its services. The writer uses these five items as the basis for making a comparison. He firstly points out that in God’s economy the first superior thing is not only God, but God expressed, that <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> is, God the Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96406" data-verses="Hebrews 1:2">1:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96407" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96408" data-verses="Hebrews 1:5">5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96409" data-verses="Hebrews 1:8-12">8-12</span>). Then he goes on to unfold that Christ is superior to the angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96410" data-verses="Hebrews 1:4">1:4—2:18</span>), to Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96411" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>), to Aaron (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96412" data-verses="Hebrews 4:14">4:14—7:28</span>), and that the new covenant of life made by Him is superior to the old covenant of letters (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96413" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1">8:1—10:18</span>). </p>

In the New Testament there is only one other book in the same category as Hebrews—the book of Revelation. I myself strongly believe that Hebrews was written by the apostle Paul because at the end of the letter he mentions Timothy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96453" data-verses="Hebrews 13:23">13:23</span>). Paul wrote at least thirteen Epistles. Among all the Epistles in the New Testament, Hebrews stands out in a very peculiar way. It is not common; it is quite unusual. Among all the other books of the Bible, Revelation also stands out. Both Hebrews and Revelation are revelations of Christ, revealing Christ in special and particular ways. Many aspects of Christ can only be seen in Hebrews, and other particular aspects of Him can only be found in Revelation. These two books are high, deep, and profound in their revelation of Christ. Because of this, they are closed to most Christians. Although many Christians can talk about the stories in the four gospels, justification by faith, and things such as head covering, the Lord’s table, and the manifestation of the gifts, they cannot touch the depth of Hebrews and Revelation. Some deal with the book of Revelation in the way of talking about horns, beasts, horses, scorpions, locusts, and frogs. Others discuss it in a higher way, talking about the length of the tribulation or the time of the rapture. But I have never heard people talk about it in the way of Christ being revealed so particularly in God’s administration, or in the way of the local churches being the testimony of Jesus. Since my youth, I have heard many messages on Revelation, but I have never heard anyone say that Revelation begins with seven golden lampstands and <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> concludes with a unique lampstand, a golden mountain, holding Christ as the lamp shining with God’s light for eternity. We praise the Lord that in His mercy He has opened up these books to us in these last days. He has opened up the depths of His Christ in these books. I do not call your attention to Hebrews and Revelation because these books are deep in doctrine, but because they are profound in the unveiling of Christ. In no other books can we see Christ in such a way. Christ, our dear Lord, is a wonderful person. He is marvelous, far beyond our understanding and utterance. We simply cannot utter His profoundness. Therefore, Hebrews and Revelation use various expressions to describe, portray, and unveil this wonderful person. I ask you to take full note of the particulars revealed in these two books. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyB_2alTLCZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH"> It may seem that this message on the heirs of salvation has nothing to do with Christ. Believe me, if you are going to know Christ, you must know this message, for it contains a particular aspect concerning Christ. Christ is wonderful, profound, unlimited, rich, and marvelous. As such a One, He certainly needs all of us to be heirs of salvation. Salvation is nothing less than the wonderful person of Christ Himself. Christ Himself, as the most profound, marvelous, unlimited, and immeasurable One, is our salvation. To say that we are heirs of salvation means that we inherit this profound, marvelous, immeasurable, and unlimited Christ. Christ’s profoundness requires our partnership. Our partnership with Christ unveils the profoundness of Christ. </p>

In His operation He has accomplished and is going to accomplish many things. He has also created and brought forth many things. For this, He has appointed the Son to be not only the Operator but also the Heir. He also has given the Son the authority to do everything in His purpose and the right to inherit all things in His operation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96454" data-verses="Hebrews 1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> says that God made <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> the universe through the Son and that He appointed the Son to be the Heir of all things. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96455" data-verses="Colossians 1:16">Colossians 1:16</span> says that all things were created by and for the Son. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96456" data-verses="John 13:3">John 13:3</span> tells us that the Father has given all things to the Son. Thus, the Son is the Lord of all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96457" data-verses="Acts 10:36">Acts 10:36</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="SX28q2m5JZZaou8YzwMxln_hlV-9-jFM-0R967a0R103rK0Jy6qGdc5kFkKIhC-VV"> Firstly, the Son was appointed by God the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96458" data-verses="Hebrews 1:2">1:2</span>); then He was anointed by the Father with the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96459" data-verses="Hebrews 1:9">1:9</span>); and eventually, after the Son had been designated to be the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96460" data-verses="Romans 1:4">Rom. 1:4</span>), being begotten of God in His resurrection to be the Firstborn Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96461" data-verses="Hebrews 1:5">1:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96462" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>), He was inaugurated as the Lord of all into His office at the time of His ascension into the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96463" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>). He was not only appointed and anointed by God, but, in His exaltation, was inaugurated as both the Lord and Christ to administrate God’s operation and was designated as the legal Heir to inherit all things in God’s economy. He, as Isaac, the Son of Abraham, is going to inherit the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96464" data-verses="Psalms 2:8">Psa. 2:8</span>), the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96465" data-verses="Daniel 7:13-14">Dan. 7:13-14</span>), the throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96466" data-verses="Luke 1:32">Luke 1:32</span>), and all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96467" data-verses="Matthew 11:27">Matt. 11:27</span>). Since He is not only the Son of God, but also the Heir of God, even the legal Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is for His possession (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96468" data-verses="John 16:15">John 16:15</span>). This is our Savior, the One who is the salvation of which we are heirs. </p>

How many sons did God have before Christ was incarnated? He had only one, unique Son. In the Bible, this Son is called the only begotten (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96469" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96470" data-verses="John 1:18">18</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96471" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>, a verse familiar to every Christian, says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. God’s only begotten Son was Christ. Before His death and resurrection, Christ was the unique Son of God. The New Testament reveals that through Christ’s death and resurrection the many sons of God were born (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96472" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). Early in the morning of the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> said to Mary, “Go to My brothers and say to them, ‘I ascend to My Father and your Father and My God and your God’” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96473" data-verses="John 20:17">John 20:17</span>). He never called His disciples brothers before that morning. Even in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96474" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> He said, “No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his lord is doing; but I have called you friends” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96475" data-verses="John 15:15">v. 15</span>). The most intimate term He used regarding His disciples before His resurrection was “friend.” But after His resurrection, He met one of His female disciples and told her to go to His brothers. This was prophesied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96476" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalm 22</span>. The first words of this psalm, “My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?” were spoken by the Lord when He was on the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96477" data-verses="Matthew 27:46">Matt. 27:46</span>). The first twenty-one verses of this psalm speak of the Lord’s crucifixion. Suddenly, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96478" data-verses="Psalms 22:22">verse 22</span> says, “I will declare thy name unto my brethren.” This proves that He passed through death and entered into resurrection. After He passed through death and resurrection, the many brothers were produced. He was that one grain of wheat which through death and resurrection became many grains (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96479" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>). Now God has many sons. He not only has the one Son, but the many sons with the Firstborn. Before His resurrection Christ was the only begotten Son of God. After His resurrection, since many sons of God have been produced, He became God’s Firstborn Son with many brothers. </p>
<p data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6CT1FreKXM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX"> What is a son? A son is the expression of his father. Many times when I see a son I can recognize the father’s face, for the sons express their fathers. Often when I see a little boy I know whose son he is, for when I look at his face I see his father’s face. The father is never the expression of the son; rather the son is the expression of the father. How many sons does God have? Before Christ’s resurrection, God had only one Son. This means that He had one, unique expression. How many expressions does God have today? He has many because He has many sons. All His sons are His expression. An understanding of this is basic to knowing the matter of the heirs of salvation. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCH6bKM1fQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv">SO GREAT A SALVATION</h1><p data-content-id="hZwxam6lXwmH0E7Nl83pZlSEoZda-ocuqHw2FtYp_6HHqSCdwcI5BmEdEnDTEQuNB"> The subject of this message is “so great a salvation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96504" data-verses="Hebrews 2:3">2:3</span>). Many people have preached on this subject about going to heaven. According to their opinion, going to heaven is the “so great a salvation.” This concept is too low. The “so great a salvation” is not that low. Why do people use such a high subject to preach the gospel with such a low concept? Because their experience of salvation is low. Although they have the term “so great a salvation,” they do not realize the depth of this term in Hebrews. In order to get into the depth of “so great a salvation” we need to cross the river from the traditional understanding of God’s salvation to a deeper realization of God’s great salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzeKoBprCFUylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> The basic concept of the book of Hebrews is crossing the river, passing over from one side to the other. It is firstly to pass over from the side of Judaism to the side of “so great a salvation.” The old Jewish religion had become the old country, the other side of the river which we all must leave. Although we are not Jewish believers, in a very real sense we might be in that region called “the other side.” It might be the other side of old Christianity. I am concerned that some of you reading this message are still in the region of old Christianity or are still clinging to the old concepts of Christianity. Perhaps you have come into the church where you have heard something better, but you still think that you have many good things from the past and find yourself unable to forget them. Perhaps even now, at this very moment, you are staggering, asking yourself, “Shall I go forward, or shall I stay here?” You may not be going backwards, <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> but you are considering whether or not to stay where you are. You need the book of Hebrews. You need to be encouraged to cross the river, to cross over from the other side. </p>
<p data-content-id="MIJlxkLQwGUFWpXbCXJwGuVp0OlJswqiU3Ejc76p9XUT9kubZPaV9POS3G28RP-sM"> We need to cross rivers every day. At the least we must cross a small river. You may need to cross a river after having offended your wife. After you offended her, you found yourself in an old region. You must cross the river. If you are unwilling to pay the price, you will stagger back and forth. You need to cross that small river. Although that river is small, it separates you from the holy of holies, from the enjoyment of “so great a salvation.” Every river you cross becomes a salvation to you, but every river that you do not cross becomes a veil. As long as you are on the other side of the river, you are outside of the veil. You are not in the holy of holies, participating in “so great a salvation.” If you cross the river, you will enter within the veil and share in the great salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-nZqYEW2zlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> In studying the book of Hebrews in the past, I used two slogans. The first, “outside the camp,” is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96505" data-verses="Hebrews 13:13">13:13</span>, which says, “Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.” Although the King James Version says, “without the camp,” the Greek is better translated “outside the camp.” We all must go outside the camp. What is the camp? Originally, the camp was Judaism. Today the camp may be Christianity, Catholicism, or anything, religious or worldly, that separates you from the enjoyment of God’s great salvation. Let us go forth therefore outside the camp. Then where shall we go? This brings us to the second slogan, “within the veil,” that is, within the holy of holies, found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96506" data-verses="Hebrews 6:19-20">6:19-20</span>. Jesus, our Forerunner, has entered within the veil. He is there now in the holy of holies. He certainly is not in any camp. </p>
<p data-content-id="iP_bgkHD-VyM-lbYNnOmntINjl-wBR5Dynf2bHQ8WpjrkRIRPrECHRAQWFcx0WQUb"> Some Christians are fond of camping in their analytical mind. Their mind becomes their camp. In fact, it might even become their Chaldea, their Mesopotamia, where Abraham was before he entered into the good land. As long as you are not in the good land, you need to cross the river. How much you need to cross the river into the good land! What is your <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> Chaldea? Nearly every Christian has some kind of Chaldea. Some Christians cling to their Bible knowledge. They hold on to the matter of Bible study, thinking that they know the Bible. However, their Bible knowledge becomes their Chaldea. Some brothers among us have had to cross over the river from the side of traditional Bible knowledge, some from the side of their religious background, and some from the side of their past experiences. Oh, how we all must realize that Hebrews is a book of river crossing! Never hold on to anything that is not up to the standard of “so great a salvation.” </p>
<p data-content-id="19J7BMpUdAP-KQCUvDLCiUT_Y2_Zvr1TF44VGLYr0Wq30Cf62POCZtTmD67IMB8WQ"> Years ago I had a good number of co-workers. At first, they were fine because they were not stuck to anything. However, after a few years some of them got stuck to certain things. Although those things were good, they became their Chaldea. If they had been with Joshua when he led the Israelites across the river Jordan, some of them probably would have stopped him, saying, “Don’t do this. When we came out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, no one ever told us that we would have to cross the Jordan.” The old knowledge and experience that those co-workers had became their Chaldea, and they would not cross the river. Nevertheless, day by day the Lord is going on. He is not standing still. None of us should stay with what we have experienced in the past. You must go on. Keep going on. A Hebrew is one who goes on. </p>
<p data-content-id="4reRc8xEUdB8gspB5LzSQE42TNhcoBqXNha6kcLoR0GcevFpPwoI5sDlLglcpJmid"> Now we need to see what is “so great a salvation.” This salvation is not great in the matter of going to heaven or even in the matters of forgiveness and justification by faith. I treasure both forgiveness and justification by faith, but the book of Hebrews, the book that covers “so great a salvation,” speaks of something higher. Forgiveness and justification by faith are salvation, but they are not “so great a salvation.” The “so great a salvation” is not even great in the matter of regeneration. In what, then, is this salvation so great? </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="o8J_Xe_Oo1DTEOu7_yttxnvkmvNr4zswpHSO-jDOTVFBVk47Q4_e4i6jscHWlhJOs">I. GREAT IN WHAT CHRIST IS</h2><p data-content-id="3kUaZWif4GddJ6x0-mt9Tdp_7mBfG_163rGTsaQ8Mae1t0n_om2qIm8zuQfDDDM9E"> Firstly, it is great in what Christ is. The writer of <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> Hebrews used the term “so great.” This term is difficult to define. How great is “so great”? Although we cannot adequately describe “so great,” this “so great a salvation” is great in what Christ is. Do you know what Christ is? Although you may know Christ according to the four gospels, do you know Christ according to Hebrews? </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="GZ-Xs1QsCoQof4c8ULP1B8jxChMb8E7KkBAeRYnN9vmNPkf2OrDQ2hBVPHBKl6cA3">A. As the Son of God, as God</h2><p data-content-id="ce50k8tQiJj2hm-zVHrfH1gS5_8sx9bxTn4PDYyUCKmXbgGgJ_N3tdzwHbUeZPInF"> Do you know Christ as the Son of God? Probably you know Him as the Son of God in a fragmentary way. You may have the subconscious concept that the Father is one God and that the Son is another. You may not have this kind of terminology, but deep within you may hold this concept. This is the reason that I say that the “so great a salvation” is great in what Christ is as the Son of God, as God. When we say that Christ is the Son of God, we mean that He is God. He is none other than God. </p>

This is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96544" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1">Hebrews 1</span>. Now we come to the second part of this comparison—that Jesus as the Son of Man, as man, is superior to the angels. This is unveiled in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96545" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span>. Firstly we saw Christ as the Son of God, as God; now we must see Jesus as the Son of Man, as man. As both God and man, He is superior to the angels. </p>
<p data-content-id="R5BCjovp4r6zbRLEWObexux1WOX_7Qf8QksznRcMh7dobccpo28CQJWJRDpQH5rrM"> Our wonderful Jesus has two natures, the divine and the human. He has divinity and humanity. He is God and He is man. Since He is God, He is the Son of God. Since He is man, He is the Son of Man. According to biblical usage, “man” and “Son of Man” are interchangeable terms. This is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96546" data-verses="Psalms 8:4">Psalm 8:4</span> which says, “What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?” Hence, the Son of Man simply means man. In the same principle, the Son of God means God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96547" data-verses="John 5:17-18">John 5:17-18</span>, for Jesus to be the Son of God means that He is God. When the Pharisees heard that the Lord Jesus called Himself the Son of God, they accused Him of blasphemy because, in their understanding, He made Himself equal with God. Thus, to say that Jesus is the Son of God means that He is God. Christ is both God and man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96548" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1">Hebrews chapter one</span> covers His divinity and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96549" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">chapter two</span> covers His humanity. With respect to both His divinity and humanity, He is superior to the angels. Even as the Son of Man, He is superior to the angels. <span class="pg" data-page-id="76" id="76">[76]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="smQkdlepcUj2tnXbV2UxxJsQEE7gpeQPNsDo0T9aLCfvZuZlwoPT8L125acok8hfa"> Although it is easy to realize that God is absolutely superior to the angels, it is difficult for us to realize that man is also superior to them. Do you still hold the concept that you are inferior to angels? I am afraid that if an angel appeared to you, you would worship him. At the least, you would look up to him, subconsciously thinking that he is superior to you. This thought is wrong. If you think that angels are superior to you, you are short of vision. You need to see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96550" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews chapter two</span>. Even at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96551" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1">chapter one</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96552" data-verses="Hebrews 1:14">v. 14</span>), we saw that, as the heirs of salvation, we are much superior to the angels, for the angels are our servants and we are their masters. We are the partners of Christ, and the angels are the servants, ministering to the heirs of salvation. We are the house of God, in which is the heavenly ladder joining us to God and bringing God to us, while the angels are ministering spirits ascending and descending upon this ladder as they render their service to us. Hence, they are much inferior to us. As we pointed out in message four, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96553" data-verses="Matthew 18:10">Matthew 18:10</span> reveals that everyone of us has an angel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96554" data-verses="Psalms 34:7">Psalm 34:7</span> says, “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” An angel appeared to Cornelius (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96555" data-verses="Acts 10:3">Acts 10:3</span>), telling him where to contact the one who preached the gospel. Moreover, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96556" data-verses="Acts 12:7-11">Acts 12:7-11</span> tells us how an angel opened the door that Peter might escape from prison. Although you may not know the name of your ministering angel, I am quite sure that he knows your name. We all have at least one angel that ministers to us continually. This is not superstition; this is reality. According to my experience, I can testify that as I have been traveling during the past forty years I have realized that my angel was with me and that, on many occasions, he protected me. </p>
<p data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPcNRpLqcwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm"> Christ, the Son of Man, as man, is superior to the angels. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96557" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span> does not speak of Him as a great man but as a little man. However, even as a little man He is superior to the angels. Before we consider the superiority of Jesus as a man to the angels, we need to see a basic factor in His being <span class="pg" data-page-id="77" id="77">[77]</span> a man, that is, that God has ordained man to rule over the earth as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96558" data-verses="Genesis 1:26-28">Genesis 1:26-28</span>. </p>

The word <em>escape</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96562" data-verses="Hebrews 2:3">verse 3</span> means, in principle, to escape the recompense alluded to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96563" data-verses="Hebrews 2:2">verse 2</span>. If we neglect “so great a salvation,” it is right and just that we receive a certain recompense. What will be this “just recompense”? Although we shall say more about this in coming messages, if we pay attention to the little word <em>for</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96564" data-verses="Hebrews 2:5">verse 5</span>, we can understand something about it now. The word <em>for</em> refers back to the negligence mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96565" data-verses="Hebrews 2:3">verse 3</span>. If we neglect “so great a salvation,” we shall receive a certain kind of “just recompense,” “for He did not subject to angels the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak.” Thus, the “just recompense” is related to the “coming inhabited earth.” </p>
<p data-content-id="pnhep-1swI5hHB5N847IaRJHSDDODfkFej5Ckh2HbQV2ZFXVzDLdqnlvjBn5DFN_h"> If we neglect so great a salvation, “how shall we escape?” This does not mean that we shall lose our salvation and be lost. Once we have been saved, we are saved forever. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96566" data-verses="John 10:28">John 10:28</span> assures us of this: “And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand” (Recovery Version). When we believe in the Lord Jesus, He gives us eternal life and we shall never perish. The Lord’s word will remain forever, and His word tells us that we have been eternally saved. We do have eternal security. However, this does not mean that a saved person can have no problems. According to this portion of Hebrews, a saved person, whose salvation is eternally secure, might miss the “coming inhabited earth.” Now we need to find out what is the “coming inhabited earth.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96569" data-verses="Daniel 2:35">Daniel 2:35</span>, at the time of the coming back of the Lord Jesus there will be on the earth nations represented by an image of iron, clay, brass, silver, and gold. All of these elements represent the earthly kingdoms. Suddenly a stone “cut out without hands” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96570" data-verses="Daniel 2:34">Dan. 2:34</span>) will descend out of heaven and will break in pieces the iron, clay, brass, silver, and gold. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96571" data-verses="Daniel 2:35">Daniel 2:35</span> reveals that “the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.” This stone which becomes a mountain is the kingdom of God. </p>

These are very significant terms and probably we are all familiar with them. My burden in this message is to show you how <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96636" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews chapter two</span> puts all of these five items together. No other chapter or other portion of the Holy Word does this. In some chapters we see Christ’s crucifixion. In other chapters we see His resurrection, glorification, and exaltation. But in no portion as short as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96637" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span> do we see incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and exaltation put together. These five major points concerning what Christ has passed through and attained are presented in this chapter in a very particular way, not in the way as they are presented in the Gospels, the Acts, or in the other Epistles. Throughout so many years, the Lord has been showing me all of the items in this one chapter. We have already seen in message four how <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96638" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1">Hebrews 1</span> reveals Christ in so many stages: in eternity past, in creation, in incarnation for redemption by crucifixion, in resurrection for imparting life, in exaltation, in His second coming, in the kingdom, and in eternity future. No other chapter affords us such a revelation of Christ as the Son of God from eternity past to eternity future. The sequence in this chapter is more than wonderful. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96639" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Chapter two</span> of Hebrews is the same in principle. No other chapter gives us all of these five major aspects of Christ. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96640" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span> these items are particularly and even peculiarly revealed.

<p data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGH-svbFQsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_"> From my youth, I heard from the pastors that Christ was incarnated simply because God loved us and sent His Son to this evil earth to die for our sins on the cross that we might be saved from hell. That was all I saw concerning the incarnation of Christ. Although this is correct, it is rather shallow. Some of the learned, high-class people will not accept this kind of preaching. They will say that it is low and that it has no purpose or goal. Only low-class people will accept such a low preaching of the gospel. Although the gospel is not low, it has been preached on a low level. I have never heard a preacher who said that Christ became a man in order to partake of our blood and flesh. This thought is much higher. The purpose of Christ’s incarnation was that He might share in the children’s blood and flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96641" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">2:14</span>). Using human words, we may say that this is very philosophical. This type of high preaching will convince the people who have philosophical minds. They will think that such preaching is very thoughtful. </p>
<p data-content-id="W1iZtRdq2EaOvu-m8SfI_hKyXQ9_rOlrXR3fm3GUzcPU0O7qbBBiKxEFUeCJG_ERL"> In the 1920’s, in answer to the prayers of so many dear missionaries, the Lord did a marvelous work in the colleges and universities throughout China. Many thoughtful young college students were saved. I also was saved during that time. After we were saved, we began to preach Christ in a higher way. We, the Chinese young people of that time, knew the Chinese philosophical thought. As a result, we knew how to convince people. We preached the higher gospel not according to our human thought but according to the “divine philosophy.” God is more than philosophical. What does it mean to say “philosophical”? It simply means thoughtful. God is not simple, superficial, or low. He is deep, thoughtful, purposeful, and meaningful. Our God is a God of purpose. Who could be more philosophical than He? As a result of that higher preaching of the gospel, many doctors, nurses, professors, and learned people were brought to the Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="2p-Clb9asquxf4mQ9n64l6lNyfz_IFbKGR1gkxbP1RjXC1oK7CumV6zeFKsjKYYc6"> The book of Hebrews is not shallow. It is both deep and high. It is in the highest bracket. This book does not say that because we were fallen and sinful Christ came to save us. It says that all the children are partakers of blood and flesh and that Christ came to share in our nature. This thought is deeper and higher. One day, the Son of God, our Savior and our God, became exactly the same in nature as we are. He became a human being, sharing in our blood and flesh. This is wonderful. We do not have a Savior who is different in nature from us. No, our God and Savior became exactly the same as we are. I can testify to you that a good number of scholars in China were convinced just by this one thought. They began to think about it, finding it most thoughtful. They saw that God came in the flesh not to command us to do something, but to be one with us. He did not come as God to rescue us, for that would have terrified us. He did not come as an angel to embrace us, for we could not have accepted that. He came, in reality, just as we are. He partook of our nature, of our blood and flesh. This thought will certainly convince the learned people. They will admire it, saying, “This truly is a high thought. The very God became the same in nature as we are, partaking of blood and flesh.” This is the incarnation, and this is the deepest thought and the highest “philosophy.” </p>
<p data-content-id="SX28q2m5JZZaou8YzwMxlkvhsHe9-jFM-0R967a0R103rK0Jy6qGdc5kFkKIhC-VV"> The incarnation should not be associated with Christmas. You need to burn everything related to Christmas. If you would go to China and preach the gospel to the learned people and mention Christmas, they would not listen to you. They would say that things such as Christmas trees, stockings full of candies, and Santa Claus are too low, shallow, and childish. That is not the gospel from the Word of God. That is the paganism, the leaven mentioned by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96642" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">Matthew 13:33</span>, brought into Catholicism by the “woman” as the Lord prophesied. How could the learned people be convinced with this kind of preaching? You may convince the poor children in the street, but you will not convince the thoughtful people. <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="gGi1krUjO5_vgHIvZGO27p1ummwBZa_k8hB0IkA8RvqDpYwLHDRb1TMHp4sIipHHx"> Christianity has preached the Lord’s highest salvation in a low way. We need those who have experienced the high salvation to go to the thoughtful people. Immediately they will be convinced. They also are seeking after truth, for they too were made by God. In their nature there is a seeking after God. But Christianity has superficially and inaccurately presented the gospel to them. The incarnation is not a matter of Christmas. Incarnation means that the very God, the Almighty God, has become flesh. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96643" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says, “The Word became flesh.” Who is the Word? The God who created everything. This Word, God the Creator, has become flesh. This is thoughtful and meaningful. Why did He become flesh? Simply that He might be the same as we are. We are men of blood and flesh, and Christ partook of the same. Through incarnation He came as a man to our level. Although Christ is God, He came to our level and shared in our nature. This is the kind of gospel preaching that university students need to hear. They will listen to this. You can hold them night after night with this kind of gospel. The learned people and students do not want to hear the low preaching of the gospel. They regard that as low and selfish. It lacks purpose. We must tell them of God’s purpose—that God came as man in order to establish His corporation of Christ and the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="eQJD4_jtknWQat9jcVOn6Uht8fNYK_r5XUDNpcDDJV6S5IySpcJb2P-RieMVJy8R6"> I am not speaking about a gospel preaching that I myself have not experienced. In China we did preach the gospel in this way. When we preached about God’s purpose regarding Christ and the church, some of the professors and students said, “We must get into this. For years we have been seeking the answers to the questions of what is the meaning of man, what is the real meaning of human life, and what the universe was created for.” So we gave them a message telling them of God’s purpose. This is the higher preaching of the highest gospel. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="H4ftD0nM_HqTnTBTZI6vl9LDeR-OM11qPJmRIviZqwZm5FkPIartulj8dlWnhx9NX">THE CAPTAIN OF SALVATION</h1><h1 class="title" data-content-id="XAU_tcFqOKo9rmOP3ZbnW2uSWbnirXynnH0CT7HqmYcBXJkMfDQnpAZCXXL7WbCkY">(1)</h1>
<p data-content-id="klFSgkmZ7z6TtXkmgUNGj8L1xzdo0ptrC0ipW-rLe2wiLoKboQqxl2qT2E6BWveTU"> In this message we come to the Captain of our salvation. It is difficult to understand this matter doctrinally. It seems that, logically speaking, for salvation we need Jesus to be our Savior and Redeemer, not our Captain, Pioneer, or Forerunner. Nevertheless, in God’s wonderful salvation, in His “so great a salvation,” we do need such a Captain. A captain is a leader who leads a group of people into a certain place. What is this Captain leading us into? He is leading us into glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="J1JYlwCOelExNYExkRji6wnkbeJ67hWsK8o7BCO9o5g1KcqitJI9Vxej8NhnohsR2"> The glory of God is a most difficult thing for anyone to define or explain. In His prayer to the Father in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96673" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span>, the Lord Jesus said, “And the glory which You have given to Me I have given to them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96674" data-verses="John 17:22">John 17:22</span>, Recovery Version). What is this glory? The glory into which our Captain is leading us is the glory which He has already given us. Although glory has been given to us already, yet we still need to enter into it. How difficult it is to speak about this glory! Some say this glory is a luxurious state into which we shall enter in the future and which will thrill and excite us very much. When I heard this kind of talk in the past, I was unhappy with it. Deep within, I felt that it was too light, that there was no weight or meaning in it. If you turn the question to me, I would have to say that it is exceedingly difficult to define what is the divine glory which God has ordained for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="z7nP6wvdoRcXW7_4yqTmjXUP9mq7mFR7fpfSTniJz1DC07eXfxsSNj_pn0tdjMZNa"> The New Testament tells us that we have been called into glory and that this glory was designed according to God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> wisdom in eternity past. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96675" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:7">First Corinthians 2:7</span> says that in eternity past God ordained that we should be brought into this glory. Both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96676" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:12">1 Thessalonians 2:12</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96677" data-verses="1Peter 5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span> tell us that we have been called into this glory. And, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96678" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>, when Christ appears, we shall appear with Him in His glory. What is this glory? Probably most Christians think that glory is merely a kind of shining or brightness. I would not say that glory is not such a shining or brightness, because I have not entered into it and dare not say that this understanding of glory is wrong. However, I would say that such an understanding is too objective and that it is absolutely according to objective considerations. To say that the glory into which we shall enter is merely a kind of radiant shining or brightness may be correct, but it is altogether an objective concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="afNFn9OFFhiGx4i5yPayuVrQAGAPwOHF65dbAP4BbUq6H0aWVC2NiuPeDe_39lWHN"> We may illustrate this matter of glory by the example of a carnation flower. The seed of a carnation plant is very small. If you sow this seed into the earth, it will grow until it eventually reaches the blossom stage. When the carnation blossoms, that is its glorification. A long process must transpire from the seed stage to the blossoming stage. As the carnation passes through this process, it must do a great deal of fighting. If you were a carnation seed, you would be able to tell us how much fighting you must pass through. The carnation must firstly fight against itself, because the life element within the seed must fight against the shell and break through it in order to come out. Then the carnation must fight against the soil in which it grows. Because the soil helps the carnation to grow, we may call it the growing soil. However, even this growing soil is a frustration to the carnation. Although the plant needs the soil and the soil helps it to grow, it is, nevertheless, a frustration to the growth of the carnation. The carnation must fight against the very soil that helps it to grow. Finally, after much fighting, the carnation reaches the stage of blossoming. That is the glory of the carnation flower. Its blossom is its glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="bL3_vIKwgozM1X2VsKZqF0wLdUEmDEIoUOwwkTFE2jCXoezsRLTSk_IdHBfxVvI3_"> Every one of us, without exception, is like a carnation seed. Through regeneration, the life of glory has come into <span class="pg" data-page-id="101" id="101">[101]</span> us. We now have a seed of glory within us. The life that we have within us as a seed is the life of glory. This is Christ in us, the hope of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96679" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Col. 1:27</span>). Glory is not merely a radiant shining in the air. That is too objective. If glory were merely an outward shining, it would simply be another vanity. But that is not the glory that the Bible talks about. The glory revealed in the Bible is the very blossoming of God’s divine element. One day, God’s divine element is going to blossom. Does it bother you when I say that the glory into which we shall enter is not merely something objective, but that it is the blossoming of the divine element from within us? If it does, it means that, at least to some degree, you are still clinging to the old doctrines. You need to cross the river. </p>
<p data-content-id="XAU_tcFqOKo9rmOP3ZbnW2uSTJHirXynnH0CT7HqmYcBXJkMfDQnpAZCXXL7WbCkY"> Consider the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on the mountaintop (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96680" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-2">Matt. 17:1-2</span>). When the Lord Jesus ascended to the top of that mountain and was transfigured, did the shekinah glory suddenly come upon Him from the outside, from the third heavens? Did He enter into an outward shining or brightness? No, the glory shone from within Him. That is why it is called the transfiguration. Likewise, the glory into which we shall be brought is the very glory that is within us right now. It is not merely objective; it is altogether subjective. What a difference between this and the traditional teaching about glory! At the time we were regenerated, the seed of glory was sown into us. This is mysterious. </p>
<p data-content-id="klFSgkmZ7z6TtXkmgUNGj8L11hto0ptrC0ipW-rLe2wiLoKboQqxl2qT2E6BWveTU"> In regeneration a life element came into our being. This life element is not a small thing: it is God’s divine element. All that God is is in this substance, this life element, that has come into our being. Oh, how we all must realize what happened to us when we were regenerated! God’s divine element came into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="J1JYlwCOelExNYExkRji6wnkcMJ67hWsK8o7BCO9o5g1KcqitJI9Vxej8NhnohsR2"> When the children of Israel entered into the land of Canaan, they began to blossom. That was their glory. That blossoming stage was also a fighting stage, for they began to fight almost immediately after entering into the good land. The first battle they fought was at Jericho. After Jericho, they fought continually until David defeated all the <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> enemies and the temple was built. Then the glory of God filled the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96681" data-verses="1Kings 8:10">1 Kings 8:10</span>). Apparently, the glory that filled the temple came down from above; actually, the glory was with the children of Israel. Since the day they crossed the Red Sea, the glory was with them. The glory was in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96682" data-verses="Exodus 14:19">Exo. 14:19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96683" data-verses="Exodus 14:24">24</span>). When they built the temple, the temple was filled with glory. Again I say that the glory did not come from above. It was present already, waiting for the people’s growth and development. When the children of Israel were fully developed, the glory filled the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="z7nP6wvdoRcXW7_4yqTmjXUP7067mFR7fpfSTniJz1DC07eXfxsSNj_pn0tdjMZNa"> Likewise, we all had our beginning at the time of our regeneration. That was our Passover. Since the time of our Passover, the time when the seed of glory was sown into us, that seed has been growing. This growing is a fighting process. Even now we are still under the process of entering into glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="afNFn9OFFhiGx4i5yPayuVrQJVgPwOHF65dbAP4BbUq6H0aWVC2NiuPeDe_39lWHN"> Now we are prepared to understand the Captain of salvation. The salvation of which Christ is the Captain is the very salvation which brings us into glory. The “so great a salvation” brings us into glory, and Christ, our Savior, is the Captain of this salvation. What does this mean? It simply means that our Savior took the lead to fight through into glory. The Lord Jesus did not suddenly enter into glory. During all of His days on earth, a fighting process was going on. The seed of glory was in Him and was fighting its way out. If you read the Gospels, you will see that the life of Jesus was a life of fighting. The story of His life was a fighting story. He was always fighting the battle for the growth of the seed of glory. He fought that the glory might come out and that He might be brought into glory. </p>

<p data-content-id="_e_6LkqX4ESYXvpCAEx27rbDt_bfnFOOjmtosmeLh6BrByUxfmVVcsvBL-SDunVSX"> We need to devote another message to the Captain of salvation. This is a great matter. The Captain of salvation is the One who leads us into glory. There is no problem with understanding the Captain; the difficulty is in understanding the meaning of glory. Although we spoke about glory in the previous message, because many of us are not clear about the true meaning of glory in the Bible, I am burdened to say something basic regarding glory in this message. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0NlIZLOtUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW">GLORY—GOD EXPRESSED</h2><p data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dntiqimi8WCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0"> In the Bible, glory is God expressed. Whenever God is expressed, that is glory. But whenever God is hidden, concealed, there is no glory. When God is seen, there is glory. You can never see God without seeing His glory. While the unseen God is God, the seen God is glory. Glory was seen as the children of Israel journeyed from Egypt to the good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96693" data-verses="Exodus 13:21">Exo. 13:21</span>). During the day God was seen as the cloud and during the night He was seen as the pillar of fire—that was glory. In the Gospel of John we read that the Word was God, that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and that we all beheld His glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96694" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96695" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96696" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span> says, “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him” (Recovery Version). There is glory in the declaration of God. When we see God, we see glory. <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="r-B8nUhR9J6hUII4QNKnAlnlhEL3T1u_Sm-0_l_AMtHeXEMBTrWU2cmFAvJnaebii">THE CORPORATE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="dY63Ns4YQPAy0AY63eLj5fwJivKw209Dd3yRfmCJvmFRPo7bCwFO5qUAj0SHHhN9d"> Based upon this understanding of glory, we may ask, What is God’s eternal purpose? God’s eternal purpose is to express Himself in a corporate way. If you read Revelation carefully, you will see that the entire city of New Jerusalem bears the glory of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96697" data-verses="Revelation 21:10-11">Rev. 21:10-11</span>). This means that the whole city will be the corporate expression of God. In the New Jerusalem, God is in the Lamb, and the Lamb is the lamp with God shining in and through Him as the light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96698" data-verses="Revelation 21:23">Rev. 21:23</span>, Gk.). Eventually, this light will shine through the wall of the city, a wall that is made of jasper, is crystal clear, and expresses God’s image. If you were to ask me what glory is, I would say that that is glory. To be brought into glory simply means to be brought into that glorious expression of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="MIJlxkLQwGUFWpXbCXJwHv1pzcFJswqiU3Ejc76p9XUT9kubZPaV9POS3G28RP-sM"> Since many of the new ones might not be familiar with this matter, let us examine the verses in Revelation more carefully. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96699" data-verses="Revelation 21:11">Revelation 21:11</span>, a description of the New Jerusalem, says, “Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96700" data-verses="Revelation 21:18">Verse 18</span> of the same chapter says, “And the building of the wall of it was of jasper.” The whole wall of the city is made of jasper, expressing the very image of God. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96701" data-verses="Revelation 4:3">Revelation 4:3</span>, you will see that God, the One sitting on the throne, has the appearance of jasper: “And He that sat was to look upon like a jasper.” God’s appearance is like jasper, and the city wall is made of jasper expressing the same appearance as God. This is the glory that the city bears. Such a glory is not an objective shining or brightness. The glory here is the divine reality expressed. The divine reality expressed through the corporate Body is glory. This is the glory that we are going to enter into. The glory into which we shall enter is not an objective shining or brightness; it is God Himself shining from, through, and out of us. </p>
<p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-mYKYCEGzlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> Where is the glory in the New Jerusalem? It is in the center, in the heart, of the city. God, the source of glory, is on the throne in the center of the New Jerusalem. God on the throne is the substance, essence, and element of glory. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96702" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> that glory is called the light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96703" data-verses="Revelation 21:23">Rev. 21:23</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> That light is not a natural light, such as the sun, moon, and stars, nor a man-made light, such as a lamp. No, it is the divine light, God Himself. This is the source of glory. God as the light shines in and through the Lamb as the lamp, eventually shining through the entire city, causing the city to bear the appearance of God Himself. When we look at the New Jerusalem, we see the expression of God’s appearance, the light in the lamp shining through the jasper. This is glory. Glory is God expressed through His redeemed people. Oh, how we all need to see what this glory really is! </p>
<p data-content-id="iP_bgkHD-VyM-lbYNnOmmsoNq3-wBR5Dynf2bHQ8WpjrkRIRPrECHRAQWFcx0WQUb"> In these messages we have spoken much about crossing the river. We need to cross the river to the glory side, to the region of glory. But this does not mean that we shall enter glory in a physical sense and walk on golden streets. No, the things pertaining to God and to His eternal purpose are so mysterious, spiritual, and divine that no human words can illustrate them adequately and no human mind can comprehend them sufficiently. Because of this, the Bible uses symbols to represent the divine reality. When the Bible says that Christ is the Lamb, it does not mean, of course, that He is literally a lamb with four feet and a tail. When the Bible says that Christ is the Lamb of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96704" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>), it is referring to the divine redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="19J7BMpUdAP-KQCUvDLCjVz_QkvZvr1TF44VGLYr0Wq30Cf62POCZtTmD67IMB8WQ"> As a whole, the Bible reveals that the Divine Being, the Almighty and mysterious God, wants to have a full expression through a corporate people. For this purpose, He created the universe, including the heavens and the earth. For this purpose, He specifically and especially created man as a corporate entity to contain Him, to be filled with Him, to live by Him, and to have his being by Him in order to express Him. Eventually, this corporate man will be the New Jerusalem as God’s corporate expression. God will be there as the center, essence, substance, content, life, and everything to this corporate man. God will be shining there. He will shine from within this corporate man and through this corporate man. God’s glory will be there, and all the members of this corporate man will be brought into that glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41YwUZ9nIMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg"> Now we are able to grasp the meaning of the glory into <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> which we are being brought. This glory is not a mere objective shining; it is God Himself expressed. When God Himself comes into us, He is life; when He works in us, He is light; and when He is expressed in us, He is glory. This is God’s eternal goal into which He is leading us. God is now bringing us into the region of glory which is God Himself expressed. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXv9_BXra_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB">THE NEED TO CROSS THE RIVER</h2><p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdllmf_C5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> Although God created man with such an intention and purpose, man has been ruined and corrupted. In a sense, ruined mankind has become Chaldea, Babylon, the land of idolatry. The Bible often uses lands and cities as figures to symbolize man. So Chaldea and Babylon signify the ruined and corrupted man filled with idolatry. Since man has fallen, there is the need to cross the river out of the corrupted land into the elevated, new land, that is, into an elevated, new mankind. So God came in and called Abraham out of that ruined mankind, that is, out of Chaldea, making him the head and father of the called race. Abraham crossed the river and became the first Hebrew, the first river crosser. Abraham’s crossing the river and entering into the new land signified his entering into an uplifted, new mankind which is to be used by God to be His expression. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="ONTNfoex8_cVo12DfRG58kHGIVfSxsp3NoQW_8wi-97vKUKUb_GzJXFfUITjZc8rP">THE SANCTIFIER AND THE SANCTIFIED</h1><p data-content-id="4reRc8xEUdB8gspB5LzSRFI2WfBcoBqXNha6kcLoR0GcevFpPwoI5sDlLglcpJmid"> In this message we come to the matter of sanctification. No book talks as much about sanctification as does the book of Hebrews. It is absolutely essential that we have holiness, for without it we cannot live in the presence of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96724" data-verses="Hebrews 12:14">12:14</span> we are told that without holiness no man can see the Lord. However, sanctification is very difficult to define. In order to understand what sanctification is, we need to see a little of the background of the various schools of Christian teaching on the subject of sanctification or holiness. Sanctification is fully revealed in the Scriptures, in both the Old and New Testament. Although it is revealed in the Scriptures, it was nearly lost. At the time of the Reformation, God began a recovery of all His truths. The first truth that God recovered was justification by faith. If you read the church history of the last five hundred years, you will find that after God recovered justification, the next thing to be recovered was sanctification. But sanctification was not recovered in as clear a way as justification was. Even justification, although it was recovered clearly, was not recovered fully. It was recovered objectively but not subjectively. We saw this in the Life-study of Romans. Nevertheless, after the recovery of justification by faith, the recovery of sanctification followed, but it followed in a way that was not fully accurate. </p>
<p data-content-id="o8J_Xe_Oo1DTEOu7_yttwmfki99r4zswpHSO-jDOTVFBVk47Q4_e4i6jscHWlhJOs"> We cannot say who was the first person used by God to recover sanctification. But we do know that, according to the history of the recovery, in the eighteenth century God used a group of university students at Oxford—John Wesley, Charles Wesley, and George Whitefield. These young men <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> began to have a meeting. John Wesley was raised up by God through the help of the Moravian brothers under the leadership of Zinzendorf. The Moravian brothers helped John Wesley to be clear about salvation. Wesley had been invited to speak in the United States. Even then, he was not clear about his salvation. It was on the boat on the way to the United States that he received help regarding this from the Moravian brothers. After spending some time in the United States, Wesley returned to Europe and visited Bohemia, the place where Zinzendorf and others had begun to practice the church life. John Wesley received the greatest help from them while he was there. In one of his writings he says that if he had not had the burden for England, he would have remained in Bohemia for the rest of his life. As far as he was concerned, that was the place where God dwelled. Wesley, however, was burdened to return to England. We know from history that the revival under John Wesley saved England from revolution. I mention this to point out to you the extent of the influence of John Wesley’s preaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kUaZWif4GddJ6x0-mt9ScZ_80BfG_163rGTsaQ8Mae1t0n_om2qIm8zuQfDDDM9E"> The group of students at Oxford that included John Wesley and George Whitefield adopted certain regulations, called methods, that they used to control, correct, and behave themselves. They were very strict to control themselves by these methods. John Wesley and the others kept these methods in order to have a proper living. They came to consider that kind of living holy. This is the holiness practiced by the Methodists as sinless perfection, a perfection without sin. The Church of the Nazarene, the Church of God, and the Assembly of God today practice a kind of holiness that is of the same school as the holiness of the Methodists. </p>
<p data-content-id="GZ-Xs1QsCoQof4c8ULP1A9TxEzcb8E7KkBAeRYnN9vmNPkf2OrDQ2hBVPHBKl6cA3"> Then in the early part of the nineteenth century, the Brethren under the leadership of John Nelson Darby were raised up. The Brethren showed from the Bible that holiness is not sinless perfection. Using <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96725" data-verses="Matthew 23:17">Matthew 23:17</span>, they showed how the temple sanctified the gold. It was the temple that made the gold holy. These Brethren teachers pointed out that the gold in the market place, although there was nothing sinful about it, was not holy until it had been offered to <span class="pg" data-page-id="121" id="121">[121]</span> God and put into His holy temple. Only then was the gold sanctified. Their argument was very strong, and no one could defeat them. Furthermore, using <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96726" data-verses="Matthew 23:20">Matthew 23:20</span>, the Brethren teachers showed that, according to the words of the Lord Jesus, the altar sanctifies the sacrifice. They argued that an ox or a lamb, when in the fold, might have been sinless and perfectly all right. Nevertheless, it was common. It was not holy until it was offered to God on the altar, at which time it was sanctified. Doctrinally speaking, the Brethren defeated the teaching that holiness is a matter of sinless perfection, proving that it had no ground in the Scriptures and that it is a human concept of holiness. The Brethren, famous for their doctrinal debates, also appealed to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96727" data-verses="1Timothy 4:4-5">1 Timothy 4:4-5</span>, which says that food is sanctified by the saints’ prayer. When that food is in the market place, it is common. There may be nothing wrong with it and it may have no sin, but it is common. However, when that same food is placed on the saints’ dining table and is prayed over by the saints, it is sanctified by the saints’ prayer. Using all of these verses, the Brethren teachers showed that sanctification means a change of position. They said that sanctification is altogether a positional matter. Gold, for example, is common when it is still in the store, but when it is put into the temple it is holy. Its position has been changed. Likewise, when a lamb is still in the fold, it is common, but when it is placed on the altar it is holy. The food in the market place is also common, but it is sanctified by the prayers of the saints. So, in the light of all these verses, the Brethren taught that holiness means a change of position. Originally, our position was worldly and not at all for God. When we are separated unto God, our position is changed and, as a result, we become holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="ce50k8tQiJj2hm-zVHrfG0QSwscsx9bxTn4PDYyUCKmXbgGgJ_N3tdzwHbUeZPInF"> This teaching of the Brethren is altogether correct. When we studied the various schools of sanctification many years ago, we agreed with the teaching of the Brethren. We saw that sinless perfection was not genuine holiness. However, although holiness is a positional matter, as we studied the New Testament we discovered that holiness, sanctification, <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> is not merely a positional matter but also a dispositional matter. Sanctification is not only a matter of changing our position but also of changing our disposition. Yes, according to the verses that speak of the gold sanctified by the temple, the sacrifice sanctified by the altar, and the food sanctified by the saints’ prayer, there is undoubtedly a positional aspect to sanctification. But we also need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96728" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> where, according to the Greek, the word <em>sanctification</em> is used twice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96729" data-verses="Romans 6:19">vv. 19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96730" data-verses="Romans 6:22">22</span>). In these two verses the King James Version uses the word <em>holiness</em> instead of <em>sanctification.</em> There is a difference between these words, for holiness does not include experience, but sanctification does indicate or imply some amount of experience. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96731" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span>, you will see that it is not concerned with the matter of position but of disposition. It not only touches our position; it goes deeper to touch our disposition. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyA-2apTLCZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96732" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span> as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96733" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> holiness refers mainly to God’s divine nature. Sanctification is to work God’s holiness into us by having God’s divine nature imparted into our being. This is not the positional sanctification; it is the dispositional sanctification. In this sanctification, Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, is saturating all the inward parts of our being with God’s divine nature. This is to work God’s holiness into our whole being. We may call this dispositional sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LCCsRH_pwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR"> Now we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96734" data-verses="Hebrews 2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span> which says, “For both He Who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one.” Does the phrase <em>all of one</em> refer to position or to disposition? Undoubtedly, “He Who sanctifies” is Christ, and “those who are being sanctified” are we. So Christ and we are all of one. The Greek word translated <em>of</em> actually means “out of.” This means that Christ and we, the Sanctifier and the sanctified, are all out of one source, one Father. The source surely does not refer to position but to nature, to disposition. The Sanctifier and the sanctified are all out of one source, one Father. The Father is the source of the Sanctifier and He is the source of all the sanctified. This is not a matter of position but of disposition. <span class="pg" data-page-id="123" id="123">[123]</span> </p>

Apparently it is difficult for anyone to realize that the church is mentioned in the book of Hebrews. Although you might have read Hebrews a number of times, perhaps you have never been impressed with the mention of the church in this book. We are all familiar with the mention of the churches in Acts and in the other Epistles, but we may not have the impression that the church is found in Hebrews. Thirty-eight years ago I conducted a detailed study of this book with two different groups of people. At that time, I thought that I knew this book thoroughly, but I did not see the church in this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="59tq157xwce1XvZTZYWABFatxS6AdhVzhWKgIad9yUQA9xO1kuO2-Z98Caw01EdMR"> The church is only mentioned twice in this book, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96757" data-verses="Hebrews 2:12">2:12</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96758" data-verses="Hebrews 12:23">12:23</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96759" data-verses="Hebrews 2:12">2:12</span> it says, “I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.” I do not think that in the past many of us paid attention to the church in this verse. This verse is composed essentially with the matter of the church. In this verse both the brothers and the church are mentioned in a very deep way. The Son says to the Father that He will declare the Father’s name to His brothers and sing hymns of praise to the Father in the church. Do you know the meaning of this? In this verse we must notice three elements: the brothers, the church, and what the Lord is doing today in the church. This verse is a very great revelation of what the church is and of what the Lord is doing in the church. In no <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> other book can we find out something concerning the nature of the church that is revealed so thoroughly, basically, fundamentally, and crucially as it is found here. Do not consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96760" data-verses="Hebrews 2:12">2:12</span> as a small verse. It is a great verse. It contains a marvelous revelation. In this message, I hope that we all shall not only have a revelation, but that we all shall see a vision of what the church is and of what the Lord is doing today in the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nra_GgDpimpsPAo0RrC1aO7HZi0642dTAWC_1CYoST56PQUyLyIACiL2qjOnKIM8F"> What is the church? The church is a corporate composition of the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God. Do you still remember the difference between the only begotten Son of God and the Firstborn Son of God? The only begotten Son of God had divinity without humanity. Although He had the divine nature, He did not have the human nature. But the Firstborn Son of God has both the divine nature and the human nature. The brothers are not the brothers of the only begotten, but the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God. We are the same as the Firstborn. He is divine and human, and we are human and divine. The Firstborn Son has humanity as well as divinity and all of His brothers are the same as He is. Whether we are brothers or sisters, we are all His brothers, for Christ does not have any sisters. Tell me, are you human or divine? Is the Firstborn Son divine or human? He is both divine and human, and we are both human and divine. He is first divine and then human, and His brothers are first human and then divine. Eventually, He and we, we and He, are the same. We are wonderful people. We are not only human—we are also divine. Do you realize whose son you are? You are God’s son. God is our divine Father, and we all are His divine sons because we all have been born of His divine life with His divine nature. We are the many sons of the Father and the many brothers of the Firstborn Son of the Father. This is not a dream. This is reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCG7bKI1fQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv"> The church is both human and divine. This is the nature of the church. The church is a composition of the many sons of God. The church is a corporation of the many brothers of the Firstborn Son of God. This is the church. I never saw the church this clearly years ago. More than forty years ago I <span class="pg" data-page-id="133" id="133">[133]</span> saw that the church was a group of real believers in Christ meeting together. This definition of the church is not wrong. Approximately one hundred fifty years ago it was revealed to some of the brothers that the church is not a building of brick and stone. They declared strongly to all of Christendom that the church is not a physical building. It is not a cathedral, chapel, or sanctuary. They declared that the church is a gathering of God’s called ones. When true believers in Christ come together, they are the church. We have received much help from this revelation and more than fifty years ago we also began to say that the church is a gathering of God’s called saints. We were thankful for the help that we received from those brothers in the last century. Later on, we began to see that the church is not only a gathering of real believers; it is a body, the Body of Christ. If you gather many chairs together, the chairs cannot become a body. If you gather sheep together, they likewise cannot be a body. As everybody knows, a body is an organism with life. It has life tissues, life cells, life nature, life shape, life ability, and life function. The church is deeper, higher, and more profound than just a gathering. </p>
<p data-content-id="hZwxam6lXwmH0E7Nl83pYkSEkZda-ocuqHw2FtYp_6HHqSCdwcI5BmEdEnDTEQuNB"> The Lord has shown us the real significance of the church. Praise Him that He has granted us to see that the church has two natures—the human nature and the divine nature. The church has two lives. These lives are not only combined but are also mingled together. The church is an organism with two natures and with two lives combined and mingled together. This is marvelous! Do you realize that the church has two lives? Do you realize that the church has two natures? Do you realize that the Firstborn Son of God has two lives and two natures, that He is not only the Son of God, but also the Son of Man? The Firstborn has all of the divine attributes as well as all of the human virtues. What we have is not just a little humility or submission. This rich store is much more profound than this. It is unlimited and immeasurable, filled with the divine attributes and the human virtues. The church is such an organism. It is the Body of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="134" id="134">[134]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzeLpBpnCFUylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> Quite often bad news comes to me about a church in a certain place. Someone may say, “The church there is not good. It has problems.” I do not like to hear things like this, because my concept of the church is based upon my faith. I believe that every church is wonderful. There is not a church that is not good. Although you may think that a certain church is not good, after a period of time that church becomes very different. Why? Because the church is organic. It grows. Your body may be quite tired, but after a while it is invigorated. It changes by life because it is an organism. The churches in the Lord’s recovery are organic. Never believe that the church in a certain locality is not good. The church is wonderful because it is an organism that grows. Never forget that the church is a living corporation of all the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God. The church is neither physical nor organizational; it is altogether of life—the divine life and the uplifted, resurrected human life. Nothing is richer than life. The best life in the universe is the divine life, and the second best life is the human life. The human life that we have today for the church is not the natural human life but the uplifted, resurrected human life. We have such a life! This human life plus the divine life is the life of the church. It is in such a profound way that the church is revealed in this book. The church is a living composition of all the sons of God, a living corporation of all the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God. </p>

No human mind could have written such an Epistle. It certainly was written under divine inspiration. In this message, on a merciful and faithful High Priest, we come to the conclusion of the first two chapters of Hebrews. After covering so many items in the first two chapters, the writer concludes this section by revealing that the Son of Man is a merciful and faithful High Priest ministering to us. In order for us to know His qualifications for being such a priest, we need to look back at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96782" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1">chapters one and two</span> to see all the items of what He is and of what He has done. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXv9PBT4q_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB">I. AS THE SON OF GOD WITH THE DIVINE NATURE</h2><p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdllWf4R5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> Why does the writer of Hebrews use the words <em>merciful</em> and <em>faithful</em> to describe this High Priest? Why does he not use just one word or more than two? The answer is that in the first two chapters of this book the writer has mainly covered two points—that Christ is the Son of God, God Himself, and the Son of Man, man Himself. <em>Merciful</em> corresponds with His being a man, and <em>faithful</em> corresponds with His being God. In order to be faithful we not only need virtue but also ability. Suppose I have spoken a word to you as a promise. Although my virtue may be good, I may not have the ability to keep my word. I have the heart to be faithful in keeping my word, but I lack the ability. I do not have the means to fulfill my word. Eventually I am forced into not being faithful. But this High Priest is not merely an honest man; He is the faithful God. God is faithful (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96783" data-verses="Hebrews 10:23">10:23</span>). He is able to fulfill <span class="pg" data-page-id="142" id="142">[142]</span> whatever He says. God never lies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96784" data-verses="Hebrews 6:18">6:18</span>). Whatever He has spoken He is able to fulfill. He has every means to fulfill what He has spoken. Only God can be fully faithful. None of us can be completely faithful. A good number of times I had a sincere heart to keep my word but found myself unable to do it. I could not do it because I am not the Almighty God. What can frustrate God from fulfilling His word? Nothing. Jesus can be a faithful High Priest because He is the very Almighty God. Since He, as the Son of God, is God Himself, He is able to be faithful. Although, as the many sons of God and as the many brothers of the Firstborn, we are divine as well as human, we are not almighty. We are human in our human nature and divine in His divine nature, but we are not almighty in His deity. Since He is the Almighty God, He can be faithful to us. </p>

AS THE SON OF MAN WITH THE HUMAN NATURE</h2><p data-content-id="6ZZlu4J5HfdMhfEfUJ3LlNT5nB2BO4c3a__L7gn1p3skFN8-BJcPmokYabiuqvwyt"> Being merciful corresponds to the point of Christ’s being a man. He became a man and lived on earth as a man passing through all the human sufferings. As a result, He is fully qualified to be merciful to us. He knows how to be merciful to man. He is a man with the experiences of human life, with the experiences of human suffering. </p>
<p data-content-id="R5BCjovp4r6zbRLEWObewvx1aOX_7Qf8QksznRcMh7dobccpo28CQJWJRDpQH5rrM"> How is Christ able to be a merciful and faithful High Priest? Because He is the Son of Man with the human nature and the Son of God with the divine nature. He is fully qualified. Aaron was a good high priest, but he only had humanity. He did not have divinity. Although Aaron could have been merciful, I doubt that he was truly faithful. But our High Priest, Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the Son of Man, is both merciful and faithful because He is both God and man. </p>

We may even say that He is more than like us, for He suffered in His human life some things we have not suffered. In order to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="143" id="143">[143]</span> qualified to be a merciful High Priest, He became like us, sympathizing with all of our weaknesses. </p>

If you read the Gospels again, you will see that no other person has been subject to so many troubles, attacks, misunderstandings, and rumors as the Lord Jesus. So many religionists are good rumor makers. There are as many rumors in the sphere of religion as in any other place. These rumor makers are accustomed to twisting your words. They isolate a few words that you say and add something else to it. Sometimes the Lord Jesus spoke a word and the religionists picked on it and twisted it, trying to make a case out of it against the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="4reRc8xEUdB8gspB5LzSRFo2TMhcoBqXNha6kcLoR0GcevFpPwoI5sDlLglcpJmid"> The situation is exactly the same today. When Brother Nee and I were working together in China, I saw how many lies and rumors were spread about him. Often Brother Nee would not say anything. A number of times he came to me, saying, “Witness, Christians can lie.” At that time, he was the target, and we were under his covering. The attacks did not reach us because he was the umbrella and we were under him. In 1949, after we went to Taiwan, I spontaneously became the target for the attacks. Now I know from my own experience that Christians can lie. If you were to go to the Lord Jesus and ask Him whether or not religious people can lie, He would say, “They certainly can. I have suffered a great deal of it.” Because the Lord Jesus was different from the dark religion of His day, He was hated by the religionists. All the religious people hated Him. The same thing happened to Watchman Nee in China. From 1932 until the day he was imprisoned in 1952, no denomination in China invited him to speak. Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus is merciful and certainly knows how to sympathize with us and how to suffer the lies. No human being has ever been tempted, tested, attacked, opposed, and misunderstood by the religionists as He was. He is qualified to be merciful to us and to sympathize with us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="144" id="144">[144]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCbqZPv7-2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96806" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">Hebrews 3</span>. This chapter opens in this way: “Wherefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling.” I like these two titles—holy brothers and partakers of a heavenly calling. No other book in the New Testament calls us holy brothers. The title holy brothers implies two main points—that we are holy and that we are brothers. We are not only brothers but holy brothers. Do you dare to say that you are a holy brother? The writer of this book could not call us holy brothers until he had covered so many of the qualifications concerning both Christ and us in the first two chapters. By the time he reaches the third chapter, he is able to call us holy brothers. Through His death and resurrection Christ has made us His brothers. Originally, we were sinners, death victims, prisoners, and captives. Praise Him that His death has made propitiation for our sins and has released us from the slavery of death. In His resurrection we were produced as His brothers. So now we can be called holy brothers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96807" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">chapter two</span> we see that the brothers brought forth in the Lord’s resurrection are in the process of being sanctified. Therefore, we are holy brothers. We are not merely sinlessly perfect; we are divinely holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssBQTSuXngzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96808" data-verses="Hebrews 1:9">1:9</span> we see our relationship with God’s anointed One. That verse, which is addressed to Christ, says, “Your God has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.” The King James Version renders the Greek word for <em>partners</em> as “companions.” But a partner is better than a <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> companion. We may be companions without being partners, but if we are partners, we certainly are companions. In God’s economy, Christ is the One whom God has appointed to accomplish His plan, and we are Christ’s partners in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and we share His anointing for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Christ is the Heir appointed by God, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96809" data-verses="Hebrews 1:9">1:9</span> we see that this appointed Heir has been anointed. The anointing confirms the appointment. Firstly, God appointed the Son and then He anointed Him. As Christ’s partners we all partake of His anointing. We are partners of God’s anointed One and we share His anointing. This is a part of the gospel. It is included in the full gospel. Many people talk about the full gospel. The full gospel includes our partnership with Christ. This wonderful item is included in the full gospel. We all need to see that we are partners of Christ and that we share in His anointing. Because of this, by the time we reach <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96810" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">3:1</span>, we have all that we need to be holy brothers. We have the standing, the qualifications, the reality, the life, the nature, the source, and all that we need. We are now the holy brothers. </p>
<p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7MigIKiZ8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> If you knew that you were such a holy brother, what would you do? Would you still smoke cigarettes? Whenever I see a brother smoking cigarettes, my whole being goes down. I say to myself, “Oh brother, you have just sold your birthright for a cheaper price than Esau did.” How can a holy brother still smoke cigarettes? Although we have no regulations or legality, we do have our majesty. We are not only holy; we are majestic. Consider our position; we are the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God and we are the partners of God’s anointed One. This is not a small thing. If you were a brother of the president of the United States, you would be very proud and have a certain amount of majesty. But whose brother are you? You are a brother of the Firstborn Son of God and a partner of God’s anointed One for the fulfilling of God’s plan. Smoking is an insult to God’s anointed One. Yes, the Bible never says that you should not smoke, and the New Testament is not a book of laws but a book of holy <span class="pg" data-page-id="155" id="155">[155]</span> brothers. Nevertheless, I believe that if the Lord would open your eyes and impress you with this marvelous item in the full gospel, you would be another person. You would be more than open for our High Priest to minister Himself into you. This would change your taste. Never again would cigarettes be tasteful to you. </p>
<p data-content-id="PvInMZn3Vp176ChSyFxrzvunCpeI0R_umEl2pfk_yxb2iqBRHJddNGyBQOilH2EXM"> Such a vision would change our preaching of the gospel. Today the preaching of the gospel is too low. As we preach the gospel, we should not only tell people that they are sinners, that they are condemned, and that they are going to perish. We have to preach the gospel in a much higher way, telling people that God is calling them to believe in His Firstborn Son that they might become His brothers, even His partners in fulfilling God’s eternal plan. </p>
<p data-content-id="-7psJDqorOUFFwhmtN2Majs-GRc6BT4LW0n2K-L9dRY0OI1PJD-NzRXLSV8ZtC8nS"> There is the need for such preaching today. I hope that some of the young brothers will be burdened to do this kind of preaching. I do not want to hear the preaching of the gospel with the same old tune that tells people that they are sinners and are going to hell. This is not wrong, but it is too low. We need to preach the gospel from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96811" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>, telling the sinners how they can be converted and transformed into holy brothers. If the young people preach this gospel, many of their schoolmates will be attracted. </p>
<p data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssBQTSpFHgzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr"> More than thirty-nine years ago, when I was still young, I stayed for a while in Peking, the old capital of China. In Peking there was an outstanding hospital that was sponsored and supplied by the Rockefeller Foundation called Peking Union Medical College. It was a great hospital with the highest standard. Many of the nurses who worked in that hospital were caught for the church, and some of the doctors were also caught by the higher preaching of the gospel. They were all on fire. We need this kind of preaching today. </p>
<p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7MigIMwp8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> I am burdened because I have seen something higher. I want to see people get something better. We should not preach the gospel in a low way. What is the center, the high point of the gospel? Is it to take a poor sinner, sprinkle some drops of blood on him, and send him to heaven? Do you think <span class="pg" data-page-id="156" id="156">[156]</span> that God’s gospel only does this much? No, it is much higher than this. God’s gospel is to make people holy brothers. This is not my concept; it is the concept revealed in the book of Hebrews. In His resurrection, Christ has made all of us His brothers and He has come into us to declare the Father to us. Now, as the Sanctifier, He is qualified to perform the sanctifying work that makes us holy. We are His holy brothers and His partners, sharing His anointing for the fulfilling of God’s plan. Is this not in the Bible? Is it not the good news? The world needs to hear these glad tidings. Many thoughtful people in the leading universities throughout the country are wondering about the meaning of human life. So many are asking themselves, “What is the purpose of life? What will happen after my graduation?” No one in the universities can tell them. We must go and tell them the real meaning of life. Go and tell them that they can be the holy brothers of the Firstborn Son of God. If the Lord delays His coming back, I hope that after a few years this kind of preaching will be prevailing in all the universities in the United States. </p>
<p data-content-id="PvInMZn3Vp176ChSyFxrzvunL7eI0R_umEl2pfk_yxb2iqBRHJddNGyBQOilH2EXM"> The United States, Europe, and all the leading countries need to hear the higher preaching of such a full gospel, the gospel that produces holy brothers of the Firstborn Son of God. If the young people will take up this burden and go to the campuses preaching this gospel, a good number of thoughtful young people will be caught. They will be satisfied. I hope that many of you reading this message will make a deal with the Lord, telling Him that you are willing to be burdened for the preaching of the high gospel. If you are burdened to preach the high gospel, I believe that the Lord will honor your preaching. “Lord, we need more young preachers, more preachers of the fullest gospel!” </p>

At the very beginning of this Epistle, we saw the comparison between our God and the God of the Jewish people. Then, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96854" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1">chapters one and two</span>, we saw two aspects of the comparison between Christ and the angels. As both the Son of God and the Son of Man Christ is superior to the angels. The third boast of the Jewish religion is Moses, who was their most outstanding leader. As we shall see in another message, the fourth comparison, that between Christ and Aaron, shows us that Christ as the High Priest is superior to Aaron. </p>
<p data-content-id="fuOTOIbl26ICXoDfOfmOzf02-x-5N_EbrL-zVhjSApM5ECRzMvL1jcqgw8vvh-fDb"> As the Apostle and High Priest, Christ is superior to both Moses and Aaron. We see these two titles of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96855" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">3:1</span> where we are told to “consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.” Jesus is our Apostle and our High Priest. As the Apostle, He was typified by Moses; as the High Priest, He was typified by Aaron. The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96856" data-verses="John 6:46">John 6:46</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96857" data-verses="John 8:16">8:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96858" data-verses="John 8:29">29</span>). The High Priest was the One who went to God from and with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96859" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Eph. 2:6</span>). As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we might partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. As the High Priest, Christ went to God with us to present us to God that we and all our case might be fully cared for by Him. As the Apostle He was typified by Moses who came from God to serve the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96860" data-verses="Hebrews 3:2-6">3:2-6</span>), and as the High Priest He was typified <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> by Aaron, who went to God with the house of Israel and their cases (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96861" data-verses="Hebrews 4:14">4:14—7:28</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="IUDJqdl9X6vy3Vq-crvLdfbhrKVwghlxQoAehr9Bor-YhLUZxsqlKZZQEkrirqIrE"> Although you might have known that Jesus is our High Priest, I doubt whether many of you reading this message have ever heard that Jesus is also the Apostle. Jesus was the first Apostle in the New Testament. This is why I say once again that the book of Hebrews is quite peculiar. Firstly, it tells us that the Lord Jesus has been appointed by God to be the Heir of all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96862" data-verses="Hebrews 1:2">1:2</span>). Then it tells us that He is even the Captain of salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96863" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10">2:10</span>). Christ as the Heir of all things and as the Captain of salvation is not so clearly revealed as in this book. Even Christ as the High Priest cannot be found elsewhere in the New Testament. Now we see that Christ is the Apostle. The word <em>apostle</em> in Greek means a sent one, one who is sent by higher authority. Jesus is the One who was sent by God. God sent Him to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="H4ftD0nM_HqTnTBTZI6vk-LDaR-OM11qPJmRIviZqwZm5FkPIartulj8dlWnhx9NX">I. MOSES</h2><p data-content-id="XAU_tcFqOKo9rmOP3ZbnX1uSabnirXynnH0CT7HqmYcBXJkMfDQnpAZCXXL7WbCkY"> Moses was a type of Jesus as the Apostle, the sent one. When the children of Israel were suffering persecution under the tyranny of Pharaoh, God appeared to Moses and charged him to go to the children of Israel and to Pharaoh. Thus, Moses became an Old Testament apostle. Moses was God’s sent one, the apostle who was to take Israel out of Egypt and lead them through the wilderness for the purpose that they might be constituted as God’s house and to be formed into a habitation of God on earth. This habitation of God was symbolized by the tabernacle made by the children of Israel in the wilderness. That tabernacle was only a symbol; it was not the real habitation of God. At that time, God’s real habitation on earth was the children of Israel themselves. The children of Israel were formed and constituted into a house of God by Moses, God’s apostle. This portrait is very clear. When we read the Bible we need to have such a heavenly vision, a revelation in the spirit. Without this, we can never apprehend the true significance of all the stories in the Old Testament. <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> </p>

Regardless of how much Moses prefigured Christ, he was still only a part of the house, whereas Christ is the Builder of God’s house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96864" data-verses="Hebrews 3:3">3:3</span>). </p>

This typifies that Christ, as the Apostle from God, for God’s house, is faithful to God who constituted Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96865" data-verses="Hebrews 3:2">v. 2</span>). </p>

Likewise, Moses was a testimony, a prefigure, a photograph, a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God. </p>

Moses only had one nature—humanity. This human nature is good for God’s building. But Moses did not have the divine nature which is good for being the builder. The Lord Jesus has two natures, the humanity which is good for the material for the building of God’s habitation and the divinity which is the element of the builder. In His humanity, Jesus is the stone for God’s habitation. He is the foundation stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96868" data-verses="Isaiah 28:16">Isa. 28:16</span>), the cornerstone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96869" data-verses="Matthew 21:42">Matt. 21:42</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96870" data-verses="Acts 4:11">Acts 4:11</span>), the topstone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96871" data-verses="Zechariah 4:7">Zech. 4:7</span>), and the living stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96872" data-verses="1Peter 2:4">1 Pet. 2:4</span>) to produce us as living stones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96873" data-verses="1Peter 2:5">1 Pet. 2:5</span>). In His humanity He is the good material for God’s building and in His divinity He is the Builder. Moses was an apostle <span class="pg" data-page-id="166" id="166">[166]</span> sent from God to constitute God’s house on earth, and Christ was also the Apostle doing the same thing. But Christ is not only a part of the building; He is also the Builder. This is the difference between Christ and Moses. </p>

In that chapter Christ is the Captain, the Firstborn Son, and the High Priest in order for the many brothers to be the church. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96875" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">Chapter three</span> is somewhat different. In this chapter Christ is the Apostle, and the church is the house of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96876" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span> Christ is the Firstborn, the Captain, and the High Priest, and the brothers are the church.

God is the Father, and the church is His house. This is the second function of the church. Just as Christ is the Head and the church is His Body, so God is the Father and the church is His house. The church as the Body of Christ is an organism. In like manner, the church as a house is not a physical house; it is a living house. </p>
<p data-content-id="hZwxam6lXwmH0E7Nl83pYliEuL9a-ocuqHw2FtYp_6HHqSCdwcI5BmEdEnDTEQuNB"> As all Greek students know, the Greek word rendered <em>house</em> here may be translated as “household” or, using the modern term, “folks,” “the members of a family.” God’s house is not a physical house but a living house. God’s house is His family, and His family is His house. His house is also His household, for His folks are His dwelling place. Suppose a certain family has a house. The family is one thing and the house is another. The family is living and the house is physical. But God’s family and God’s house are both living. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96883" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1-2">Hebrews 1 and 2</span> we have seen that we have been constituted to be the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God, and, as the many brothers, we have been formed into the church. Taken as a whole, these two chapters reveal that God is the source and that out of Him have come the many brothers of the Firstborn Son of God who have been formed into the church. The church is simply the expression of God Himself in Christ. In the church we have God. In the church we also have the Son of God, God’s appointed Heir. In the church we also have the Captain of salvation, the Firstborn Son of God, and the Son of Man. In the church we have the many brothers of the Firstborn Son of God and the partners, the joint-heirs of the appointed Heir. All of these heirs are the partners of the unique Heir. The issue of all of this is a glorious expression of God. One day, in the New Jerusalem, this will fully come into being. There, in the New Jerusalem, we shall see the glorious expression of God in full. In the New Jerusalem there will be the throne of God with the Almighty God sitting upon it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96884" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Rev. 22:1</span>). There in the New Jerusalem will be the Father, the Son as the Lamb, and the Spirit flowing as a river of water. The many brothers of the Firstborn and the many sons of God will also be there. In the New Jerusalem we shall see the Lord of all, the Captain, and the High Priest. That city will be the full expression of the glorious God. This is the glory, the rest, the good land, and the region into which we shall enter after we have crossed many rivers. <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ypPAS58zX4Yp4txU9VRAS7eAFXCToz5xsxInBUpzhFwkU2SoOph-gkqdH4Klv2TIx"> While I am speaking, I have a glorious vision in front of me. Oh, I have seen the church! In the church we not only have justification by faith, personal salvation, and forgiveness of sins—we have everything. The church life is a small focus through which we can see the whole picture of the New Jerusalem. Everything that will be in the New Jerusalem in a full way we have in the church today in a miniature way. I have the sensation that in these days we have entered into glory, into rest. This is a foretaste of the full taste that is coming. We are in the glory, in the good land. Christ is not only our God but also today’s Moses. He is a better, higher, and more excellent Moses. He is also our Aaron and our real Joshua, and we are His Calebs, His partners, comrades, and companions. </p>
<p data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LCDcRAtJwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR"> In Greek the word <em>partners</em> is the same word as <em>partakers.</em> The same Greek word has these two meanings. A partaker is absolutely different from a partner. I may be a partaker of my breakfast, meaning that I am one who enjoys breakfast, but I am a partner of a corporation, meaning that I am a joint-owner of that corporation. Because these two English words are the same word in Greek, the translators have had difficulty in rendering the correct meaning of the Greek word. The King James Version made a big mistake in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96885" data-verses="Hebrews 3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span>, translating it as “partakers of Christ.” But according to the context, here the Greek word should not be translated “partakers” but “partners.” The portion from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96886" data-verses="Hebrews 3:7">3:7 through 3:14</span> deals with entering into the good land. The type of this entering into the good land was entering into the land under the leadership of Joshua. Joshua entered into the good land, and Caleb was his partner in this matter. We should not consider Caleb as a partaker of Joshua, for Caleb did not enjoy Joshua; he was a comrade, companion, and partner of Joshua in entering into and possessing the good land. Christ today is our real Joshua, and we must be His Calebs. In this respect, we are not His partakers; we are His partners. When we enjoy Christ, we are His partakers; when we follow Him, we are His partners. My burden in this message is to tell you that we are not only partakers enjoying <span class="pg" data-page-id="175" id="175">[175]</span> Christ but also partners following Him. As His partners, we are working together and cooperating with Him. </p>

This glorious expression is the goal into which we all are going to enter. Our view must be broadened to see that God’s operation in the whole universe is to accomplish a glorious expression of Himself. The Son of God was appointed to accomplish God’s plan. He has been appointed to run this corporation. He was appointed to this office in eternity past. </p>

That anointing was the initial heavenly, divine inauguration. God has initially inaugurated His appointed Heir into His office by anointing Him. God the Spirit poured Himself out as the anointing oil upon this appointed Heir, anointing Him to be the operator of God’s divine operation. </p>
<p data-content-id="IUDJqdl9X6vy3Vq-crvLdfrhsYVwghlxQoAehr9Bor-YhLUZxsqlKZZQEkrirqIrE"> As the partners of Christ, we are partners in His anointing. He was appointed in eternity past and anointed in time. His anointing includes us. I would refer you to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96888" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span> where we see that the ointment poured out upon the head of Aaron, the high priest, flows down upon the whole body to the skirts of his robe. This signifies that all the members of the body of the high priest share his anointing. We, the partakers, share the anointing of the unique Heir. As I have already mentioned, the anointing was the initial inauguration. Therefore, we all share in His inauguration. In this heavenly, divine, and eternal inauguration, we are His partners. He has obtained the anointing, and we share it with Him because we are His partners. This means that we all have been anointed. We all have been put into office. We are not only the partakers of Christ who enjoy Him but also the partners of Christ who share in His operation. I have the full assurance that in giving this message I am sharing in His <span class="pg" data-page-id="176" id="176">[176]</span> operation. He is going to accomplish a full expression of God in glory, and we are now cooperating with Him in this operation. I have heard many testimonies concerning being a partaker of Christ and enjoying Him, but I have not heard one concerning being a partner of Christ. From now on, in the churches we need to hear more testimonies concerning being partners of Christ and sharing in His operation. Recently, many of us have been touched to go to the campuses and preach the high gospel. That kind of preaching should be the sharing in the operation of the anointed Heir. We are Christ’s joint-heirs and partners, cooperating with Him and sharing in His operation. His office must also be our office. </p>

We have seen that the Son is God. How many gods are there? There is only one. Some of those reading this message may unconsciously still hold the concept that there are three gods, but they dare not say that there are three gods. According to the truth of the Bible, there is only one God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96890" data-verses="1Corinthians 8:4">1 Cor. 8:4</span>). We cannot say that there is more than one God. Nevertheless, deep within, many Christians unconsciously hold onto the concept of three gods, the so-called tritheism. I ask you to forget about your traditional teachings. We do not have more than one God. God is one, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96891" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>). But this does not mean that there are three different gods. </p>

This matter of the good land has been a great puzzle to most Bible readers and Bible teachers. Many Christian books speak about the good land. If you read these books, you will realize that all the readers and teachers of the Bible have the feeling that the good land is not merely a tract of land in Palestine. In the Bible, the good land is a symbol, a figure, of something further. Even the lowest interpretation of the good land as a symbol—that it is the region Christians enter after crossing the Jordan River of death—follows the principle that the good land is not merely a tract of land in Palestine but rather signifies something spiritual, holy, and heavenly. It is very difficult for anyone to understand thoroughly the spiritual significance of the good land. I have been studying this matter for years. Ever since my youth, I have been interested in the true significance of this good land. I am sorry to say that as a young Christian I did not receive much help in this regard. But now in this message I shall try my best to present to you what the Lord has shown us concerning the real significance of this good land. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw4SG7vNjq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF">THE PROPER PEOPLE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="lkvZM26z559Bj3lTSOUy7cpuuokXSx0PljTjoOkXjCBX2Rdfb66sdAUBGOBf9pyrf"> In the Bible, the land or earth always signifies the proper people of God. The sea, on the contrary, signifies the world that has been corrupted, polluted, and ruined by Satan. In other words, the land always signifies the people of God, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="184" id="184">[184]</span> the sea signifies the worldly people, the people who have been polluted, corrupted, ruined, and usurped by Satan. </p>

Christ is the good land. When we studied <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96914" data-verses="Genesis 1:9">Genesis 1:9</span> in our Life-study of Genesis, we pointed out that the land which came out of the death water on the third day was a type of the resurrected Christ who came out of death on the third day. As we saw in that study, all of the life, including the vegetable, animal, and human life, came out of the land. Even man was made from the dust of that resurrected land. Medically speaking, our physical body contains the same elements as the earth. In both the earth and our bodies we have such elements as copper, iron, and sulfur. So mankind came from the land, and the land is a figure of Christ. This signifies that Christ is the source of all kinds of life. Christ as the good land, the land that came out of death water, the land that was elevated above and surrounded by the death water, was depicted by the land of Canaan. As we shall see, the land of Canaan is an elevated land surrounded by water. This land is a picture of Christ. </p>

God has chosen us to be the soil into which He sows Himself in order that He Himself may grow in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96915" data-verses="Matthew 13:3">Matt. 13:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96916" data-verses="Matthew 13:23">23</span>). We are God’s soil. Eventually, we become His field and His farm to grow Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96917" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Cor. 3:9</span>). This matter is quite weighty and meaningful. </p>

Thus man was made out of the land and was destined to express God. Man’s body was made with the dust of the resurrected land, but man himself was made in the image of God for the purpose of expressing God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96919" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Gen. 2:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96920" data-verses="Genesis 1:26-28">1:26-28</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="185" id="185">[185]</span> Not only was the dusty man made in God’s image to express God, but he was also committed with God’s authority to exercise God’s dominion and to form God’s kingdom on earth. So God’s expression and kingdom are fully related to the earth. Man came from the resurrected land, the resurrected earth, and lived on this earth to express God and to represent Him, to form an expression of God and a kingdom of God. This expression with the kingdom is God’s goal, and we must enter into it. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzeLoRpvQVUylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> This short word combines the land, Christ, and humanity. The land, Christ, and humanity combined together are the expression of God and the kingdom of God where God’s glory and authority are. This is the sphere into which we all must enter. It is the realm that we all must reach. Here is our rest and satisfaction. Here God is fully expressed and has a dwelling place, His habitation. </p>

In this new heaven and new earth will be the New Jerusalem, and within the New Jerusalem God in Christ flows as the living water which symbolizes the flowing Spirit. If you look at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96922" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span>, you will see a picture of the land, Christ, and all of God’s chosen, regenerated, sanctified, and glorified people. This combination of the land, Christ, and us will be God’s expression with God’s kingdom. This is our good land, the land that we all must strive to enter into.

This is God’s eternal purpose: to express Himself in a practical and real way through a corporate entity composed of many human beings. This is God’s eternal purpose. In order <span class="pg" data-page-id="186" id="186">[186]</span> to accomplish this purpose, God created the heavens and the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="19J7BMpUdAP-KQCUvDLCjUD_QlvZvr1TF44VGLYr0Wq30Cf62POCZtTmD67IMB8WQ"> Satan, God’s enemy, intervened and damaged God’s creation, especially the earth. So the earth was judged with water by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96923" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Gen. 1:2</span>). The whole earth was under the judging water, which was a kind of death covering the land. Then God came in and raised up the land that had been covered by the death water, raising it out of the death water on the third day. A good number of Bible teachers agree that this is a picture of the resurrected Christ. The land that was raised out of the water on the third day was a type of the resurrected Christ from whom all life has come into being. Out of this land God made man in His own image to express and represent Him. In Adam at that time we could see the land because Adam was made with the dust of the ground. We could also see Christ because Adam was made in the image of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96924" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> says that man was made in the image of God, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96925" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> says that Christ is the image of the invisible God. Therefore, man was made in the image of Christ and bore the image of Christ. If you could have seen Adam, you would have seen the image of Christ. So with Adam, a man, there were the dust of the land and the image of Christ. Hence, in Adam we see three things: the land, Christ, and man. These three things are combined to be God’s expression and God’s kingdom. That was a miniature of what God intended to obtain. </p>

When the Lord Jesus became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96926" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>), He came to become dust. When He came to join with man, it meant that He came to join with the earth. After Adam had been damaged, man eventually became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96927" data-verses="Genesis 6:3">Gen. 6:3</span>), and God came in to judge that flesh. When God judged the flesh, He also judged the earth, for the flesh, that is, mankind, cannot be separated from the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96928" data-verses="Genesis 6:12-13">Gen. 6:12-13</span>). In God’s sight and according to God’s concept, man is always related <span class="pg" data-page-id="187" id="187">[187]</span> to the earth. When man is judged, the earth is judged, and when the earth is judged, man is judged. God always treats these two things together. By the flood, God judged the flesh and the earth. </p>

What is the Sabbath rest? As I have already pointed out, throughout the centuries it has been difficult for Christians to understand the matter of the good land of Canaan. Likewise, Christians have been unable to understand properly the Sabbath rest revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96936" data-verses="Hebrews 4:1">Hebrews 4</span>. Some say that the Sabbath rest in this chapter is the millennium. They say that the millennial kingdom, a period of a thousand years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96937" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">Rev. 20:4</span>), will be the seventh period of a thousand years, the first six thousand years being the period from the time of Adam’s creation until the time of the Lord’s coming back. This concept is based upon the fact that in the eyes of the Lord a thousand years are the same as a day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96938" data-verses="2Peter 3:8">2 Pet. 3:8</span>). According to those who hold this concept, six days mean six thousand years, and the seventh day will be the seventh thousand, the Sabbath rest during the millennium. This interpretation has never satisfied me. To say that the Sabbath rest in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96939" data-verses="Hebrews 4:9">4:9</span> is simply the millennial kingdom is not altogether accurate; it is only partially correct. </p>

The first time that the Bible mentions the Sabbath is after the creation of man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96940" data-verses="Genesis 2:2-3">Gen. 2:2-3</span>). Many Christians, looking at this matter superficially, only see that the Sabbath was the seventh day, the day on which God rested after completing His work of creation. Although it is correct to say this, <span class="pg" data-page-id="192" id="192">[192]</span> we need to look into the contents. Why did God not rest on the fifth day? You may say that He did not rest on the fifth day because He had not finished His work. That is correct. What, then, did God lack? It is very meaningful to see what He lacked. </p>
<p data-content-id="eQJD4_jtknWQat9jcVOn7Uht1NNYK_r5XUDNpcDDJV6S5IySpcJb2P-RieMVJy8R6"> According to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96941" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, God created all things by means of His word, calling things not being as being through His word. But the creation of man was not done in this way. God did not create man simply by saying, “Man,” and bringing mankind into being. No, God made man with the dust of the ground (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96942" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Gen. 2:7</span>). Nothing else was made with any kind of material substance. When God wanted light, He said, “Light,” and light came into being. The creation of man, however, was absolutely different. When God created man, He did not call things not being as being. Firstly, there was a conference among the Godhead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96943" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>) and then He used a certain material, the dust of the ground, to create man. If man had not been created on the sixth day, God would have been unable to rest on the seventh day even though everything else had been created. It was not the completion of the work that caused God to rest—it was the creation of man. After God created man, He was satisfied and was able to rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="59tq157xwce1XvZTZYWABH6t9S6AdhVzhWKgIad9yUQA9xO1kuO2-Z98Caw01EdMR"> How can we prove this? In all the days of creation, except for the second day, God looked at His work and said, “Good.” But at the end of the sixth day, after man had been created, God saw everything that He had made and said, “Very good” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96944" data-verses="Genesis 1:31">Gen. 1:31</span>). When He said, “Very good,” it meant that He was satisfied. At the end of the sixth day, seeing man in His image to express Him and committed with His authority to represent Him, God was satisfied and said, “Very good.” </p>
<p data-content-id="afNFn9OFFhiGx4i5yPayvV7QJUgPwOHF65dbAP4BbUq6H0aWVC2NiuPeDe_39lWHN"> Our study of the Bible has been greatly influenced by our religious background. Even before we ever read the Bible, we already had certain concepts about it. These concepts are damaging. Before we could look at the colors in the Bible, we had already put on colored eye glasses. As a result, we could not see the real colors in the Scriptures. We must take off our glasses and look at the Bible in a pure way. This is why <span class="pg" data-page-id="193" id="193">[193]</span> I say again and again that we must return to the pure Word and reread and restudy it. We need to forget what we have heard about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96945" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> in the past. If you reread <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96946" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span>, you will see that God rested on the seventh day not mainly because His work was finished but because He had attained what He desired. What God desired was not a finished work. Rather, He wanted mankind to be on the earth expressing and representing Him. This is His heart’s desire. As long as God can have this, He is satisfied. God’s heart is satisfied by having man on the earth expressing and representing Him. When God had this, He rested on the seventh day. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bL3_vIKwgozM1X2VsKZqE0gLVG0mDEIoUOwwkTFE2jCXoezsRLTSk_IdHBfxVvI3_">II. THE LOSS OF THE SABBATH REST</h2><p data-content-id="qKxtcI35M3YEACqdkwu3F6oAhTXcUUjY_hyL2HgqHBT9dM7ruT_ZFMeT5R17JOoOA"> When man was damaged by the fall, this rest was lost. At this point, we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96947" data-verses="John 5:1">John chapter five</span>, the case of the enlivening of the impotent man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96948" data-verses="John 5:9">John 5:9</span> says, “And immediately the man became well, and picked up his bed and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day” (Recovery Version). In enlivening the impotent man, the Lord did something which, according to the Jewish regulations, was not permitted on the Sabbath day. As a result, the Jews persecuted the Lord Jesus. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96949" data-verses="John 5:16">Verse 16</span> says, “And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath” (Recovery Version). On the Sabbath day, they sought to kill Jesus. Do you believe that anyone who is seeking to kill a person could be at rest? Do you think that all those persecuting Jews had rest in their hearts? I do not believe it. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96950" data-verses="John 5:17">verse 17</span> we see the Lord’s answer to the Jews: “My Father is working until now, and I am working” (Recovery Version). The Lord seemed to be saying, “You are keeping the Sabbath, but My Father is working. The Sabbath that He had on the seventh day has been lost because man has been damaged. As long as man has not been recovered, My Father is still working. Look at this poor man. He has been lost, spoiled, ruined, and corrupted by the enemy of God. How can My Father rest? You may rest according to your tradition, but you don’t have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="194" id="194">[194]</span> real rest. While you say you keep the Sabbath, you don’t know what the Sabbath really means. You do not have rest, do you? Neither does My Father have rest. So, My Father is still working, and I am working too. This is why I am here. I have come here to do My work. Don’t you know that the Sabbath has been lost, that the Sabbath on which God was satisfied has been lost, destroyed by the enemy of God? Don’t you know that God lost what He had gained? My Father is working until now. Since <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96951" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, My Father has never stopped working because the man who satisfied Him has been damaged.” How we need to be impressed with the real significance of the Sabbath! The significance of the Sabbath is that God is satisfied with man when man expresses and represents Him. When there is a situation in which man expresses God and represents Him, that day is the Sabbath to God. </p>

THE GOOD LAND AS THE SABBATH REST</h2><p data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LCA8RH-pwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR"> Now we need to return to the matter of the good land. Why was the good land a rest? Did the children of Israel rest in the good land? From the very day they entered into it they were fighting constantly. Then why did God call that land the rest, as He did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96952" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:9">Deuteronomy 12:9</span>? Superficially speaking, people say that the good land of Canaan was called the rest because the people made their homes in it and settled there. This thought is rather natural and superficial. The land was a rest because the temple could be built there. There, with the temple, God could have His expression and representation. When God is expressed and represented, there is satisfaction for both God and man, and that is the real rest. </p>

<p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-maaYGW2zlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> In the last message we saw the real meaning of the Sabbath rest, seeing that it is not merely a rest after the completion of work but that it means satisfaction. If your desire has not been satisfied, you cannot have rest. The best rest, the real rest, is the satisfaction of our heart’s desire. When we consider this matter of the Sabbath rest, we must learn what is God’s heart’s desire. From the beginning of the Bible to the end, we can see that God’s desire according to His eternal plan is to have Himself expressed and represented by man. It was for this reason that He created man in His own image and gave him dominion over all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96984" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). When man is on the earth expressing God and representing Him, God’s desire is satisfied. When we are satisfied in our God’s desire, we are resting even as we are laboring and working. When the Bible first mentions man, it speaks of God’s image and dominion, indicating that man was destined to express God with His image and to represent God with His dominion. In other words, man has been destined by God to express Him and represent Him in His image and with His authority to set up a kingdom, a divine realm, for God’s rule on earth. This is clearly pictured in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96985" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="iP_bgkHD-VyM-lbYNnOmmu4Ntl-wBR5Dynf2bHQ8WpjrkRIRPrECHRAQWFcx0WQUb"> When we come to the end of the Bible, after centuries of God’s work of creation, redemption, transformation, and glorification, we see a city with God’s appearance. God sitting upon the throne has the appearance of jasper (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96986" data-verses="Revelation 4:2-3">Rev. 4:2-3</span>), and the entire city of New Jerusalem also has the appearance of jasper (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96987" data-verses="Revelation 21:11">Rev. 21:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96988" data-verses="Revelation 21:18">18a</span>), signifying that God will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="202" id="202">[202]</span> fully expressed in and through that city. When you look at that city, you will see God. There, in the New Jerusalem, God will be fully expressed. Moreover, in the center of the city is the throne of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96989" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Rev. 22:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96990" data-verses="Revelation 22:3">3</span>), showing that God’s dominion also is there. In the New Jerusalem God’s image will be expressed and His authority will be exercised. Therefore, in eternity future on the new earth, the New Jerusalem will be God’s complete expression and dominion. That will be the true Sabbath rest to God. At that time, God will be fully at rest because His heart’s desire will have been completely satisfied. He will have obtained what He desired to have. This is the real meaning of the Sabbath rest. </p>

<p data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXv_vBf4q_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB"> Based upon this understanding of the Sabbath rest, we can see in the Bible different ages or periods in the Sabbath rest. Firstly, the children of Israel in the Old Testament age were God’s Sabbath. The children of Israel expressed God and represented Him on earth. Although there are many negative stories concerning the children of Israel in the Bible, they did, nonetheless, express and represent God. We should not only look at the black side of the history of the children of Israel but also at the white side. When I was a young Christian, almost everything that I heard about the children of Israel was negative. In message after message we were warned not to be like Israel. As a result of this, I received the deep impression that the book of Numbers was the worst book in the Bible. Many years later I learned that the book of Numbers was glorious. Although there is the black side in this book, there is also the white side. For example, what happened when Baalam was hired to curse Israel? God sovereignly took care of this matter, and out of Baalam’s mouth came blessings instead of cursings. Baalam said, “He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96991" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">Num. 23:21</span>), and, “How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel! (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96992" data-verses="Numbers 24:5">Num. 24:5</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="203" id="203">[203]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41YyEZ9mIMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg"> The Old Testament reveals that Israel, God’s chosen people, became God’s rest, His Sabbath. Israel secured the good land, and that good land became “the land of Emmanuel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96993" data-verses="Isaiah 8:8">Isa. 8:8</span>). The word Emmanuel means “God with us.” The land of Canaan was called the land of God with man, the land where God was able to be with man. Since God secured that land through the children of Israel, the children of Israel became His Sabbath. </p>
<p data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXv_vBXqa_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB"> Eventually the children of Israel built the temple for God, and the shekinah glory of the Lord filled it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96994" data-verses="1Kings 8:11">1 Kings 8:11</span>). On that day, God not only came down from heaven, but His shekinah glory filled the temple. That was more precious than God’s creation of the earth. If God could only create the earth but not gain it and build His temple, His habitation, on it, then what was the use of the earth? After the temple was built, God could say, “Now I have a habitation on earth.” The land secured by the children of Israel not only became the land of Emmanuel, the land of God with man, but also the site where God’s habitation was built. God’s expression was there in the temple, which was a symbol of Israel as God’s habitation on earth. When the temple had been built and was filled with God’s glory, God rested. Do you not believe that the children of Israel were also at rest? Yes, they all rested with God; that was a Sabbath to them. As all of them rested with God, they surely kept the Sabbath. That was the first stage of the Sabbath rest. </p>

Jesus as God’s Sabbath Rest</h2><p data-content-id="nGm-eJrwx-DRz6RAx60bNhAUgiuiP-3qER1EiyiqV-1eQ6SXHd83e5a9vAuFAVRIG"> In His economy, God always acts in a gradual way. Firstly, God had Adam and then, gradually, He had Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham with his descendants, and then the children of Israel. But that was not the end. After this gradual development, Jesus, the second man, came. When the Lord Jesus was baptized, God was happy and satisfied, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96995" data-verses="Matthew 3:17">Matt. 3:17</span>). When God said that He was pleased with His Son, it meant that He was satisfied. At that time, the Lord Jesus was the Sabbath rest to God. Not only did <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> God rest in Him, but so many of those who followed Him also rested in the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus was the Sabbath rest to God and His followers. Both God and His followers rested in Him. </p>

If Christ was God’s Sabbath, then how much more extensive should the church be as His Sabbath? If Israel was God’s Sabbath, then the church must be even more of a Sabbath to Him. If the Lord Jesus in the flesh was God’s Sabbath, then the church, the Body of Christ, must be an even greater Sabbath to God. Although I have heard that when we come to the Lord Jesus we have rest, I have never heard that we also may have rest when we come to the church. Today I want to announce to you the glad tidings that the church is your rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="smQkdlepcUj2tnXbV2UxwKMQDX7gpeQPNsDo0T9aLCfvZuZlwoPT8L125acok8hfa"> No place is as restful as your own home. Is not the church your home? If the church is your home, then the church must certainly be your rest. Is not the church God’s house? Since the church is God’s house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96996" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">1 Tim. 3:15</span>), then the church must be God’s rest today. </p>
<p data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPdOxpN5MwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm"> In this age, the age of the church, Christ is our rest. But do you not realize that the church is the enlargement of Christ? If Christ is our rest, then what about the church as the enlargement of Christ? If the individual Christ is our rest, then what about the corporate Christ? How can we forget the enlarged Christ or neglect the corporate Christ? Not only is the individual Christ our rest but also the corporate Christ. Not only the Head but also the Body is our Sabbath rest. Recently the Lord burdened me, saying, “You must go and tell My people that the church is their rest today!” Never have I seen so clearly as in these days that the church is today’s Sabbath rest. </p>

<p data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPeMhpJqcwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm"> We thank the Lord for what He has been showing us about the Sabbath rest. God could never find His full rest in heaven, because heaven is not the place where His eternal purpose is fulfilled. God’s full rest is on earth with man. Regardless of how wonderful or excellent the angels may be, God’s rest is not with the angels in heaven but with man on the earth. This is why the Lord Jesus taught us to pray, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97054" data-verses="Matthew 6:10">Matt. 6:10</span>).

THE PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT<br/>OF THE SABBATH REST</h2><p data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6ASlFtM6XM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX"> Beginning at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97055" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, this matter of the Sabbath rest develops progressively. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97056" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we see that God’s first Sabbath was immediately after He had gained a man on earth in His image to express Him and with His authority to represent Him. Immediately after securing a man on earth in His image and with His dominion, God rested. That was the first Sabbath. God’s second Sabbath was with the children of Israel. After the children of Israel had gained the good land of Canaan and had built there a temple which was filled with God’s shekinah glory, God had His second Sabbath on earth. The temple in the good land filled with God’s glory signified that God had secured on earth a people to be His dwelling place, a place where He could dwell, express Himself and exercise His dominion. This was God’s second <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> Sabbath with man on earth. Thus, in the Old Testament we have two outstanding stories concerning God’s Sabbath: the first in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97057" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> and the second in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97058" data-verses="1Kings 8:1">1 Kings 8</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Z-QbeF7eFSCsrR20PWwNBnNXtOdizFUNBnmIQqNZgJ_0WMRdgwQ1A7MTTYXlofxbP"> As we saw in the last message, when the Lord Jesus came, He also was God’s Sabbath. Following the Lord Jesus, we have the church as the Sabbath rest to God. Christ is the Head and the church is the Body. When we come to the day of Pentecost in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97059" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>, we see that the glory of God filled the temple once again, and God again secured a habitation with man on earth for His rest. We may say that this is the third Sabbath. God had gained a man on the earth. Although God did have something with Noah, Abraham, and with the Lord Jesus Himself, in this message we need to focus on the three main Sabbaths: the first Sabbath after the creation of man in God’s image and with God’s dominion; the second when the temple was built on earth and filled with God’s glory; and the third when the church, as the new man, was built with people in God’s image. </p>
<p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCYrZPj7-2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> The first two Sabbaths, the Sabbath after the creation of man and the Sabbath after the building of the temple, both were pictures; neither of them was the real thing. The first real Sabbath that God secured with man on earth was the building up of the church. The church is not a Sabbath rest in figure but in reality. The Sabbaths with Adam and with the building up of the temple were types, but the building up of the church is not a type—it is the fulfillment. </p>
<p data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0OlIZMcNUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW"> God’s way is a progressive way. We can see this in His creation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97060" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. Why did not God create everything in a single day? He could have completed everything in just a few minutes. On the first day God simply called for the light, and on the second day He created the expanse. If we had been there, we probably would not have been very patient, saying to God, “God, the light is here, but we need air.” Sometimes we are faster than God. God’s way is often contrary to ours; He always does things in a progressive way. One day, God became a man, sowed Himself into mankind, and after the death and resurrection of that man, the church was produced. But God did not accomplish everything <span class="pg" data-page-id="215" id="215">[215]</span> once for all. Although God has sown Himself into us as the seed, the harvest has not yet come. Whatever we have received, secured, and gained today is the seed, not the harvest. God is patient. Although the seed was sown nearly two thousand years ago, God did not accomplish all the work once for all at that time. When God sowed Himself into mankind, a wonderful age, the New Testament age, began. Before the Lord Jesus came God had never sown Himself into mankind. Adam and the children of Israel were types. God never sowed Himself into the soil of Adam or into the soil of the children of Israel because they were types. Only in the church is the real soil into which God has sown Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dnuiqigwMWCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0"> Consider the natural law of the growth of a seed. If you sow a seed into the ground, you do not expect to have a harvest the next morning. Not even a mushroom grows that fast. The best harvest will always take the longest time. According to natural law, life takes time to grow, and the highest life requires the longest time to grow. A dog may grow to maturity in less than a year, but a human being needs at least eighteen years to grow into maturity. Parents do not expect their children to grow as quickly as a dog grows. Nevertheless, all the pastors, preachers, and ministers are dreaming, thinking that we Christians can grow up overnight. We need time to grow, time to ripen and mature. </p>

THE GROWING SABBATH AND<br/>THE SABBATH OF MATURITY</h2><p data-content-id="dY63Ns4YQPAy0AY63eLj6fwJq9aw209Dd3yRfmCJvmFRPo7bCwFO5qUAj0SHHhN9d"> God has sown Himself into a part of mankind which became the church and which includes everyone who has received the Lord Jesus. But after receiving the Lord Jesus there is a problem: How are we going to allow the Lord to grow in us? In the parable of the sower in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97061" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>, we see four kinds of soil. Although each type of soil received the same seed, the issue, the result, was different in each case. Have you been regenerated? Have you received the Lord Jesus? What will be the issue? This is the very thing that many Christians miss today. Yes, the church life is a Sabbath rest to God, but it is not a Sabbath with maturity. It is <span class="pg" data-page-id="216" id="216">[216]</span> good, but it is not altogether good; it is not yet good enough. The church life is wonderful as far as the seed goes, but we have not yet reached the harvest. There is a Sabbath for God in the church life today, but this Sabbath is not yet complete, perfect, or mature. Hence, there will be another stage of the Sabbath—the age of harvest at the time when the Lord Jesus comes back. When the Lord Jesus comes the second time, that will be the age of the harvest. It is wonderful to see the field growing, but this could never be as wonderful as the harvest. Undoubtedly, there is a real Sabbath for God in the church life because God has sown Himself as the seed into the field and the field is now growing. Nevertheless, we must remember that we are still not in the harvest. Will you be ripe when the harvest time comes? If you inquire of farmers, they will tell you that some of the crop is not ripe at the harvest time. Today’s Sabbath in the church life is a real Sabbath, but it is not a Sabbath with perfection or maturity. That Sabbath will be in the next age. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97062" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> we see the field growing, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97063" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> we see the harvest being reaped. </p>

<p data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGF88vZFQsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_"> In the last three messages we have seen the meaning of the Sabbath rest according to the full revelation of the Holy Word. In brief, the Sabbath rest is simply God’s satisfaction in His heart’s desire. Whenever and wherever God is expressed and represented by man on earth, He is satisfied and at rest. As we have pointed out, the first Sabbath was after the creation of man, and the second Sabbath was after the completion of the building of the temple. Both of these Sabbaths were figures of God’s Sabbath, not the real Sabbath. After the Lord Jesus came to declare God, expressing and representing Him as an example and model, the church was produced by His death and resurrection and became the corporate expression and representation of God. When God has the church, He is truly expressed and represented. Undoubtedly, the church life is a real Sabbath to God. The church as the Sabbath rest is not a figure but a fulfillment of what was prefigured in the Old Testament. When God gained the church, He obtained a real Sabbath. </p>
<p data-content-id="W1iZtRdq2EaOvu-m8SfI9jayZQ9_rOlrXR3fm3GUzcPU0O7qbBBiKxEFUeCJG_ERL"> As we saw in the last message, the age of the church is just the sowing and growing stage. Regardless how long this stage may be according to our feeling, it is still one stage, the stage of sowing and growing. In this stage, God’s major task is to sow Himself into mankind and to make this part of mankind the church, the Body of Christ, the house of God. This part of mankind which has been injected with God Himself as life must grow in Christ and reach maturity. We must be very clear about this point. Why is God able to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="224" id="224">[224]</span> satisfied in this age? Because in this age He is expressed and represented through the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="2p-Clb9asquxf4mQ9n64n41N8fz_IFbKGR1gkxbP1RjXC1oK7CumV6zeFKsjKYYc6"> In the New Testament we are clearly told that the church as the expression and representation of God is the kingdom of God on earth today (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97077" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>). Whoever receives Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is born into the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97078" data-verses="John 3:5">John 3:5</span>). Praise the Lord that the church is the kingdom of God today! <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97079" data-verses="Hebrews 12:28">Hebrews 12:28</span> says that we are receiving an unshakable kingdom. This verse does not say that we have received the kingdom or that we shall receive it; it says that we are in the process of receiving the kingdom. We cannot say that we have not received an amount of the kingdom, but our receiving of the kingdom has not yet been fully accomplished. The kingdom has already started and it is continuing. </p>
<p data-content-id="u4VI6PwMV9YLyodQonZhSgFS-t-vTx71vxZI3U8v6Kn8u6sybJckax5dbxTnzWMOb"> In the church age we are in the growing Sabbath, in the Sabbath where Christ as life is growing. God’s heart is at least somewhat satisfied with this growing Sabbath, but it is not satisfied in full because it is just the growing stage, not the final stage, the stage of harvest. The book of Hebrews was written to encourage the wandering, hesitating, and staggering Hebrews to come into the proper church life, today’s Sabbath rest. But following this Sabbath, there is something still better—the harvest Sabbath. Both of these are real Sabbaths to God. Today God does have a true Sabbath in the church life. We never realized that there could be such a wonderful thing as the church life. But by His mercy, the Lord has opened our eyes, showing us the church life, which is something holy, heavenly, and spiritual that we can touch in our spirit and enjoy with the Lord as our Sabbath rest. Hallelujah, there is such a church life on earth today! </p>
<p data-content-id="fuOTOIbl26ICXoDfOfmOwe02yx-5N_EbrL-zVhjSApM5ECRzMvL1jcqgw8vvh-fDb"> If we know the Bible and God’s economy, we shall realize that everyone who has been regenerated and has received salvation needs to come into the church life. This is God’s economy. If you do not come into the church life, you will miss the mark. God’s economy is not only that you be saved and regenerated; His economy is that you come into the proper church life, which is today’s Sabbath. God’s economy is to have a corporate expression and representation of Himself. God is <span class="pg" data-page-id="225" id="225">[225]</span> very patient; He is fulfilling His economy progressively. Firstly, He has sown Himself into His chosen people and now He is giving them time to grow. </p>

THE ULTIMATE SABBATH</h2><p data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6AS1FreKXM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX"> We are now in the church life, the growing Sabbath that is leading us into the harvest Sabbath of the millennial kingdom. But not even the harvest Sabbath will be the ultimate Sabbath. The ultimate Sabbath rest will be the New Jerusalem. At the time of the New Jerusalem, there will be no more sea, satanic work, or corrupted and polluted world. All of that will be in the lake of fire. There will be a new earth, and upon that new earth there will be a city built up with transformed people as the living materials. That living composition, the New Jerusalem, will be God’s complete expression in eternity future. There, in the New Jerusalem, we shall see God’s expression and dominion. In the New Jerusalem will be God’s throne and authority for His kingdom. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate and eternal Sabbath because there God will be fully expressed and represented. That will be the ultimate consummation of God’s work of grace, and we all shall be there. </p>
<p data-content-id="Z-QbeF7eFSCsrR20PWwNBndXkcdizFUNBnmIQqNZgJ_0WMRdgwQ1A7MTTYXlofxbP"> Whether we are diligent or sloppy, our wise Father has a way to perfect us and make us mature. If we do not cooperate with Him, He is patient and will wait for tomorrow, next month, next year, or even for the next age. Before the age of the New Jerusalem, there are two ages, this age and the coming age. During both of these ages our patient Father will deal with His naughty children. If we are naughty and do not participate in the growing Sabbath today, we may miss the harvest Sabbath in the coming age. To miss the coming harvest Sabbath does not mean that we shall be lost. Since we are children of the Father, we can never be lost. But if we do not behave ourselves in His grace today, making it difficult for our Father to deal with us, we may miss the coming harvest Sabbath. However, our Father is much wiser than we are and has a way to bring us to maturity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> Eventually we all shall be in the New Jerusalem, the ultimate Sabbath. </p>
<p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCYrJPrpu2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> There will be a total of three real Sabbaths: the church, the millennial kingdom, and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth. Although all these are Sabbaths to God, the second will be better than the first, and third will be fuller than the second. I have the complete assurance that we all shall share in the third and fullest Sabbath, for that Sabbath is wholly a matter of grace, not of reward. It is not a prize but our Father’s eternal portion for all of His children. As long as you are a child of the Father, He has a way to make you mature so that eventually you will participate in that third Sabbath. </p>

<p data-content-id="z7nP6wvdoRcXW7_4yqTmhVkP_mq7mFR7fpfSTniJz1DC07eXfxsSNj_pn0tdjMZNa"> The Bible is the revelation of God. If we are to understand any major aspect of this revelation, we must take care of the governing principles established and revealed in the Bible. The governing principle of the Bible as a whole is that God in eternity past made a purpose, a plan, which was to express Himself with His authority. This plan, God’s eternal purpose, is thoroughly revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97090" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> we see that man is the center of God’s created universe. Although God created the heavens, the earth, and millions of other items, the central item is man. God made man in a very specific way, forming him out of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97091" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Gen. 2:7</span>) and in His own image (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97092" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). Hence, man, a single entity, bears two things: the earth and the image of God. In substance man is earthly, but in expression he is divine. In this one entity, man, we see a wonderful principle—one creature bearing the earthly substance and the divine image. When man expressed God’s image and exercised His authority in His dominion, God was at rest. As we have seen in previous messages, this is the significance of the Sabbath rest. That was the situation at the very beginning of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="afNFn9OFFhiGx4i5yPaysXbQOGAPwOHF65dbAP4BbUq6H0aWVC2NiuPeDe_39lWHN"> When we go to the end of the Bible, we see the consummation: the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. In the new heaven and new earth, the earth will be more useful than heaven because the New Jerusalem will be on the earth. If we read Revelation carefully, we shall see that the New Jerusalem is not a physical building, but a <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> living composition composed of living persons, such as the twelve Apostles of the Lamb and the twelve tribes of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97093" data-verses="Revelation 21:12">Rev. 21:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97094" data-verses="Revelation 21:14">14</span>). The city of New Jerusalem will bear the appearance of God and express Him in a full way. Moreover, God’s throne will be in that city, and God’s authority will be fully exercised there. This is the eternal kingdom of God. Therefore, in the New Jerusalem God will have complete rest and obtain His eternal Sabbath. This matter is the governing principle of the whole Bible. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bL3_vIKwgozM1X2VsKZqH2ALTUEmDEIoUOwwkTFE2jCXoezsRLTSk_IdHBfxVvI3_">XIX. THE THREE PERIODS OF THE UNIVERSE</h2><p data-content-id="qKxtcI35M3YEACqdkwu3G4IAoBXcUUjY_hyL2HgqHBT9dM7ruT_ZFMeT5R17JOoOA"> If we are to know the Bible, we need to have an overall view of it. Do you realize that the universe is composed of three periods? The first period was the time before Adam, the period that is called the pre-Adamic age. As we saw in our Life-Study of Genesis, before Adam was created the universe was already in existence. No one can tell how long that first period of time was. The second period of the universe extends from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97095" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</span> through the end of the coming millennium, from the time of the creation of Adam until the end of the millennium. This period of time is quite short, perhaps not more than seven thousand years. Although we may think that this is a long time, in God’s eyes seven thousand years are the equivalent of seven days, for to Him a thousand years are as one day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97096" data-verses="2Peter 3:8">2 Pet. 3:8</span>). Following this second period, there will be the third period of the universe—the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. That period will last for eternity. In order to know the Bible thoroughly, we must understand these three periods of the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="ypPAS58zX4Yp4txU9VRAR6eAJXCToz5xsxInBUpzhFwkU2SoOph-gkqdH4Klv2TIx"> The first period of the universe was the period of the fall. God created, Satan damaged, and God came in to judge the universe. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97097" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</span> we have the start of God’s re-creation. Strictly speaking, only <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97098" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">verse 1</span> of Genesis refers to God’s creation, for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97099" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">verse 2</span> is the beginning of God’s re-creation. Within God’s re-creation there was further creation. Man, for instance, was not a re-creation but a creation. From the time of God’s re-creation until the full completion of His <span class="pg" data-page-id="235" id="235">[235]</span> purpose will be a period of approximately seven thousand years. Since it is during this span of time that God accomplishes His eternal purpose, we may call this the period of accomplishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="4reRc8xEUdB8gspB5LzSSF42TNhcoBqXNha6kcLoR0GcevFpPwoI5sDlLglcpJmid"> The period of accomplishment began with the creation of man. Man was God’s creation. God’s re-creation only recovered the fallen universe back to a condition suitable for man’s creation and existence. The second coming of the Lord Jesus will not end the period of accomplishment, because the old heaven and old earth will continue for another thousand years after the Lord’s coming back. Those one thousand years will be a continuation of the period of accomplishment. The Lord’s second coming is even a further step in the accomplishment of God’s purpose. Therefore, God’s accomplishment of His purpose began with the creation of man and will be completed not at the time of the Lord’s second coming but at the end of the millennium. </p>
<p data-content-id="o8J_Xe_Oo1DTEOu7_yttzmvkmvNr4zswpHSO-jDOTVFBVk47Q4_e4i6jscHWlhJOs"> After the period of accomplishment, the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem will come. That will be the period of the eternal Sabbath, the time of the complete Sabbath. The eternal period in the future will be an unending Sabbath. Our Father, our Savior, and all the redeemed ones will be there. This is our destiny, our future. Our future is the eternal Sabbath where our Father, our Savior, and all of us will be at rest for eternity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3kUaZWif4GddJ6x0-mt9Rcp_7mBfG_163rGTsaQ8Mae1t0n_om2qIm8zuQfDDDM9E">XX. THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD’S PURPOSE</h2><p data-content-id="GZ-Xs1QsCoQof4c8ULP1D9jxChMb8E7KkBAeRYnN9vmNPkf2OrDQ2hBVPHBKl6cA3"> Let us now see how God accomplishes His purpose. Firstly, He created man. In his natural make-up, man is not the genuine fulfillment of God’s purpose, but only a photograph, a prefigure. But even in this photograph we can see the features of God’s satisfaction. The Old Testament mainly reveals two things: God’s creation of man and His calling of man. God made Adam and called Abraham. Abraham, including Isaac, Jacob, and all Jacob’s children, was the corporate called one. All the children of Israel were called in Abraham. Thus, Abraham was a corporate man, a prefigure once again of God’s satisfaction. In this corporate man we <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> can see much more than we can with Adam, for Adam was only a single man as a photograph of God’s satisfaction, while Abraham, including his descendants, was a complete, corporate figure of God’s satisfaction. The Old Testament reveals these two prefigures of God’s satisfaction, one individual and the other corporate. However, in principle both are the same, revealing what God’s satisfaction is. We need to have such an overview if we are to understand the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="ce50k8tQiJj2hm-zVHrfF0gS5_8sx9bxTn4PDYyUCKmXbgGgJ_N3tdzwHbUeZPInF"> While the Old Testament shows us the prefigure, the New Testament reveals the reality. God Himself came to be a man, to be the seed which He Himself has sown into mankind as the earth, the soil. We should never separate mankind from the earth, because in substance these two are one. The Bible clearly says that man came out of the earth and belongs to the earth. God came to sow Himself as a seed into humanity, the real earth. This one grain of wheat fell into the earth of humanity, died, and in resurrection produced many grains which have been formed together into one loaf, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97100" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97101" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:17">1 Cor. 10:17</span>). In this loaf, the church, we have God’s expression and God’s dominion. Here in the church is God’s kingdom where God’s authority is exercised and His image is expressed. Hence, the church is God’s Sabbath, the first stage of God’s accomplishment of His purpose in a genuine and real way. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyD-GahA7CZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH"> But there is the need of another stage. The first stage was with the Lord’s first coming, and the second stage will begin with His second coming. In order for Him to accomplish His purpose in a genuine way, He needs to come twice. In His first coming, He sowed Himself into mankind, and in His second coming He will reap what He sowed in His first coming. Something was accomplished with His first coming—the church was produced, and there was a Sabbath—but this is not the full completion of His purpose. His second coming will accomplish more, bringing in a fuller Sabbath. His first coming brought in the first real Sabbath, but this Sabbath is not the full Sabbath, because the accomplishment of God’s purpose has not yet been completed. Thus, there is a need of His coming again to complete His <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> accomplishment of God’s eternal purpose. This means that God’s eternal purpose could never be accomplished before the Lord’s second coming. In other words, God’s eternal purpose cannot be fully completed without the millennium. </p>

God deals with His house, that is, His children, in one way and at one time, and He deals with those who do not obey the gospel in another way and at another time. Although we have been saved and have become God’s household, God’s family, this does not mean that we shall never again be judged by God. On the contrary, this verse says that God’s judgment will begin at His house. If God were unjust in dealing with His own children, how could He judge the unbelievers and those who oppose Him? The principle here is that in order for God to be just in judging the unbelievers, He must firstly make a righteous judgment of His children. </p>

GROWING IN LIFE<br/>FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD’S PURPOSE</h2><p data-content-id="Qpdn89MhLxfVrIv8GWTBeVisdZw55oZqOEuk2qvXDTa4ELyWoRmN1r_WYV01cf7Lc"> God’s intention is not to have a universe filled with neat, clean, righteous, sinless people. As we have seen, God’s purpose is to sow Himself into His chosen people, making them His children. Once we have become God’s children through regeneration, having God’s life as our seed and content, we need to grow with and into God and be fully transformed by being permeated with all His divine elements. God’s intention is not to gain a group of pure, righteous people; it is to gain a people who have been saturated with Him and built up in Him. Satan came in to frustrate God’s work mainly <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> through sin, the world, and the self. Thus, if we are to grow in God’s life, we must hate sin, forsake the world, and deny the self. The object of dealing with sin is not merely to deal with the sin itself, but to eliminate the satanic frustration to the growth in life. Having our sins forgiven is a minor thing; being delivered from the sinful frustration so that we may grow in God’s life is the major thing. If you have committed a sin but repent and desire to go on with the Lord, God will surely forgive your sin because of Christ’s redemption. Do not worry about it. God’s intention is not simply to forgive your sins but to bring you onward that you may grow in His life. We all are human and easily fall into sin. But as long as we desire to grow in life, God will spontaneously take care of our sins and cleanse us with the blood of Jesus. However, if we are not willing to grow and yet ask God to forgive our sins, He will be faithful to do it, but we shall not be in the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Simply having our sins forgiven on the negative side does not fulfill God’s purpose. We also need to grow and enter into the Sabbath rest. </p>

THE LIFE AND WORK NEEDED<br/>FOR ENTERING INTO THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM</h2><p data-content-id="pnhep-1swI5hHB5N847IYQJHSDDODfkFej5Ckh2HbQV2ZFXVzDLdqnlvjBn5DFN_h"> I like the picture we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97164" data-verses="Matthew 24:1-2">Matthew 24 and 25</span>. As we pointed out in the last message, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97165" data-verses="Matthew 24:40-41">Matthew 24:40-41</span> we see the two living ones, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97166" data-verses="Matthew 25:1-4">Matthew 25:1-4</span> we see the ten dead ones. Of the two living ones, one is taken and the other is left. Of the ten dead ones, five are accepted and five are temporarily rejected. The saved ones can never be rejected by God eternally, but they may be rejected dispensationally, like a child who does not do well in school and who, after graduation, is not allowed to share in the special dinner planned by his parents as a prize for his brothers and sisters who did well. Such a child will never be rejected permanently by his parents, but he may be rejected temporarily. If we believe <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97167" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span>, then we must also believe <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97168" data-verses="Matthew 24:1-2">Matthew 24 and 25</span>. We should not select the verses that we like and ignore the verses that we do not like. Both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97169" data-verses="Matthew 24:1-2">Matthew 24 and 25</span> are crucial to our Christian life and work. <span class="pg" data-page-id="251" id="251">[251]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGF8cvdXgsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97170" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">Matthew 25</span> contains two parables concerning us—the parable of the ten virgins and the parable of the talents. The parable of the ten virgins depicts the life we should have, and the parable of the talents portrays the work we should have. Our life must be that of a wise virgin, and our work must be that of a faithful servant. In the parable of the ten virgins, we see that we need to have a watchful life, a life that continually bears testimony and goes out of the world to meet the Lord. This parable also reveals that we not only need to have our spirit enlightened by God’s Spirit, but our vessel, that is, our soul, must be transformed with an extra portion of the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="W1iZtRdq2EaOvu-m8SfI9j6yeC9_rOlrXR3fm3GUzcPU0O7qbBBiKxEFUeCJG_ERL"> Furthermore, the parable of the talents reveals that our work must be the work of a faithful servant, using the Lord-given talents to do business for the Lord and to earn profit for His economy. According to what is revealed in Matthew, both such a watchful life and a faithful work are crucially needed for us to be rewarded with the coming Sabbath rest in the millennial kingdom. This is different from the enjoyment of rest in salvation which is received simply by faith in the Lord. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2p-Clb9asquxf4mQ9n64n4VN6Nj_IFbKGR1gkxbP1RjXC1oK7CumV6zeFKsjKYYc6">A. Talents Given according to Ability</h2><p data-content-id="u4VI6PwMV9YLyodQonZhSglS3-evTx71vxZI3U8v6Kn8u6sybJckax5dbxTnzWMOb"> We have not only been regenerated that we may have the divine life to be God’s children, but we have also been talented to serve the Lord as His servants. In the parable of the talents, we see that the talents were given to the servants according to their ability. “Unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97171" data-verses="Matthew 25:15">Matt. 25:15</span>). We all have some ability, and the talents given to us are according to our ability. The Apostle Paul had great ability; many talents were given to him. Brother Watchman Nee also had much ability, and many talents were given to him. However, all our natural ability has to be dealt with by the death of Christ that it may be brought into resurrection to cooperate with the Lord-given talent. Our natural ability is always a frustration to our usefulness in the Lord’s hand. In the Lord’s work, <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> only the resurrected ability, not the natural, can match the talent which the Lord gives. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="fuOTOIbl26ICXoDfOfmOweU26iO5N_EbrL-zVhjSApM5ECRzMvL1jcqgw8vvh-fDb">B. A Warning about Being Slothful</h2><p data-content-id="IUDJqdl9X6vy3Vq-crvLee7hsZVwghlxQoAehr9Bor-YhLUZxsqlKZZQEkrirqIrE"> None of us should excuse ourselves by saying, “Praise the Lord, I don’t have much ability and not many talents have been given to me, so I don’t have much to do.” Whether we have been given five talents, two talents, or one talent, the principle is the same: we have to gain another five, two, or one for the Lord. If you have been given one talent, you should not use this as an excuse to be slothful. According to the parable, the danger is not with those of more talents but with those of one talent. The servant of one talent tried to excuse himself but received rebuke and punishment. Many fundamental Bible teachers, including C. I. Scofield, say that the one-talented servant was a false Christian. As we pointed out in the last message, these fundamental teachers, being Calvinists, were forced to say this because they could not reconcile such portions of the Word with the teaching that once we have been saved we are saved forever. Since they could not understand how a Christian could be cast into outer darkness, they had to say that the slothful, one-talented servant was a false believer. Calvinism does not see the matter of reward, which includes both prize and punishment. But the complete revelation of the Holy Word does not only show us the eternal salvation by faith but also unveils to us the dispensational reward (either prize or punishment) by works. The dispensational reward of a prize will be the coming Sabbath rest in the millennial kingdom. For us to enter into that Sabbath rest, we need, after being saved forever by faith, to live a watchful life as the wise virgins, and to do a faithful work as the faithful servants. Otherwise, we shall lose the coming Sabbath rest in the millennial kingdom and suffer some discipline. </p>

<p data-content-id="GZ-Xs1QsCoQof4c8ULP1D8DxGzcb8E7KkBAeRYnN9vmNPkf2OrDQ2hBVPHBKl6cA3"> The Bible, especially the New Testament, is a complete revelation. In the New Testament we see how the Savior came, was revealed to us, and accomplished redemption for us, and how we can believe in Him, receive salvation, and be regenerated. The New Testament also tells us that the saved ones form the church and that we can live the church life on earth today. In addition to all this, the New Testament gives us a warning. After we have been saved and regenerated, we must hold on to God’s grace, enjoying all that God has prepared for us in His grace. If we fail to do this, not holding on to God’s grace and enjoying His riches, we shall suffer loss and punishment. The New Testament gives us such a clear and definite warning. It also encourages us to gain the prize. In order to gain this prize, we must pay the price. Hence, either punishment or a prize are ahead of us. Whether we receive the prize or suffer the punishment does not depend whatsoever on our salvation; it all depends upon how we live and work after being saved. If we live and work in the proper way ordained by God, we shall receive a prize. But if we neglect God’s grace, we shall suffer loss, and a certain punishment will await us. As we pointed out in past messages, the Gospel of Matthew tells us that when the Lord Jesus comes back He will reward us according to our works (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97186" data-verses="Matthew 16:27">16:27</span>). The parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97187" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">Matthew 25</span> also make this matter very clear. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ce50k8tQiJj2hm-zVHrfF1AS-scsx9bxTn4PDYyUCKmXbgGgJ_N3tdzwHbUeZPInF">XXVII. THE FIVE WARNINGS IN HEBREWS</h2><p data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyD_manTLCZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH"> In the book of Hebrews there are five warnings, all of <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> which are the same in nature. In the seven epistles in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97188" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span> we also have some warnings. The seven warnings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97189" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span> are the same in nature as the five warnings in Hebrews. Therefore, we may say that altogether there are twelve warnings, five in the book of Hebrews and seven in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97190" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span>. Of course, with each of these warnings there is a certain amount of promise, for if we heed the warnings, we shall receive a prize. The first warning in Hebrews is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97191" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1-4">2:1-4</span>, telling us “to give heed more abundantly to the things which were heard, lest at any time we drift away” and not to “neglect so great a salvation.” The second warning, found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97192" data-verses="Hebrews 3:7">3:7 through 4:13</span>, tells us not to come short of the promised Sabbath rest but to “be diligent to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.” In a sense, these messages on the remaining Sabbath rest have all been concerned with the second warning. The third warning, regarding being brought on to maturity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97193" data-verses="Hebrews 5:11">5:11—6:20</span>), tells us not to be like the earth that brings forth “thorns and thistles” because “it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned.” In the fourth warning we are told to come forward to the Holy of Holies and not to shrink back to Judaism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97194" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19-39">10:19-39</span>). And in the fifth warning we are encouraged to run the race and not to fall away from grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97195" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1-29">12:1-29</span>). The Arminians use these five warnings as a basis for saying that a saved person can be lost again. But if we look into these portions of the Word in a proper way, we shall see that they do not speak of being lost again but of the matter of reward, either the positive reward of gaining a prize or the negative reward of receiving punishment. </p>

A WARNING ABOUT SINNING WILLFULLY</h2><p data-content-id="D0hW7peMyKatW3Yyp1pjR361rmZR3tlI4jM_n3qZwVMLHLzSUtNKlGG2jUwn-109y"> Let us now consider the fourth warning. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97196" data-verses="Hebrews 10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span> says, “For when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.” What does it mean to “sin willfully”? To understand this we must go back to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97197" data-verses="Hebrews 10:25">verse 25</span> as the word “for” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97198" data-verses="Hebrews 10:26">verse 26</span> indicates. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97199" data-verses="Hebrews 10:25">Verse 25</span> says, “Not forsaking <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.” To sin willfully in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97200" data-verses="Hebrews 10:26">verse 26</span> is to forsake the assembling together in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97201" data-verses="Hebrews 10:25">verse 25</span>. This warning had to be taken seriously by the Hebrew believers. When the book of Hebrews was written, many of the Hebrew Christians were on the edge between Judaism and the church, uncertain whether to forsake the church and return to Judaism, or to forsake Judaism and go on with the church. Where is the church? The church is in the assembling, the meetings of the believers in Christ. For the Hebrew believers not to attend the meetings with the believers in Christ meant that they had forsaken the church. If those staggering Hebrew Christians would forsake the meetings of the church, it meant that they were sinning willfully after they had received the knowledge of the truth. The writer seemed to be saying to them, “In this epistle I have presented to you the knowledge of the truth. You must attend all the meetings of the church. If you don’t, it means that you sin willfully. If you sin willfully by forsaking the church meetings and returning to Judaism to offer the sacrifice for sin, you must realize that there no longer remains a sacrifice for sin, for all the types of the offerings are now over.” This is the correct meaning of “there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.” It does not mean that if we sin we cannot be forgiven or have our sins remitted. It means that the types are over, having been replaced by Christ, and that the Hebrew believers must stay with the church and not forsake the meetings. But if they would forsake the church and return to Judaism to offer the sacrifice for sin, they would be sinning willfully and offering the sacrifice in vain, for no such sacrifice for sin remained any longer in God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="SX28q2m5JZZaou8YzwMxnnvhsHe9-jFM-0R967a0R103rK0Jy6qGdc5kFkKIhC-VV"> The writer warned the Hebrew believers that there no longer remained a sacrifice for sins, “but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fiery zeal about to consume the adversaries” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97202" data-verses="Hebrews 10:27">10:27</span>). If the Hebrew believers would forsake the church, they would suffer the punishment which is intended for the adversaries. <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="gGi1krUjO5_vgHIvZGO25q1ummwBZa_k8hB0IkA8RvqDpYwLHDRb1TMHp4sIipHHx"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97203" data-verses="Hebrews 10:28-29">Verses 28 and 29</span> continue, “And any one who has set at naught Moses’ law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses: by how much do you think he shall be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has regarded the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?” What does it mean to trample underfoot the Son of God? It means that if the Hebrew believers would return to Judaism to offer the sacrifice for sin, trusting in that sacrifice, they would in effect be trampling under foot the Son of God. They would be despising Him. The sacrifice for sin was a type of Christ. Since Christ had come to fulfill and replace the sacrifice for sin, the Hebrew believers had to stay with Him and not return to Judaism to offer the sacrifice for sin. If they were to do that, they would have been regarding the blood of the covenant a common thing, making it the same as the blood of sheep and oxen. The Hebrew Christians were warned not to return to Judaism to offer again the sacrifice for sin. For them to do this would have been to despise the Son of God in whom they believed and whose blood had sanctified them and to make His blood as common as that of the animal sacrifices. To do such a thing is also to insult the Spirit of grace. The Spirit of grace was working, moving, and anointing in them, and they had to listen to Him. Then the writer warned them by saying, “For we know Him Who said, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay. And again, the Lord will judge His people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97204" data-verses="Hebrews 10:30-31">vv. 30-31</span>). This is not the Lord’s judgment on the unsaved ones; it is His judgment on “His people,” His believers, the saved ones. </p>

<p data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCF6rKK1fQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv"> In this message we need to cover three matters: an evil heart of unbelief deserting the living God; the living word of God; and the parts of man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97217" data-verses="Hebrews 3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span> says, “Beware, brothers, lest there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God.” No heart is more evil than a heart of unbelief. Nothing offends God as much as our unbelief. David committed a dreadful sin, murdering a man and taking his wife. Governmentally speaking, however, this sin was not that serious, for it did not cause God to give up David. But the unbelief of the children of Israel in the wilderness caused God to give them up. Unbelief insults and offends God Himself. Every sin breaks God’s righteous law, but some sins do not insult God Himself, as does the sin of unbelief. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hZwxam6lXwmH0E7Nl83pbliEqZda-ocuqHw2FtYp_6HHqSCdwcI5BmEdEnDTEQuNB">I. THE LIVING GOD</h2><p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzeIoxppCFUylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> Our God is the living God. Unbelief is so evil because it insults the living, faithful, and almighty God. If we do not believe in God, in His work and in His ways, we insult Him. This is why we must beware of unbelief. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97218" data-verses="Hebrews 3:10">Verse 10</span> says, “Wherefore I was disgusted with this generation, and I said, They always go astray in heart; and they have not known My ways.” God’s ways are different from His acts. His acts <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> are His activities; His ways are the principles by which He acts. The children of Israel only knew His acts, but Moses knew His ways (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97219" data-verses="Psalms 103:7">Psa. 103:7</span>). In the wilderness the children of Israel saw a miracle nearly every morning—the manna. If such a miracle would occur today, it would be publicized in newspapers throughout the world. Although the children of Israel witnessed such a miracle, they, unlike Moses, saw only the acts of God; they did not know God’s faithful, divine ways. We should not be like the children of Israel; we must learn the ways, the principles, of our God. When the children of Israel lacked food and water, they complained and murmured. When God acted on their behalf, they were happy temporarily, but not long afterward they offended God again. If we look at ourselves, we would not criticize them, because we would see that we are the same. We may shout, “Praise the Lord!” one night in a meeting and murmur against the Lord the next morning. How we need to know the ways of God! Our God is living and has His principles in doing things. He will never deny Himself. He is able, almighty, and faithful, always keeping His promises and fulfilling His word. </p>

THE EVIL HEART</h2><p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-lZaYKW2zlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> Although God is living and faithful, the evil heart is hardened against Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97220" data-verses="Hebrews 3:8">3:8</span>). In a sense, an evil heart is very reasonable; it reasons a great deal. However, in another sense, it is stubborn and without reason because it is hardened. Hence, it departs from the right track and goes astray, not knowing God’s ways or principles. It tries God by putting Him to the test (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97221" data-verses="Hebrews 3:9">3:9</span>). Eventually, such a heart is self-deceiving and will be deceived (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97222" data-verses="Hebrews 3:13">3:13</span>). This is the condition of an evil heart. Such an evil heart always issues from the hardening. How dangerous it is for our heart to be hardened! We need to pray again and again for the Lord to soften our heart, saying, “Lord, have mercy on me. Soften my heart and never allow it to be hardened.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XAU_tcFqOKo9rmOP3ZbnU1uSTJHirXynnH0CT7HqmYcBXJkMfDQnpAZCXXL7WbCkY">III. UNBELIEF</h2><p data-content-id="klFSgkmZ7z6TtXkmgUNGh_L11hto0ptrC0ipW-rLe2wiLoKboQqxl2qT2E6BWveTU"> An evil heart produces unbelief. Unbelief reasons according <span class="pg" data-page-id="267" id="267">[267]</span> to the natural concept, not according to God’s principle. Consider the reasoning of the children of Israel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97223" data-verses="Numbers 13:31-33">Numbers 13:31-33</span>. Their reasonings included some lies, for they said that “the land through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof.” That was a lie. Joshua and Caleb said, “Rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us: fear them not” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97224" data-verses="Numbers 14:9">Num. 14:9</span>). Joshua and Caleb spoke the truth. However, the children of Israel did not reason according to the truth but according to the lie, not counting on the ways of God. In the beginning, God had promised Moses that He would bring the Israelites into the good land. That one word should have been sufficient for them. Suppose a millionaire would give you a check for $10,000 with his signature on it. If you did not believe it, it would be an insult to that millionaire. You should not say, “I don’t believe I have $10,000. I don’t even have enough money to buy a pair of shoes.” This kind of reasoning is an insult to the millionaire. God had spoken to Moses, saying, “Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites...unto a land flowing with milk and honey” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97225" data-verses="Exodus 3:16-17">Exo. 3:16-17</span>). This one word was more reliable than a check signed by a millionaire. The children of Israel should have believed this word and known God’s ways, saying, “God, You should not let us die here in the wilderness. If You do this, how can Your word stand? We don’t care how many giants are in the good land, or even if the good land is filled with evil angels. We will eat them up because You have promised to bring us into the land.” This is proper reasoning, the reasoning that is according to God’s ways, principles, faithfulness, and power. But the Israelites did not reason in this way. Instead, the Israelites said, “There are giants in the land, and we are like grasshoppers in their sight. They <span class="pg" data-page-id="268" id="268">[268]</span> will eat us up.” This is the logic of unbelief, the logic of reasoning according to the natural concept and not counting on the ways of God or trusting in the faithfulness of God. Joshua and Caleb stood against that kind of reasoning, declaring that the people were well able to take the land. Joshua and Caleb honored God, and God, in turn, honored them for honoring Him. Nothing honors God more than our belief, and nothing dishonors and insults Him more than our unbelief. </p>
<p data-content-id="J1JYlwCOelExNYExkRji4znkcMJ67hWsK8o7BCO9o5g1KcqitJI9Vxej8NhnohsR2"> Unbelief issues in disobedience, obstinacy, and rebellion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97226" data-verses="Hebrews 3:18">3:18</span>) and provokes God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97227" data-verses="Hebrews 3:8">3:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97228" data-verses="Hebrews 3:16">16</span>). Because of their unbelief, the Israelites withdrew from the living God. The Greek word translated “withdrawing” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97229" data-verses="Hebrews 3:12">3:12</span> may also be rendered as turning away, deserting, departing, standing aloof. Although God is living and faithful, unbelief causes us to turn away from Him. Once we turn away, what then can He do for us? Because of their unbelief, the Israelites missed the rest and fell in the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97230" data-verses="Hebrews 3:18-19">3:18-19</span>). The Lord swore that they would not enter into His rest, and their “carcasses fell in the wilderness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97231" data-verses="Hebrews 3:17">3:17</span>). How serious is an evil heart of unbelief! God was forced into not doing anything for the Israelites because He could not do anything against Himself or against His principles. Never offend God to the extent that He is unable to do anything for you. That is terrible. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXs8fBV4q_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB">THE THREE STAGES OF SALVATION</h1><p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdmkGf6R5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> According to the whole revelation of the Bible, God’s salvation is of three stages. It is a matter of a gradual process. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nGm-eJrwx-DRz6RAx60bOiwUkw-iP-3qER1EiyiqV-1eQ6SXHd83e5a9vAuFAVRIG">I. WITH THE ISRAELITES</h2><p data-content-id="6ZZlu4J5HfdMhfEfUJ3LmMD5pB2BO4c3a__L7gn1p3skFN8-BJcPmokYabiuqvwyt"> The salvation which God intended for the children of Israel to partake of was related to three places: Egypt, from which they were delivered; the wilderness, in which they wandered; and Canaan, into which they entered. Their history in these three places signifies the three stages of their participation in God’s full salvation. The children of Israel did not partake of the whole of God’s salvation in one place. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="R5BCjovp4r6zbRLEWObezuh1UOX_7Qf8QksznRcMh7dobccpo28CQJWJRDpQH5rrM">A. Salvation from Egypt</h2><p data-content-id="smQkdlepcUj2tnXbV2UxzJ8QKE7gpeQPNsDo0T9aLCfvZuZlwoPT8L125acok8hfa"> In Egypt, the Israelites participated in the first stage of God’s salvation. At the time of the Passover, they experienced the redeeming blood of the lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97309" data-verses="Exodus 12:7">Exo. 12:7</span>) and the nourishing meat of the lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97310" data-verses="Exodus 12:8">Exo. 12:8</span>) and were saved from God’s righteous judgment. When they made their exodus out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, they were saved from Egyptian slavery and tyranny. After crossing the Red Sea, they were a released and liberated people. In this sense, they all were saved. No one can deny that they had been saved from God’s judgment and from Egyptian bondage, tyranny, and slavery. However, they had only shared in one-third of God’s full salvation. Although they had been saved from God’s judgment and from Pharaoh’s slavery, what about God’s eternal purpose? What about God’s expression and dominion? With the children of Israel at that time, there was not yet the divine expression nor the divine dominion. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="282" id="282">[282]</span> tabernacle had not yet been erected, and God’s divine government had not been established on earth. Although the children of Israel had been saved from Egypt, they had to experience two further stages of God’s salvation for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPeNBpFqcwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm">B. Salvation through the Wilderness</h2><p data-content-id="MIJlxkLQwGUFWpXbCXJwEuVpzcFJswqiU3Ejc76p9XUT9kubZPaV9POS3G28RP-sM"> After the Israelites were saved from Egypt where they ate the Passover lamb and the unleavened bread, they experienced salvation through the wilderness. Although they had had a sweet enjoyment of Christ, typified by the lamb in Egypt, that was merely the initial stage, the beginning. They had to enjoy, partake of, and experience Christ more, as typified by the manna and the rock flowing with living water. After the exodus from Egypt, God brought them into the second stage, which was signified by the wilderness. In the wilderness they enjoyed the feeding manna (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97311" data-verses="Exodus 16:31-32">Exo. 16:31-32</span>) and the quenching water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97312" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">Exo. 17:6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-lZqYCEGzlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> Because of the influence of past teaching, whenever we hear the word wilderness we think of it as a bad word. Although it is not a good word, it is not altogether bad. If you consult a map, you will see that the children of Israel could not have gone from Egypt into the good land without passing through the wilderness. The wilderness was bad because the children of Israel did not go directly through it into Canaan but wandered in it for over thirty-eight years. It was that waste of time which made the wilderness so bad. If, however, they had crossed the Red Sea and gone directly through the wilderness into the good land, the wilderness would have been a good word. That the wilderness was not altogether bad is proved by the fact that there the Israelites enjoyed the manna and the water from the rock, both of which were types of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="iP_bgkHD-VyM-lbYNnOmltINq3-wBR5Dynf2bHQ8WpjrkRIRPrECHRAQWFcx0WQUb">C. Salvation into Canaan</h2><p data-content-id="19J7BMpUdAP-KQCUvDLCgUT_QkvZvr1TF44VGLYr0Wq30Cf62POCZtTmD67IMB8WQ"> After wandering in the wilderness, the children of Israel crossed the Jordan River and entered into the good land of Canaan, the third stage of their salvation. Here, in the third <span class="pg" data-page-id="283" id="283">[283]</span> stage, in the good land, they enjoyed something more than the lamb, the unleavened bread, the manna, and the water—they enjoyed the rich produce of the land of Canaan. Although they had eaten manna daily in the wilderness for nearly forty years, immediately after they entered into the good land, the manna ceased and they began to enjoy the rich produce of the all-inclusive land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97313" data-verses="Joshua 5:11-12">Josh. 5:11-12</span>). The Passover lamb, the heavenly manna, the living water, and the produce of the good land of Canaan are all types of the different aspects of the riches of Christ. If the children of Israel had only been saved in Egypt, they would have never tasted the manna. If they had not entered into the land of Canaan, they would never have enjoyed the rich produce of the good land. Hallelujah for the rich enjoyment of Christ in the various stages of salvation! </p>
<p data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41bx0Z9nIMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg"> In the third stage of their salvation, salvation into Canaan, the Israelites entered into the rest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97314" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:9">Deut. 12:9</span>). All the rich enjoyment of Christ in the three stages of salvation is for the securing of the good land and the building up of the temple that there might be the expression of God and the divine government of God among men on earth. The full salvation of God with the rich enjoyment of Christ is for God’s expression and kingdom. Salvation from Egypt, through the wilderness, and into the good land is absolutely for God’s expression and kingdom. As we have seen, where there is God’s expression and kingdom, there is the Sabbath rest. When God’s glory filled His house, the temple, all His people rested in His presence. That was a Sabbath to God and to His saved people. Therefore, we clearly see that the three stages of God’s salvation are for His expression and kingdom so that God may have rest with His saved people. </p>
<p data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXs8fBXra_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB"> As we have pointed out, God’s full salvation, which He intended for the children of Israel, included redemption through the Passover lamb, exodus from Egypt, feeding by the heavenly manna, thirst-quenching by the living water from the cleft rock, and partaking of the riches of the good land of Canaan. All the Israelites shared in the Passover lamb, the heavenly manna, and the living water, but of those <span class="pg" data-page-id="284" id="284">[284]</span> who shared the exodus from Egypt only Joshua and Caleb entered into the good land and partook of it; all the rest fell in the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97315" data-verses="Numbers 14:30">Num. 14:30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97316" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1-11">1 Cor. 10:1-11</span>). Though all were redeemed, only the two overcomers, Joshua and Caleb, received the prize of the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdmkGf_C5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> The Passover lamb, the heavenly manna, the living water, and the good land of Canaan are all types of the different aspects of Christ. According to what has been depicted of the children of Israel, not all believers who have been redeemed through Christ will partake of Christ as a prize to them as their rest, their satisfaction, both in the church age and in the coming kingdom. Only those who, after being redeemed, seek Christ diligently will do so. This is why the Apostle Paul, though fully redeemed, was still pressing toward the mark that he might gain Christ as the prize (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97317" data-verses="Philippians 3:10-14">Phil. 3:10-14</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97318" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span>, Paul tells us that he was in Judaism but that for Christ’s sake he gave it up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97319" data-verses="Philippians 3:4-9">vv. 4-9</span>). Here in the book of Hebrews the writer holds the same concept in encouraging the Hebrew believers to forsake Judaism and press toward Christ that they may not miss the prize. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nGm-eJrwx-DRz6RAx60bOiwUgjuiP-3qER1EiyiqV-1eQ6SXHd83e5a9vAuFAVRIG">II. WITH THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6ZZlu4J5HfdMhfEfUJ3LmMD5uRWBO4c3a__L7gn1p3skFN8-BJcPmokYabiuqvwyt">A. Salvation from the World</h2>
<p data-content-id="R5BCjovp4r6zbRLEWObezuh1Sen_7Qf8QksznRcMh7dobccpo28CQJWJRDpQH5rrM"> According to the type of the salvation of the children of Israel, the salvation of the new testament believers is also in three stages. Firstly, we experience salvation from the world. We are justified through the blood of Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97320" data-verses="Romans 3:22-25">Rom. 3:22-25</span>) and separated from the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97321" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">Gal. 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97322" data-verses="Galatians 6:14">6:14</span>). If anyone has not made his exodus from the world, he has not completed the first stage of his salvation. The salvation offered in Christianity is mainly a salvation with justification by faith through the blood of Christ, but without an exodus. Today there are millions of real Christians who have been justified by faith through the blood of Christ but who are still in the world. They need an exodus. We praise the Lord that we are out of the world, which includes religion. We are out of Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. <span class="pg" data-page-id="285" id="285">[285]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7PiQIIiZ8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> The book of Hebrews is a book of comparisons. In the foregoing messages we have seen three comparisons: the comparisons between our God and the God of the Jewish people, between Christ and the angels, and between Christ and Moses. Now we come to another subsection in this book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97346" data-verses="Hebrews 4:14">4:14-7:28</span>) where we find still another comparison—the comparison between Christ and Aaron. Our God is more excellent than the God whom the Jews worship, and our Christ is much superior to the angels, Moses, and Aaron. As we have seen, in each section of Hebrews there is a warning. The first warning is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97347" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1-4">2:1-4</span> and the second is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97348" data-verses="Hebrews 3:7">3:7 through 4:13</span>. In this subsection we have the third warning, found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97349" data-verses="Hebrews 5:11">5:11 through 6:20</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="PvInMZn3Vp176ChSyFxrwvenMpeI0R_umEl2pfk_yxb2iqBRHJddNGyBQOilH2EXM"> In the previous chapters we have seen that Christ is the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Captain of our salvation, and the Apostle. All this qualifies Him to be our High Priest. In the Bible, no one is more wonderful or excellent than Christ as our High Priest. He comes from God and ministers God to us. Before His coming, we had nothing of God. God was God and we were simply men, having nothing to do with Him. He came not only as our Savior and Redeemer but also as our High Priest. The titles of Savior and Redeemer are understood by most people in a superficial way. If we only know Christ as our Savior and Redeemer, we may know Him just in a superficial way. We must go on to know Him as the Captain of our salvation, the Apostle, and the High Priest. Although many Christians realize that Christ is our High <span class="pg" data-page-id="292" id="292">[292]</span> Priest, not many know what this truly means. If we would know what it means for Christ to be our High Priest, we must thoroughly cover the whole book of Hebrews. </p>
<p data-content-id="-7psJDqorOUFFwhmtN2MZjc-IRc6BT4LW0n2K-L9dRY0OI1PJD-NzRXLSV8ZtC8nS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97350" data-verses="Hebrews 4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span> says, “Having therefore a great High Priest Who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.” The Lord Jesus firstly was sent from God to us through incarnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97351" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">2:14</span>) to be our Apostle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97352" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">3:1</span>), our Captain, our Leader (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97353" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10">2:10</span>), the One superior to Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97354" data-verses="Hebrews 3:3">3:3</span>), and our real Joshua (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97355" data-verses="Hebrews 4:8">4:8</span>) to bring us, His partners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97356" data-verses="Hebrews 1:9">1:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97357" data-verses="Hebrews 3:14">3:14</span>), into glory and rest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97358" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10">2:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97359" data-verses="Hebrews 4:11">4:11</span>). He then went back from us to God through resurrection and ascension (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97360" data-verses="Hebrews 5:5-6">5:5-6</span>) to be our High Priest to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97361" data-verses="Hebrews 2:17-18">2:17-18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97362" data-verses="Hebrews 4:15">4:15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="pnhep-1swI5hHB5N847IYRJHbRjODfkFej5Ckh2HbQV2ZFXVzDLdqnlvjBn5DFN_h"> The very Christ whom we need and have today in the Sabbath rest of the church life is our High Priest. A high priest, properly speaking, is not on the street nor in the wilderness but in the Holy of Holies. Where is our Christ today? He is continually in the Holy of Holies. Our High Priest is not at the altar offering the sacrifices, nor in the Holy Place preparing the showbread, lighting the lamps, and burning the incense. He is in the Holy of Holies. Most Christians only have a Christ who is at the altar, that is, a Christ on the cross. Many hymns speak of the crucified Christ. Some Christians have a Christ only in the Holy Place. The highest attainment in their spiritual seeking is that of a Christ preparing the showbread, lighting the lamp, and burning the incense in the Holy Place. They have missed the High Priest in the Holy of Holies. The main function of our High Priest today is neither at the altar nor in the Holy Place but in the Holy of Holies, where God’s presence and shekinah glory are. Yes, He was once on the cross, but, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97363" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">1:3</span> reveals, His work on the cross has been finished. Never ask Him to go back to do it again. Now, having finished His work, He is sitting at the right hand of God in the heavens. No place is closer to God than this. The book of Hebrews was written to help us come forward to this Christ who is now in the presence of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGF9cvVFQsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_"> The Christ who is in the Holy of Holies is not merely our <span class="pg" data-page-id="293" id="293">[293]</span> Savior, Redeemer, Apostle, or Captain of salvation; He is our High Priest. What is He doing there in the Holy of Holies? He is ministering God into us. As we have seen in a previous message, the major function of the High Priest is to minister God into God’s chosen people. Oh, how we need our High Priest in the Holy of Holies to minister God into us! We should forget our environment, weaknesses, troubles, and even ourselves and only remember that today Jesus Christ is our High Priest in the Holy of Holies. As long as we have such a High Priest, we have everything we need. </p>
<p data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LBDMRH_pwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR"> According to the Old Testament, whenever the high priest went into the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, he bore upon his shoulders two onyx stones on which were engraved the names of the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97364" data-verses="Exodus 28:9-12">Exo. 28:9-12</span>). He also wore the breastplate in which were set twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97365" data-verses="Exodus 28:15-30">Exo. 28:15-30</span>). This signified that the people of Israel were on the shoulder and breast of the high priest. Since the shoulder signifies strength and the breast signifies love, the people of God were on the strength and in the love of the high priest. When the high priest was in the Holy of Holies, he brought all the people of God along with him. In the eyes of God, when he was there, all the people of God were there with him. Likewise, when God looks at Christ, our High Priest in the Holy of Holies, He sees us upon His shoulder and breast. How we need to see this vision! Our High Priest in the Holy of Holies in the heavens bears us and wears us before God. Right now we are upon His shoulder and upon His breast in the Holy of Holies. We are there with Him in the shekinah glory of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="0LzTaf-UCCdfAz45OTRuYexTMnpWe9bD9g-xeDycbaQml7QnmCMyvs8NwZmgFWFwe"> As Christ bears us before God in the Holy of Holies, He ministers God into our being. When the Apostle Paul prayed to the Lord, asking Him to remove the thorn (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97366" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7-8">2 Cor. 12:7-8</span>), the Lord said, “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97367" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">2 Cor. 12:9</span>). The Lord seemed to be saying, “Paul, I will not remove that thorn, but I will impart Myself into you as grace. When I do this, you will know how precious and sufficient I am, and more of Me will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="294" id="294">[294]</span> added into you.” This experience of Christ as our High Priest who bears us on His shoulder and breast and ministers God into us is an experience in the Holy of Holies, where we enjoy God Himself and all His riches. When we get into this experience, it is difficult to say where we are or what is happening. We can only say that we are upon the shoulders and breast of our High Priest and that He is ministering something comforting and strengthening into us. Perhaps all we can say is, “I have received something from the Lord, but I simply cannot describe it or give it a name.” This experience of Christ as our High Priest is the highest experience and enjoyment. We all must learn to stay here on His shoulders and on His breast in the Holy of Holies. This is an experience in the third stage of our salvation which corresponds to the experiences in the Holy of Holies. We should not be content to remain outer court Christians; neither should we be Christians staggering in the Holy Place. We must press on into the Holy of Holies where God’s presence and shekinah glory are. </p>

<p data-content-id="klFSgkmZ7z6TtXkmgUNGh8b1zzdo0ptrC0ipW-rLe2wiLoKboQqxl2qT2E6BWveTU"> Aaron did not take honor unto himself but was called and established by God to be the high priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97422" data-verses="Hebrews 5:4">5:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97423" data-verses="Hebrews 5:1">1</span>). This is even more true with Christ. He did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest; He was ordained by God in His resurrection, according to the order of Melchisedec (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97424" data-verses="Hebrews 5:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). Aaron, as the high priest, took care of things pertaining to God on behalf of the people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97425" data-verses="Hebrews 5:1">v. 1</span>). Christ is superior to him in taking care of all our cases before God. Aaron offered both gifts and sacrifices for sins in type for the people and for himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97426" data-verses="Hebrews 5:1">vv. 1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97427" data-verses="Hebrews 5:3">3</span>). But Christ offered Himself as the sacrifice for sin in reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="J1JYlwCOelExNYExkRji4w3kVeJ67hWsK8o7BCO9o5g1KcqitJI9Vxej8NhnohsR2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97428" data-verses="Hebrews 5:2">5:2</span> we are told that a high priest was “able to exercise forbearance toward the ignorant and straying, since he also is encompassed with weakness.” The Greek implies a feeling toward the ignorant and straying which is neither too severe nor too tolerant. It is to be moderate or tender in judgment toward their situation. The thought in this verse <span class="pg" data-page-id="304" id="304">[304]</span> is a continuation of the thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97429" data-verses="Hebrews 4:15">4:15</span>. Christ as our High Priest, though not encompassed with weakness as the high priests taken from among men, has been tried in all respects like us. Hence, sympathizing with our weaknesses, He is able to exercise forbearance toward us, the ignorant and straying ones. </p>

With the high priest taken from among men, there is only honor, a matter of position. With Christ as the High Priest, there is not only honor, but also glory; not only the preciousness of His position, but also the splendor of His Person. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97431" data-verses="Hebrews 5:5">Verse 5</span> contains a quotation from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97432" data-verses="Psalms 2:7">Psalm 2:7</span>, saying, “You are My Son, this day I have begotten You.” This refers to Christ’s resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97433" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>), which qualifies Him to be our High Priest. For Christ to be our High Priest, He must partake of our humanity, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97434" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14-18">2:14-18</span>, and enter with this humanity into resurrection. With His humanity, He can sympathize with us and be merciful to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97435" data-verses="Hebrews 4:15">4:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97436" data-verses="Hebrews 2:17">2:17</span>).

They mean that Christ was resurrected out of death. Before He died, Christ prayed for this, and God answered His prayer by raising Him from among the dead. </p>

Christ was not only resurrected from among the dead, but He ascended to the height of the universe. In the previous message, we pointed out that Christ overcame the gravitation of earth, overcoming the frustrating attack of the demons on the earth. When He entered into the air, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97444" data-verses="Colossians 2:15">Colossians 2:15</span> reveals, He stripped off the principalities and powers and made a show of them. The Greek word translated “stripped off” means to dust off as with a feather duster. When Christ was ascending through the air, the principalities and powers came, like insects, to prevent Him from ascending. The Lord Jesus did not struggle against them; He simply dusted them off and made a show of them. After that, He ascended into the heavens where He is now sitting at the right hand of God. Whenever we touch Him, we touch the One who is above all, and we also are above everything. The attraction of the earth, the demons, the principalities and powers, and all negative things have been overcome by Him. How we need to experience the Christ unveiled in the book of Hebrews! </p>

The order of Aaron was for the priesthood only in humanity, whereas the order of Melchisedec is for the priesthood in both humanity and divinity.

A PRIEST LIKE MELCHISEDEC</h2><p data-content-id="PvInMZn3Vp176ChSyFxrwsunI7-I0R_umEl2pfk_yxb2iqBRHJddNGyBQOilH2EXM"> According to the Bible, there are only two orders of the priesthood—the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec. The order of Melchisedec came before that of Aaron. The priesthood of Melchisedec did not come in with Abraham’s descendants but with Abraham himself. We have seen that Adam was the head of the created race and that Abraham was the head of the called race. Since the created race under the headship of Adam had become a failure, Adam having failed God in His eternal purpose, God eventually gave up the created race. At the time of Babel, the created race had become altogether a land of Chaldea. Since the time of Nimrod, Chaldea was filled with idols. Idolatry is utterly opposed to God Himself. Because mankind under the headship of Adam had become a land of idols, even the Almighty God found it impossible to do anything with them. Although He gave up the created race, He could never forsake His eternal purpose which needed man for its fulfillment. Therefore, according to His economy, God called Abraham out of the fallen created race, making him the head of the called race. </p>
<p data-content-id="-7psJDqorOUFFwhmtN2MZgs-NDs6BT4LW0n2K-L9dRY0OI1PJD-NzRXLSV8ZtC8nS"> We, the chosen ones of God, also belong to the called race. We all were once part of the created race belonging to Chaldea” under the headship of Adam. We all have come out of an idolatrous land. Where were you before you were saved? You were in a land of idols. In the eyes of God, everything, whether it was moral or immoral, ethical or unethical, good or bad, high or low, was an idol. Praise the Lord that He called us out of our “Chaldea”! <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97448" data-verses="Romans 8:29-30">Romans 8:29 and 30</span> say that God foreknew, predestinated, and called us. This calling of God is not an insignificant matter; it is a high, heavenly matter, and we must behave ourselves worthy of it. God’s calling is higher, richer, and more important than His creation. Hallelujah, we are members of the called race! Our father Abraham is the head of this race. The priesthood which came to the father of the called race was not that which was according to the order of Aaron but that which is according to the order of Melchisedec. Melchisedec met <span class="pg" data-page-id="307" id="307">[307]</span> Abraham with bread and wine, and Abraham gave him tithes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97449" data-verses="Genesis 14:18-20">Gen. 14:18-20</span>). Melchisedec did not come to Abraham to receive tithes from him, but to minister to him the bread and wine. </p>

Why must the word be the word of righteousness? The writer mentioned the word of righteousness at a time when he was speaking of Christ as the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec. Concerning Melchisedec he had “much to say” which was “hard to interpret” since the receivers of this epistle had “become dull of hearing” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97482" data-verses="Hebrews 5:11">5:11</span>). They had been learners for quite a long time. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97483" data-verses="Hebrews 5:12-13">verses 12 and 13</span> the writer said of them, “For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food.” Although they should have been teachers, at the time of the writing of this epistle, they still needed someone to teach them. They were still babes. Since “everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97484" data-verses="Hebrews 5:13">Heb. 5:13</span>), we see that the word of righteousness is for the mature, not for babes. Now in this message we need to see what the word of righteousness basically is. </p>

<p data-content-id="_e_6LkqX4ESYXvpCAEx24pLDv_bfnFOOjmtosmeLh6BrByUxfmVVcsvBL-SDunVSX"> If we would understand this matter of the word of righteousness, we must firstly be deeply impressed that the word <span class="pg" data-page-id="316" id="316">[316]</span> of God is not mainly for knowledge. In this short portion of the Word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97485" data-verses="Hebrews 5:11-14">5:11-14</span>), there seems to be a contradiction. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97486" data-verses="Hebrews 5:12">Verse 12</span> uses the words “teachers” and “teach.” This surely refers to knowledge. However, in these verses it is clearly and definitely indicated that the word of God is for nourishment, for it likens His word to either milk or solid food. Milk and solid food are not for knowledge. People do not study them; they drink and eat of them as nourishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0OnYZFOtUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW"> For years we have been saying that our need is not mere teachings; it is food. Many have argued with me, saying, “How can you say that we don’t need teaching? Don’t you believe that the Bible is a book of teaching? Even you yourself teach people.” Yes, the Bible is a book of teaching, but it does not teach us merely for mental knowledge; its teaching ministers food to us. The aim of the Bible is not for our mental comprehension and knowledge; it is absolutely for our spiritual realization and nourishment. According to the word of the Lord Jesus, the words of God are for us to eat. In order to live, we must take the word of God as our food. When the Lord was tempted by the Devil, He answered him, saying, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97487" data-verses="Matthew 4:4">Matt. 4:4</span>). The word of God should be our food, and we must eat it daily and live by it. Even in the Old Testament times, Jeremiah said, “Thy words were found, and I did eat them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97488" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:16">Jer. 15:16</span>). The prophet realized that the word of God is for nourishment, not for knowledge. Furthermore, the New Testament not only tells us that we must feed ourselves with the word of God but that we must feed others with it. Paul’s concept concerning his ministry of the word was that of feeding. He fed the Corinthians with milk and desired to feed them with the solid food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97489" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:2">1 Cor. 3:2</span>). Therefore, according to the basic principles of the Bible, the word of God is for nourishment rather than for knowledge. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dnug6ioi8WCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0">II. MILK</h2><p data-content-id="Qpdn89MhLxfVrIv8GWTBeXCsULQ55oZqOEuk2qvXDTa4ELyWoRmN1r_WYV01cf7Lc"> The Bible itself classifies God’s word into two categories—milk for babes and solid food for the mature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97490" data-verses="Hebrews 5:12-13">5:12-13</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="317" id="317">[317]</span> Paul told the Corinthians that because they were babes he could only feed them with milk (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97491" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1-2">1 Cor. 3:1-2</span>), and Peter, holding the same concept, said, “As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97492" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">1 Pet. 2:2</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97493" data-verses="Hebrews 5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>, milk refers to “the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God.” The Greek word translated “rudiments,” which also may be rendered as “primary elements,” denotes elementary things. For example, learning the twenty-six letters of the alphabet and the numbers from one to ten are the rudiments. If you were to talk with children in a philosophical way, they would be unable to understand. Recently, one of my grandchildren was pleased to show me how he could write the letters L E E. He was very happy with his elementary “candies.” </p>
<p data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw7Rm7rfTq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF"> In Christianity there are many old babes who can barely write the letters of the spiritual alphabet. If you were to talk with them about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97494" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">Matthew 25</span>, they would say, “Oh, that is too difficult. As long as I have been redeemed and will go to heaven when I die, that is enough for me.” They are content with “candy bars.” They can only take the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, not solid food. </p>
<p data-content-id="lkvZM26z559Bj3lTSOUy4fJup6kXSx0PljTjoOkXjCBX2Rdfb66sdAUBGOBf9pyrf"> The “rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97495" data-verses="Hebrews 5:12">5:12</span> are “the word of the beginning of the Christ” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97496" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">6:1</span>. These are special terms found in the book of Hebrews. Even Christ, like your education, has a beginning. Some little children only know the ten numbers, being unable to do even the simplest addition. Likewise, in our spiritual education we have the word of the beginning of Christ. Many Christians can only say, “Christ died for me. I am a sinner and I should go to hell, but God loves me and sent Jesus to die on the cross for my sins. Now I believe in Him and I am saved.” This is the word of the beginning of Christ. How poor is the situation among most Christians today! They are even unable to discern the difference between the human spirit and the Holy Spirit. Whenever they see the word “spirit,” they take it to mean the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, regarding the Holy Spirit, they are unfamiliar with the term “life-giving Spirit.” Many of them do not even want to hear <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> about it. It seems that when they read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97497" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>, which tells us that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, they cover their eyes and pass it by. Have you not also passed by many verses in your reading of the Scriptures? I am quite sure that many of you have skipped over the first seventeen verses of the Gospel of Matthew. Perhaps you never paid attention to these verses before coming into the church life. Others might even have advised you to begin your reading of the New Testament with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97498" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matthew 1:18</span>. Then you might have proceeded to read a little of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97499" data-verses="Matthew 2:1">chapter two</span> regarding the visit of the wise men and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97500" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> concerning the baptism of Jesus. Perhaps you skipped chapters like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97501" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">thirteen</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97502" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">twenty-four</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97503" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span>, finding them too difficult to comprehend, and gave some attention to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97504" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span>. Maybe you shed a few tears for the crucified Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97505" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> and then were happy to hear that He was resurrected in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97506" data-verses="Matthew 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span>. As you came to the end of Matthew, you thought of the Lord Jesus as ascending to the heavens, although Matthew does not speak of His ascension; yet, according to your traditional mentality, you added an extra point about Christ ascending to the heavens. This is the way many Christians understand the Bible today. </p>
<p data-content-id="ONTNfoex8_cVo12DfRG5_mHGKHPSxsp3NoQW_8wi-97vKUKUb_GzJXFfUITjZc8rP"> There is only one Bible. However, nearly every Christian has his or her own version of the Bible. It is not the Bible printed with black and white letters as God revealed; it is the “Bible” printed with their kind of mentality. They have their own mental version of the Scriptures. Very few Christians care for the solid word of God. They only take the rudiments, the word of the beginning of Christ. Perhaps some would argue with me, saying that the word of the beginning is not wrong. Of course it is not wrong, but it is simply the A B C’s. We need to go on! </p>

<p data-content-id="ONTNfoex8_cVo12DfRG5-kXGOVfSxsp3NoQW_8wi-97vKUKUb_GzJXFfUITjZc8rP"> The book of Hebrews is a book on maturity. In order to be brought on to maturity we need to cross the river. Whenever we have a handicap or are unable to go on, that is the time for us to cross the river. Just as the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea and the Jordan River, we must cross river after river. </p>
<p data-content-id="4reRc8xEUdB8gspB5LzSTFY2UfBcoBqXNha6kcLoR0GcevFpPwoI5sDlLglcpJmid"> What does it mean to be mature? Throughout the years, we have learned that if we are in ourselves or are individualistic, we are immature. If we are trying to be holy, spiritual, or victorious, that also is immaturity. Real maturity is not only in our spirit, but also in the church life. The church life is the sign of our having become mature. As a result of my watching and observing for almost fifty years, I can testify that there is no real maturity in life outside the church. Real maturity can only be found in the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="o8J_Xe_Oo1DTEOu7_yttymPkg99r4zswpHSO-jDOTVFBVk47Q4_e4i6jscHWlhJOs"> The Hebrew believers to whom this book was written were staggering in their Christian life. They were wondering in their mind whether to go on or to go back. At that very point, this book was written to encourage them to go on. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kUaZWif4GddJ6x0-mt9QcJ_y0BfG_163rGTsaQ8Mae1t0n_om2qIm8zuQfDDDM9E"> The best way to go on is to forget everything. Once we forget everything, we shall go on. We may spend much time to consider our environment, our past, our future, and all the things related to it, yet we would not spend one hour in going on. Many times dear saints have come to me asking about the past, present, future, and many other things. I became famous for never answering their questions. I only gave them <span class="pg" data-page-id="328" id="328">[328]</span> one word of advice: “Go on. Don’t talk and don’t remember your past. You should even forget the present and not care for the future. If you really want to go on, then just go on.” Those who are going on the best are those who do not remember anything. Consider the runners in a race. While they are running, they have no time to think of anything else. They only know one thing—running the race. </p>
<p data-content-id="GZ-Xs1QsCoQof4c8ULP1C9DxKzcb8E7KkBAeRYnN9vmNPkf2OrDQ2hBVPHBKl6cA3"> Here we see a basic principle: if anyone of us has fallen from the right track, or has stopped running in the race and then is stirred up to go on, he should not hesitate or ask questions. He should just go on. When many of the young people are stirred up to go on with the Lord, some of them are concerned with what they should do before they can go on, wondering whether the Lord will forgive them or be happy with them. If you are like this, it will be difficult for you to go on with the Lord. If you mean business with the Lord, simply go on with Him. Forget about whether He will forgive you or be happy with you. Do not take time to consider such things until you have reached the goal and gained the prize. Do not wonder whether you are right or wrong—just go on. </p>
<p data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssDRTSpFHgzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97562" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">Hebrews 6</span>, to go on does not need the laying of another foundation. Suppose the brothers who are building a new meeting hall have laid the foundation, but have become frustrated and have stopped working. After they are stirred up to continue working on the meeting hall, should they start over from the beginning and lay another foundation? No, that would be foolish. If they did that a few times, the whole building site would be filled with foundations. There would be no walls, roof, or building, only many foundations. Although doing such a thing would be foolish, many Christians, including myself, have done this very thing in their Christian life. In the early years of my Christian life, I laid many foundations. After I had been revived, I would gradually go down again. Then, after being stirred up again, I would purposely and thoroughly go back to the beginning to repent and make confession all over again. This is what it means “to renew again to repentance,” which is to lay again <span class="pg" data-page-id="329" id="329">[329]</span> “a foundation of repentance.” After a while, I would be distracted again and then go back to confess and make confession still another time. Finally, I became tired of this, but I did not know what to do. One day, as I was reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97563" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">Hebrews chapter six</span>, I realized how foolish I had been. I did not need to repent again of what I had repented already or go back to the beginning to make another thorough confession. I simply needed to go on. </p>
<p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7OjgIMwp8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> Most of the so-called revivals in today’s Christianity only stir up people to go back and lay another foundation again and again. A famous preacher comes and stirs the people up. After a few months they begin to go down, and another preacher comes to revive them once again. Each time the people are revived they lay another foundation. Most Christians lay the same foundation again and again. This is why we need <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97564" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">Hebrews 6</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="PvInMZn3Vp176ChSyFxrxuunL7eI0R_umEl2pfk_yxb2iqBRHJddNGyBQOilH2EXM"> We should forget about laying another foundation and just go on. Do not consider whether the Lord will forgive you or not—just go on until you reach the goal. Once you have been stirred up to go on with the Lord, you do not need that much repentance. Repentance has been overemphasized in today’s revivalistic Christianity. Nearly every revivalist has learned one skill—to stir up people to repentance. But now I must tell you that you do not need to repent that much. The Lord is bored with your repentance. In a sense, the Lord is disgusted with so many repenting prayers. He wants to see you going on, not repenting of the same thing over and over again. To go on simply means to cross the river, to go from one side to another, from one stage to another, from one standing to another. Do not talk or consider. Go on. Leave your old concepts, understandings, doctrines, and teachings, and go on. The faster you go on, the better. </p>

LEAVING THE WORD OF THE BEGINNING OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="pnhep-1swI5hHB5N847IZQ5HSCDODfkFej5Ckh2HbQV2ZFXVzDLdqnlvjBn5DFN_h"> If we are to go on, we must leave the word of the beginning of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97565" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">6:1</span>). This means that we must leave the foundation stage, the milk stage, and the baby stage. As we have seen in the previous message, the word of the beginning of <span class="pg" data-page-id="330" id="330">[330]</span> Christ is the milk for the babes in Christ. In order to go on we must leave the doctrines we received at the beginning and no longer feed on baby food. We must go on from the baby stage to maturity by feeding on the solid food, which is the word of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97566" data-verses="Hebrews 5:13-14">5:13-14</span>) ministered to us in this book. </p>

NOT LAYING AGAIN THE FOUNDATION</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="W1iZtRdq2EaOvu-m8SfI8jKyeD9_rOlrXR3fm3GUzcPU0O7qbBBiKxEFUeCJG_ERL">A. The Foundation Being Laid Already and<br/>There Being No Need to Lay It Again</h2>
<p data-content-id="2p-Clb9asquxf4mQ9n64m4lN6Mj_IFbKGR1gkxbP1RjXC1oK7CumV6zeFKsjKYYc6"> The foundation has already been laid, and there is no need to lay it again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97567" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">6:1</span>). The foundation is of six things: repentance from dead works, faith toward God, teaching of baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97568" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>). This is the foundation of our Christian life which was laid at the beginning when we were saved. Since it has already been laid, there is no need to lay it again. If we fall away after being saved, we do not need to go back to repent of the things which we have repented of already. If we go back to repeat our past repentance, it means that we are going back to lay another foundation. If after falling away we come back and desire to go on with the Lord, we do not need to repeat our old repentance. We simply need to go on. Let us use again the illustration of construction work. If the work on a meeting hall is stopped after the laying of the foundation, there is no need to lay another foundation for the further building work. The workmen should simply build upon the foundation already laid. We may also use the illustration of running a race. If a runner falls after starting the race, he does not need to go back to start the race again. He simply needs to press on from the very place where he has fallen. Our Christian life is a building project and a race. If we fall away after we have begun, we do not need to go back to the beginning and start again; we only need to go on from where we fell. </p>

Firstly, Christ is the High Priest of God typified by Aaron, and secondly He is the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec. Christ’s ministry is of two main aspects, the one typified by Aaron on earth and the other according to the order of Melchisedec in heaven. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gGi1krUjO5_vgHIvZGO24rlui0ABZa_k8hB0IkA8RvqDpYwLHDRb1TMHp4sIipHHx">I. A TURN IN THE BOOK OF HEBREWS</h2><p data-content-id="eQJD4_jtknWQat9jcVOn5Wxt7NNYK_r5XUDNpcDDJV6S5IySpcJb2P-RieMVJy8R6"> According to the work and ministry of Christ, this book has a turn at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97616" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">7:1</span>, a turn from earth to heaven. To the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97617" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">chapter six</span>, what is mainly revealed is Christ’s work on earth typified by the priesthood of Aaron. That section is the word of foundation. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97618" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">7:1</span>, Christ’s ministry in heaven according to the order of Melchisedec is unveiled. This section is the word of perfection, which shows us how the heavenly Christ ministers in the heavenly tabernacle. His purification of sins is typified by the work of Aaron, while His sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97619" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">1:3</span>) is according to the order of Melchisedec (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97620" data-verses="Psalms 110:1">Psa. 110:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97621" data-verses="Psalms 110:4">4</span>). His work on the cross on earth typified by the work of Aaron affords us forgiveness of sin. His ministry on the throne in heaven ministers to us the overcoming of sin. His cross delivered us out of Egypt; His throne brings us into Canaan. Although the Hebrew believers had participated in His work on the cross, they had to press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne. </p>
<p data-content-id="59tq157xwce1XvZTZYWADFqtzS6AdhVzhWKgIad9yUQA9xO1kuO2-Z98Caw01EdMR"> We may say that the forgiveness of sin is on the ground <span class="pg" data-page-id="342" id="342">[342]</span> floor and that the overcoming of sin is on the second floor. During the past centuries, a great many Christians have sought for the overcoming of sin. However, not many of them ever succeeded in this matter because they were seeking something that is on the second floor while they were on the ground floor. How could you ever have the things on the second floor while seeking for them on the ground floor? The forgiveness of sin is on the ground floor. Every saved Christian can testify that he has fully, successfully, absolutely, and thoroughly experienced the forgiveness of sin. But we must be on the second floor in order to experience the overcoming of sin. The forgiveness of sin is related to Christ’s work on earth typified by the work of Aaron. This is on the ground floor. The overcoming of sin is related to Christ’s work today in heaven according to the order of Melchisedec. This is on the second floor. Are you on the ground floor or on the second floor? I am quite sure that I am on the second floor. How wonderful it is to be on the second floor enjoying not only the forgiveness of sin but also the overcoming of sin! Sin is beneath our feet! If you are going to overcome a certain thing, that thing must be underneath you. Although in terminology it sounds like a small thing to speak of the overcoming of sin, in experience it is tremendous. How good it is to enjoy the overcoming of sin! If you want to have the overcoming of sin, you must come to the second floor to experience the heavenly ministry of the heavenly Christ according to the order of Melchisedec. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nra_GgDpimpsPAo0RrC1YOLHXi0642dTAWC_1CYoST56PQUyLyIACiL2qjOnKIM8F"> As I have already mentioned, Christ’s cross delivers us out of Egypt and His throne brings us into Canaan. Where are you—in Egypt or in Canaan? How do you know that you are in Canaan? It is easy to tell. I know that I am in Canaan because I am no longer around the cross but around the throne. The sermons, messages, conversations, and fellowship of most Christians is around the cross. I hardly ever heard of a group of Christians fellowshipping around the throne. Is your Christ today on the cross or on the throne? I can testify to you that my Christ today is on the throne. I am not seeking Him at the cross; I am enjoying Him on the throne. <span class="pg" data-page-id="343" id="343">[343]</span> This is marvelous. Today our Christ is no longer on the cross but on the throne. The Passover in Egypt signified Christ on the cross. But today our Christ is on the throne, and where the throne is, there is Canaan. We are in Canaan. We are in the Sabbath rest because our Christ is on the throne. Although we have participated in Christ’s work on the cross, we must now press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne. The Christ who is with me in the present ministry is the Christ on the throne. Oh, may the fact that Christ is now on the throne be experienced by us! We need to see all the details concerning this enthroned Christ. When we enjoy such a Christ, we are on the second floor, in Canaan, and around the throne. </p>
<p data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCE7rKG1fQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv"> This message is on the heavenly ministry of the heavenly Christ. As we have seen, the book of Hebrews makes a great turn at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97622" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">7:1</span>. Not many readers of Hebrews have seen this point clearly, but by God’s mercy and grace He has shown us this turn. My burden in this message simply is to impress you with this turn. May the Holy Spirit inscribe this turn deeply into your spirit. This turn is not merely a doctrinal turn; it is a turn in our experience of Christ in an active way, even in a subjectively objective way. In the next message I shall explain what I mean by subjectively objective. For the time being, I ask you to keep in mind that at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97623" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">7:1</span> we must make a turn so that we may experience Christ in a subjectively objective way. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ce50k8tQiJj2hm-zVHrfE0QS5-8sx9bxTn4PDYyUCKmXbgGgJ_N3tdzwHbUeZPInF">A. From the Outer Court on Earth<br/>to the Holy of Holies in Heaven</h2><p data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyC-2ahB7CZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH"> This turn is from the outer court on earth to the Holy of Holies in heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97624" data-verses="Hebrews 8:2">8:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97625" data-verses="Hebrews 9:11-12">9:11-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97626" data-verses="Hebrews 9:24">24</span>). This reminds us of the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle. Firstly, there was the outer court. Then there was the tabernacle, which was divided into two parts—the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies where God’s presence was. Thus, there were three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. According to the type, both the outer court and the Holy Place are for the Holy of Holies. The purpose in <span class="pg" data-page-id="344" id="344">[344]</span> entering the outer court is to come through the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies. Both the outer court and the Holy Place are for the people to come into the Holy of Holies. The outer court is for people to enter the Holy of Holies, and the Holy Place is the threshold of the Holy of Holies. If you come to the outer court without entering into the Holy of Holies, you are aimless. If you remain around the altar and the laver for a long time, you have no aim or destination. Neither the altar nor the laver in the outer court is the goal. The goal is the Holy of Holies. Whenever you are at the altar or at the laver you must aim for the Holy of Holies. Even when you are in the Holy Place you should say, “Lord, I am not for this place. I am passing through this place to the Holy of Holies. My aim, my goal, is Your Holy of Holies.” The book of Hebrews firstly presents us the things in the outer court. Then, beginning at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97627" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">7:1</span>, it turns us to the Holy of Holies. This is the turn from the outer court through the Holy Place to the Holy of Holies. </p>

What does this mean? This is a very exciting matter. One night, in 1968, a brother said to me, “Brother Lee, in the whole U.S.A., the preachers, pastors, and ministers have been telling people for years to look to the Lord who is in heaven. But since coming to this country, you have been telling people to turn to their spirit to meet with the Lord. This is absolutely different. It seems that there are two directions.” Yes, there are undoubtedly these two directions. As we pointed out in the last message, the Lord today is no longer here on earth but is on the throne in heaven. There is no doubt about this. But if the Lord were only on the throne in heaven, how could the people on earth have Him as their life? If He were only in heaven, He would be too far away from us for us to have Him as our life and our daily life supply. How can the Lord, who is in fact objective, become subjective to us in our daily life? This is the problem. </p>
<p data-content-id="19J7BMpUdAP-KQCUvDLChVT_U2_Zvr1TF44VGLYr0Wq30Cf62POCZtTmD67IMB8WQ"> The secret to the answer to this question is in the book of Hebrews. This secret in the book of Hebrews is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97676" data-verses="Hebrews 4:12">4:12</span>, which speaks of the dividing of soul and spirit. It seems that the writer introduces this point suddenly for no apparent reason. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97677" data-verses="Hebrews 4:1">Chapter four</span> deals with the Sabbath rest. Doctrinally speaking, there is apparently no relationship between the Sabbath rest and our human spirit. The Sabbath rest is the Sabbath rest, and our human spirit is our human spirit. These two things seem to be far removed from one another. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97678" data-verses="Hebrews 4:14">4:14</span> goes on to say that we have “a great High Priest Who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97679" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">verse 16</span> tells us to “come forward with boldness to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="356" id="356">[356]</span> throne of grace.” Our great High Priest is on the throne in heaven. How can we touch Him? How can we experience Him? </p>
<p data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41aw0Z60oMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg"> The writer of Hebrews tells us to “come forward.” I need to say a word about this phrase. It is used several times in Hebrews: “come forward to the throne of grace” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97680" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">4:16</span>); “come forward to the Holy of Holies” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97681" data-verses="Hebrews 10:22">10:22</span>); “come forward to God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97682" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">7:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97683" data-verses="Hebrews 11:6">11:6</span>). We need to come forward to three things: to the Holy of Holies, to the throne of grace, and to God Himself. Do not shrink backward—come forward. In Greek, the words “come forward” are one word. Most versions render it either as approach, draw near, or come near. According to the best Greek lexicon, however, the primary meaning of this word is come forward. </p>
<p data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXt9fBR4q_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB"> We need to understand the background of the book of Hebrews. As we have already seen clearly, the recipients of this book, the Hebrew believers, were in danger of shrinking back. They were staggering and hesitating, and the book of Hebrews was written to encourage them to come forward. The writer did not tell them to go forward but to come forward. This means that the writer was in a particular place and that he wanted his readers to come forward to the place where he was. So he told them to come forward to the Holy of Holies, to the throne of grace, and to God. Where is God? He is on the throne of grace. Where is the throne of grace? It is in the Holy of Holies. At the time of the writing of this book, the writer was there in the Holy of Holies, calling the Hebrew brothers to come forward. </p>
<p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdnlGf2R5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> At this point we have a problem. Where are the Holy of Holies and the throne of grace? According to our experience, we would say that they are joined to our spirit. If they, the Holy of Holies and the throne of grace, are joined to our spirit, then undoubtedly God must be in our spirit, because God is on the throne of grace. As long as the Holy of Holies and the throne of grace are joined to our spirit, God must be in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="nGm-eJrwx-DRz6RAx60bPjwUow-iP-3qER1EiyiqV-1eQ6SXHd83e5a9vAuFAVRIG"> If you were to ask many Christians where the Holy of Holies and the throne of grace are, they would say that they <span class="pg" data-page-id="357" id="357">[357]</span> are in heaven. There is a strong ground in the Bible for saying this. Doctrinally speaking, it is absolutely correct to say this. Nevertheless, we need to ask this question: If the throne of grace is in heaven and we are on earth, how can we come forward to it? Is there any way for us who are on earth today to touch the throne of grace in heaven? According to their theology, many Christians have no way to touch the throne of grace today. The throne of grace is far away from them. The Holy of Holies in heaven is also far away. Yes, doctrinally speaking, the Holy of Holies and the throne of grace undoubtedly are in heaven. Since we all are on the earth, how can we enter the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace today? And today Christ is also on the throne in heaven objectively. How can this objective Christ be our subjective experience? According to the objective teachings, there is no way. </p>
<p data-content-id="u4VI6PwMV9YLyodQonZhTg1S3_evTx71vxZI3U8v6Kn8u6sybJckax5dbxTnzWMOb"> The Bible speaks of a place called Bethel, the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97684" data-verses="Genesis 28:19">Gen. 28:19</span>). In this place there is the ladder joining earth and heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97685" data-verses="Genesis 28:12">Gen. 28:12</span>), and on this ladder the angels of God are ascending and descending. This indicates that the ladder joins earth to heaven and heaven to earth. Between earth and heaven there is a great deal of traffic, as indicated by the angels’ ascending and descending. This traffic is not found in any place on earth except in one special place—Bethel, the house of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="fuOTOIbl26ICXoDfOfmOxeE26jO5N_EbrL-zVhjSApM5ECRzMvL1jcqgw8vvh-fDb"> We may use electricity as an illustration of the traffic between earth and heaven. An electrical power plant may be far away from your home, but between your home and the power plant there is the traffic of electricity. Wires bring the electricity from the power plant into your home. Likewise, there is traffic between earth and heaven. Christ is the ladder that affords this traffic. Upon this ladder there is much ascending and descending, much going and coming. This ladder is in the house of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="IUDJqdl9X6vy3Vq-crvLferhsYVwghlxQoAehr9Bor-YhLUZxsqlKZZQEkrirqIrE"> All of this, however, is still doctrinal. Where is the house of God on earth today? After studying the Bible for many years, I eventually found out that today Bethel, the house of God, is in our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97686" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span> (Gk.) says that we “are <span class="pg" data-page-id="358" id="358">[358]</span> being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit.” The church today is the habitation of God, the house of God, and this is in our spirit. When we, the church people, all meet together in our spirit, the house of God, Bethel, is here. Immediately, that very place is joined to heaven, for there is a ladder joining earth to heaven and bringing heaven down to earth. Spontaneously, we have traffic between earth and heaven. However, whenever we get out of our spirit and into our mind or emotions, Bethel disappears. Where is Bethel today? It is in our spirit. Since Bethel, God’s house, is in our spirit, our spirit is the very place where Christ, the heavenly ladder, joins us to heaven and brings heaven to us. According to this revelation and according to our experience, we may boldly say that the Holy of Holies and the throne of grace are joined to our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="H4ftD0nM_HqTnTBTZI6vm_7DcDuOM11qPJmRIviZqwZm5FkPIartulj8dlWnhx9NX"> This is why the writer of Hebrews told us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97687" data-verses="Hebrews 4:12">4:12</span> that firstly we must experience the dividing of our spirit from our soul and that, following this, we can come forward to the Holy of Holies, to the throne of grace, and to the very God who is on the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies. The secret of this experience is the dividing of soul and spirit. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPfMRpPqcwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm">A DIVINE HIGH PRIEST,<br/>LIVING AND ABLE TO SAVE</h1><h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LsMUGHoOAyglcgXHKOT_4NgP5Q-wBBYWGd_3K1-drcYapSz78FtH6UNrSlSq3kKsG">I. A DIVINE HIGH PRIEST</h2>
<p data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6BSVFvM6XM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97719" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">Hebrews 7</span>, a chapter on the priesthood of Christ, reveals two aspects of Christ’s priesthood. The first aspect is the kingly priesthood, and the second aspect is the divine priesthood. As we saw in the last message, Christ is a kingly priest. His status is kingly, royal. Although He is a High Priest, He did not come out of the tribe of the priests but out of the tribe of the kings—Judah. Kingship is His status and makes Him a kingly priest. </p>
<p data-content-id="Z-QbeF7eFSCsrR20PWwNAn9XjOdizFUNBnmIQqNZgJ_0WMRdgwQ1A7MTTYXlofxbP"> Kingship is related to both righteousness and peace because kingship is a kind of rule and authority. In order to maintain righteousness and peace, we need authority. If Christ is to minister the processed God to us as our bread and wine, there must be an environment that is full of righteousness and peace. Whenever we come to the Lord’s table, we need to have the deep sensation that we are in a condition of righteousness and peace. Suppose, on the contrary, that we are continually fighting with one another. In such a case, there would be no righteousness and peace, and there would be no ministering of the bread and wine to us. In order to have the processed God ministered to us for our enjoyment, everything between us and God and between us and one another must be all right. When everything is right, there will be peace, and in peace Christ will minister the processed God to us. Righteousness and peace come out of His kingship, for when the King is here, no one will fight. Everything will be peaceful. Christ’s kingship maintains an order of righteousness and peace. His kingly status is for the purpose of preserving a righteous and peaceful order. <span class="pg" data-page-id="368" id="368">[368]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCZrpPt7-2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> The second aspect of Christ’s priesthood in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97720" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">Hebrews 7</span> is the divine priesthood. For Christ to be kingly is a matter of status, but for Him to be divine is a matter of constituent, a matter of His having the necessary, basic element that constitutes Him to be such a High Priest. Christ’s being divine refers to His nature. Christ is kingly according to His royal status and divine according to His divine nature. He is kingly because He is a King and He is divine because He is the Son of God. Christ, the Son of God, not only has kingship but also divinity. While His kingship maintains a condition that is full of righteousness and peace so that He may minister the processed God to us for our enjoyment, His divinity constitutes Him as a High Priest who is living and full of life so that He may be able to continue His priesthood perpetually. </p>
<p data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssDRjSgXngzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr"> Divinity is Christ’s nature and life. As such a divine person full of divinity, He is the living One. With Christ as the kingly High Priest there is no unrighteousness or strife but righteousness and peace. With Christ as the divine High Priest there is no death. He has conquered, subdued, and swallowed death. Why is there no death with our divine High Priest? Because He is life. Christ is divine. Divinity is His very essence, nature, element, and makeup. His kingly status solves all problems and maintains a peaceful environment. But He is divine, not just kingly. Since Christ is divine, wherever He is, there is no death. Wherever He is, there is resurrection and death is swallowed. Wherever Christ is, there is the absence of death. Christ’s priesthood is the absence of death. Have you ever heard that the priesthood of Christ is the absence of death? Light is the absence of darkness, for whenever light is present, darkness must be absent. Likewise, Christ’s presence means the absence of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7OjQIEiZ8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> Why does Christ’s presence mean the absence of death? Because He is divine. Divinity is the constituent of His priesthood. His priesthood is constituted, composed, with His divinity. As wood is the element of a table, so divinity is the element of Christ’s being the High Priest. When His ministry comes in, it means the absence of death. On the one hand, the priesthood of Christ is the absence of death; on the <span class="pg" data-page-id="369" id="369">[369]</span> other hand, it is the presence of life. Thus, the priesthood of Christ is the absence of death and the presence of life. As the kingly High Priest, Christ ministers the processed God to us, and as the divine High Priest, wherever He is, life is present. His priesthood is the presence of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nra_GgDpimpsPAo0RrC1YOrHewU642dTAWC_1CYoST56PQUyLyIACiL2qjOnKIM8F"> Have you ever noticed the two aspects of Christ’s priesthood in this chapter—the kingly aspect and the divine aspect? Perhaps you are wondering how we can prove that there are these two aspects. This is easy to do. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97721" data-verses="Hebrews 7:2">7:2</span> we have the King of righteousness and the King of peace, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97722" data-verses="Hebrews 7:28">7:28</span> we have “the Son, Who is perfected forever.” The Son of God has been appointed to be the High Priest, and the Son of God is certainly divine. Hence, at the beginning of this chapter we have the King and at the end we have the Son of God. Although I spent much time on this chapter, I could not understand it until one day I got the two words kingly and divine. When I saw that the first part is the kingly aspect and the second part is the divine aspect, the whole chapter became clear. </p>
<p data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCE7LKOnvQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv"> This wonderful High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec has not been constituted “according to the law of a fleshy commandment, but according to the power of an indestructible life,” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97723" data-verses="Hebrews 7:16">v. 16</span>) for “the law perfected nothing” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97724" data-verses="Hebrews 7:19">v. 19</span>). Since the law did not perfect anything, we need to say to the law, “Law, you are nothing. You never profited anyone. Law, stay away from me.” Our High Priest has not been constituted with the law but with the power of an indestructible life. Who is He? He is the Son of God. You may also say to the law, “Dear Law, can you compare yourself with the Son of God? I have been cheated by you for years, thinking that you were something when actually you were nothing. Now, Law, I have life!” We have the Lord’s life, the life that is the Son of God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="hZwxam6lXwmH0E7Nl83pakCEtLda-ocuqHw2FtYp_6HHqSCdwcI5BmEdEnDTEQuNB"> The Son of God is not simple, for He has two aspects. Most Christians only know that the Son of God is the Only Begotten Son, but the Bible says that He is also the Firstborn Son. The Only Begotten Son is one aspect, and the Firstborn Son is the other aspect. The Only Begotten Son, <span class="pg" data-page-id="370" id="370">[370]</span> who existed from eternity past, only had divinity. The Firstborn Son, who according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97725" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97726" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span> was born as such on the day of resurrection, has both divinity and humanity. On the day of resurrection, the man Jesus was born to be the Son of God. This does not relate to the aspect of His being the Only Begotten Son but to the aspect of His being the Firstborn Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzeJpRpvQVUylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> Do not think that this is merely a doctrinal matter. It is related to the qualifications of Christ as the High Priest. Although the Only Begotten Son was wonderful, He had only divinity but not humanity, which is necessary for Him to be our High Priest. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97727" data-verses="Hebrews 7:28">Verse 28</span> says that the Son of God has been perfected forever, proving that the Son of God here must not be just the Only Begotten Son but also the Firstborn Son. The Only Begotten Son of God needed no perfection because He was eternally perfect. But, in order for Him to be the Firstborn Son of God, He needed a great deal of perfection. He had to put on humanity in His incarnation and live on earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through all the experience of human living. Then He needed to pass through death, tasting, overcoming, subduing, and swallowing death. After that, He had to come out of death in resurrection. After His resurrection, He, as the Firstborn Son of God with humanity, was fully perfected. Now He is not just the eternal Only Begotten Son of God, but also the perfected Firstborn Son of God. Therefore, now He is completely perfected, equipped, and qualified to be our divine High Priest. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGE9svfFQsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_">THE INDESTRUCTIBLE LIFE</h1><p data-content-id="W1iZtRdq2EaOvu-m8SfI8iKybQ9_rOlrXR3fm3GUzcPU0O7qbBBiKxEFUeCJG_ERL"> This message is on the indestructible life, the life that is the essence, element, and constituent of Christ’s divine priesthood. To say that Christ’s priesthood is kingly is not too difficult to grasp because the logic there is not that deep. But to say that Christ’s divine priesthood is constituted with life, having life as its element, essence, component, and constituent, is very deep. The logic here is quite deep. As I pointed out in the previous message, Christ’s divine priesthood is the absence of death. Before we consider the matter of the indestructible life, I need to say more about Christ’s divine priesthood being the absence of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="2p-Clb9asquxf4mQ9n64m5lN-fz_IFbKGR1gkxbP1RjXC1oK7CumV6zeFKsjKYYc6"> According to the Scriptures, there are three aspects of the priesthood: the aspect of the Aaronic priesthood, the aspect of the kingly priesthood, and the aspect of the divine priesthood. The Aaronic aspect of the priesthood is for offering sacrifices to God for our sins. Hence, the Aaronic priesthood is mainly concerned with the sin offering. The kingly aspect of the priesthood is for ministering the processed God to us as our life supply. The aspect of the divine priesthood is for saving us to the uttermost. Therefore, we have three words to describe the three aspects of the priesthood: offering for the Aaronic aspect, ministering for the kingly aspect, and saving for the divine aspect. Offering solves the problem of sin, ministering imparts the processed God to us as our daily supply, and saving rescues us to the uttermost. The saving of the divine priesthood rescues us especially from death and all of the environment of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="u4VI6PwMV9YLyodQonZhThVSwt-vTx71vxZI3U8v6Kn8u6sybJckax5dbxTnzWMOb"> While the Aaronic priesthood solves the problem of sin, the kingly priesthood ministers God to us, not as the object <span class="pg" data-page-id="382" id="382">[382]</span> of our worship but as our enjoyment for our daily supply. Whenever you mention God to most Christians, they think of Him as the object of their worship. But, for the time being, we must forget this. When we mention God, we must think of Him as the One who has been processed and imparted to us to be our daily supply. There is no better worship to God than enjoying Him as your supply. Although you may like to kneel down to Him, He may say, “Child, don’t do this. I like to be the bread and wine that you eat and drink. The more you eat and drink of Me, the more worship you render to Me.” Eating and drinking of God is the best worship. The worship that satisfies God’s heart desire to the uttermost is that we enjoy Him as our supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="fuOTOIbl26ICXoDfOfmOxfk28x-5N_EbrL-zVhjSApM5ECRzMvL1jcqgw8vvh-fDb"> That man should eat and drink of God was the original and initial intention of God in His eternal plan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97763" data-verses="Genesis 2:9-10">Gen. 2:9-10</span>). In God’s eternal plan, God intended to dispense Himself into man to be man’s everything that man might become His complete expression. This intention can only be accomplished by Christ’s kingly priesthood, which ministers the processed God to us as our daily supply. However, before this was accomplished, sin came in. Therefore, the problem of sin had to be solved. But solving the problem of sin was not intended by God to fulfill His eternal purpose; it was added later due to the entrance of sin caused by the fall of man. Because of man’s fall, sin came in to frustrate and damage God’s purpose of ministering Himself into man as man’s daily supply. Since Satan had brought in sin to frustrate God’s purpose, the problem of sin had to be solved. Hence, there was the need of the Aaronic priesthood, which was brought in to solve the problem of sin. By this we can see that the Aaronic priesthood was not a part of God’s initial intention but was added later. Many Christians, forgetting the initial things and concentrating on what was added later, neglect the kingly priesthood and concentrate on the Aaronic priesthood. The Aaronic priesthood solves the problem of sin, whereas the kingly priesthood fulfills God’s eternal purpose. The Aaronic priesthood took away sin, and the kingly priesthood brought in God as our grace. <span class="pg" data-page-id="383" id="383">[383]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="IUDJqdl9X6vy3Vq-crvLffLhlKVwghlxQoAehr9Bor-YhLUZxsqlKZZQEkrirqIrE"> Why then is there the need for the third aspect of the priesthood, the divine priesthood? Although sin is over, it caused a tremendous result—death. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97764" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span>, the issue of sin is death. We should not understand death according to the narrow view of our human concept. According to the broadest understanding of death in the Bible, death includes vanity, corruption, sighing, groaning, and decay. Everything is decaying. You may have a strong body, but before too long it begins to decay. The matters of vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay are fully developed and covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97765" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97766" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span>, we have sin and death; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97767" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> we have vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay. The whole universe has been polluted by death, which is the result of the sin that came in through Adam, the head of the old creation. What is the pollution that comes from death, the result of sin? It is corruption, vanity, decay, and groaning. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97768" data-verses="Romans 8:22">Romans 8:22</span> says that the entire creation is groaning. Why do people today have so many sports and entertainments? Because they, along with the whole creation, are sick and are groaning. Every person is groaning deep within. Since people want to escape from this groaning, they go dancing or partake of other worldly entertainments. All of these entertainments are drugs, like opium, that take away the feeling of the sickness. But opium does not heal; it merely drugs you. The dancing and all sports and entertainments are drugs. When many people come home from dancing or from a sporting event, they find that the inward groaning is still there. The only thing that has been changed is that they have been drugged. Education is also a drug. Although you may attain the highest degree, once you have graduated, you will say, “What is this?” and will throw away your diploma. This groaning is one of the issues of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="H4ftD0nM_HqTnTBTZI6vm-bDUR-OM11qPJmRIviZqwZm5FkPIartulj8dlWnhx9NX"> Because of the issues of death, we need the divine priesthood, which is the presence of life and the absence of death. When you visit the homes of some of the dear saints in the church, you see nothing but vanity, corruption, groaning, and decay. If this is the situation in your home, it means that <span class="pg" data-page-id="384" id="384">[384]</span> there is a lack of the divine priesthood in your home. When your home is filled with the divine priesthood of Christ, there is the absence of death and the presence of life. There will be no more vanity, corruption, groaning, and decay. Contrary to the concept of many Christians, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97769" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span> does not mean that Christ will save us from such things as gambling; it mainly means He will save us from all of our corruption, vanity, groaning, and decay. Oh, we need to be saved to the uttermost! When you come to my home, there should be praising, reality, building up, and growth, not groaning, vanity, corruption, and decay. To be saved from these issues of death is what it means to be saved to the uttermost. This is not the saving of the Savior but the saving of the divine priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="afNFn9OFFhiGx4i5yPaytW7QJUgPwOHF65dbAP4BbUq6H0aWVC2NiuPeDe_39lWHN"> The Greek word translated uttermost in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97770" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">7:25</span> has the same root as the Greek word for perfection. Hence, to be saved to the uttermost means to be saved into perfection. Into what kind of perfection is Christ saving us? Into His perfection. To be saved to the uttermost is to be brought into Christ’s perfection. The divine Son of God was incarnated, lived on earth, passed through death, was resurrected, and has been fully perfected forever. This means that in His perfection there is no groaning, vanity, corruption, bondage, or decay. In Christ, the perfected Son of God, the One who has been resurrected and uplifted, there is no groaning. Do you think that within Him there is any vanity, bondage, corruption, or decay? No, He is absolutely free from these things. Vanity, groaning, decay, bondage, and corruption are all by-products of death. Christ, the perfected One, is able to save us from all of these by-products of death and to bring us into His perfection. In this wonderful perfection there is no vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, or decay. This is the saving to the uttermost, the saving to perfection. This is the saving of the divine priesthood of Christ. </p>

After the foregoing messages on Christ’s kingly priesthood and divine priesthood, we are surely prepared, equipped, and even positioned to hear this message. We have seen the two sections of Christ’s ministry: the Aaronic section on earth and the kingly and divine section in heaven. It is not a small thing for us to be clear regarding these two aspects of Christ’s ministry. With this understanding as our background, it is not difficult to understand this matter of the heavenly Minister with a more excellent ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="bL3_vIKwgozM1X2VsKZqG3wLRUEmDEIoUOwwkTFE2jCXoezsRLTSk_IdHBfxVvI3_"> Before we come to this, however, I would like to speak further about the comparison between Hebrews and Romans. Sin and death are mentioned in both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97813" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97814" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97815" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> says that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed us from the law of sin and death, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97816" data-verses="Romans 8:3">8:3</span> says that God has condemned sin in the flesh, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97817" data-verses="Romans 8:6">8:6</span> says that the mind set on the flesh is death. When we come to the middle and last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97818" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, there is no more mention of sin and death but of groaning, vanity, corruption, and bondage, which are the by-products of death. It is one thing to overcome sin and death and quite another thing, a most crucial thing, to eliminate these by-products of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="qKxtcI35M3YEACqdkwu3H54AmBXcUUjY_hyL2HgqHBT9dM7ruT_ZFMeT5R17JOoOA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97819" data-verses="Romans 3:1-8">Romans 3 through 8</span> we can see three steps of God’s economical salvation: justification, sanctification, and glorification. Justification is related to God’s righteousness, sanctification to God’s holiness, and glorification to God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="394" id="394">[394]</span> glory. God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory all have requirements upon us. In order for us to be thoroughly and ultimately saved, we need to meet all of these requirements. God’s justification meets the requirements of His righteousness, God’s sanctification meets the requirements of His holiness, and God’s glorification meets the requirements of His glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="ypPAS58zX4Yp4txU9VRAQ7uAHXCToz5xsxInBUpzhFwkU2SoOph-gkqdH4Klv2TIx"> God’s economical salvation is not only to justify us or to sanctify us but also to glorify us. As we pointed out in the last message, to be glorified is to have our being completely saturated with Christ’s divine priesthood. When our whole being has been saturated and permeated with His divine priesthood, that will be our glorification, the last step of God’s salvation. At that time we shall enjoy full sonship, which will be consummated by the redemption of our body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97820" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Rom. 8:23</span>). Glorification does not save us from sins or even from death; it saves us from the by-products of death, from groaning, vanity, corruption, bondage, and decay. These by-products of death require that we be saved to the uttermost, and Christ is able to do this. Salvation to the uttermost not only rescues us from sin and death but also diminishes and swallows up all the by-products of death. When all the by-products of death are swallowed up, that will be the time of the manifestation of the sons of God in glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97821" data-verses="Romans 8:19">Rom. 8:19</span>). At that time not only the sons of God but also the whole creation will be freed from the bondage of vanity and corruption into the freedom of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97822" data-verses="Romans 8:21">Rom. 8:21</span>). When we have been saved to the uttermost, we shall be brought into complete perfection. This is what it means to be glorified. </p>
<p data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LADsROtJwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97823" data-verses="Romans 8:30">Romans 8:30</span> says, “And whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified” (Recovery Version). We see from this verse that glorification is salvation to the uttermost. This glorification is the definition of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97824" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>, which says that Christ is able to save us to the uttermost. This uttermost salvation is glorification, and glorification means to deliver us from the by-products of death. At the time of glorification, there will be no more <span class="pg" data-page-id="395" id="395">[395]</span> groaning, slavery, bondage, vanity, corruption, or decay. Who is doing this work of saving us to the uttermost? Our Melchisedec, the kingly and divine High Priest. </p>
<p data-content-id="0LzTaf-UCCdfAz45OTRuZeRTE1ZWe9bD9g-xeDycbaQml7QnmCMyvs8NwZmgFWFwe"> Only two verses in the Bible, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97825" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97826" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Romans 8:34</span>, tell us that Christ is interceding for us, and these two verses correspond to one another. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97827" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, Christ is not interceding for poor sinners to be justified—justification is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97828" data-verses="Romans 4:1">Romans 4</span>—but He is interceding for us to be glorified. This corresponds to the interceding in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97829" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>, for here Christ intercedes for us that we may be saved to the uttermost. Being saved to the uttermost is the equivalent of glorification. Hence, both of these chapters tell us the same thing. Without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97830" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">Hebrews 7</span> we would never realize that the interceding Christ is the kingly, divine High Priest. Without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97831" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">Hebrews 7</span> we might think, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97832" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, that the interceding Christ is only the Savior. But the interceding Christ is more than the Savior—He is the kingly and divine High Priest, the heavenly Minister. Now we know who is the heavenly Minister—it is our Melchisedec. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41axEZ9mIMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg"> The ministry of Melchisedec is not to save sinners. If you are still a sinner, then you need Christ’s ministry as typified by Aaron. But we are no longer pitiful sinners; we are fighters, fighting against the by-products of death. Chedorlaomer, who was slaughtered by Abraham, does not represent sin but represents the by-products of death. When Abraham learned that Lot had been captured, that capture was a matter of the by-products of death. All of the elders in the churches must be slaughtering elders. When the elders come into the meetings and see that many of the dear brothers have been captured by Chedorlaomer, they must slaughter that king. Do not rebuke or condemn the brothers who have been captured but slaughter Chedorlaomer, the by-products of death that have captured the brothers and sisters and hold them in bondage. If you do this, our Melchisedec will come in, and you will enjoy His ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXt8vBXqa_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB"> Many Christians do not understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97833" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1-2">Hebrews 7 and 8</span> because they maintain the position of being pitiful sinners. <span class="pg" data-page-id="396" id="396">[396]</span> Hardly any one of them is a slaughtering Abraham. We must slaughter all of the by-products of death mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97834" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>; we must slaughter groaning, vanity, bondage, slavery, corruption, and decay. How can we slaughter these by-products of death? Through the intercession of our High Priest. While we are slaughtering Chedorlaomer and all of the by-products of death, He will be interceding for us. This is the ministry of our High Priest, the heavenly Minister, today. </p>
<p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdnk2f_D5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> We see a picture of this ministry in the case of the warfare between Israel and Amalek (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97835" data-verses="Exodus 17:8-13">Exo. 17:8-13</span>). Moses was holding up his hand (that is, praying) on the top of the hill and Joshua was fighting in the midst of the battle. While Moses was praying, Joshua was slaughtering the enemy. Likewise, I believe that while Abraham was slaughtering the kings, Melchisedec was praying for him. In the same way, while we are slaughtering the by-products of death, Christ, our heavenly Minister with a more excellent ministry, is in heaven interceding for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="nGm-eJrwx-DRz6RAx60bPiAUgiuiP-3qER1EiyiqV-1eQ6SXHd83e5a9vAuFAVRIG"> What is Christ’s more excellent ministry today? It is to intercede for the fighters. Christ’s intercession is like a powerful motor which energizes a machine that it may operate. How can power be brought into the machine? By the motor. When the motor runs, the power is transmitted into the machine. In like manner, the interceding Christ in the heavens is transmitting the heavenly power into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ZZlu4J5HfdMhfEfUJ3LnMz5uSWBO4c3a__L7gn1p3skFN8-BJcPmokYabiuqvwyt"> Consider once again the case of Abraham’s defeating the kings. Suppose you had been Abraham hearing the news that Lot had been captured. If that had happened to us, we would have been frightened to death and would have gone into the inner part of our tent and prayed, “O Lord, have mercy on us and protect us. Don’t allow the kings to come here.” But when Abraham heard the news, he seemed to say, “They have captured my brother Lot! I don’t care how many men they have—I have the Most High God, and I am going to fight against the kings and rescue Lot.” Abraham and his three hundred eighteen men were bold because they were energized by the intercession of Melchisedec. They <span class="pg" data-page-id="397" id="397">[397]</span> were empowered by a heavenly, universal motor. When Melchisedec came to bless Abraham, he blessed the Most High God for delivering Abraham’s enemies into his hands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97836" data-verses="Genesis 14:20">Gen. 14:20</span>). In other words, Melchisedec was telling Abraham that his victory was the result of his intercession to the Most High God on his behalf. </p>
<p data-content-id="R5BCjovp4r6zbRLEWObeyuR1Sdn_7Qf8QksznRcMh7dobccpo28CQJWJRDpQH5rrM"> We need to have a high vision of Christ’s more excellent ministry. It is not a low ministry for pitiful sinners; it is a high ministry for victorious fighters, for God’s victors, the proper descendants of Abraham. This is not the priesthood that we find in Leviticus but the continuation of the priesthood that we see in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97837" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">Genesis 14</span>. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dnvjKiii8WCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0">THE NEW COVENANT</h1><p data-content-id="r-B8nUhR9J6hUII4QNKnCkHltEL3T1u_Sm-0_l_AMtHeXEMBTrWU2cmFAvJnaebii"> After the five foregoing messages, we are now qualified to understand the new covenant. In this message we need to see what the new covenant is. </p>
<p data-content-id="dY63Ns4YQPAy0AY63eLj7eQJuvKw209Dd3yRfmCJvmFRPo7bCwFO5qUAj0SHHhN9d"> God has an eternal purpose with His divine intention. God’s intention is simply to dispense Himself into us and to work Himself into us as our life and our everything until eventually He and we, we and He, are mingled together and we become His expression to the whole universe. In this process, divinity is wrought into humanity and humanity is mingled with divinity. God is God, but He became man. We are men, but we have God’s life and nature. This is a brief definition of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qpdn89MhLxfVrIv8GWTBfUysTZw55oZqOEuk2qvXDTa4ELyWoRmN1r_WYV01cf7Lc"> Before God accomplished this purpose, Satan caused the fall of man and of many of the angelic creatures. In one sense, this caused God a great deal of trouble, but, in another sense, it afforded Him a good opportunity to manifest His wisdom. Firstly, on the negative side, because sin had come in as a frustration to the fulfillment of God’s purpose, God had to solve all the problems related to sin and to put sin away. Secondly, on the positive side, God has put Himself into us as our life. This life must now be developed into the regulating laws imparted into every inward part of our being. God has put Himself as life into our spirit, and from our spirit He is developing this divine life into laws that are spreading into all of our inward parts. Thirdly, according to this life law, God is our God and we are His people. Fourthly, when this life comes into us and is developed into laws that are imparted into our whole being, <span class="pg" data-page-id="404" id="404">[404]</span> this life with its laws gives us a spontaneous and automatic inward ability to know God in the way of life. This is not to know God by knowledge, by being taught; it is to know Him by the inward ability of life. In order for God to accomplish His eternal purpose He had to do four things: take away sin; put Himself as life into our spirit and develop this life into the laws that are imparted into all of our inward being; make Himself our God and make us His people according to the life law; and grant us the inward ability to know Him in life in an automatic way. </p>
<p data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw6SW7tNjq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF"> Before God did these four things, He firstly promised His people that He would do them by making a covenant with them. A covenant is a biblical term for what we call a contract or an agreement. The content of this contract is that God assures us that He will take away our sins, that He will put Himself as life into our spirit and develop this life into laws in our inward parts, that He will be God to us and that we will be His people according to the life law, and that we shall have the spontaneous inward ability to know Him. These four things are the content of the divine contract. This is the new covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="lkvZM26z559Bj3lTSOUy5c5ugokXSx0PljTjoOkXjCBX2Rdfb66sdAUBGOBf9pyrf"> Why is it called the new covenant? Because before the new covenant was enacted and consummated, God made an old one. Why did He firstly make an old one? Because all of the things in the new covenant are too mysterious and abstract. If God had immediately made such a new covenant, the people would not have been impressed with it or able to understand it. God teaches us in the same way as a kindergarten teacher instructs the little children in her class. For example, before teaching the children the word dog, the teacher shows them a picture of a dog. First there is a picture and then the clear word. Likewise, God firstly gave us the picture and then He told us the real thing. The old covenant was a picture. In the old covenant there was the covering of sin but not the forgiveness of sin. The covering of sin in the old covenant foreshadowed the coming forgiveness of sin in the new covenant. In the old covenant there was the old law, the law of letters. The law of letters in the old <span class="pg" data-page-id="405" id="405">[405]</span> covenant was a shadow of the law of life in the new covenant. Furthermore, in the old covenant God told His people that He was going to be their God according to the law of letters and that they were going to be His people also according to that law of letters. Today, in the new covenant, God is our God not according to the law of letters but according to the law of life, and we are His people also according to the law of life. Moreover, in the old covenant the people were taught to know God by the knowledge of the law, but in the new covenant we are enabled to know God by the inward ability of life. All of the four items of the new covenant were found in the old covenant in the way of shadows, not in the way of reality. Now in the new covenant we have the real thing to replace the shadows. </p>
<p data-content-id="ONTNfoex8_cVo12DfRG5-l3GCVfSxsp3NoQW_8wi-97vKUKUb_GzJXFfUITjZc8rP"> Suppose before I come to see you, I send you my photograph. Although that photograph closely resembles me, it is not I myself; it is merely my picture. When I, the living person, come to see you, my presence surely replaces the photograph. If when I come you do not care for me but continue to treasure my photograph, you would be a most foolish person. </p>
<p data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0PkoZMcNUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW"> As we consider the matters of the old and new covenant, we must know the difference between a promise, an oath, a covenant, and a testament. A promise is an ordinary word spoken by God promising you that He will do something for you. An oath is a confirmation of an ordinary word. God confirmed His ordinary word of promise by means of His oath (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97854" data-verses="Hebrews 6:13">6:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97855" data-verses="Hebrews 6:17">17</span>). When the promise has been confirmed by an oath, it immediately becomes a covenant. What we have received from God is not just an ordinary word as a promise but a covenant, a contract, confirmed by God’s oath and sealed with His divine being. A covenant always binds people more than a promise does. In this binding covenant there are four things which are no longer promises but accomplished facts. All of these facts are clearly itemized in the covenant. The One who made the covenant died so that the covenant might become a bequeathed will, that is, a testament. Now the covenant is no longer merely a covenant but a testament <span class="pg" data-page-id="406" id="406">[406]</span> bequeathed by the One who enacted the covenant. In this bequeathed testament, the four accomplished items have all become bequests. Thus, we do not need to wait for the accomplishment of these things or to pray that God will be faithful to remember His promise and keep His word. We do not need to pray because everything has been accomplished. Each of the four items is an accomplished fact that has been bequeathed to us. These four items are not only promises and facts but also bequests that we may inherit, participate in, and enjoy. What we have today is not a promise or even merely a covenant, but a testament, a will, which is an advanced covenant. An advanced covenant is one that is bequeathed with the accomplished facts, which are the fulfilled promises. When the promise has been fulfilled, it becomes the covenant, and when the covenant has been bequeathed, it becomes the testament. In the promise we have the promised matters, in the covenant we have the accomplished facts, and in the testament we have the accomplished facts bequeathed as bequests. Do not pray that God will fulfill His promises or that He will give you the facts. All of the promises have become accomplished facts, and all of the accomplished facts have been bequeathed to us. We should simply take them and enjoy them. </p>

The crucial matter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97884" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">Hebrews 7</span> was the indestructible life, and the crucial matter here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97885" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1">Hebrews 8</span> is the law of life. The focus of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97886" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1">Hebrews 8</span> is the law of life. Although the words, “the law of life,” are not found in this chapter, what is revealed in this chapter essentially is the law of life. How do we know that the law mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97887" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1">Hebrews 8</span> is the law of life? Because we are told in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97888" data-verses="Hebrews 8:10">verse 10</span> that God will impart His laws into our mind and inscribe them on our hearts. Anything that can be imparted into our inward being must be life. Anything that is not life could never be wrought into our inward being. Therefore, according to the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97889" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1">Hebrews 8</span>, what is indicated by the word law must be the law of life. Please keep in mind that the law of life is the focus, the heart, of this whole chapter. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyC_WalTLCZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH"> In this chapter we also have another five wonderful things: the heavenly Minister, the heavenly tabernacle, the more excellent ministry, the better covenant, and the better promises. The better promises produce the better covenant, and within the better covenant is the heavenly Minister who has a more excellent ministry in the heavenly tabernacle. Hence, we have five things—promises, covenant, Minister, ministry, and tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="Exk_X4ZwoNzpPcXz877bNljOiefhZJx0Y8sYmtn5wXIbTlFsXe1YOEcisvE2Ef8z5"> In the Old Testament, the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the old covenant, that is, the law, were combined to fulfill God’s economy in the way of shadows. These three things give us a clear picture of the heavenly Minister with a more excellent ministry in the heavenly tabernacle and of the better covenant consummated upon better promises for <span class="pg" data-page-id="416" id="416">[416]</span> the fulfillment of God’s economy, not in the way of shadows but in the way of reality. The heavenly tabernacle, the heavenly Minister, and the new covenant are combined for the fulfillment of God’s economy in the way of reality. This is the matter on which we are dwelling in this message. The heavenly tabernacle, as we have seen, is joined to our spirit. Since the heavenly tabernacle is joined to our spirit, the heavenly Minister of the better covenant is also joined to our spirit. Right now the heavenly Minister is doing His duty of ministering under the better covenant. This is the central thought here: the heavenly Minister doing His ministry in the heavenly tabernacle under the new covenant. This new covenant, which is called the better covenant, has been consummated upon the better promises, the promises found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97890" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:1">Jeremiah 31</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="D0hW7peMyKatW3Yyp1pjQ3K1lmZR3tlI4jM_n3qZwVMLHLzSUtNKlGG2jUwn-109y"> The contents of the better covenant include four items: the imparting of the law of life into our being; having God as our God and being His people; the inward ability to know the Lord; and the propitiation for unrighteousnesses and the forgiveness of sins. All of these four items are focused on the law of life. In this message we need to see what the law of life is. </p>
<p data-content-id="SX28q2m5JZZaou8YzwMxmnfhlV-9-jFM-0R967a0R103rK0Jy6qGdc5kFkKIhC-VV"> Before we can see what the law of life is, we must consider some other things that are the necessary background for our seeing this. Throughout the years we have repeatedly mentioned one central point: that God’s eternal purpose is to dispense Himself into us in order to make us His living expression. God has done this. Although certain negative things, such as Satan and sin, have come in, these have all become past history because of the all-inclusive crucifixion of Christ. The all-inclusive Christ has terminated all the negative things by His all-inclusive crucifixion. Thus, Satan and sin are a history. Very few Christians today realize that these things are histories. They think that these things are still entangling and bothering them. But that is a lie—these negative things are a history. When we all get into the New Jerusalem, we shall laugh at Satan and say, “Satan, now I know that you are just a history. As far as I am concerned, <span class="pg" data-page-id="417" id="417">[417]</span> you are nothing. I am in a new region, in the new realm of the new heaven and new earth. Satan, I am in the New Jerusalem, and you are a history.” What has made all of these things a history? The all-inclusive crucifixion of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="gGi1krUjO5_vgHIvZGO24qFuu0ABZa_k8hB0IkA8RvqDpYwLHDRb1TMHp4sIipHHx"> Our new birth, our regeneration, is also a history. We were regenerated nineteen and a half centuries ago when Christ was raised from the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97891" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). According to your feeling, you were reborn some years ago, but according to God’s divine point of view, you were reborn nineteen and a half centuries ago. Since we were reborn when Christ was resurrected from the dead, our rebirth is a history. When we were regenerated, the inward ability to know God was imparted into us. This also occurred nineteen and a half centuries ago. All of these items have become accomplished facts that have been bequeathed to us as our bequests. If our eyes have been opened, we shall not need to pray but simply say, “Lord, thank You for Your bequests. Thank You for Your will. I just take it, receive it, and enjoy it.” </p>
<p data-content-id="LsMUGHoOAyglcgXHKOT_4MgP8CewBBYWGd_3K1-drcYapSz78FtH6UNrSlSq3kKsG"> If we see that the New Testament is actually a testament, a will, we shall preach the gospel in the highest way. We would speak to people in this way, saying, “Friends, here is a testament, a will. It is Jesus Christ’s will. This will says that many bequests are yours. One bequest is that all of your sins have been taken away by Him. Before you even committed your sins, they were already forgiven by God and put away. Another bequest is that before you were born of your parents, nineteen and a half centuries ago you were reborn, and the divine life was imparted into you. It does not matter whether you understand this or not. All you need to do is receive the will and thank the Lord. Say, ‘Thank You, Lord, for the will and for all the bequests. Thank You, Lord, for the forgiveness of sins and for regeneration.’” The more the newly saved ones thank the Lord for His testament, for the forgiveness of sins, for their regeneration, and for all the other bequests, the more anointing they will have and the more riches of life they will possess. This is the highest preaching of the gospel. In order to preach the gospel in this way, we need to have a clear view of the testament and we <span class="pg" data-page-id="418" id="418">[418]</span> need the power of the Spirit with the anointing. When we preach the gospel in such a high way, people will not reject it. They will be happy to receive it and say, “Praise the Lord! Thank You, Lord, for all these bequests.” If a poor sinner would do this, he would immediately become a millionaire. I expect that one day we shall see this kind of high preaching of the gospel. </p>

THE ORIGIN OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="Z-QbeF7eFSCsrR20PWwNAm9XkcdizFUNBnmIQqNZgJ_0WMRdgwQ1A7MTTYXlofxbP"> Now we come to the law of life. The focus of the heavenly tabernacle, the heavenly Minister, the more excellent ministry, the better covenant, and the better promises is on the law of life. What is the origin of the law of life? The origin of the law of life is life. Then what is life? Life is just God Himself. When God is expressed, He is the Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97892" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">1:3a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97893" data-verses="Hebrews 1:8">8a</span>). When the Son, who is God Himself, is realized as the Spirit, He is life to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97894" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17a</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97895" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). Life is God in Christ as the Spirit coming into our being. Thus, the Spirit is called the Spirit of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97896" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>), which is the eternal and divine life. Out of this life, the law of life comes through the regeneration of the Spirit of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97897" data-verses="John 3:5-6">John 3:5-6</span>). When we were regenerated by the Spirit of life, the eternal and divine life was imparted into us, out of which the law of life comes to exist in our inward being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCZqpPrpu2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q">II. THE DEFINITION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssDQjSpEHgzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr"> What is the law of life? A law is a natural regulation, a constant and unchanging rule. A law of life is the natural characteristic, the innate, automatic function of a certain kind of life, and the higher a life is, the higher is its law. The law of the divine life is then the natural characteristic, the innate, automatic function of the life of God, and since the life of God is the highest, its law is the highest. This highest law of life is the function, the working, of the divine life. This function and working are innate, spontaneous, natural, and automatic. </p>

<p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzeJrhprCFUylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> God’s eternal purpose is to work Himself into us and make us the same as His Firstborn Son. The Firstborn Son of God is the standard model for God’s economy. This standard model has both divinity and humanity. Originally, He was the Only Begotten Son of God. As the Only Begotten Son of God, He was the embodiment of God, for all that is in the Godhead was embodied in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97909" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). He was also the expression of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97910" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Heb. 1:3</span>). As the embodiment and expression of God, He became incarnated, bringing divinity into humanity and joining humanity to divinity. But before the incarnation, divinity had never been joined to humanity. Since the day of His incarnation, there was in this universe a wonderful Person who was both human and divine. </p>
<p data-content-id="MIJlxkLQwGUFWpXbCXJwFt1p0OlJswqiU3Ejc76p9XUT9kubZPaV9POS3G28RP-sM"> The Lord Jesus lived on earth for thirty three and a half years. On some occasions He exercised His divinity, but most of the time He lived out His humanity. People mostly saw Him as a man, as a proper, perfect, and extraordinary man. His extraordinary quality was His divinity. One day, He went to the cross to put away sin. At the same time, He destroyed Satan, the source of sin. As the Lord destroyed sin and Satan, He tasted death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97911" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9">Heb. 2:9</span>), and by tasting death He swallowed it. Through the Lord’s all-inclusive death, every negative thing in the whole universe, including sin, Satan, and death, was terminated and made a history. After His crucifixion, the Lord rested for three days. According to the Bible, while He was resting in the grave, He took a tour of Hades, offering it the opportunity to do everything to Him and proving that it could do nothing with Him. After His <span class="pg" data-page-id="428" id="428">[428]</span> rest and His tour, He walked out of Hades and arose from the tomb, coming forth in His resurrection. By His resurrection, He was born with His humanity into the divine sonship and became the Firstborn Son of God. The most striking thing about Christ as the Firstborn Son of God is that with Him all the negative things, including sin, Satan, and death, have become a history. He is a person who has divinity mingled with an uplifted humanity and who has humanity that is one with divinity. Ultimately, He entered into glory, even into glorification. Being in glorification is superior to being in glory, because being in glory does not require a process, whereas being in glorification does. The Lord Jesus, as the Firstborn Son of God, has passed through a process to enter into glory. That was His glorification. </p>
<p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-kaKYEW2zlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> As the Only Begotten Son, Christ was already in glory. That did not require glorification. However, once He was on earth in His humanity, He needed to be glorified. Therefore, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97912" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17:1</span> reveals, during the last night of His life on earth, He prayed, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You” (Recovery Version). Since He was already in glory, why did He still need to be glorified? Although He was in glory as the Only Begotten Son, since He had put on humanity, the human part of His being had to be glorified, to be processed into glory. In His resurrection Christ entered into His glorification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97913" data-verses="Luke 24:26">Luke 24:26</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="iP_bgkHD-VyM-lbYNnOmkuoNjl-wBR5Dynf2bHQ8WpjrkRIRPrECHRAQWFcx0WQUb"> Few Christians realize that ultimately in the New Testament the word perfection means glorification. Regardless how perfect you may be, if you have not been glorified, you are still not adequate. The book of Romans reveals that in the economy of God we have firstly justification, then sanctification, and finally glorification. Romans does not mention perfection. Both glorification and perfection, however, are found in Hebrews. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97914" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9-10">Hebrews 2:9-10</span>, which says that Christ, the Captain of our salvation, has been crowned with glory, refers to both perfection and glorification. His perfection was His glorification, the very glorification revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97915" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97916" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, the last step of God’s salvation is to glorify us, and according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97917" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2</span>, it is <span class="pg" data-page-id="429" id="429">[429]</span> through the Captain of our salvation that we are being brought into glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="19J7BMpUdAP-KQCUvDLChXz_Y2_Zvr1TF44VGLYr0Wq30Cf62POCZtTmD67IMB8WQ"> On the throne, as well as in our spirit, there is a glorified Man, a Man who has been fully perfected. Some saints, such as John Wesley and those with him, practiced what is called sinless perfection. According to the concept of sinless perfection, if you do not lie or lose your temper but love others and are humble, you have attained perfection. But this is a very low concept of perfection. I would ask you to compare this with the perfection of the glorified Jesus. The perfection of the glorified Jesus is that of divinity mingled with a humanity that has been tested, resurrected, uplifted, and glorified. </p>
<p data-content-id="4reRc8xEUdB8gspB5LzSTHY2TNhcoBqXNha6kcLoR0GcevFpPwoI5sDlLglcpJmid"> At this point I want to introduce a new word—sonized. After passing through all the tests and after being resurrected and uplifted, the humanity of Jesus was “sonized.” This means that it was brought into the divine sonship. Although Christ was the Son of God, before His resurrection He was clothed with humanity, which was unrelated to that sonship. One day, He brought this humanity into, through, and out of death, and it was resurrected by the power of the divine life according to the Spirit of holiness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97918" data-verses="Romans 1:4">Rom. 1:4</span>). Through this process, His humanity was sonized into God’s divine sonship. Thus, with His resurrected and uplifted humanity He was born in resurrection as the Firstborn Son of God. This is the meaning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97919" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>: “God...hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second Psalm, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.” </p>
<p data-content-id="o8J_Xe_Oo1DTEOu7_yttykPkmvNr4zswpHSO-jDOTVFBVk47Q4_e4i6jscHWlhJOs"> Such a sonized One is now the standard model. This standard model has attained perfection—a perfection with divinity, with an uplifted humanity, and with all negative things having become a history. We need to lift up our eyes and gaze at this standard model. As we look at Him, we behold His divinity and His sonized humanity. All the negative things are now on the other side of the river and have become a history. But the standard model is in glorification and exaltation on the golden side of the river, where there is no sin, death, Satan, or any other negative thing. Now there is a Man in the glory, a Man in perfection. What kind <span class="pg" data-page-id="430" id="430">[430]</span> of perfection can compare with this? The so-called sinless perfection is in the basement, while this glorious perfection is in the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kUaZWif4GddJ6x0-mt9QeJ_7mBfG_163rGTsaQ8Mae1t0n_om2qIm8zuQfDDDM9E"> What is perfection? Perfection is glorification. In this perfection is the Man who has divinity, who has a humanity that has been sonized as the Firstborn Son of God, and who is now in His glorification. With Him, all the negative things are a history, having been left on the other side of the river. This is perfection and this is glorification. In the New Testament, glorification is the equivalent of perfection. Christ, the standard model, is now in such a perfection, and we are on the way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GZ-Xs1QsCoQof4c8ULP1C_DxChMb8E7KkBAeRYnN9vmNPkf2OrDQ2hBVPHBKl6cA3">II. THE PRODUCTION OF THE MANY SONS OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="ce50k8tQiJj2hm-zVHrfE2AS5_8sx9bxTn4PDYyUCKmXbgGgJ_N3tdzwHbUeZPInF"> When this standard model was resurrected, being born in His humanity to be the Firstborn Son of God, He included us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97920" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). When He was sonized in His humanity, in His resurrection, we were born as sons of God. We need to forget time. There is no clock in heaven, and there will be no watches in eternity. Although we may not be able to understand this, we should simply accept it. According to the pure word of the Holy Bible, when Christ was resurrected, He imparted Himself into us as life, and we were reborn. After imparting Himself into us as life, Christ entered into perfection, into glory, where He is now interceding for our glorification. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyC8mahA7CZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH"> Christ is interceding for us to be saved to the uttermost. Although I have heard many messages saying that Christ is interceding for us, I have not heard one message which said that Christ is interceding for us to be brought into perfection. Many pastors use <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97921" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Romans 8:34</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97922" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span> concerning Christ’s interceding to comfort those who are in difficulty. But Christ is not interceding merely for us to have comfort. Such a concept of His intercession is too low. Christ is interceding for us to be glorified and to be saved into His perfection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Exk_X4ZwoNzpPcXz877bNmTOlNfhZJx0Y8sYmtn5wXIbTlFsXe1YOEcisvE2Ef8z5"> What does it mean to be brought into Christ’s perfection? It is to eliminate all the by-products of death, to swallow up <span class="pg" data-page-id="431" id="431">[431]</span> all vanity, corruption, groaning, and decay. Christ is interceding that this work may be accomplished. His intercession on the throne motivates the life seed that He sowed into us at the time of His resurrection. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97930" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1-3">9:1-3</span> we see that there were two tabernacles. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97931" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">Hebrews 9:1</span> says, “Then indeed the first covenant has ordinances of service, and its sanctuary, a sanctuary of this world.” The sanctuary here is the entire tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97932" data-verses="Exodus 25:8-9">Exo. 25:8-9</span>), including the first tabernacle which is called the Holy Place (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97933" data-verses="Hebrews 9:2">v. 2</span>) and the second tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97934" data-verses="Hebrews 9:3">v. 3</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97935" data-verses="Hebrews 9:2">Verse 2</span> says, “For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which were both the lampstand and the table and the loaves set forth, which is called the Holy Place.” When I read this verse in the past, I was bothered. According to the knowledge that I had of Exodus, there was only one tabernacle. If there was only one tabernacle, how then could this verse speak of “the first”? By the term “Holy Place” in this verse we can understand that the first tabernacle was that part of the unique tabernacle which was called the Holy Place. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97936" data-verses="Hebrews 9:3">Verse 3</span> says, “And after the second veil, a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies.” The Holy of Holies was the second tabernacle. Hence, we have the first tabernacle, the Holy Place, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="R5BCjovp4r6zbRLEWObeytR1WOX_7Qf8QksznRcMh7dobccpo28CQJWJRDpQH5rrM"> These two tabernacles are symbols of two covenants. The Holy Place is a symbol of the old covenant and the Holy of Holies a symbol of the new covenant. Although it is difficult to realize the true significance of these covenants, it is easy to understand them if we consider the tabernacle. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97937" data-verses="Hebrews 9:2">9:2</span>, in the Holy Place, the symbol of the old <span class="pg" data-page-id="436" id="436">[436]</span> covenant, there were the lampstand and the table. These two things were good, but they were far off from God’s presence. Although a person could find nourishment at the table and enlightenment at the lampstand, he had no way to contact God. In the Holy Place there was neither God’s presence nor the way to come into His presence. Moreover, in the Holy Place there was no oracle, no place for the divine speaking of God. Where there is the oracle, there is God’s speaking. But in the Holy Place there was no divine speaking. Furthermore, there was no meeting with God in the Holy Place. The highest blessing is to meet with God. However, no one in the Holy Place could say that there he was meeting with God, for there was no way to meet Him in the Holy Place. Therefore, with respect to the Holy Place, there were four no’s: no presence of God, no way to contact God, no oracle for the speaking of God, and no meeting with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="smQkdlepcUj2tnXbV2UxyKMQEE7gpeQPNsDo0T9aLCfvZuZlwoPT8L125acok8hfa"> This is a true picture of today’s religion. When you were in the denominations, did you have either the presence of God or the way to come into His presence? Did you have the oracle where there was the divine speaking? Although there was a pulpit and the speaking of a theologian, there was no oracle with the divine speaking. Then how about meeting with God? Although the Holy Place is good and in it we may have nourishment and enlightenment, there is no presence of God, no way to come into His presence, no divine speaking, and no meeting with God. How pitiful! </p>
<p data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPfOxpLqcwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm"> We need to remember that the book of Hebrews was written to the Hebrew Christians who were staggering in the Holy Place. They were uncertain whether to come forward to the Holy of Holies or to shrink back from the Holy Place to the outer court. This means that they were on the border between the old covenant and the new covenant. The writer of Hebrews was marvelous and full of patience; he did not write superficially but in a very deep way. His writing was so deep that during the past nineteen centuries most of his readers have not fully realized what he said. </p>
<p data-content-id="LsMUGHoOAyglcgXHKOT_4PAP1Q-wBBYWGd_3K1-drcYapSz78FtH6UNrSlSq3kKsG"> We have seen that the Holy of Holies signified the new covenant. What was in the Holy of Holies? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97938" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Hebrews 9:4 </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="437" id="437">[437]</span> speaks of the Holy of Holies as “having a golden altar.” The golden altar, which was the incense altar, was not in the Holy of Holies, but it belonged to the Holy of Holies. Notice that it does not say that the incense altar was in the Holy of Holies, but that the Holy of Holies had the incense altar. What is the function of the incense altar? It provides the way to come into God’s presence. The incense altar signifies the proper prayer with Christ in resurrection as the incense for our acceptance. Hence, it is the entrance into God’s presence. When I was in religion as a youth, I was taught to pray, “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.” Although we prayed a great deal in that way, we never entered into the Holy of Holies. Actually, the more we prayed in that way, the more we remained in the outer court, or even outside the outer court. That is not the experience of the incense altar. When we pray in the Lord’s name with Him as the fragrant resurrection frankincense, we immediately enter into the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6BQ1FjM6XM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97939" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">9:4</span> we see that in the Holy of Holies was also “the ark of the covenant covered round in every part with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant.” Above the ark were “cherubim of glory overshadowing the propitiation-cover” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="97940" data-verses="Hebrews 9:5">v. 5</span>). Here in the Holy of Holies we not only have the entrance into God’s presence but God’s presence itself. Over the ark was the lid called the propitiation-cover, which was the place of the divine oracle of God’s speaking. It is here that we have God’s speaking. It is here that we meet with God and have fellowship and communion with Him. This is the new covenant symbolized by the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="pnhep-1swI5hHB5N847IZSpHSDDODfkFej5Ckh2HbQV2ZFXVzDLdqnlvjBn5DFN_h"> We all need to consider where we are. Are we Christians in a place where there is some amount of nourishment and enlightenment but no entrance into God’s presence, no presence of God, no speaking of God, and no way to meet with God? Are we in that place or in the place where it is so easy to come into God’s presence, have His speaking, and meet and have fellowship with Him? If you are in this place, then you are in the Holy of Holies. <span class="pg" data-page-id="438" id="438">[438]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGE-8vdXgsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_"> The two tabernacles are not only symbols of two covenants but also types of two ages, two dispensations—the old testament dispensation and the new testament dispensation. If you are in the Holy Place, it means that you are in the old age, in the old dispensation. If you are in the Holy of Holies, then you are in the new age, in the new dispensation. At this point we need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97941" data-verses="Hebrews 9:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span>. “The Holy Spirit showing by this, that the way of the Holy of Holies has not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing; which is a figure for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which, as to the conscience, are unable to perfect him who serves.” The word “which” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97942" data-verses="Hebrews 9:9">verse 9</span> refers to the tabernacle mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97943" data-verses="Hebrews 9:8">verse 8</span>. This tabernacle was a “figure for the present time,” a type of an age, a dispensation. The “present time” means the new testament age, not the old testament age then present as indicated by the words “then present” in the King James translation. There are different translations of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="97944" data-verses="Hebrews 9:9">verse 9</span>. Some render “the time then present” for “the present time,” considering that this refers to the old testament age. But according to the Greek, the tabernacle is “a figure of the present time,” which is the new testament age. By this one verse we are certain that the Holy Place was a type of an age. In this principle, the Holy of Holies must also be a symbol of an age. </p>

Many Christians think that we can only experience Christ as our Savior and Protector. According to those who have had Pentecostal experiences, Christ is a Healer and a Worker of miracles. To them, experiencing Christ is a matter of witnessing miracles. But Christ is altogether mysterious, and our experiences of Him are also mysterious and very difficult to define. Thank God that this is clearly portrayed in His Holy Word by the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle, His dwelling place. This arrangement is of three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. In each section there was furniture. Many Bible teachers agree that the entire tabernacle with its contents is a detailed picture of Christ. When I studied the typology of the tabernacle as a youth, I was told that it was a picture of Christ, but I was never taught that it was also a portrait of our experiences of Christ. Gradually in my experience throughout the years, I came to realize that the arrangement of the furniture of the tabernacle presents a full definition of our experiences of Christ. In this message we are not concerned with learning typology which was emphasized by the Brethren teachers more than a century ago. The recovery today is not a recovery of the teachings of typology but a recovery of the experiences of Christ as portrayed in the types. We need to enter into the experiences of Christ as <span class="pg" data-page-id="448" id="448">[448]</span> shown in the arrangement of the furniture in God’s dwelling place. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-7psJDqorOUFFwhmtN2Mfis-KRc6BT4LW0n2K-L9dRY0OI1PJD-NzRXLSV8ZtC8nS">I. IN THE OUTER COURT—IN AN OUTWARD WAY</h2><p data-content-id="pnhep-1swI5hHB5N847IeQ5HVRjODfkFej5Ckh2HbQV2ZFXVzDLdqnlvjBn5DFN_h"> In the outer court are the brass altar and the brass laver. Both of these signify the experiences of Christ in an outward way. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGD8svbFQsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_">A. At the Brass Altar</h2><p data-content-id="W1iZtRdq2EaOvu-m8SfI7jKyXQ9_rOlrXR3fm3GUzcPU0O7qbBBiKxEFUeCJG_ERL"> At the brass altar, which signifies the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98009" data-verses="Exodus 40:29">Exo. 40:29</span>), we participate in Christ mainly as our sin offering and also as all the other offerings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98010" data-verses="Hebrews 13:10">Heb. 13:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98011" data-verses="Hebrews 13:12">12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98012" data-verses="Hebrews 10:12">10:12</span>). In principle, the offerings solve our problems with God, fully reconciling us to Him and making our situation with God righteous and peaceful. Through the cross of Christ, we are right with God and with one another. Christ as our sin offering has solved the problem of sin, and as our peace offering He has also made peace between us and God and with one another. Thus, through the offerings offered by Christ on the cross, our condition is one of righteousness and peace. This is the first experience that we enjoy in Christ outwardly. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2p-Clb9asquxf4mQ9n64h4lNyfz_IFbKGR1gkxbP1RjXC1oK7CumV6zeFKsjKYYc6">B. At the Brass Laver</h2><p data-content-id="SX28q2m5JZZaou8YzwMxhmvhsHe9-jFM-0R967a0R103rK0Jy6qGdc5kFkKIhC-VV"> After the altar is the laver, which signifies the washing of the Spirit. Both the altar and the laver were made of brass. In typology, brass signifies God’s righteous judgment. The washing of the Spirit is based upon the judgment Christ has borne for us. At the brass laver (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98013" data-verses="Exodus 40:30-32">Exo. 40:30-32</span>) we partake of the washing of the Spirit, which is based upon the redemption of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98014" data-verses="Titus 3:5">Titus 3:5</span>). Although we have experienced Christ as the offerings, before we can come into God’s presence we also need to be washed, cleansed by the Spirit. This also is somewhat outward. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gGi1krUjO5_vgHIvZGO2_r1ummwBZa_k8hB0IkA8RvqDpYwLHDRb1TMHp4sIipHHx">II. IN THE HOLY PLACE—IN AN INNER WAY</h2><p data-content-id="eQJD4_jtknWQat9jcVOn-Wht8fNYK_r5XUDNpcDDJV6S5IySpcJb2P-RieMVJy8R6"> After having the two kinds of experiences in the outer court, we are qualified to come into the tabernacle. Firstly, we enter into the Holy Place, where our experiences of <span class="pg" data-page-id="449" id="449">[449]</span> Christ turn from the outward to the inward. Here, in the Holy Place, we experience Christ in an inner way. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="59tq157xwce1XvZTZYWAEF6t1AqAdhVzhWKgIad9yUQA9xO1kuO2-Z98Caw01EdMR">A. At the Showbread Table</h2><p data-content-id="Nra_GgDpimpsPAo0RrC1fObHexU642dTAWC_1CYoST56PQUyLyIACiL2qjOnKIM8F"> When we enter into the Holy Place, the first item of furniture is the showbread table (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98015" data-verses="Exodus 40:22-23">Exo. 40:22-23</span>), which signifies Christ as our life supply (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98016" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98017" data-verses="John 6:57">57</span>). On the showbread table twelve loaves of bread were displayed. The number twelve signifies eternal completion and perfection. Christ is our eternal bread. Our inward enjoyment of Him at the showbread table is eternal. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCD77KOmvQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv">B. At the Lampstand</h2><p data-content-id="hZwxam6lXwmH0E7Nl83pdkyEtKda-ocuqHw2FtYp_6HHqSCdwcI5BmEdEnDTEQuNB"> After the showbread table is the lampstand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98018" data-verses="Exodus 40:24-25">Exo. 40:24-25</span>), where we experience Christ as the shining light of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98019" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98020" data-verses="John 8:12">8:12</span>). That the experience of the lampstand follows the experience of the showbread table indicates that the light comes out of our enjoyment of Christ as our life supply. When we enjoy Christ as our food, we have light because the “life is the light of men” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98021" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span>). This light does not come from knowledge but from the life we enjoy. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzeOphpvRVUylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> While the showbread table has twelve loaves of bread, the lampstand has seven lamps. Seven is also a number of completion, but it is not the number of eternal completion. It is the number of completion in God’s dispensational move, denoting a completion in God’s movement. For eternity we shall have the life supply, but the purpose of the lampstand is to enable God’s people to move and act in the dark age. It is for God’s dispensational move. In His economy and dispensation, God has His movement and action, which need the shining of the divine light. This shining is complete. Without the shining of the light we cannot move or do anything in God’s economy. As we enjoy Christ as our life, this life becomes the light by which we move and act in God’s economy. Our experience proves this. Firstly, we enjoy Christ as life and as the life supply. Then this life shines within us, and we know how to move and act. This is the experience of Christ as light inwardly. <span class="pg" data-page-id="450" id="450">[450]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="MIJlxkLQwGUFWpXbCXJwCv1pzeFJswqiU3Ejc76p9XUT9kubZPaV9POS3G28RP-sM">C. At the Incense Altar</h2><p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-jYKYCGGzlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> The last item of furniture in the Holy Place is the golden altar, which is the incense altar. The incense altar, lampstand, and showbread table form a triangle. The showbread table was on the north, the lampstand on the south, and the incense altar between them on the west, very close to the separating veil. At the incense altar we share in Christ as the sweet incense toward God for our acceptance by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98022" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6">Eph. 1:6</span>). God accepts us because of Christ, not because of what we are. This is why we must pray to God in the name of Christ. If we pray in, by, and with ourselves, our prayer will never be accepted. Christ as the acceptable, sweet incense must be added to our prayer. Our prayer is like a censer, and Christ is like the fragrant incense that is put into the censer. When we pray in and with Christ, Christ as incense is mingled with our prayer as it ascends to God. This incense becomes the element that makes our being and our prayer acceptable to God. This experience is more inward, leading to the most inward experiences in the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="iP_bgkHD-VyM-lbYNnOmjsoNp3ewBR5Dynf2bHQ8WpjrkRIRPrECHRAQWFcx0WQUb"> Although the incense altar is not in the Holy of Holies, it directs and leads us into the Holy of Holies. It is in the Holy Place, but its function is for the Holy of Holies. Hence, it is more inward than both the showbread table and the lampstand. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="H4ftD0nM_HqTnTBTZI6vh_LDeR-OM11qPJmRIviZqwZm5FkPIartulj8dlWnhx9NX">THE NEW COVENANT<br/>AND THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><p data-content-id="XAU_tcFqOKo9rmOP3ZbnS0uSWbnirXynnH0CT7HqmYcBXJkMfDQnpAZCXXL7WbCkY"> In this message we shall cover two important matters—the new covenant and the new testament. In Greek the same word is used for both covenant and testament. Whether it is translated covenant or testament depends on whether the person who consummated the covenant is living or dead. If the consummator is still living, that covenant remains a covenant. But if the consummator has died, the covenant immediately becomes a testament. A covenant is an agreement containing some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will containing certain accomplished things bequeathed to the inheritor. The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant, but a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us. The term testament is the equivalent of the modern term will. Many parents, when they know that they soon will die, make a will in which they leave various things to their children. A will only becomes effective after the death of the maker of the will. In a simple word, a covenant and a testament are the same, but when the maker of the covenant is living, it is a covenant, and when he has died, it is a testament, a will. The Bible is composed of two wills—the Old Testament, the old will, and the New Testament, the new will. The Bible is not mainly a book of teachings; it is a will. <span class="pg" data-page-id="462" id="462">[462]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="z7nP6wvdoRcXW7_4yqTmnVUP9mq7mFR7fpfSTniJz1DC07eXfxsSNj_pn0tdjMZNa"> The new covenant, which the Lord Jesus enacted, is better than the old covenant made through Moses. In the old covenant, all things were shadows, whereas in the new covenant everything is reality. Everything in the old covenant has been fulfilled and realized in the new covenant. Hence, the new covenant is a better covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98056" data-verses="Hebrews 7:22">7:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98057" data-verses="Hebrews 8:6">8:6</span>). </p>

Enacted upon Better Promises</h2><p data-content-id="bL3_vIKwgozM1X2VsKZqB2wLdUEmDEIoUOwwkTFE2jCXoezsRLTSk_IdHBfxVvI3_"> The new covenant is enacted upon better promises (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98058" data-verses="Hebrews 8:6">8:6</span>), which were given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98059" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</span>. In these better promises, as we have seen in previous messages, four major things are covered—the inward law of life, the blessing of God being our God and us being God’s people, the inward ability of knowing the Lord, and the forgiveness of sins. Among these four major things, the inward law of life is the focus. The old covenant was made with the outward law of letters, whereas the new covenant is enacted with this inward law of life. The old covenant was of letters; the new covenant is of life. </p>

That was a figure showing that the heavenly things needed to be purified by the blood of better sacrifices, which are the sacrifices of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98062" data-verses="Hebrews 7:27">7:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98063" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">9:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98064" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98065" data-verses="Hebrews 10:10">10:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98066" data-verses="Hebrews 10:12">12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98067" data-verses="Hebrews 10:14">14</span>). Heaven and all things in heaven have been defiled by the rebellion of Satan and the fallen angels who followed him in his rebellion against God. Thus, all the heavenly things needed to be purified. Christ accomplished this <span class="pg" data-page-id="463" id="463">[463]</span> purification with His own blood when He entered into heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98068" data-verses="Hebrews 9:12">9:12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="J1JYlwCOelExNYExkRji-ynkcMJ67hWsK8o7BCO9o5g1KcqitJI9Vxej8NhnohsR2"> The new covenant was consummated with better sacrifices and with the blood that speaks better things. Christ offered Himself as one sacrifice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98069" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">9:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98070" data-verses="Hebrews 10:12">10:12</span>). This one sacrifice, viewed from its various aspects, may be considered as many sacrifices. As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man who offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices are better than those of animals. The animal sacrifices were shadows which could never take away sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98071" data-verses="Hebrews 10:11">10:11</span>), but His sacrifices are real and have put away sin once for all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98072" data-verses="Hebrews 9:26">9:26</span>), thus finding an eternal redemption for us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98073" data-verses="Hebrews 9:12">9:12</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98074" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Verse 22</span> says that “without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.” Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God’s righteousness that by it the covenant may be enacted. But Christ’s blood has been shed for the forgiveness of sin, and the covenant has been enacted with His blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98075" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">Matt. 26:28</span>). We are told in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98076" data-verses="Hebrews 12:24">12:24</span> that Christ’s blood “speaks better than that of Abel.” The blood of Christ is the speaking blood, speaking to God for forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, and redemption. As unveiled in Hebrews, this precious blood speaks to God for us that by it the new covenant may be enacted. Hence, it is called the blood of the eternal covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98077" data-verses="Hebrews 10:29">10:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98078" data-verses="Hebrews 13:20">13:20</span>). </p>

But the new testament has a High Priest who is the eternal Son of God with a more excellent ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98079" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1-13">8:1-13</span>). With Him there is no preventing of death. His ministry is the ministry of the kingly and divine priesthood in heaven, ministering, by His intercession, the divine life with all its riches as our daily supply to bring us into His perfection and glorification. <span class="pg" data-page-id="464" id="464">[464]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="ypPAS58zX4Yp4txU9VRAX6uABESToz5xsxInBUpzhFwkU2SoOph-gkqdH4Klv2TIx"> God’s promise is God’s word which He speaks. God speaks many different kinds of words. He may command us to do a particular thing. That command is God’s word, but it is not God’s promise. When God speaks in such a way that He promises to give, do, or be something to us, that is a promise. As we have seen, God’s promise of the new covenant is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98080" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</span> and includes four major things. The word of God’s promise is insured by His faithfulness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98081" data-verses="Hebrews 10:23">Heb. 10:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98082" data-verses="Hebrews 11:11">11:11</span>). God’s faithfulness is the guarantee of what He speaks as a promise. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LHCsRH9pwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR">B. God’s Covenant</h2><p data-content-id="0LzTaf-UCCdfAz45OTRuefRTMlpWe9bD9g-xeDycbaQml7QnmCMyvs8NwZmgFWFwe"> God’s covenant is enacted upon God’s promise (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98083" data-verses="Hebrews 8:6">8:6</span>). A promise is a common, ordinary word without confirmation. In the Bible, after God made His promise, He sealed it with an oath. He swore by His Godhead that His promise was confirmed. Once His promise was confirmed by an oath, it immediately became the covenant sealed by God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98084" data-verses="Hebrews 6:16">Hebrews 6:16</span> says that in all disputes an oath is final for confirmation. If you read the Old Testament carefully, you will see that God’s promises were all sealed by His oath. That the promises have become a covenant means that they cannot possibly be altered. Once the promises have been confirmed by God’s oath, having been made unalterable, there is no possibility of repentance or change. The promise has been sealed; it is no longer a promise but a covenant confirmed by God’s oath. </p>
<p data-content-id="7jd7JxYu3HksSKr4QbwSi5qEOVVlrkuZWozXhPoomFiFg9DTFF4MA6D0nrSqDBm76"> After God made His promises in the Old Testament, confirming them by His oath (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98085" data-verses="Genesis 22:16-18">Gen. 22:16-18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98086" data-verses="Psalms 110:4">Psa. 110:4</span>), the Lord Jesus came and accomplished all that God had promised. By the Lord’s work on earth, every item of God’s promise has become an accomplished fact. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98087" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:1">Jeremiah 31</span> God promised to forgive our sins. The Lord Jesus did this, making propitiation for our sins on the cross as the fulfillment of God’s promise. Before the Lord Jesus <span class="pg" data-page-id="465" id="465">[465]</span> died on the cross, it was a promise. After He died on the cross, that promised item became an accomplished fact. Hence, forgiveness of sins is no longer a promise but an accomplished fact of history. God’s promised covenant was consummated as the new covenant by the Lord’s death with His blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98088" data-verses="Hebrews 9:18-23">9:18-23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98089" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">Matt. 26:28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98090" data-verses="Luke 22:20">Luke 22:20</span>). By His death, all the promises have become accomplished facts. </p>
<p data-content-id="_e_6LkqX4ESYXvpCAEx2-rLDqtrfnFOOjmtosmeLh6BrByUxfmVVcsvBL-SDunVSX"> After His death and resurrection, the Lord ascended into the heavens, leaving with us the covenant which He had accomplished by His death. When He left this covenant with us, it immediately became a testament, a new testament bequeathed to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98091" data-verses="Hebrews 9:16-17">9:16-17</span>). In this testament the accomplished facts are no longer merely facts; they have all become bequests. Firstly, we had the promises; secondly, the promises became the facts; and thirdly, the facts have become the bequests. Through the Lord’s death and resurrection, all the promises were fulfilled and became accomplished facts. After the Lord had left this new covenant with us, it immediately became a testament, a will, containing all the accomplished facts as our bequests. Since the Lord had accomplished everything, He went to the heavenly throne where He is now restfully sitting. As our High Priest in the heavens, the Lord is the Surety of this better covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98092" data-verses="Hebrews 7:21-22">7:21-22</span>). </p>

I thank God that, under His sovereignty, there was such a group of staggering Hebrew Christians in the first century. Without them, the book of Hebrews probably never would have come into existence. Do not think that the book of Hebrews was only for them. We need this book today much more than they needed it in their time. In the past eleven messages we have been on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98100" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">chapters seven</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98101" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1">eight</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98102" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">nine</span>. If I were to ask you to write a conclusion to these chapters, you may find it quite difficult. But at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98103" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">chapter nine</span> the book of Hebrews itself gives us a summary, a conclusion, of these three chapters. This conclusion is the very matter which we shall cover in this message—Christ’s two manifestations and the interval between them. These three things, Christ’s two manifestations and the interval, compose God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="_e_6LkqX4ESYXvpCAEx2-r7Dt_bfnFOOjmtosmeLh6BrByUxfmVVcsvBL-SDunVSX"> It has been difficult for many Christians to understand the true significance of Christ’s two manifestations. The two manifestations of Christ refer to His two comings. Christ has come once and He will come again. During the long period between the two manifestations of Christ to the world, He remains in the presence of God. Nearly two thousand years have passed since Christ’s first manifestation. Although this is a long time as far as we are concerned, to Him it is less than two days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98104" data-verses="2Peter 3:8">2 Pet. 3:8</span>). We need to see the significance of the two manifestations of Christ and the interval between them. </p>
<p data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0IloZLOtUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW"> Before Christ’s first manifestation, there were God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="472" id="472">[472]</span> plan, God’s promise, and a type, a picture, of God’s economy, but besides God’s creation nothing had been accomplished. When we build a meeting hall, we also may have a plan and a model of the building. However, simply having these things does not mean that there is an actual building. Before Christ’s incarnation, men like Abraham, Moses, and David had come and gone, but nothing had been accomplished for God’s economy. Although there was the model of the tabernacle with Moses and of the temple with Solomon, nothing real was accomplished until the first manifestation of Christ. </p>

Christ “was foreordained” for us “before the foundation of the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98107" data-verses="1Peter 1:20">1 Pet. 1:20</span>), and He was “slain from the foundation of the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98108" data-verses="Revelation 13:8">Rev. 13:8</span>). Actually, His being slain transpired once for all at the consummation of the ages, when He offered Himself to God in His first manifestation for the putting away of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-jYqYCEGzlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> Christ put away sin about nineteen and a half centuries ago. Before He accomplished this, the priests offered the sin offering day after day. But that was not the actual <span class="pg" data-page-id="473" id="473">[473]</span> putting away of sin; it was only a type, a picture. The real putting away of sin was accomplished once for all by Christ on the cross. Perhaps you were born just twenty or thirty years ago, and during your lifetime you have committed many sins, such as stealing and lying. But the putting away of sin was accomplished nineteen and a half centuries ago, long before you committed any sins. Hence, the putting away of sin is a bequest. Firstly, it was a promise; secondly, it was foreshadowed by the covering of sins; eventually, the promise and the shadow were completely fulfilled by Christ on the cross when He offered Himself as the sacrifice for sins once for all. He was “once offered to bear the sins of many” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98109" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">9:28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98110" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98111" data-verses="Hebrews 10:12">10:12</span>). Therefore, in the eyes of God, sin has gone and has become a history. Do not believe Satan, your feelings, or your failures. They are lies. You must tell them, “Sin was put away by Christ in His first manifestation.” </p>

We have seen that when the new covenant was bequeathed, it became the new testament. In His first manifestation, Christ accomplished everything, put all that He had accomplished into a will, and left His will with us. In this will we have, as our bequests, everything Christ has accomplished. Since everything has been accomplished, neither He nor we need to do anything more. If we have this vision, we shall see that within the thirty-three and a half years of His first manifestation, Christ accomplished everything and put it into a will, into the new testament. Do not think that the New Testament is a book of promise or prophecy. No, the entire New Testament is a will. If your grandfather’s will were full of promises and prophecies, it might take eighty years for it to be fulfilled. You might not live long enough for them all to be fulfilled. This is exactly the way many Christians take the New Testament. Today many Christians do not have a will; they have a book of promise and prophecy. They are waiting for the promises and prophecies to be fulfilled by and by. But remember, even Revelation, a book of prophecy, is included in the New Testament which is a will. As I pointed out in the previous message, even in a book of prophecy such as Revelation, many of the verbs are in the past tense, indicating that they have already been fulfilled and accomplished. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ZZlu4J5HfdMhfEfUJ3LgND5uRWBO4c3a__L7gn1p3skFN8-BJcPmokYabiuqvwyt"> We need to have a clear vision and see that Christ has accomplished everything. If we see this, we will not strive for anything, but rest in all that Christ has done. I am happy because Christ has accomplished everything for me. Blessed is he who sees the vision that Christ has accomplished everything for us. Christ is sitting in the heavens because all the work has been done. He is not laboring or striving but restfully sitting there. In the Bible, to sit means that the work is finished. Everything needed for the completion of God’s eternal plan has already been fulfilled by Christ in His first manifestation. All that He has accomplished has been bequeathed to us in the new testament as our bequests. <span class="pg" data-page-id="475" id="475">[475]</span> </p>

The repeated mention of the fact that Christ, through His sacrifice, has put away sin was necessary because of the strength of the Jewish tradition in the ancient times. The Jews only knew to go to the altar and offer the sacrifice for sin. Daily, the sacrifices for sin were offered; they were also offered yearly on the day of atonement. Thus, the mind of the ancient Jews was occupied with the sin offering. Because of the strength of the Jewish tradition regarding the sin offering, after dealing with the matter of the accomplishment of the sacrifice for sin in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98148" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">chapters seven</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98149" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1">eight</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98150" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">nine</span>, the writer gives us a further conclusion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98151" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1-18">10:1-18</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="o8J_Xe_Oo1DTEOu7_ytt1m_ki99r4zswpHSO-jDOTVFBVk47Q4_e4i6jscHWlhJOs"> The main point of this supplementary conclusion is that the Hebrew Christians had to realize that none of the sacrifices offered by the Levitical priests could put away sin or perfect the worshippers. Even their Old Testament predicted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98152" data-verses="Isaiah 53:10">Isaiah 53:10</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98153" data-verses="Isaiah 53:12">12</span> that Christ would come to be the sacrifice for sin, that is, to replace and terminate the Levitical sacrifices. Since Christ, the unique sacrifice, has done this, it would have been foolish for the Hebrew believers to go back to the temple and offer the sacrifice for sin again. Sin has been put away and has become a history. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98154" data-verses="Hebrews 10:18">10:18</span>, speaking of sins and lawlessnesses, says, “where forgiveness of these is, there is no longer an offering for sin.” This is a logical conclusion. <span class="pg" data-page-id="480" id="480">[480]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="3kUaZWif4GddJ6x0-mt9Xc5_80BfG_163rGTsaQ8Mae1t0n_om2qIm8zuQfDDDM9E"> In God’s economy, Christ did two main things: He put away sin, which had come in to frustrate God’s eternal purpose, and He imparted Himself into us as the divine life which is working within us and spreading into all the inward parts of our being. The main thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98155" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1-18">10:1-18</span> is that Christ has put away sin, accomplishing what all the Levitical sacrifices were unable to do. Having put away sin once for all, Christ has now imparted Himself into us as the divine life, so that through the working of this divine life we may become the corporate reproduction of Himself. </p>

THE HOLY SPIRIT TESTIFYING THAT<br/>OUR SINS AND LAWLESSNESSES ARE FORGIVEN</h2><p data-content-id="ce50k8tQiJj2hm-zVHrfD0wS6_csx9bxTn4PDYyUCKmXbgGgJ_N3tdzwHbUeZPInF"> At this point we need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98167" data-verses="Hebrews 10:15-17">verses 15 through 17</span>. “And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after having said, This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws upon their hearts and upon their minds I will inscribe them; Then He says, And their sins and their lawlessnesses I will by no means remember anymore.” In this section of the Word, the writer was trying his best to prove to the Hebrew believers that there was no longer any need of offering the sacrifice for sin, because Christ had accomplished the putting away of sins. The problem of sin has been solved. Now he stresses this fact by pointing out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98168" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33-34">Jeremiah 31:33 and 34</span>, which he had quoted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98169" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1">chapter eight</span> for the inward law of life, the Holy Spirit also testifies to this effect. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98170" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33-34">Jeremiah 31:33 and 34</span>, after the Holy Spirit said that God would put His laws upon our hearts, He then said that God would not remember our sins any more. This proves that the Holy Spirit testifies that our sins have been taken away and that the problem of sin has been solved. Not only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98171" data-verses="Isaiah 53:6">Isaiah 53:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98172" data-verses="Isaiah 53:11">11</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98173" data-verses="Isaiah 53:12">12</span> was there the prediction that Christ would bear our sins, but also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98174" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:1">Jeremiah 31</span> there was the testimony of the Holy Spirit that our sins would be taken away and that God would no longer have any remembrance of them. </p>

However, beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98183" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19">10:19</span> the writer presents another warning. Many Christians do not understand what is covered in this warning. In this message we must see this matter clearly. </p>
<p data-content-id="59tq157xwce1XvZTZYWAEE6txS6AdhVzhWKgIad9yUQA9xO1kuO2-Z98Caw01EdMR"> This warning, the fourth one in Hebrews, is a warning to come forward to the Holy of Holies and not to shrink back to Judaism. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98184" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">chapter nine</span> we saw the two tabernacles which symbolize two covenants and two ages. There is the danger of not coming forward to the second tabernacle but of shrinking back to the first. We must leave the first tabernacle, the first covenant, and the first age, and go on to enter into the second tabernacle, into the second age or dispensation. We must go on to the Holy of Holies, enter into the new covenant dispensation, and live in the new age. After presenting a complete picture of these things, the writer was very concerned that the Hebrew believers would not go on. Thus, he gave them a warning, telling them of the danger of shrinking back to Judaism and not coming forward to the new testament. He seemed to be saying, “Hebrew believers, come forward from where you are staggering. If you won’t come forward, you will be in danger of shrinking back.” Coming forward is in sharp contrast with shrinking back. It is a terrible thing to <span class="pg" data-page-id="488" id="488">[488]</span> shrink back! Because shrinking back is such a dreadful thing, we must view this fourth warning in a very sober way. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nra_GgDpimpsPAo0RrC1fPbHZi0642dTAWC_1CYoST56PQUyLyIACiL2qjOnKIM8F"> Firstly, I would like to say a word about the phrase “come forward.” This phrase is used four times in Hebrews regarding three things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98185" data-verses="Hebrews 4:16">4:16</span> we are told to come forward to the throne of grace; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98186" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">7:25</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98187" data-verses="Hebrews 11:6">11:6</span> we are told to come forward to God; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98188" data-verses="Hebrews 10:22">10:22</span> we are told to come forward to the Holy of Holies. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98189" data-verses="Hebrews 10:22">10:22</span>, of course, the phrase “Holy of Holies” must be in italics, because it is not found in the original Greek text. However, if you consider the context beginning from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98190" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19">verse nineteen</span>, you will see that the meaning certainly is to come forward to the Holy of Holies. The King James Version of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98191" data-verses="Hebrews 10:22">10:22</span> says to “draw near,” but it does not tell us what we are to draw near to. After much study, I have come to the conclusion that the best translation of the Greek word is not “come,” “draw near,” or “approach to” as some versions render it; it is “come forward.” We must come forward to the Holy of Holies, to the throne of grace, and to God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCD67KI1fQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv"> God is on the throne of grace, and the throne of grace is in the Holy of Holies. This is the scene of the new covenant age. Wherever we may be, we must come forward to the Holy of Holies, the throne of grace, and to God. When we do this, we come forward to the new age, to the new economy, dispensation, and administration in and through which God fulfills His purpose. God’s eternal purpose can only be fulfilled with God sitting on the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies in this new covenant age. Coming forward is not merely a matter of our salvation or even of our glorification; it is for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. For us to be saved or glorified is a small thing, but for God’s eternal purpose to be accomplished is a tremendous matter. Thank God that He has included us in this. Our coming forward and enjoying the new testament is altogether for Him and His purpose. It is for Him to be expressed and for His eternal purpose to be accomplished. This requires four things: God on the throne, the throne of grace, the Holy of Holies, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="489" id="489">[489]</span> the new covenant age. If any one of these four items is missing, it is impossible for God to accomplish His purpose. How serious this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="hZwxam6lXwmH0E7Nl83pdlyEkZda-ocuqHw2FtYp_6HHqSCdwcI5BmEdEnDTEQuNB"> Not only were the pagans and the heathen far away from these four things, but even the Judaizers who had the old covenant were far away from them. Moreover, many Christians today are also far off from these four items. Therefore, there is the call to come forward. We thank God that today the sky is crystal clear above us and we can understand that to come forward means to come forward to the Holy of Holies, to the throne of grace, and to God, and that this means we must come forward to the new covenant dispensation. Where are you? Are you still at the altar beholding the One crowned with thorns, or are you touching the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies gazing upon the One crowned with glory? How we need to come forward! Coming forward is the focal point of the book of Hebrews, and it is very crucial that we all see it. Once we see it, we should never depart from it. </p>

The Holy of Holies is a reality. It is realized by the new covenant dispensation in which we now are experiencing its reality. The presence of God, the shekinah glory of God, God’s meeting with man, and God’s speaking, which are in the Holy of Holies, are all real. They are not types but realities which <span class="pg" data-page-id="490" id="490">[490]</span> are fully realized and experienced by us in the new testament dispensation. </p>

Then, how can we enter it while we are still on earth? The secret is our spirit, referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98199" data-verses="Hebrews 4:12">4:12</span>. The very Christ who is in heaven is also now in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98200" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>). He, as the heavenly ladder (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98201" data-verses="Genesis 28:12">Gen. 28:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98202" data-verses="John 1:51">John 1:51</span>), joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies. Here we meet with God who is on the throne of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCeqZProu2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> We enter the Holy of Holies by a “new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98203" data-verses="Hebrews 10:20">v. 20</span>). The way into the Holy of Holies has been cut. According to the Greek, the word “new” in this verse means “freshly slain.” Through Christ’s death on the cross, the way has been “freshly slain” for us. What was slain? Not only the flesh but the entire old creation. In this verse, the veil, which is His flesh, signifies the old creation, including us. On the veil were cherubim (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98204" data-verses="Exodus 26:31">Exo. 26:31</span>) which signify the creatures (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98205" data-verses="Ezekiel 10:15">Ezek. 10:15</span>). When the veil was rent, the cherubim were also rent, signifying that when the flesh of Christ, <span class="pg" data-page-id="491" id="491">[491]</span> which is typified by the veil, was crucified, all the creatures also were crucified with His flesh. This flesh has been slain. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98206" data-verses="Matthew 27:51">Matthew 27:51</span>, when the Lord Jesus died, the veil was rent from top to bottom, meaning that it was not rent by anyone on earth but by God in the heavens. The old creation has been slain and a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies has been cut. Now through the riven veil of the flesh and by the blood of Jesus we can enter into the Holy of Holies. His death and His blood are still available to us today. </p>

The term dispensational punishment is not likely to be found in other Christian books or messages, for it is a new term in the Lord’s recovery. This term is necessary because many Christians have confused the matter of dispensational punishment with eternal perdition. According to the New Testament, these are clearly two separate things, having nothing to do with one another. Eternal perdition is for unbelievers, whereas dispensational punishment is for believers. A great deal of trouble has been caused by mixing together these two things. </p>
<p data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXq8vBT4q_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB"> In today’s Christianity, there are two main schools of theology regarding salvation. One school says that salvation is eternal. According to this school, once we have been saved, we are saved eternally, regardless what we do after we are saved. Salvation can never be lost. The second school claims that if we are not careful after being saved, we might be lost again. Most of the so-called holiness churches belong to this school, believing that a person may be saved and lost again and again. Because their salvation goes up and down like an elevator, we may call this concept of salvation “elevator salvation.” Once, when I was less than thirty years of age, a preacher came to our town saying that we could be saved in the morning and lost again that night, and then by repenting and confessing our sins we could be saved again <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> the next morning. When I heard about this, I boldly told the saints in that town that this was nonsense and that our God would never give us such a salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdgk2f4R5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> Apparently those who preach and teach “elevator salvation” have some ground in the Bible; actually they do not. They are like those who see the letter C and, having poor eyesight, mistake it for a G. They make a big mistake in interpreting certain passages in the Bible. They use all the verses which speak of dispensational punishment to support their belief that a saved person can be lost again. Those who follow this school of theology never have any assurance. If, as far as salvation is concerned, they are up when they die, they will be saved forever. But if they are down, they will be lost eternally. What kind of gospel is this? It is terrible! </p>
<p data-content-id="nGm-eJrwx-DRz6RAx60bIiAUmw-iP-3qER1EiyiqV-1eQ6SXHd83e5a9vAuFAVRIG"> However, it is also wrong to teach that no matter what you do after you have been saved there will be no problem and you will continue to be saved. According to this teaching, as long as we have the assurance of being saved for eternity, it is all right. We need to be unloaded and drop the teaching of both these theological schools and see what the pure Word of God says concerning this matter. </p>

It has definitely been covenanted that He has written the law of life within us and that He will never remember our sins. As the faithful God, He will never break His covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98252" data-verses="Psalms 89:34">Psa. 89:34</span>). Not only His righteousness but also His faithfulness binds Him. Hence, His covenant with His faithfulness is a security of our salvation. </p>

Do you believe that the eternal life can be recalled once it has been given to us?

Once we have the eternal life, we shall never perish. </p>

These two phrases are both heavy and meaningful; they are the keys to this fourth warning. The writer of this epistle was not concerned with our salvation, for according to what he has written, it is eternally secure. The writer has made it quite clear that Christ has offered Himself to put away sin once for all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98294" data-verses="Hebrews 7:27">7:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98295" data-verses="Hebrews 9:26">9:26</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98296" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">28</span>) and that He has obtained for us an eternal salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98297" data-verses="Hebrews 5:9">5:9</span>). Having entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, He has found for us an eternal redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98298" data-verses="Hebrews 9:12">9:12</span>). The writer knew that our salvation was fully, thoroughly, and completely secure and that we have been saved forever. However, he was very concerned whether his readers would receive a great reward or suffer punishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCeq5Pv7-2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> Throughout the centuries, most Christians have not seen the punishment as well as the reward. Many books deal with the matter of reward, saying that if we follow the Lord faithfully and do His will, we shall receive a crown as a reward. However, it is difficult to find a book which speaks about the other side—punishment. Most Christian writers do not want to touch this subject, because it will cause them difficulty. Nevertheless, “worse punishment” is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98299" data-verses="Hebrews 10:29">10:29</span>, and we cannot ignore it. We shall either suffer a worse punishment or receive a great reward. </p>
<p data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssEQzSuXngzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr"> Our God is fair, righteous, and wise. He knows how to handle everything and how to deal with His children. As <span class="pg" data-page-id="512" id="512">[512]</span> our wise Father, He has a just way of dealing with us, His children: He will reward the faithful and obedient ones and punish the unfaithful and disobedient ones. According to most of the teachings, it seems that God only rewards the faithful ones but does not punish the unfaithful. This is not logical. Our Father is much wiser than this. To say that He will reward the faithful ones and discipline the unfaithful ones is logical. Our God is logical and purposeful, never doing anything without a meaning. The clear word in His oracle says definitely that if we are faithful, He will reward us, but if we are not, He will punish us. </p>
<p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7JiAIKiZ8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> We need not be concerned about our salvation. We may be assured that it is eternally secured according to His holy word. The question, however, is this: how shall we follow the Lord after we have been saved? Will we conduct ourselves according to the law of life? Will we come forward to the Holy of Holies, or shrink back to the Holy Place and even to the outer court? This is up to us. If we come forward, we shall receive a reward. But if we shrink back, we shall suffer punishment because we break God’s administration and disobey His will. We all must come forward to the second covenant and dive into the new covenant economy of God, forgetting our sins and devoting our full attention to the law of life that will make us His reproduction. If we care for this, He surely will reward us. But if we do not care for it, shrinking back instead, He will punish us according to His warning. It is a serious matter to break God’s administration. If we do this, breaking the law of life, we shall suffer a worse punishment than those who broke the law of letters. We need to be deeply impressed with this matter of the “worse punishment” and the “great reward.” Perhaps we even need to underline these words in our Bibles as a reminder of their significance. These words represent our future destiny. Which shall it be—a worse punishment or a great reward? </p>
<p data-content-id="PvInMZn3Vp176ChSyFxr2vOnCpeI0R_umEl2pfk_yxb2iqBRHJddNGyBQOilH2EXM"> The Apostle Paul was not assured that he had the reward until he reached the end of his life. When he wrote the book of 1 Corinthians, he was very much concerned that he might <span class="pg" data-page-id="513" id="513">[513]</span> be a castaway in the heavenly race (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98300" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:24-27">9:24-27</span>). Even when he wrote the book of Philippians, he was still pressing on toward the mark for the prize (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98301" data-verses="Philippians 3:14">Phil. 3:14</span>). Only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98302" data-verses="2Timothy 4:7-8">2 Timothy 4:7 and 8</span>, written shortly before his martyrdom, did he have the assurance that the crown of righteousness was awaiting him. Do not be assured that you have already attained the reward. You have not yet finished your race. </p>
<p data-content-id="-7psJDqorOUFFwhmtN2MfjM-GRc6BT4LW0n2K-L9dRY0OI1PJD-NzRXLSV8ZtC8nS"> We all must be clear about four words: salvation, perdition, reward, and punishment. The reward is not salvation; it is something in addition to it. Salvation is by grace through faith, whereas the reward is according to the life and work we have after being saved. As the reward is different from salvation, so is punishment different from perdition. As we have pointed out, perdition is for the unsaved while punishment is for believers. Thus, punishment here is something altogether different from perdition. We have been saved forever and we can never perish. The unbelievers face two choices—salvation or perdition. We, the saved ones, also must consider two possibilities—receiving a reward or suffering some punishment. All the saints in the Lord’s recovery must be clear about this, for it is a matter of God’s economy, God’s way of dealing with His children. </p>

The Lord Jesus said, “I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father Who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand” (Recovery Version). The life we have received is the eternal life which nothing can terminate. And we have two hands holding us, the Lord’s hand of power and the Father’s hand of love, out of which nothing can snatch us. Our salvation is eternally secured by the eternal life and by the two divine hands. </p>

We need to pay close attention to this verse and its context. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98308" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:8">Verse 8</span> says, “Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.” This verse indicates that here it is not a matter of salvation but of reward. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98309" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12">verse 12</span> we see two categories of materials with which we may build: gold, silver, and precious stones—the produce of the law of life; wood, hay, and stubble—the produce of the flesh. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98310" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:13-14">Verses 13 and 14</span> continue, “Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.” Once again, it is not a matter of salvation but of reward. If a man’s work is burned, he shall suffer loss, but he shall not suffer perdition. “He himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire.” Paul was very careful in writing this verse. He said that we may suffer loss but <span class="pg" data-page-id="515" id="515">[515]</span> still be saved. Lest we think that since we shall still be saved there can be no problem, Paul said that we “shall be saved, yet so as through fire.” There is no need for me to interpret this verse. Simply take it as it is. It certainly is not a good thing to be saved “as through fire.” I do not know what kind of fire that will be, but I do not want to pass through it. </p>

Of these three, Hebrews is the best as far as composition is concerned. In the first ten chapters of Hebrews we have a clear, thorough, and complete comparison between God’s economy and man’s religion. This man-made religion frustrates God’s people from going on according to His economy. Due to this frustration, the book of Hebrews was written. After presenting a thorough comparison of Judaism with God’s economy, this book charges the Hebrew believers, who were in danger of shrinking back, to live, walk, and go on “by faith” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98387" data-verses="Hebrews 10:38-39">10:38-39</span>), that is, “not by sight” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98388" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:7">2 Cor. 5:7</span>). Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98389" data-verses="Hebrews 11:1">chapter eleven</span> it continues to define what faith is in a historical way. </p>
<p data-content-id="fuOTOIbl26ICXoDfOfmO2fU2-x-5N_EbrL-zVhjSApM5ECRzMvL1jcqgw8vvh-fDb"> Suppose you are driving an automobile and come to an intersection where there are two signs, one indicating that a road is closed and the other indicating that a road is open. Would you drive on the road that has been closed? If you did, you would run the risk of losing your life. It would be much better to drive on the open way. The clear comparison given in the first ten chapters of Hebrews is a sign for our driving, showing which way has been closed and which way is open. Over the old way is a sign—Closed, Terminated. Over the new way is also a sign—Open, Freshly Slain. This contrast is the consummation of these ten chapters. After presenting such a contrast, the writer tells us how to take this open, freshly slain way—it is by the unique way of faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="IUDJqdl9X6vy3Vq-crvLYf7hrKVwghlxQoAehr9Bor-YhLUZxsqlKZZQEkrirqIrE"> Before considering this matter of faith, I would like to say a further word about the gaining of the soul. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98390" data-verses="Hebrews 10:39">Hebrews 10:39</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> says, “But we are not of them who shrink back to ruin, but of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul.” The Bible is the most consistent book. Although it has many aspects and uses different terms, its main point is always consistent. The terms glorification, perfection, and the gaining of the soul all point to one thing. As we have seen, glorification is perfection and perfection is the gaining of the soul. We are Christ’s followers today. If we would follow Him according to God’s economy, we must pay the price. Humanly speaking, in order to follow the Lord we must lose the soulish enjoyments and worldly entertainments. To lose such things is what it means to lose our soul. If we are unwilling to pay the price to lose our soul today, meaning that we do not like to lose any soulish enjoyments or worldly entertainments in this age, we shall not give any opportunity to the law of life to work Christ into us. To lose our soul today means that we give the law of life the opportunity to work Christ into our being. It means that we do not care for shopping, housing, eating, clothing, or any type of entertainment, and that we only care for the working of the law of life within us. We all must say, “I am willing to pay any price that the law of life might have the opportunity to work Christ into every part of my being.” This is what it means to be perfected. This is also for our glorification. Our glorification in the future will be the gaining of our soul. Hence, perfection, glorification, and the gaining of the soul all refer to the same thing. </p>
<p data-content-id="H4ftD0nM_HqTnTBTZI6vh-rDaR-OM11qPJmRIviZqwZm5FkPIartulj8dlWnhx9NX"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98391" data-verses="Hebrews 10:39">10:39</span> the writer says that “we are not of them who shrink back to ruin.” Because we have been cleansed with the Lord’s precious blood, regenerated, and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, we are good material for God’s economy, and the law of life is able to work Christ into us. If we are unwilling to pay the price for this and shrink back, we shall be ruined as the good material for God’s economy, as the material in which the law of life can work. If we come forward, we shall remain good material for the law of life to work Christ into our being. Shrinking back ruins the good material by soulish enjoyments, worldly entertainments, and religious <span class="pg" data-page-id="529" id="529">[529]</span> activities. The Greek word translated “ruined” is the same word as for destruction. This means that if, as good material for the working of the law of life, you shrink back from God’s economy, you will be completely destroyed as far as being material is concerned. In the past years, I have seen much good material that has been destroyed by shrinking back from God’s up-to-date economy. Although they saw God’s present economy, they were unwilling to pay the price for it. They shrank back and were ruined. We must be careful about this. </p>
<p data-content-id="XAU_tcFqOKo9rmOP3ZbnS1OSabnirXynnH0CT7HqmYcBXJkMfDQnpAZCXXL7WbCkY"> To be ruined means that we save our soul today and lose it in the future. It also means that we sell our birthright of glorification, giving up our right to full perfection. Those who lose their soul in the future are those who do not care for their future perfection, glorification, and gaining of their soul. They only care for their soulish enjoyments today. If we are willing to pay the price to lose our soul today, in the future we shall gain our soul and be perfected and glorified. As an encouragement to the Hebrew believers to go on in this matter, at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98392" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">chapter ten</span> the writer said that we are of them “who have faith to the gaining of the soul.” After presenting a thorough comparison of Judaism with God’s economy, the writer charges the Hebrew believers to go on by faith.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98396" data-verses="Hebrews 4:2">4:2</span> we see that faith is the unique way to receive the word of the gospel. The proper gospel is the gospel of bequests. If anyone would receive the gospel of bequests, he must have faith. Suppose someone would offer you a document which said that a large amount of money had been deposited in your bank account. In order to receive this document, you must have faith. If you do not have faith, you will say, “This is just a piece of paper. It doesn’t mean anything to me.” When we preach the gospel, we must infuse people <span class="pg" data-page-id="530" id="530">[530]</span> with faith. The power of the proper gospel preaching is that people are infused with faith to such an extent that they believe whatever we tell them. People must have faith if they are to receive the word of the gospel. </p>

Although God is great and wonderful, some people say, “As far as I am concerned, God is nothing.” If we have faith, God is everything; if we do not have faith, He is nothing to us. Whenever we minister God to people, we must be able to infuse them with faith; otherwise, whatever we minister to them will be in vain. If people are to grasp God, they must have faith. </p>

As He inspired the writing of this chapter, the Holy Spirit certainly had such a view. Everyone involved in this history of faith was a witness. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98451" data-verses="Hebrews 11:1">Hebrews 11</span> is not only a chapter on faith with its history, but also with its witnesses. The word “witness” here refers to the person testifying, not to the testimony. In Greek, the word for witness is the same as the word for martyr. Every witness is a martyr, suffering martyrdom for the testimony of faith. In this chapter we read of many martyrs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98452" data-verses="Hebrews 11:32-39">vv. 32-39</span>). Some were stoned and others were sawn in two. In this message, we shall consider the history of faith, especially concentrating on the consummation of this history, which is very much related to us. </p>

By faith he obeyed God’s calling to leave his homeland, dwelling as a foreigner in the land of promise (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98458" data-verses="Hebrews 11:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>). Abraham obeyed God and went out of Chaldea “without knowing where he was going.” This afforded him constant opportunity to exercise his faith to trust in God for His instant leading, taking God’s presence as his map. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98459" data-verses="Hebrews 11:10">Verse 10</span> says that by faith Abraham “waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Maker is God.” This is “the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98460" data-verses="Hebrews 12:22">12:22</span>), “the Jerusalem above” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98461" data-verses="Galatians 4:26">Gal. 4:26</span>, Gk.), “the holy city, the New Jerusalem” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98462" data-verses="Revelation 21:2">Rev. 21:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98463" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">3:12</span>) which God has prepared for His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98464" data-verses="Hebrews 11:16">v. 16</span>), and “the tabernacle of God” in which God will dwell with men for eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98465" data-verses="Revelation 21:3">Rev. 21:3</span>). As the patriarchs waited for this city, so we also seek it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98466" data-verses="Hebrews 13:14">13:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="klFSgkmZ7z6TtXkmgUNGn8b11gto0ptrC0ipW-rLe2wiLoKboQqxl2qT2E6BWveTU"> Abraham also acted by faith in offering up Isaac, “counting that God was able to raise him even from among the dead, from whence he also received him back in a figure” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98467" data-verses="Hebrews 11:17-19">vv. 17-19</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98468" data-verses="Hebrews 11:12">Verse 12</span>, referring to Abraham, says, “Wherefore also there was born of one, and that of one become dead, even as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand by the seashore innumerable.” The stars of heaven signify Abraham’s heavenly descendants, the descendants of faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98469" data-verses="Galatians 3:7">Gal. 3:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98470" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">19</span>); whereas “the sand by the seashore” signifies his earthly descendants, the descendants in the flesh. </p>

Yet he did not settle here; rather, he sojourned in the land of promise as a pilgrim, even as an exile and an expatriate, longing after a better country, a <span class="pg" data-page-id="540" id="540">[540]</span> heavenly one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98474" data-verses="Hebrews 11:16">v. 16</span>), seeking a country of his own (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98475" data-verses="Hebrews 11:14">v. 14</span>). This might imply that he was ready to cross another river from the earthly side to the heavenly side. Isaac and Jacob followed him in the same steps, living on the earth as strangers and sojourners and waiting for the God-built city of foundations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98476" data-verses="Hebrews 11:10">v. 10</span>). In the word of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98477" data-verses="Hebrews 11:9-16">verses 9 through 16</span>, it may imply that the writer of this book intended to impress the believing Hebrews with the fact that they, as the real Hebrews, should follow their forefathers, considering themselves also as strangers and sojourners on the earth and looking forward to the heavenly country, which is better than the earthly one. </p>

His inner sight was exceedingly clear. When Joseph attempted to change his hands, being displeased that Jacob’s right hand was upon Ephraim instead of upon Manasseh, the firstborn, Jacob refused and said, “I know it, my son, I know <span class="pg" data-page-id="541" id="541">[541]</span> it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98481" data-verses="Genesis 48:15-19">Gen. 48:15-19</span>).

When we are settled, we no longer need to keep a staff in our hand, for that is a sign of a sojourner, not of a dweller. Jacob’s staff also signified that God was his shepherd, having shepherded him all his life long (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98484" data-verses="Genesis 48:15">Gen. 48:15</span>, Heb.). This is the reason that his worshipping, leaning on the top of his staff, is recorded here as a matter of faith. </p>

<p data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw9Rm7vNjq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF"> In this message we come to the Author and Perfecter of faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98562" data-verses="Hebrews 12:2">12:2</span>). The saints of the old covenant were only witnesses of faith. None of them was the author, source, perfecter, or finisher of faith. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98563" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1">verse 1</span> of this chapter the witnesses of faith are considered as “a cloud of witnesses surrounding us.” The Lord was in the cloud to be with His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98564" data-verses="Exodus 13:21-22">Exo. 13:21-22</span>). The children of Israel followed the Lord according to the move of the cloud. Where the cloud was, there the Lord was also. Furthermore, the cloud is for leading people in following the Lord. If you have a heart to seek out the Lord and you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98565" data-verses="Hebrews 11:1">Hebrews 11</span>, you may immediately have the sense that by the people of faith you can have the Lord’s presence and His leading. If you have the cloud, you will have the Lord. But if you miss the cloud, you will also miss the Lord. All the people of faith, the church people, are the cloud. The best way to seek the Lord’s presence is to come to the church. If anyone is seeking the Lord’s leading, he must follow the cloud, the church. The Lord is in the cloud, meaning that He is with the people of faith. Since we are the people of faith, we are today’s cloud, and people can follow the Lord by following us. Those who seek Him can find His presence with us. The Lord is where we are, and where we are is the direction in which the Lord is moving in these days. </p>

As we <span class="pg" data-page-id="552" id="552">[552]</span> have seen, the saints of the old covenant were only the witnesses of faith, but Jesus is the Author and Perfecter of faith. The Greek word translated “Author” may also be rendered “Originator,” “Inaugurator,” “Leader,” “Pioneer,” “Forerunner.” It is the same word in Greek that is used for Captain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98566" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10">2:10</span>. Jesus is the Author of faith; He is the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source, and the cause of faith. The Author is the Originator and the Inaugurator; then He is the source and the cause. Since the Author is the Originator, He is also the Pioneer and Forerunner. Therefore, He is also the Leader and the Captain. If we put all these titles together, we have an adequate definition of Jesus as the Author of faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="o8J_Xe_Oo1DTEOu7_ytt1kfku99r4zswpHSO-jDOTVFBVk47Q4_e4i6jscHWlhJOs"> We need Jesus as the Author of faith because, according to our natural man, we do not have any believing ability. We do not have faith by ourselves. The faith we have through which we are saved is “not of ourselves; it is the gift of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98567" data-verses="Ephesians 2:8">Eph. 2:8</span>). We have “obtained” this “precious faith” by God’s gift (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98568" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">2 Pet. 1:1</span>). When we look unto Jesus, He, as “the life-giving Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98569" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span> ASV), transfuses us with Himself, with His believing element. Then, spontaneously, the believing ability arises in our being, and we have the faith to believe in Him. It is not of ourselves, but of Him who imparts Himself into us as the believing element to believe for us. Hence, it is He Himself who is our faith. We live by Him as our faith, by His faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98570" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>), not by our own faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nra_GgDpimpsPAo0RrC1fMLHewU642dTAWC_1CYoST56PQUyLyIACiL2qjOnKIM8F"> Jesus is the Author and the Originator of faith mainly in His life and in His path on earth. The Lord Jesus originated faith when He was here on earth. The life He lived was a life of faith, and the path He walked was a path of faith. In His life and path He originated faith. Hence, He is the Author of faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCD5rKOnvQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv"> Jesus, being the Pioneer and the Forerunner, has cut the way of faith. If you read the four Gospels again, you will see that His life was a cutting life, a life that cut the way of faith. Wherever He went, it seems that there was a mountain or a river frustrating Him. But step after step, He cut <span class="pg" data-page-id="553" id="553">[553]</span> the way of faith. If we have this view in reading the Gospels, we shall see that the very Jesus who is the Originator of faith was always cutting the way of faith, closing the gaps and removing the mountains like the builder of a highway. Since He has cut the way of faith, He is also the Pioneer and Forerunner on the pathway of faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="hZwxam6lXwmH0E7Nl83pdmiEtLda-ocuqHw2FtYp_6HHqSCdwcI5BmEdEnDTEQuNB"> As the Pioneer and the Forerunner of faith, Jesus is also the Leader and Captain of faith. He has cut the way of faith and, as the Forerunner, has taken the lead to pioneer it. Hence, He, as the Captain, can carry us through the pathway of faith in His footsteps. As we look unto Him as the Originator of faith in His life and in His path on earth, and as the Perfecter of faith in His glory and on His throne in heaven, He transfuses and even infuses us with the faith which He has originated and perfected. </p>

We have received it as a gift from God. God is the source and giver of faith, and we are the recipients of this divine gift. God has put something into our being which becomes our faith. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98573" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">Second Peter 1:1</span> says that we “have obtained like precious faith.” Faith is precious because it has been given to us as a gift by God. </p>

We have seen that faith, the substantiating ability, is like a sixth sense. We acquired this substantiating sense through the preaching of the gospel. Proper gospel preaching is not merely a matter of teaching; it must also be a matter of transfusion. Suppose I am preaching the gospel to some sinners. Before I can preach the gospel to them, I must first receive something of and from the Lord. Then, as I am preaching, what I have received of the Lord will enter, like electricity, into those who are listening. While I am speaking and the people are looking at and listening to me, something spontaneously and unconsciously is transfused into them. Although they may shake their heads, not consenting to my preaching, deep within they believe what I am saying. Although some may say to themselves that it is silly to believe, something within them continues to react and brings them to the point where they say, “Lord Jesus, thank You. You are so good. Lord, You are my Savior.” Because some element has been transfused into their being, they are able to believe in the Lord. I know of many stubborn ones who would not express in the meeting that they had come to believe in the Lord Jesus. They went home, but they had no peace, for something within stirred and troubled them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="555" id="555">[555]</span> When it was time for the next gospel meeting, they said, “I would like to go there again.” This is the result of the transfusion of faith by God through a preacher. </p>

<p data-content-id="D0hW7peMyKatW3Yyp1pjW261nmZR3tlI4jM_n3qZwVMLHLzSUtNKlGG2jUwn-109y"> In this message we come to the Christian race. The Christian life is a race. Every saved Christian must run the race to win the prize (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98581" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:24">1 Cor. 9:24</span>). This prize is not salvation in a common sense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98582" data-verses="Ephesians 2:8">Eph. 2:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98583" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:15">1 Cor. 3:15</span>), but a reward in a special sense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98584" data-verses="Hebrews 10:35">Heb. 10:35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98585" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:14">1 Cor. 3:14</span>). The Apostle Paul, who has run the race and won the prize, was nearly the only one who likened the Christian life to a race. In the book of Hebrews he charged the Hebrew believers to run the race, saying, “run with endurance the race which is set before us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98586" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1">12:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="SX28q2m5JZZaou8YzwMxgmvhrV-9-jFM-0R967a0R103rK0Jy6qGdc5kFkKIhC-VV"> Now we must ask a very puzzling question: what is this race? We should not say that the race is perfection or glorification, for that is the goal of the race. Neither is the race the inward working of the law of life, for that is the process of the race. The race is not even the losing of the soul, because that is the way to run the race; it is not the race itself. In order to answer this question, we need to consider the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98587" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>: “I am the way.” A race is a way, a course. Because Christ is the way, He is also the race. The race we are running is Christ. Our way is our race. These are not two things, one the way and the other the race. No, the way we are walking is the race we are running. Therefore, Christ, who is the way, is the race. Although I have been ministering on this matter of running the race for over forty years, I have never been so clear as I am now that the race is Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="gGi1krUjO5_vgHIvZGO2-r1ug0ABZa_k8hB0IkA8RvqDpYwLHDRb1TMHp4sIipHHx"> I am burdened that we all might be clear about God’s way. In the universe God has prepared the unique way which we must take. This way has no beginning or ending; it is <span class="pg" data-page-id="560" id="560">[560]</span> endless, reaching from eternity to eternity. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98588" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98589" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span> there is only one way—Christ. Before Christ was manifested, God used types to signify this matter of Christ as God’s way, the most striking of which was the tabernacle. As we have seen, the tabernacle has three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. In these three parts of the tabernacle there is a way, starting from the altar; passing through the laver, the showbread table, the lampstand, and the incense altar; and ushering us into the ark, the place where the law of life is. The way in the tabernacle is a picture of Christ as our unique way. As we shall see, there is a reason why this way is called a race. </p>
<p data-content-id="eQJD4_jtknWQat9jcVOn_Wht1NNYK_r5XUDNpcDDJV6S5IySpcJb2P-RieMVJy8R6"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98590" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> reveal that God’s intention was that man, who was created in His image, would be on His way. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98591" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98592" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>, the image of God is Christ. Thus, for man to be created in the image of God meant that he was made according to Christ. He was created according to Christ that he might be on God’s way, which is Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98593" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> man was put in front of the tree of life, which signified Christ as our life. Therefore, man was not only made according to Christ, but also was destined to take in Christ as his life. If man had done this, he would immediately have been on God’s way. However, soon after the creation of man and before man was on God’s unique way, Satan came in to distract man from God’s way to something other than Christ. But, in His mercy, God came in to establish the way of redemption that the distracted man might be brought back to God’s way. Abel followed this, but Cain did not. Although Abel was brought back to God’s way, Cain was distracted by a further step of Satan, never returning to God’s original way. Later, God commanded the children of Israel to erect the tabernacle. With the tabernacle there was a clear way by which sinners could enter into the reality of what God is. When the children of Israel were called by God, they all were sinners distracted from the way of God. But God showed them the tabernacle, in which there was a way to go from the altar in the outer court to the consummate point in the Holy of <span class="pg" data-page-id="561" id="561">[561]</span> Holies—the enjoyment of God’s element, the law of life. Everything on this way indicates an aspect of Christ. Hence, the way for man to reach God is just Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="59tq157xwce1XvZTZYWAFF6t9S6AdhVzhWKgIad9yUQA9xO1kuO2-Z98Caw01EdMR"> However, Judaism, the Jewish religion, misused the tabernacle and everything revealed in the Old Testament to make a religion. The very religion which was constituted according to God’s holy word eventually distracted God’s people from God’s way. Both the tabernacle and the temple were constructed for the purpose of showing God’s people the way by which they might reach God and enter into Him. When the Lord Jesus came, the priests were worshipping God in the temple, offering sacrifices on the altar, dressing the lamp, displaying the showbread, and burning the incense. They did all this for the purpose of contacting God. But the Lord Jesus went to the house of Simon the leper in Bethany, where He enjoyed fellowship with those brothers and sisters. While the priests were worshipping God in the temple, God was in Simon’s house in Bethany. The way was not in the temple; the way—Christ—was in that house in Bethany. Even the worship and service which had been ordained by God to show the way to reach God was utilized by Satan to distract people from Christ, God’s unique way. </p>
<p data-content-id="afNFn9OFFhiGx4i5yPayrX7QJUgPwOHF65dbAP4BbUq6H0aWVC2NiuPeDe_39lWHN"> Consider the example of Saul of Tarsus, who was absolutely for the Jewish religion. When he realized that some of his countrymen, such as Peter, John, and Stephen, were not in this religion, he was stirred up to oppose them. By that time, the way had become a race, and Peter, John, Stephen, and all the other believers were running in it. As Saul of Tarsus was running alongside of this way, attempting to hinder those on the way, the Lord Jesus appeared to him, striking him down and turning him to this way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98594" data-verses="Acts 9:1-6">Acts 9:1-6</span>). I believe that once Saul was in Christ and was walking on this way, he considered his religious background and all the distractions along the way, thinking that he had been born a Hebrew and circumcised on the eighth day and wondering whether he should give it all up. Eventually he realized that he had to forget about being a Hebrew and not only walk on the way but run the race. Whenever you drive a car fast, you <span class="pg" data-page-id="562" id="562">[562]</span> are not looking for an exit. But once you slow down, it means that you are seeking an exit. Saul began to speed up, and his name was changed to Paul. By running, the way was changed into a race. </p>

GOD WANTING THE HEBREW BELIEVERS<br/>TO BE HOLY, TO BE SEPARATED<br/>ABSOLUTELY UNTO HIM</h2>
<p data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-iYaYGW2zlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr"> In this message we come to the matter of discipline for holiness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98641" data-verses="Hebrews 12:5-14">12:5-14</span>). One of the basic concepts of this book is that God wanted the Hebrew believers to be holy, to be separated absolutely unto Him, not to remain common in Judaism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98642" data-verses="Hebrews 12:14">v. 14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98643" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">3:1</span>), but rather to enter into the Holy of Holies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98644" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19">10:19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98645" data-verses="Hebrews 10:22">22</span>). True holiness is to enter into the Holy of Holies. Once we have entered into the Holy of Holies, we have reached the peak of holiness. There is no place where we can be more holy than in the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="iP_bgkHD-VyM-lbYNnOmis4Ntl-wBR5Dynf2bHQ8WpjrkRIRPrECHRAQWFcx0WQUb"> Entering into the Holy of Holies is not merely a matter of being in the shekinah glory. Even this is somewhat outward and superficial. Although we may be in the shekinah glory in the Holy of Holies, we still need to experience the contents of the ark. Even inside the ark there is something concealed—the hidden manna in the golden pot. This hidden manna is near the tables of the testimony, the ultimate item in the experience of Christ. To be holy means to reach the consummate point of the experience of Christ, that is, to experience the law of life. Nothing can make us more subjectively holy than the law of life, for it works God’s holy nature, which is true holiness, into our being. God’s divine nature is the substance of holiness. Nothing other than the law of life is able to work God’s divine nature into our being. Only when we experience the law of life can we be truly holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="19J7BMpUdAP-KQCUvDLCnVj_W2_Zvr1TF44VGLYr0Wq30Cf62POCZtTmD67IMB8WQ"> The aim of the book of Hebrews is to bring us on into the Holy of Holies, with the intention that we may experience the contents of the ark of testimony. These contents consist <span class="pg" data-page-id="570" id="570">[570]</span> of three things: the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of life. Both the hidden manna and the budding rod are for our enjoyment and privilege, but the law of life is for God’s working. Through it, He works Himself into our being. Therefore, if we would be holy to the uttermost, we must experience the law of life by which God works Himself into us as our real holiness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41cwEZ00oMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg">II.

They were being disciplined that they might be separated from the common things unto the holiness of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41cwEZ9mIMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg">III. DISCIPLINE BEING THE FATHER’S DEALING<br/>WITH HIS SONS THAT THE SONS MAY PARTAKE<br/>OF THE FATHER’S HOLY NATURE</h2><p data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXr9vBXqa_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98647" data-verses="Hebrews 12:10">Verse 10</span> says, “For they indeed disciplined us for a few days as it seemed good to them, but He for our profit that we might partake of His holiness.” Discipline is the Father’s dealing with His sons that they may partake of His holy nature. God’s discipline, God’s dealing with us, is to bring us into His intention, which is that we forsake everything other than the Holy of Holies and enter into the Holy of Holies where we may have genuine holiness. However, like the Hebrew believers in the ancient times, many of us do not cooperate with God in this way. Thus, under His sovereignty, He disciplines us that we might be brought into His intention. </p>
<p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdhl2f_D5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> As we have seen, holiness is God’s nature, and to partake of God’s holiness is to partake of His nature. It was common, unholy, for the Hebrew believers to remain in Judaism. They needed to be separated to God’s new covenant that they might partake of God’s holy nature. For this purpose, <span class="pg" data-page-id="571" id="571">[571]</span> persecution was aroused to discipline them that they might be separated from the common to the holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="nGm-eJrwx-DRz6RAx60bJjAUgiuiP-3qER1EiyiqV-1eQ6SXHd83e5a9vAuFAVRIG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98648" data-verses="Hebrews 12:9">verse 9</span> God is called the “Father of spirits.” “Father of spirits” is contrasted with “fathers of our flesh.” In regeneration, we are born of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98649" data-verses="John 1:13">John 1:13</span>) in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98650" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>). Hence, He is the Father of our spirits. Since the staggering Hebrew believers were wandering in their mind, not following the Lord in their spirit, the Father of spirits used the persecution by Judaism to force them to turn from their mind to their spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98651" data-verses="Hebrews 4:12">4:12</span>) that they might partake of His holy nature. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6ZZlu4J5HfdMhfEfUJ3LhNz5uSWBO4c3a__L7gn1p3skFN8-BJcPmokYabiuqvwyt">IV. DISCIPLINE BEING FOR HOLINESS,<br/>RESULTING IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p data-content-id="R5BCjovp4r6zbRLEWObe0vR1Sdn_7Qf8QksznRcMh7dobccpo28CQJWJRDpQH5rrM"> Discipline is for holiness resulting in righteousness. Holiness is the inward nature, the nature of the divine life, and righteousness is the outward behavior, the behavior of the sanctified believers, which comes out of the inward nature and which brings forth the peaceable fruit, the fruit of peace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98652" data-verses="Hebrews 12:11">v. 11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98653" data-verses="Isaiah 32:17">Isa. 32:17</span>). If we have never been permeated inwardly with God’s holy nature, we can never have proper righteousness in our outward behavior. Firstly, the law of life must work God’s divine nature into us. Then in our outward behavior we shall have the peaceable fruit of righteousness as the issue of inward holiness. In our practical experience, holiness is first, righteousness is second, and peace is third. </p>
<p data-content-id="smQkdlepcUj2tnXbV2Ux0IMQDX7gpeQPNsDo0T9aLCfvZuZlwoPT8L125acok8hfa"> The Hebrew believers were being persecuted by the Judaizers. Some of the persecutors were probably their relatives, perhaps even parents or children. As they were under this persecution, they tried to make peace with their persecutors. But they did so at the neglect of their holiness. Holiness is entering into the Holy of Holies to reach the law of life, the working of which saturates us with God’s holy nature. When we are saturated with God’s nature, we spontaneously have the issue of righteousness, and this righteousness brings in genuine peace. Many Christians have a peace which is not genuine; it is a peace which comes <span class="pg" data-page-id="572" id="572">[572]</span> from compromise. Some of the Hebrew believers might have said, “Oh, father, if you will not let me be in the new covenant way absolutely, then maybe I can go with you to the temple on the seventh day and attend the Christian assembly on the eighth day, the first day of the week. Then we can be at peace.” This peace is a peace through compromise, a peace which comes from sacrificing holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPZMxpN5MwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm"> As we have seen, peace is the fruit of righteousness, and holiness is the inward nature, while righteousness is the outward behavior. God’s discipline helps the believers not only to partake of His holiness, but also to make them right with both God and man that in such a condition of righteousness they might enjoy peace as a sweet and peaceable fruit of righteousness. </p>

THE WEARIED AND PARALYZED HEBREW BELIEVERS<br/>NEEDING TO MAKE STRAIGHT PATHS<br/>THAT THE LAMED MEMBERS<br/>MAY NOT BE PUT OUT OF JOINT<br/>BUT RATHER MAY BE HEALED</h2><p data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6HS1FrcKXM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98654" data-verses="Hebrews 12:12-13">Verses 12 and 13</span> say, “Wherefore lift up the wearied hands and the paralyzed knees, and make straight paths for your feet that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather may be healed.” The Christian life is not a matter of theoretical doctrines for the mind. Rather, it must be practical in providing paths for our feet. All the sound, healthy doctrines of the Bible are for the paths. This is absolutely true with this book of Hebrews. This book firstly ministers to us the most high and healthy doctrines concerning Christ and His new covenant. Then, based upon the proper doctrines which it has shown us, it charges us to run the race and make straight paths for our feet. The first section of this book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98655" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1">1:1—10:18</span>) is of doctrines, and the second (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98656" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19">10:19—13:25</span>) is of a race, of paths. </p>
<p data-content-id="Z-QbeF7eFSCsrR20PWwNGndXnc9izFUNBnmIQqNZgJ_0WMRdgwQ1A7MTTYXlofxbP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98657" data-verses="Hebrews 12:13">verse 13</span> the writer tells the Hebrew believers to “make straight paths for your feet that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather may be healed.” The Greek word translated “put out of joint” may also be rendered <span class="pg" data-page-id="573" id="573">[573]</span> “dislocated” or “wrenched.” The implication of the context is that the staggering Hebrew believers should abandon all appearance of the practices of Judaism (that is, to make straight paths) that they, the lamed members (limbs) of the Body may not fall into apostasy (that is, may not be put out of joint), but rather may be fully brought into the new covenant way (that is, may be healed). Thus, to make straight paths is to abandon all appearance of the practice of Judaism; not to be lamed is not to fall into apostasy; and to be healed is to be fully brought into the new covenant way. </p>

This book has a special arrangement. It has five main teachings, and with each teaching there is a warning. Three of the warnings come after the teachings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98662" data-verses="Hebrews 3:7">3:7-4:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98663" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19-39">10:19-39</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98664" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1-29">12:1-29</span>), and two are inserted into the teachings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98665" data-verses="Hebrews 2:1-4">2:1-4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98666" data-verses="Hebrews 5:11">5:11-6:20</span>). All of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98667" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1">chapter twelve</span> is a warning which follows the teaching given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98668" data-verses="Hebrews 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. This warning tells us to run the race and not to fall away from grace. The race needs the grace, and the grace is sufficient for the race. </p>
<p data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPZMBpJqcwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm"> Before we consider the matter of falling from grace, I would like to say a further word concerning the race. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98669" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">chapters ten</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98670" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1">twelve</span> we have three synonymous terms. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98671" data-verses="Hebrews 10:20">10:20</span> we have the “new and living way” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98672" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1">12:1</span> we have the race. As we have seen, the race is the way on which we are running. If we are walking, the way remains a way, but once we begin to run, the way becomes the race. The third of these synonymous terms is paths (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98673" data-verses="Hebrews 12:13">12:13</span>). The living way, the race, and the paths all point to the same thing. The way on which we walk should be the race we are running, and the race should be the paths. Whether we call it the race, the way, or the paths, the meaning is the same. </p>
<p data-content-id="LsMUGHoOAyglcgXHKOT_-NwP7Q-wBBYWGd_3K1-drcYapSz78FtH6UNrSlSq3kKsG"> Perhaps you are wondering why both the way and the race are singular while the paths are plural. This is like one freeway which has many sections. The many sections are many paths. </p>
<p data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6HSFFtM6XM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX"> The way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98674" data-verses="Hebrews 10:20">10:20</span> is the way to enter into the Holy of Holies, and the race in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98675" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1">12:1</span> is for reaching the goal and obtaining the reward. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98676" data-verses="Hebrews 12:13">12:13</span> we see that on this highway into the Holy of Holies and toward God’s goal, there are <span class="pg" data-page-id="578" id="578">[578]</span> paths, and that these paths must be straight, not having any curves. Some Christians have weak ankles. If their way is not made straight, they will fall away because their ankles are weak. Hence, we must make straight paths that their ankles would not be put out of joint, that is, be dislocated or wrenched, but rather be healed. </p>
<p data-content-id="Z-QbeF7eFSCsrR20PWwNGntXtOdizFUNBnmIQqNZgJ_0WMRdgwQ1A7MTTYXlofxbP"> To remain in the Holy of Holies is to continue the running of the race. According to our experience, whenever we exercise our mind to compromise a little, we can sense deep within our spirit that we are away from God’s presence, that we are no longer in the Holy of Holies. Immediately, our way of contacting God is no longer straight; it has become curved. This curve leads us away from the Holy of Holies, away from the ark of testimony, the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the tables of the testimony. Although at the beginning we may be only a short way off from the Holy of Holies, eventually we find that we are a great distance away. </p>
<p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCfr5Pj7-2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> Our race must eventually be in the Holy of Holies. If we are running the race only in the outer court, we are too shallow. We must run our race in the Holy of Holies. Perhaps you are thinking that the Holy of Holies is too small an area in which to run a race. Yes, in the tabernacle it was a cube only ten cubits in length, width, and height (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98677" data-verses="Exodus 26:8">Exo. 26:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98678" data-verses="Exodus 26:16">16</span>). In the temple it became twenty cubits in length, width, and height (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98679" data-verses="1Kings 6:20">1 Kings 6:20</span>). Eventually, in the New Jerusalem it will be twelve thousand stadia in length, width, and height (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98680" data-verses="Revelation 21:16">Rev. 21:16</span>). The cubical dimensions of the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle and in the temple and of the New Jerusalem signify the completeness of God’s eternal being. From any direction, God is perfect and complete. His completeness and perfection is eternal, unlimited. </p>
<p data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0JloZMcNUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW"> The more we run, the larger the Holy of Holies becomes, expanding from the tabernacle, to the temple, and ultimately to the New Jerusalem. When we first run the race in the tabernacle, it is ten cubits. As we continue to run, it becomes twenty cubits in the temple and twelve thousand stadia in the New Jerusalem. When we run the race in eternity, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="579" id="579">[579]</span> shall discover that it is eternally spacious. This is very meaningful. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dnpiKigwMWCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0"> We can never exhaust the race in the Holy of Holies. I have been running the race for many years, and the more I run, the longer, wider, and higher the Holy of Holies becomes. For the young people, the Holy of Holies in which they are running may be just ten cubits long, wide, and high. After they have been running the race for a number of years, it will be much larger. When we enter into eternity, we shall see that the whole city of New Jerusalem, which is the same in each of its three dimensions, is the Holy of Holies. Today our continual race is in the Holy of Holies, and the paths of this continual race must be made straight. In order to make the paths straight, we must have grace. We must run the race and not fall away from grace. We need grace to run the race. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="r-B8nUhR9J6hUII4QNKnElHloWL3T1u_Sm-0_l_AMtHeXEMBTrWU2cmFAvJnaebii">I. THE GRACE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="dY63Ns4YQPAy0AY63eLj9fQJq9aw209Dd3yRfmCJvmFRPo7bCwFO5qUAj0SHHhN9d"> Now we must ask a crucial question: what is grace? When I was young, I was taught by some great teachers that grace means that we do nothing and that God does everything for us. According to this teaching, anything we do is work, not grace, but whatever the Lord does for us is grace. For example, there is no need for us to do anything for our sins. If we do this, it is our work. The Lord Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and that is grace. Are you satisfied with this definition of grace? For a while, I was satisfied with it. But as a result of considering certain verses in the Bible, I began to question it. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98681" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> says that grace came through Jesus Christ, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98682" data-verses="John 1:16">John 1:16</span> says, “Of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace” (Recovery Version). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98683" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span> the Apostle Paul says, “By the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.” One day, as I was comparing this verse with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98684" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> where Paul says, “Not I, but Christ liveth in me,” I realized that grace is just God in Christ dispensed into our being for <span class="pg" data-page-id="580" id="580">[580]</span> our enjoyment in our experience. It is not only the work the Lord does for us; it is the Triune God Himself dispensed into our being and experienced as our enjoyment. In brief, grace is the Triune God experienced by us. According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, grace is nothing less than God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment. Firstly, He is dispensed into our spirit, and then, as He spreads into our inward parts, He becomes our enjoyment. This grace has come to us through Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98685" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98686" data-verses="John 1:17">17</span>), and it is the grace of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98687" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98688" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">12:9</span>), even Christ Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98689" data-verses="Galatians 6:18">Gal. 6:18</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98690" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Qpdn89MhLxfVrIv8GWTBZVysUKQ55oZqOEuk2qvXDTa4ELyWoRmN1r_WYV01cf7Lc">II. TO FALL AWAY FROM GRACE<br/>BEING TO FALL AWAY FROM CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw8TW7reTq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF"> To fall away from the grace of God is to fall away from Christ. When we are “fallen from grace” we are “severed from Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98691" data-verses="Galatians 5:4">Gal. 5:4</span>, Gk.). In this matter Paul warned the churches of Galatia, which were in the same danger as the Hebrew believers, not to be “severed from Christ” by being turned aside to the law of the Jewish religion, lest they fall away from the grace of God which is Christ Himself. We should not fall away from grace, but rather “have grace” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98692" data-verses="Hebrews 12:28">v. 28</span>), “be confirmed by grace” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98693" data-verses="Hebrews 13:9">13:9</span>), and “stand in grace” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98694" data-verses="Romans 5:2">Rom. 5:2</span>). Both Galatians and Hebrews close with the blessings of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98695" data-verses="Galatians 6:18">Gal. 6:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98696" data-verses="Hebrews 13:25">Heb. 13:25</span>). </p>

Paul was undoubtedly marvelous both in the spirit and in the mind. He was a very brilliant man. Like one of today’s writers who includes photographs in his books, Paul gave us some pictures in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98724" data-verses="Hebrews 12:18-24">12:18-24</span>. The two scenes portrayed in these verses not only give us a comparison but also a clear view of the situation of both the old and new covenants. </p>
<p data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGC8cvZFQsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_"> If we read these seven verses carefully, we can see that there are six items belonging to the old covenant and eight belonging to the new covenant. Six is the number of the old creation, which was made in six days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98725" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Gen. 1</span>). Eight is the number of resurrection. The Lord Jesus was resurrected on the first day of the week (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98726" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20:1</span>), which is the eighth day. The six items of the old covenant indicate that the old covenant was on the side of the old creation. The eight items of the new covenant indicate that the new covenant is on the side of resurrection. The number eight signifies a new beginning after the passing of a period of time. A week is the first period of time, and the first day of the second week, the eighth day, is a new beginning. Hence, the number eight signifies resurrection, a new beginning. The new covenant is a new start after the period of the old covenant has passed. </p>
<p data-content-id="W1iZtRdq2EaOvu-m8SfI6j6yZQ9_rOlrXR3fm3GUzcPU0O7qbBBiKxEFUeCJG_ERL"> The old covenant was of the law, whose position is that of a concubine. The new covenant is of grace, whose position is that of the proper wife. Sarah, Abraham’s wife, symbolizes grace in resurrection, and Hagar, the concubine, <span class="pg" data-page-id="590" id="590">[590]</span> symbolizes the law related to the flesh. Paul makes this quite clear in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98727" data-verses="Galatians 4:1">Galatians 4</span>, where he tells us that these two women, Hagar and Sarah, are two covenants, Hagar being the old covenant and Sarah the new. In other words, Hagar stands for the law and Sarah for grace. We Christians today are not the children of Hagar but of Sarah. We are children of grace. These two women also symbolize two mountains. Hagar signifies Mount Sinai, and Sarah signifies Mount Zion, which is the heavenly Jerusalem, our mother. </p>

Do you like such a mountain? I prefer a mountain covered with trees and flowing streams, but I do not like a mountain that is set on fire. That would terrify me. Paul seemed to be saying, “Hebrew brothers, do you still want to go back to the old covenant? Don’t you know that that belongs to the mountain which was set on fire?” After saying so many things in the foregoing chapters, he showed them such a picture. </p>

Ordinarily, when there is a great fire, there is also some shining and enlightening. But the Bible says that while the fire was burning on Mount Sinai, there was darkness. This darkness came from two sources: from the thick cloud in the air and from the heavy smoke on the earth. The mingling of the cloud and the smoke produced <span class="pg" data-page-id="591" id="591">[591]</span> a thick darkness. This picture depicts the negative situation of the old covenant. </p>

What is the difference between darkness and gloom? According to my understanding and experience, darkness is objective and gloom is subjective. When darkness is afar off, it remains darkness, but once we enter into it, it becomes gloom. Gloom is an atmosphere in which we dwell. When we enter into darkness and dwell in it, that darkness becomes gloom. Darkness was not only an objective condition for those in the old covenant; it had become the gloom in which they dwelt. </p>
<p data-content-id="PvInMZn3Vp176ChSyFxr3uenL6eI0R_umEl2pfk_yxb2iqBRHJddNGyBQOilH2EXM"> The same is true in our spiritual experience. When we were not seeking the Lord, we were in darkness. But when we began to pursue spiritual things, we immediately had the deep sense that we were in gloom. Before we were revived, we were in darkness. After we were revived, we were in a gloomy situation. If the Hebrew brothers had returned to the old covenant where the darkness was, that darkness would have brought them into gloom. </p>

The sound of a trumpet indicates a warning. Religion is filled with warnings, such as, “Don’t do this or you will go to hell,” or, “Be careful or you will lose your salvation.” In religion, they sound the warning trumpet much more often than they deliver a positive message. Religion always says, “Be careful—don’t do <span class="pg" data-page-id="592" id="592">[592]</span> that,” for in religion there are always many more “don’ts” than “do’s.” The sound of the trumpet is a sign of the poverty of religion. Religion has nothing positive to afford us; it can only warn us negatively. Every religion, including Buddhism, Catholicism, and Protestantism, is the same in principle, sounding warnings and telling us what we should not do. </p>

This scene comprises eight items in four pairs. That these items are arranged in pairs is very meaningful. The six items of the old covenant are presented singly, while the six items of the word of foundation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98747" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">Hebrews 6</span> are arranged in three pairs.

The Greek word rendered “universal gathering” may also be translated as “festal gathering.” This Greek word, <em>paneguris,</em> means universal gathering, whole or full assembly, and is used for a gathering of the people to celebrate a public festival, such as the Olympic games. The entire new covenant age is a festival, and the myriads of angels, who are the ministering spirits rendering service to the heirs of salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98761" data-verses="Hebrews 1:14">1:14</span>) under the new covenant, are a universal festal gathering celebrating the marvelous festival of “so great a salvation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98762" data-verses="Hebrews 2:3">2:3</span>), the greatest and most exciting “game” in the universe.

The kingdom which we are receiving is unshakable (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98806" data-verses="Hebrews 12:28">v. 28</span>). Since this kingdom is unshakable, it is neither of the earth nor of the heavens. This is a strong word. Because we have such a doctrinal mind, we may argue with this statement, saying, “What about the kingdom of heaven? Doesn’t the Bible speak of this?” Yes, the New Testament does speak of the kingdom of the heavens, but it also says that heaven will be shaken (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98807" data-verses="Hebrews 12:26">v. 26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98808" data-verses="Haggai 2:6">Hag. 2:6</span>). That heaven will be shaken proves that the kingdom which we are receiving is not of heaven. Although there seems to be a contradiction between the terms unshakable kingdom and the kingdom of the heavens, later on we shall see that there is actually no contradiction here. </p>

<p data-content-id="o8J_Xe_Oo1DTEOu7_ytt0nPkmvNr4zswpHSO-jDOTVFBVk47Q4_e4i6jscHWlhJOs"> The kingdom is actually the Lord Himself as the kingship within us. We have seen that faith is the Lord Himself as the believing element within us. Now, in the same principle, the kingdom is the Lord Himself as the kingship. As a help in realizing this matter, let us read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98816" data-verses="Daniel 2:34-35">Daniel 2:34 and 35</span>. “Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.” The stone cut without hands is the heavenly Christ who was cut on the cross without human hands. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98817" data-verses="Daniel 2:44">Verse 44</span>, referring to the toes of the image, says, “In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98818" data-verses="Daniel 2:45">Verse 45</span> also speaks of the stone, saying, “The stone was cut out of the mountain without hands” and “it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold.” These verses indicate that the stone, which is Christ, will eventually become a great mountain filling the whole earth. This great mountain is the coming kingdom. Hence, the unshakable kingdom which we are receiving is Christ with His enlargement. <span class="pg" data-page-id="601" id="601">[601]</span> </p>

We repented for the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98824" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">Matt. 3:2</span>). Perhaps when we were saved, we did not hear such a clear gospel. At that time, we were afraid of going to hell and desired to go to heaven. Thus, we repented for heaven. This is the preaching of the wrong gospel, for repentance is not for heaven but for the kingdom. </p>

Suppose you purchase a hamburger at a stand and the cashier gives you too much change. If you are exercised and are ruled by the kingdom, you will return this extra change immediately. This is an experience of the rule of the reality of the kingdom, which is both an exercise and a discipline. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzePohpsR1Uylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> The situation of today’s Christianity is very poor, for many Christians have been drugged, thinking that everything is of grace and that there is no need for training, exercise, or discipline.

Through the years, I have seen the Lord’s grace working in so many of us. I thank <span class="pg" data-page-id="603" id="603">[603]</span> the Lord that there has been a great improvement in His recovery. Nevertheless, we must uplift the standard even higher. If we do this, our cheering angels will be very happy, for they will see a group of believers who are quite serious regarding God’s eternal purpose.

<p data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dnpj6iki8WCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98909" data-verses="Hebrews 10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span> says not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together. As we have pointed out, for the Hebrew believers to forsake the assembling of themselves together with the saints meant that they were forsaking the new covenant way. When the believers assembled themselves together in ancient times, that assembly was the practical and actual church. </p>
<p data-content-id="r-B8nUhR9J6hUII4QNKnEk3lvEL3T1u_Sm-0_l_AMtHeXEMBTrWU2cmFAvJnaebii"> As we have seen, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98910" data-verses="Hebrews 12:18-24">12:18-24</span>, we have a contrast between the sight of the old covenant and the scene of the new covenant. In the scene of the new covenant, we see Mount Zion, God’s holy city, the myriads of celebrating angels, and the church of the firstborn ones. The church is the center of this scene. After the mention of the church, we have the justifying God, the justified spirits of the ancient saints, and Jesus, the Mediator of the better covenant with His precious blood that speaks better than that of Abel. By this we can see that the church is the focus of the scenery of the new covenant. </p>

No one can estimate how much hospitality has built up the Lord’s testimony since the beginning of the Lord’s recovery in this country. Hospitality truly edifies. It brings much new blood into the fellowship of the Body. How we thank the Lord for this! In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98923" data-verses="Romans 12:13">Romans 12:13</span> we are told to pursue hospitality, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98924" data-verses="1Timothy 3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98925" data-verses="Titus 1:8">Titus 1:8</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98926" data-verses="1Peter 4:9">1 Peter 4:9</span> (Gk.) we are admonished to be hospitable.

When one member suffers, all the members sense it and suffer with him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98928" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:26">1 Cor. 12:26</span>). This is the Body life.

However, marriage is a very important factor in the church life. Whether a church is sound and healthy or loses its element and essence is very much dependent upon the marriage life. Do not consider the matter of marriage to be a light thing. We must hold it in honor. This means that we must possess our body, our vessel, in sanctification and honor (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98930" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:3-4">1 Thes. 4:3-4</span>), that “no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98931" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:6">1 Thes. 4:6</span>). In the church life, the brothers and sisters must contact one another in a holy way. This means that we honor our marriage and others’ marriage. To honor marriage means to possess our body in sanctification and honor and to flee fornication. <span class="pg" data-page-id="614" id="614">[614]</span> </p>

Hence, for our protection from falling into defilement, we must hold marriage in honor and not behave loosely. This is a matter which seriously affects our birthright in God’s economy. Reuben lost it due to his defilement (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98932" data-verses="Genesis 49:3-4">Gen. 49:3-4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98933" data-verses="1Chronicles 5:1">1 Chron. 5:1</span>), and Joseph received it because of his purity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98934" data-verses="1Chronicles 5:1">1 Chron. 5:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98935" data-verses="Genesis 39:7-12">Gen. 39:7-12</span>).

We should always be satisfied with our circumstances that we may not be distracted from the church life by mammon.

Before I come to this matter, however, I am burdened to say a further word about the way, the race, and the paths, particularly about the one race becoming the many paths. </p>
<p data-content-id="GZ-Xs1QsCoQof4c8ULP1E8jxGzcb8E7KkBAeRYnN9vmNPkf2OrDQ2hBVPHBKl6cA3"> By looking at the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle, we can see how Christ is the way and the race, and how the one race becomes many paths. As we have seen, the altar and the laver are in the outer court; the showbread table, the lampstand, and the incense altar are in the Holy Place; and the ark, containing the golden pot, the budding rod, and the table of the testimony, is in the Holy of Holies. The altar, laver, incense altar, and ark form a line, and the showbread table and the lampstand form an intersecting line. These two lines form a cross. Each of these items signifies an aspect of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ce50k8tQiJj2hm-zVHrfC1gS-scsx9bxTn4PDYyUCKmXbgGgJ_N3tdzwHbUeZPInF"> Consider the experience of a sinner who comes to Christ. Firstly, he comes to the altar where he kneels down, makes confession, and takes Christ as his substitute, Redeemer, and Savior. Here at the altar he begins to enjoy Christ. After experiencing Christ at the altar, he goes to the laver, which signifies that the Redeemer has become the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98959" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98960" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>), and there he experiences the washing of the living water. The washing of the water in the laver is different from the washing of the blood at the altar. The blood at the altar washes away our sins; the water of the laver washes away the earthly dirt. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyE_GanTLCZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH"> While many Christians go back and forth between the altar and the laver, the laver and the altar, we need to take a <span class="pg" data-page-id="620" id="620">[620]</span> straight path into the Holy Place. Once we are in the Holy Place, we make a right turn to the showbread table where we enjoy Christ as the bread of life. Before coming into the church, we never heard that Christ was eatable. But the Lord Jesus said, “I am the bread of life,” and “He who eats Me shall also live because of Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98961" data-verses="John 6:48">John 6:48</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98962" data-verses="John 6:57">57</span>, Recovery Version). Now, after coming into the church, we have been helped to eat Christ, to feed on Him, and even to masticate Him. After feeding on Christ at the showbread table, we must make an about-face and take a straight path to the lampstand. Here at the lampstand we are enlightened by the light of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98963" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span>), that is, by the light which comes from feeding on Christ. At the lampstand we make another about-face to the central line, and then make a left turn and go to the incense altar to experience Christ in resurrection as the sweet fragrance by which we are accepted of God. This experience of the incense altar will then usher us directly into the Holy of Holies. In the tabernacle we can see several paths: the path from the cross to the laver, from the laver to the showbread table, from the showbread table to the lampstand, from the lampstand to the incense altar, and from the incense altar to the ark in the Holy of Holies. Once we are in the Holy of Holies, we are in the shekinah glory. But we should not stop there. We must proceed even further and experience all the contents of the ark, feeding upon Christ as the hidden manna, partaking of Him as the budding rod, and experiencing the working of the law of life. As we have seen, the working of the law of life will make us the corporate reproduction of God’s standard model for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. All the paths from the altar in the outer court to the ark in the Holy of Holies are the way for us to have the fulfillment of God’s economy and the enjoyment of the birthright. Ultimately, it is the way into perfection, glorification, and the full taste of God. Everything we need is on this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="Exk_X4ZwoNzpPcXz877bLlzOsefhZJx0Y8sYmtn5wXIbTlFsXe1YOEcisvE2Ef8z5"> Once we are on this way, we should not linger or hesitate. We must run the race, forgetting Judaism, Christianity, and every other religion. As soon as we start to run on the way, it <span class="pg" data-page-id="621" id="621">[621]</span> becomes a race composed of many paths. The path from the altar to the laver, from the laver to the showbread table, from the showbread table to the lampstand, from the lampstand to the incense altar, and from the incense altar to the ark—these are the paths which compose God’s unique way. </p>
<p data-content-id="D0hW7peMyKatW3Yyp1pjW3a1rmZR3tlI4jM_n3qZwVMLHLzSUtNKlGG2jUwn-109y"> Why do we need so many turns in Christ as the way? Because we need the cross to eliminate all the negative things in us. I have already pointed out that the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle forms the symbol of the cross. The way in Christ is in the shape of a cross. In fact, the way even is the cross. When we begin at the altar in the outer court, we are filled with many negative things, such as sin, the world, the flesh, lusts, and Satan. But as we move along the paths, making all the turns, these negative things are crossed out. Once we reach the ark in the Holy of Holies we are a purified person. I say again that all the negative things are crossed out by the turns which form the paths. What remains after making all these turns is a resurrected, uplifted humanity which is suitable to be mingled with divinity. How marvelous this is! Only God could have designed it. </p>
<p data-content-id="SX28q2m5JZZaou8YzwMxgnPhsHe9-jFM-0R967a0R103rK0Jy6qGdc5kFkKIhC-VV"> Now we may come to the experiences of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98964" data-verses="Hebrews 13:8-15">13:8-15</span>. Since so many things have been covered in the first twelve chapters of Hebrews, why does the writer include the experiences of Christ found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98965" data-verses="Hebrews 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>? Because the Judaizers were using a certain aspect of their religious ceremonies—the eating of the festival food—to attract the Hebrew believers. According to the Old Testament, the children of Israel came to Jerusalem three times a year for the worship of God in their annual feasts, coming together to feast for several days. In these feasts they ate the festival food. This eating together, which was a very attractive thing, is the background of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98966" data-verses="Hebrews 13:9">verse 9</span>, which says, “Do not be carried away with various and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be confirmed by grace, not by foods, in which those who walked were not profited.” The word “food” mentioned here is in contrast with “grace” and refers to the foods of the ceremonial observances of the old covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="98967" data-verses="Hebrews 9:10">9:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98968" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">Col. 2:16</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="622" id="622">[622]</span>) which the Judaizers used in their attempts to carry away the Hebrew believers from the enjoyment of grace, which is the participation in Christ in the new covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="gGi1krUjO5_vgHIvZGO2-qVummwBZa_k8hB0IkA8RvqDpYwLHDRb1TMHp4sIipHHx"> At the time of their festivals, all the Israelites were excited, much more excited than Americans and Europeans are at Christmas time. It was very difficult for the seekers of Christ to stay away from such a charming attraction. The Judaizers might have come to the Hebrew believers, saying, “In a few days the feast of tabernacles will begin. If you don’t go, you will lose all the enjoyment. Where will you be while we are singing, dwelling together, and enjoying all the riches of the good land? You will be assembling with that church in a little house. What will you have to eat there? If you go there, you will lose the right to kill the sacrifices for your eating. If you want to eat, you must go with us to the temple. But you have given up our precious feast. This means that you so-called Christians have lost all this enjoyment.” If you were a Jew and had been there at the time, could you have withstood this attraction? Most of us would have been unable to resist. Then a fellow believer might have come to the Hebrew Christians, saying, “Don’t go back to the temple. If you do, you will fall away from the grace of God. Don’t listen to the strange teachings about the food in our old religion. Christ is the reality. He is everything.” In the midst of such a dilemma, the Hebrew believers did not know what to do. Because of this, the writer gave them a strong word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="98969" data-verses="Hebrews 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. </p>

We must enter within the veil and go outside the camp. Within the veil there is one unique place—the Holy of Holies. When we are within the veil, we are within the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies, the unique place, there is one unique thing—the ark of testimony, which is the full symbol of Christ. Inside this unique item are three precious things: the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of the testimony, that is, the law of life which issues in God’s expression and testimony. This brief word, which opens a very wide field, tells us the meaning of the phrase “within the veil.” To be within the veil is to be in the Holy of Holies, in a realm where we partake of Christ and enjoy the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of life which issues in God’s corporate expression. This is the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCC6LKK1fQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99017" data-verses="Hebrews 13:13">Hebrews 13:13</span> says, “Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.” Both in this book and in typology the camp signifies the organization of religion, which is human and earthly. To go outside the camp means to go outside the human organization of religion. While the camp signifies the human organization, the city signifies the earthly realm. In the book of Hebrews, both the gate and the camp signify the Jewish religion with its two aspects, the earthly and the human. Judaism is both earthly and human. Every religion is both a human organization <span class="pg" data-page-id="632" id="632">[632]</span> and an earthly realm which keeps people away from God’s economy. </p>

On the other hand, many religious things are taking place inside the camp. All we can see in the camp are just the religious things. Although many of the things in the camp may be related to the Bible, God is not there. Inside the camp, that is, in the organization of religion, there are no angels, church, Savior, saved ones, Christ, or sprinkled blood. Rather, there is a mountain set on fire producing a thick darkness and gloom, there is a whirlwind which moves without direction or peace, and there is the terrifying sound of a trumpet with the fearful words of warning. This is the picture of the Jewish religion as portrayed in this book. In all the foregoing messages we have seen a very vivid picture of what is within the veil on the one side and of the religious things in the camp on the other side. Now we all must choose where we shall be—within the veil or within the camp. We cannot be neutral. </p>
<p data-content-id="UvHxaxNuLE_DSI-qcDzePoRppCFUylwy9_wHnjE6jX5KKVUpL6muzNffEpzyMi7gT"> The book of Hebrews instructs and charges us to come forward to the Holy of Holies and to enter within the veil. The way into the Holy of Holies, a new and living way, has been slain. Hence, this book firstly ushers us into the Holy of Holies and then directs us to go outside the camp. According to our mental figuration, we firstly go outside the camp and then enter within the veil. But this is our human mathematics. According to God’s mathematics, we firstly enter within the veil and only then can we go outside the camp. Everyone who has gone outside the camp has firstly experienced what is within the veil. Perhaps when you began to come to the meetings of the church, you were not yet outside the camp. You were simply coming within the veil to have a taste. But that taste attracted you, caught you, and supplied you with the energy to go outside the camp. No one has firstly gone outside the camp and then entered within the veil. Although the Lord Jesus firstly went outside the gate and then entered within the veil, it is exactly the opposite with us. In other words, firstly we enter into the Holy of <span class="pg" data-page-id="633" id="633">[633]</span> Holies, where we are strengthened and encouraged to go outside the camp, and then we go out of the organization of religion. The more we enter within the veil, the more we go outside the camp. </p>

Of course, we can only do this by exercising our spirit. As we have seen, our spirit is joined to the heavenly Holy of Holies. When we turn to our spirit and exercise it, we enter within the veil. Here we participate in the heavenly ministry of the heavenly Christ.

After God created man, He did not do anything with him, nor did He charge him to do anything for Him. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99063" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span>, the basic requirement for living in the presence of God is to eat properly. What matters the most in God’s presence is what and how we eat. Hence, in the Bible eating is a basic concept concerning our relationship with God. God has created everything, including man. If He can make the heavens and the earth and billions of items, what is there that He cannot do? He can easily do everything. Actually, there is even no need for Him to do anything, for He just speaks and what He desires comes into being. Nevertheless, there is one thing which God cannot do—He cannot eat for us. Although a mother may do many things for her children, she cannot eat for them. The children must eat for themselves. As far as our relationship with God is concerned, the basic matter is eating properly. </p>

After man fell, God came in to redeem him. But when God brought in redemption in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99065" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>, the eating was <span class="pg" data-page-id="644" id="644">[644]</span> changed to include more than just the one item, the tree of life. Eating was no longer simply to have the supply of life; it was also related to redemption. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99066" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span> the children of Israel were instructed to eat a lamb. The tree of life is of the vegetable life, and a lamb is of the animal life. While there is no blood with a tree, there is blood with a lamb. In the Bible, blood is for redemption. At the time of the exodus, the children of Israel struck the blood that they might be redeemed and they ate the lamb that they might have the life supply. In the first stage, eating was only for man’s life supply, but in the second stage, eating was for both redemption and the life supply. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="w1lX7tlyWBsF0NxP4AMPZOhpFqcwIR00vHFgifpHSUNUQWMWwSH-RHhneGULoSRFm">EATING THE LORD’S FLESH<br/>AND DRINKING HIS BLOOD</h2><p data-content-id="MIJlxkLQwGUFWpXbCXJwDt1pzcFJswqiU3Ejc76p9XUT9kubZPaV9POS3G28RP-sM"> During the years in the wilderness, the children of Israel ate manna. Since there certainly was no blood in the manna, the eating of manna was unrelated to redemption; it was altogether for the life supply. How could the children of Israel, who wandered in the wilderness for forty years, continue to live and move? They lived and moved by the supply of manna which they ate every day. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99067" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> of John, the Lord Jesus said, “I am the bread of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99068" data-verses="John 6:35">v. 35</span>). This troubled the Jews. Then the Lord said, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99069" data-verses="John 6:53">v. 53</span>, Recovery Version). In this chapter the Lord firstly said that He was the bread of life. Then He said that we must drink His blood. How could the bread have blood in it? This bread is not only the bread of the vegetable life but also the meat of the lamb. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99070" data-verses="John 6:51">John 6:51</span> the Lord said, “The bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world” (Recovery Version). The bread is of the vegetable life and is only for feeding; the flesh is of the animal life and is not only for feeding but also for redeeming. Before the fall of man, the Lord was the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99071" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>), only for feeding man. After man fell into sin, the Lord became the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99072" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>), <span class="pg" data-page-id="645" id="645">[645]</span> not only for feeding man, but also for redeeming him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99073" data-verses="Exodus 12:4">Exo. 12:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99074" data-verses="Exodus 12:7-8">7-8</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VoUg28D1qTo1-E8gHGL-iaKYCEGzlV27DDzmpKRBPD4Czdl_Ha5nf11m4yDW7weKr">THE NEED TO KEEP EATING</h2><p data-content-id="iP_bgkHD-VyM-lbYNnOmiuoNq3-wBR5Dynf2bHQ8WpjrkRIRPrECHRAQWFcx0WQUb"> I want to say again that after the creation of man and even in God’s redemption of man, the basic concept regarding our being in the presence of God is this matter of eating. Thus, we must devote our complete attention to it. Do not try to learn so many things—just continue to eat well in the presence of the Lord. I was a Christian for over thirty years before I knew anything about eating in the spirit. I was never taught about this. Many of us can testify that before we came into the church, we were never told that we could eat Jesus. But from beginning to end, the Bible covers the matter of eating. The Bible begins and ends with the eating of the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99075" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Rev. 2:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99076" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">22:1-2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99077" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">14</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="19J7BMpUdAP-KQCUvDLCnXz_QkvZvr1TF44VGLYr0Wq30Cf62POCZtTmD67IMB8WQ">EATING IN THE BOOK OF HEBREWS</h2><p data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41cyUZ9nIMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg"> As we have pointed out, the entire book of Hebrews is focused on Christ as the heavenly Minister with His kingly and divine priesthood. As our heavenly Minister, His main responsibility is to minister the Triune God into us as our supply. He is now ministering such a wonderful supply, not in the outer court, but in the Holy of Holies, and not on the cross, but on the throne of grace. We have seen that the book of Hebrews calls us to come forward to the Holy of Holies, to the throne of grace, and to God. In the Holy of Holies we are not gathered around the cross for redemption; we are meeting around the throne of grace for the life supply. Here we enjoy Christ as our Melchisedec ministering to us the bread and wine as our life supply. This also is absolutely a matter of eating. Hence, this book brings us from the outer court to the Holy of Holies, where there is one unique item—the ark of testimony, which represents Christ. In the Holy of Holies there is nothing but the all-inclusive Christ. According to the outward appearance, He is only one item, the ark of testimony. But when we experience Him as the ark, we see not <span class="pg" data-page-id="646" id="646">[646]</span> only one unique item; we see three items—the golden pot containing manna, the budding rod, and the law of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXr__BXra_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB"> These three items are the kernels within the kernel. After entering into the tabernacle, we find ourselves in the Holy Place where everything is rather outward. After passing through the second veil, we enter into the inner chamber of the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies. Once we have come into the Holy of Holies, we are in the heart, the kernel, of the tabernacle. But within the Holy of Holies we have the ark of testimony, and within the ark we have the golden pot containing manna, the budding rod, and the law of life. Because these items are all in the ark in the Holy of Holies, we may say that they are the kernels within the kernel. </p>
<p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdhnmf_C5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> As we touch the first of these items, the golden pot containing manna, we find something even deeper. After passing through four layers, the layer of the tabernacle, the layer of the Holy of Holies, the layer of the ark of testimony, and the layer of the golden pot, we come to the manna. When we touch this, we have truly come home. If we are only in the Holy of Holies but are not feeding on the manna in the golden pot, we are not yet home. Even if we touch the ark of testimony, we are still not home. The tabernacle is for the Holy of Holies, the Holy of Holies is for the ark, the ark is for the golden pot, and the golden pot is for the hidden manna. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99078" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">Revelation 2:17</span> the Lord Jesus said, “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna.” Where is this hidden manna? It is in the golden pot which is in the ark in the Holy of Holies. The one main kernel, the living kernel among all the kernels, is the hidden manna. The Lord Jesus promised His overcomers that they would eat this hidden manna. </p>

If anyone overcomes degraded Christianity, the Lord will give him the hidden manna. Nearly everything mentioned in the book of Revelation, including the manna, can be found in the Old Testament. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99101" data-verses="Exodus 16:32-33">Exodus 16:32 and 33</span>, referring to the manna, say, “Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations.” The Lord commanded that an omer of manna be put into a pot. An omer is “the tenth part of an ephah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99102" data-verses="Exodus 16:36">Exo. 16:36</span>). An ephah is a complete unit, and an omer is one tenth of a unit. This small portion was put into a pot and laid up before the testimony to be kept (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99103" data-verses="Exodus 16:34">Exo. 16:34</span>). In Exodus, the testimony means the two tables of the law which were put into the ark. The omer of manna was put in front of the testimony, meaning that it was quite close to the ark. This portion of the manna became the hidden manna. </p>
<p data-content-id="-7psJDqorOUFFwhmtN2Meg8-IRc6BT4LW0n2K-L9dRY0OI1PJD-NzRXLSV8ZtC8nS"> Manna came from heaven, from God, as a gift to His <span class="pg" data-page-id="656" id="656">[656]</span> people. It was not a temporary gift; it was a gift lasting for forty years. Morning after morning, this gift came down from heaven to feed and satisfy the children of Israel. After they had been satisfied, God seemed to say, “Take an omer of what you have enjoyed and put it before Me as a testimony and a reminder that the coming generations may be reminded that you enjoyed this heavenly food as you wandered in the wilderness.” The open manna, the people’s portion, came from God, and the hidden manna, God’s portion, was offered back to God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pnhep-1swI5hHB5N847IfSpHbRjODfkFej5Ckh2HbQV2ZFXVzDLdqnlvjBn5DFN_h">THE TITHE OF THE PRODUCE<br/>OF THE LAND</h2><p data-content-id="vvH6kqkWv0LiOnukKEMGC-8vVFQsfntYG48DDNK1hDHq13fLIKdzfbEMhq1Yl4LO_"> Now we need to consider the tithe, the basic concept of one tenth of the produce. The children of Israel were required to take the top tenth, the choicest portion of their produce in the good land, and offer it to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99104" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:22-23">Deut. 14:22-23</span>). All the produce came from God. God ordained that one tenth of the produce which He had given the children of Israel be offered back to Him. The majority of the produce was for the people, but the tithe was offered to God as His portion. The tithe which was offered to God went to the priests and the Levites (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99105" data-verses="Numbers 18:21">Num. 18:21</span>) who in turn took a tenth of the tithe they received and offered it to God. This tenth of the tenth went to the high priest who ministered in the Holy of Holies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99106" data-verses="Numbers 18:26">Num. 18:26</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99107" data-verses="Numbers 18:28-29">28-29</span>). I repeat, the children of Israel offered one tenth of their produce to God as His portion. After this had been offered to God, it was given to the serving ones, to the priests and Levites who served the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites then took one tenth of this top tenth and offered it to God. It was then given to the high priest who ministered in the Holy of Holies. The Levites who served in the outer court and the priests who served in the outer court and in the Holy Place could only enjoy the tenth offered by the children of Israel. Only the high priest who served in the Holy of Holies was privileged to enjoy the tenth of the tenth, the topmost portion of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="657" id="657">[657]</span> produce of the good land. Thus, the more we serve, the more we shall enjoy the topmost portion, God’s portion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LGAsRH_pwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR">THE HIDDEN MANNA BEING GOD’S PORTION</h2><p data-content-id="0LzTaf-UCCdfAz45OTRufdRTMnpWe9bD9g-xeDycbaQml7QnmCMyvs8NwZmgFWFwe"> When the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, God gave them manna from heaven as a gift every day (except the Sabbath day). They all enjoyed this gift of manna. Then God seemed to say, “Take a portion, one tenth of an ephah, of the manna I have given you and place it before My testimony.” This portion of the manna was for God. The open manna was the people’s portion, and this offered, hidden manna in the pot before God’s testimony was God’s portion. The principle was the same with offering the produce after the children of Israel had entered into the good land. Once they were in the land, God no longer sent manna from heaven, for the good land provided all that was needed for their living. Thus, instead of gathering the manna, they harvested the produce of the good land. Regarding this, God seemed to say, “Give Me as My portion a tenth of all the produce you have harvested.” The children of Israel did so, giving this one tenth to the priests and the Levites who served in and around the tabernacle. Then God told the priests and the Levites to take one tenth of what they received from the people and offer it to God. This portion, which we may call the top of the top, was then given to the high priest as his portion. Only the high priest, the one serving in the Holy of Holies, was privileged to enjoy this topmost portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="7jd7JxYu3HksSKr4QbwSj7qENV1lrkuZWozXhPoomFiFg9DTFF4MA6D0nrSqDBm76"> Based upon this principle, we see that the hidden manna is the portion for God. The basic concept of the hidden manna is that it is God’s portion. In the past, I was troubled whenever I read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99108" data-verses="Exodus 16:36">Exodus 16:36</span>, which says, “Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.” I thought that this verse was unnecessary and wondered why Moses included it. I could not understand the significance of an omer of manna being placed in a pot and put in front of the testimony of God. But just recently the Lord enlightened me about this, and I saw that the tenth is the choice portion, the portion for God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="658" id="658">[658]</span> Manna signifies Christ whom God has given to us as a gift. While we are enjoying Christ as our manna, we must take the best portion and offer it to God, offering Christ to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="_e_6LkqX4ESYXvpCAEx2_pLDptLfnFOOjmtosmeLh6BrByUxfmVVcsvBL-SDunVSX"> If we would eat the hidden manna, we must firstly eat the open manna. If we do not experience the open manna, we shall have no manna to offer God as the hidden manna. The hidden manna is the very manna which we experience, enjoy, and then offer to God. Eventually, because we are so intimate with God, He will say, “Come into My dining room and dine with Me.” Do not think that you will suddenly enjoy Christ as your hidden manna if you have never enjoyed Him as your open manna. No, the hidden manna comes out of our enjoyment of the open manna. We enjoy manna and, out of the manna we enjoy, we offer a small portion to God, saying, “God, I offer to You the very Christ whom I have been enjoying. You have given Christ to me as my portion, and now I give the best of Him to You as Your portion.” To this God will say, “Child, come into My Holy of Holies and enjoy this portion with Me.” This is the hidden manna. </p>
<p data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0JnYZMdNUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW"> Let us consider our experience. When we enjoy Christ in a general way as our daily supply, we spontaneously desire to offer the very Christ whom we have enjoyed back to God, saying, “O God, how I thank You for the Christ whom You have given me. I have enjoyed Him very much. Now I would like to offer the best portion of Him to You.” This is the omer of manna, the choice portion of the manna which is offered back to God. This portion is not for all of God’s people; it is only for those who serve Him in a very intimate way in the Holy of Holies. This is the hidden manna, which comes out of the manna we enjoy in a general way. </p>

<p data-content-id="H4ftD0nM_HqTnTBTZI6vj_bDYR-OM11qPJmRIviZqwZm5FkPIartulj8dlWnhx9NX"> In this message we need to consider some principles regarding spiritual food. The eating of spiritual food altogether depends upon the distance between us and the Lord. This distance determines how much spiritual food we can eat. If we are far off from the Lord, we cannot partake of any spiritual food. When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they could not eat the manna, because the manna was the spiritual food for God’s people in the wilderness. Those who were in the wilderness were closer to God than those who were in Egypt. At that time, God was not in Egypt; He was in the wilderness. If anyone wanted to partake of spiritual food, the heavenly manna, he had to leave Egypt and go into the wilderness. As long as the Israelites were in Egypt, they had no spiritual food. Even if an Israelite was in the wilderness, he still had to be near the camp of the children of Israel in order to partake of the manna. If he was far away from the camp, it would have been difficult for him to enjoy the heavenly manna. Anyone who wanted to eat the manna had to camp with the children of Israel. By this we see that the distance between us and the Lord is a very important matter in the enjoyment of spiritual food. </p>
<p data-content-id="XAU_tcFqOKo9rmOP3ZbnQ0-SUbnirXynnH0CT7HqmYcBXJkMfDQnpAZCXXL7WbCkY"> The manna came down near the camp, and only those who had come out of Egypt and who were camping with God’s people had the privilege of enjoying it. After the children of Israel had enjoyed the manna, God commanded the Israelites to present an omer of manna to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99117" data-verses="Exodus 16:33">Exo. 16:33</span>). The manna had come from God to them, and they offered a portion of it back to God. What is the hidden manna? The <span class="pg" data-page-id="666" id="666">[666]</span> hidden manna is simply the top portion of the manna given by God and offered back to God. It is the special portion of manna. Once the manna had been presented to God, it was no longer the open manna; it had become the hidden manna because, after being presented to God, it was placed in a golden pot and hidden in the ark in the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle. Originally, the manna was under the sky in the open air. It was open to anything and anyone. But after the top portion had been presented to God and placed in the pot, it was hidden within the innermost part of the tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, where it was placed before the testimony of God. Among the children of Israel was the tabernacle, within the tabernacle was the Holy of Holies, within the Holy of Holies was the ark, within the ark was the golden pot, and within the pot was the manna. Hence, manna was altogether hidden. In this way, the top portion of manna became hidden. </p>
<p data-content-id="klFSgkmZ7z6TtXkmgUNGl-b1zzdo0ptrC0ipW-rLe2wiLoKboQqxl2qT2E6BWveTU"> Suppose you are an Israelite who has come out of Egypt and who is camping with God’s people. You have the privilege of eating the open manna, but you do not have the right to enjoy the hidden manna. Because you are far off from the innermost chamber of the tabernacle, you do not have the right to enjoy the hidden manna. Where is God? He is in the Holy of Holies, in the innermost chamber of the tabernacle. Compared with the Egyptians and the others in the wilderness, you are closer to God. But, being outside the outer court of the tabernacle, you are not that close to Him. Although you may eventually come into the outer court, you still cannot enter into the Holy Place, much less into the Holy of Holies. If you are a priest, you may be in the Holy Place and be closer to God than the Levites who are serving in the outer court. Nevertheless, although you may be a priest ministering in the Holy Place, you are not yet in the Holy of Holies. Thus, there is still a distance between you and God. If you want to enjoy the hidden manna, there must be no distance between you and God. All the distance between you and the Lord must be eliminated. </p>
<p data-content-id="J1JYlwCOelExNYExkRji8y3kVeJ67hWsK8o7BCO9o5g1KcqitJI9Vxej8NhnohsR2"> In this message I do not care to explain what the hidden <span class="pg" data-page-id="667" id="667">[667]</span> manna is, for the more I explain it, the more troubled you will be. Rather, I would ask this question: how close are you to the Lord? Is there still a distance between you and Him? If there is, you may enjoy the open manna, but you cannot eat the hidden manna. If we would partake of the hidden manna, there must be no distance between us and the Lord. This matter of distance is quite exposing. Although we may not know what the hidden manna is, we do know how far we are from the Lord. Where are you? Are you in Egypt? Are you in the wilderness, or across the street from the tabernacle? Are you in the outer court, the Holy Place, or the Holy of Holies? If we are honest, some would say that they are in the outer court of the church life. Even in the church life there are sections: the section of the outer court, the section of the Holy Place, and the section of the Holy of Holies. Even in the Holy of Holies there are some small sections. If you are in the outer court or in the Holy Place of the church life, you cannot touch the hidden manna. You can only eat the sacrifices on the altar or the showbread on the table. You are still not in the place where the hidden manna is. </p>
<p data-content-id="z7nP6wvdoRcXW7_4yqTmlVEPzmq7mFR7fpfSTniJz1DC07eXfxsSNj_pn0tdjMZNa"> After the children of Israel had entered into the good land, they ate the produce of the land. In the Old Testament we are told clearly that all the children of Israel who were in the good land could partake of the produce of the land at any time. But anyone who was outside the border of the land had no right to enjoy this produce. Here again we see the matter of distance. When the children of Israel came together to eat at the time of the three yearly feasts, they did not eat the general produce, but the portion of the produce which was purposely reserved for the feast. At ordinary times, the Israelites enjoyed the common portion. At the time of the feasts, however, they enjoyed the special portion, the one top tenth, because they were closer to God, having come together to meet around God’s dwelling place where they enjoyed the top portion of the produce of the good land, which they had offered to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99118" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:17-18">Deut. 12:17-18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99119" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:22-23">14:22-23</span>). Another tenth of their produce was given to the priests and the Levites who served in the outer court or in the Holy Place and who were <span class="pg" data-page-id="668" id="668">[668]</span> closer to God than most of the people were. Thus, the closer an Israelite was to God, the better was his enjoyment of the spiritual food. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99120" data-verses="Numbers 18:26-28">Numbers 18:26-28</span>, after the priests and the Levites received the tithe, they offered one tenth of the tenth to the Lord. This topmost portion, which was offered to God as a heave offering, was then given to the high priest who ministered to God in the Holy of Holies. Since he was the one closest to God, he had the right to enjoy the topmost portion of the produce of the good land. </p>

<p data-content-id="0LzTaf-UCCdfAz45OTRucfRTI1ZWe9bD9g-xeDycbaQml7QnmCMyvs8NwZmgFWFwe"> In this message we come to the matter of the budding rod (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99123" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Heb. 9:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99124" data-verses="Numbers 17:1-10">Num. 17:1-10</span>). Not many Christians have realized the full significance of the budding rod. Many simply regard the record of the budding rod as an interesting Bible story of a piece of dried wood that budded, blossomed, and yielded fruit overnight. But this incident is not a small point in the divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="7jd7JxYu3HksSKr4QbwSg5qEKH1lrkuZWozXhPoomFiFg9DTFF4MA6D0nrSqDBm76"> Many Christians pay attention to the tabernacle. We have seen that with the tabernacle there are the altar and the laver in the outer court; the showbread table, the lampstand, and the incense altar in the Holy Place; and the ark of testimony in the Holy of Holies. The ark of testimony, the unique unit in the Holy of Holies, signifies Christ as the unique testimony of God. The contents of the ark comprise three items: the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the tables of the law. In the three previous messages, we have covered the first item, the hidden manna. Many Christians can understand something of the manna, for they know that it is a heavenly food signifying Christ as the bread of life. It is difficult, however, to understand the significance of the budding rod. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_e_6LkqX4ESYXvpCAEx28rLDv_bfnFOOjmtosmeLh6BrByUxfmVVcsvBL-SDunVSX">THREE SYMBOLS OF EXPERIENCES</h2><p data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0KlYZFOtUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW"> The children of Israel had many experiences in the wilderness, and the Lord commanded them to place in His presence symbols of three of the experiences through which they passed. These symbols were the tables of testimony, the manna, and the budding rod. After the Israelites had received the law at Mount Sinai, the Lord told them to put <span class="pg" data-page-id="676" id="676">[676]</span> the two tables of the law into the ark (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99125" data-verses="Exodus 34:1">Exo. 34:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99126" data-verses="Exodus 34:29">29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99127" data-verses="Exodus 25:21">25:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99128" data-verses="Exodus 40:20">40:20</span>). An omer full of manna was put in a pot and laid up before the Lord to be kept (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99129" data-verses="Exodus 16:32-34">Exo. 16:32-34</span>). In the wilderness, the children of Israel also passed through some experiences of rebellion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99130" data-verses="Numbers 16:1">Numbers 16</span> is an account of the most serious rebellion. Out of that rebellion came the budding rod, which was put before the testimony, which was in the ark, as a sign (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99131" data-verses="Numbers 17:10-11">Num. 17:10-11</span>). By this we see that each of these items came out of the experiences of the Israelites. They were not teachings, but the issue, the outcome, of their experiences. Thus, if we try to understand these three items by our mentality and for the purpose of acquiring knowledge, we shall not succeed. We can only understand them in, with, and for our experiences. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dnqi6ioi8WCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0">THE FOCUS OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="Qpdn89MhLxfVrIv8GWTBaVCsULQ55oZqOEuk2qvXDTa4ELyWoRmN1r_WYV01cf7Lc"> If we would understand the budding rod, we must have a little background. God’s purpose is to gain a collective people to be His corporate expression to express and represent Him that He might have a dominion, a kingdom, in which to carry out His eternal economy. Many people think that God had a partial love for the Jews, working for them and doing things for them, and that He did not care for the Gentiles. This is a religious concept; it is not the focus of the divine revelation. The focus of the divine revelation is that the eternal God has a purpose. This purpose is to gain a people as a corporate unit to contain Him, to be one with Him, and to let Him be one with them that they might be the living expression of the invisible God, and that God might have a kingdom on earth to carry out His economy for His glory and to deal with His enemy. This was God’s purpose when He called the children of Israel out of Egypt, making them a chosen and a called people. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw_Tm7rfTq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF">THE NEED OF LEADERSHIP<br/>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF GOD’S PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="lkvZM26z559Bj3lTSOUy8dJup6kXSx0PljTjoOkXjCBX2Rdfb66sdAUBGOBf9pyrf"> As such a people outside of Egypt, the Israelites were walking in the wilderness toward God’s goal. The children of <span class="pg" data-page-id="677" id="677">[677]</span> Israel were at least a few million in number, for the male warriors alone numbered more than six hundred thousand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99132" data-verses="Numbers 1:45-46">Num. 1:45-46</span>). Since the number of the Israelites was so great, there was certainly the need, as there is today, for the building up of God’s people. For the building up of the people of God, there was, in turn, the need for some authority. Using today’s term, there was the need of leadership. As we shall see, God did not only raise up this leadership—He built it up. The leadership among the children of Israel was a corporate leadership comprising at least two men: Moses, representing the aspect of dominion and kingship, and Aaron, representing the aspect of image and priesthood. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ONTNfoex8_cVo12DfRG57kHGKHPSxsp3NoQW_8wi-97vKUKUb_GzJXFfUITjZc8rP">THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE KINGSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="4reRc8xEUdB8gspB5LzSWFI2TMhcoBqXNha6kcLoR0GcevFpPwoI5sDlLglcpJmid"> In order for God’s people to express God and to represent Him, there must be both the priesthood and the kingship. Even the New Testament tells us clearly that in God’s redemption He has made us priests and kings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99133" data-verses="Revelation 1:5-6">Rev. 1:5-6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99134" data-verses="Revelation 5:9-10">5:9-10</span>). Thus, we have the priesthood and we are in the kingship. We have the priesthood so that we may express God. This is related to the image of God. The kingship is for God’s dominion. God created man in His image and gave him dominion over all the creatures (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99135" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). This is the kingship for God’s kingdom. In the church today there is still the need of the priesthood to express God and the kingship to represent God. In the coming millennial kingdom, we shall also be the priests expressing God and the kings representing God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99136" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">Rev. 20:6</span>). Furthermore, for eternity in the New Jerusalem we shall be priests and kings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99137" data-verses="Revelation 22:3-5">Rev. 22:3-5</span>) expressing God through our priesthood and representing Him with His dominion in our kingship. From the first chapter of Genesis through the last chapter of Revelation, the Bible is very consistent about these two aspects of God’s corporate people. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="o8J_Xe_Oo1DTEOu7_ytt3mfkmuNr4zswpHSO-jDOTVFBVk47Q4_e4i6jscHWlhJOs">THE BUILDING UP OF THE LEADERSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="3kUaZWif4GddJ6x0-mt9VcZ_7nBfG_163rGTsaQ8Mae1t0n_om2qIm8zuQfDDDM9E"> Moses, representing the kingship, and Aaron, representing the priesthood, were put together for God’s leadership. As we have already mentioned, they were both raised up and <span class="pg" data-page-id="678" id="678">[678]</span> built up. God did not take Moses and put him into the leadership immediately after he had completed his education in Pharaoh’s palace. No, after Moses had been educated, God brought him into the wilderness where He built up his leadership. Moses was born into a Jewish family and thus received the knowledge concerning God. Since he did not have a worldly education, God raised up the circumstances to enable him to receive the highest education in Pharaoh’s palace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99138" data-verses="Acts 7:22">Acts 7:22</span>). I believe that his education was higher than that of a Ph.D. Although he was so well educated, he was still not qualified to be the leader. During his first forty years, Moses learned of God and gained the world’s best education. After that, he had to spend another forty years in the wilderness in order to be built up as a leader. The Bible does not afford us a clear record regarding the leadership of Aaron, but, in principle, Aaron must have also been under God’s building hand. When Moses told the Lord that he was not eloquent but was “slow of speech, and of a slow tongue” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99139" data-verses="Exodus 4:10">Exo. 4:10</span>), the Lord said that Aaron, his brother, who could speak well, would be unto Moses “instead of a mouth” and that Moses would “be to him instead of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99140" data-verses="Exodus 4:14">Exo. 4:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99141" data-verses="Exodus 4:16">16</span>). Only after Moses and Aaron had been built up as leaders were they able to take the lead. </p>

<p data-content-id="ONTNfoex8_cVo12DfRG57k3GOVfSxsp3NoQW_8wi-97vKUKUb_GzJXFfUITjZc8rP"> As we pointed out in the last message, few Christians have paid attention to the budding rod in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99163" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span>. The reason for this is that the budding rod is a matter of experience. Although we may understand the types of the tabernacle, we cannot know the true significance of the tabernacle until we have had the necessary experiences. As far as the experience of the tabernacle is concerned, the writings and messages of the various Christian teachers mainly speak of the altar. But once we go on from the altar to the Holy Place, we find that not many have touched the real experiences there. Thus, throughout the years, the three items in the ark in the Holy of Holies have remained a mystery. Few have even talked about them. Have you ever heard a message on the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the two tables of the law contained in the ark? This shortage is altogether due to the lack of experience. </p>

If we only had <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99164" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span>, we could not see this. But if we consider the first mention of the budding rod in the Old Testament, we shall see that it is fully related to the building up of God’s people. In the previous message we pointed out that for the fulfillment of His purpose God had to have a people as a corporate unit. In the Old Testament, this people was the children of Israel. They were at least a few million in number and had to be built up as one. <span class="pg" data-page-id="688" id="688">[688]</span> According to the record of the history of Israel, they were treated as one unit. The Bible does not say that they were saved individually. No, they were all saved corporately. They held the Passover all together as a corporate people and they all crossed the Red Sea as one unit. Moses did not cross the Red Sea alone, with Aaron following him a few days later. Even as they were wandering in the wilderness, they were a corporate people, not a group of individuals with everyone taking his own way. Moreover, among them was the tabernacle, God’s unique dwelling place. There was not one tabernacle of God in Moses’ backyard and another one in Aaron’s yard. There was just one tabernacle which, as God’s unique dwelling place, was the center for the building up of God’s people. As we have seen, in order for so many to be built up together, there was the need of the leadership. The budding rod is related to this leadership and is for the building up of God’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="3kUaZWif4GddJ6x0-mt9Vcp_y0BfG_163rGTsaQ8Mae1t0n_om2qIm8zuQfDDDM9E"> Korah, who belonged to the tribe of Levi, the same tribe to which Moses and Aaron belonged, considered himself to be equal to Moses and Aaron. Korah might have said, “Moses and Aaron, you are children of Levi. I am, too. I am the same as you are.” Along with Korah, there were Dathan and Abiram, descendants of Reuben, the first son of Jacob. Dathan and Abiram probably thought that because their tribe was the first, they also should be among the leaders. These three men stirred up a great rebellion. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99165" data-verses="Numbers 16:2">Numbers 16:2</span>, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram “rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown.” As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99166" data-verses="Numbers 16:1">Numbers 16</span> indicates, nearly the whole congregation of Israel rebelled against Moses and Aaron. Undoubtedly, that rebellion was the work of the enemy to destroy the building among God’s people. It surely hindered the children of Israel from going on to reach God’s goal. I mention this to show that the budding rod is related to the building up of God’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="GZ-Xs1QsCoQof4c8ULP1H9jxKzcb8E7KkBAeRYnN9vmNPkf2OrDQ2hBVPHBKl6cA3"> When many Christians read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99167" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">Hebrews 9</span>, they pay no attention to the budding rod because among them there is <span class="pg" data-page-id="689" id="689">[689]</span> not the building up of God’s people. I would like to address a question to those who have been Christians for many years: have you ever heard a message telling you that what God needs today is the building up of His people? There is no such thing in today’s Christianity. Because most Christians do not pay attention to this matter of the building, they are not interested in the budding rod. Many today talk about spirituality, gifts, behavior, and speaking in tongues, but who is concerned about the building up of God’s people? Without the building up of His people, there is no way for God to fulfill His purpose. God wants a people that is built up as a unique unit. As the Head, Christ needs the Body, not many separate members. And God needs a house, not a pile of stones. This is what God is after today. If we are not for this, we have neither the standing nor the qualifications to understand the significance of the budding rod. If you have no interest in God’s eternal purpose but are still for the world, everything in this message will merely be vain talk as far as you are concerned. </p>
<p data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssGRzSpFHgzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr"> May the Lord be merciful to us that we may see that what He is seeking today is the building. It is not a question of how spiritual we are, nor how good we are, nor how gifted we are; it is a question of whether or not we have been truly built up with God’s people. Today there is too much religion, too much of the human concept, and too little divine revelation. If we would understand the significance of the budding rod, we must have a heavenly, divine vision that God’s need today is for the building up of His people. What matters to God is not how many people He has, but whether or not they have been built up. If we are here for God’s eternal purpose, then we must see that God’s need is for the building. </p>
<p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7LjAIMwp8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> Consider the tabernacle. There is no building at the altar. What we see at the altar is the sacrifice for redemption. Although this is wonderful, it is not God’s goal. It is the beginning, not the end. As we have seen already, the experience of the tabernacle starts with the altar and consummates with the ark. Within the ark there are three items—the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the tables of the law. At the <span class="pg" data-page-id="690" id="690">[690]</span> altar we see nothing regarding the building. Neither do we have the building at the laver. The washing of the life-giving Spirit at the laver is for the building, but it is not the building itself. </p>
<p data-content-id="PvInMZn3Vp176ChSyFxr0uOnL7eI0R_umEl2pfk_yxb2iqBRHJddNGyBQOilH2EXM"> From the laver we proceed to the showbread table, where there is much food for us to eat. But eating should not simply be for eating; it also must be for the building. The term hidden manna is used only once in the New Testament. It is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99168" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">Revelation 2:17</span> which says, “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone.” This verse indicates that eating the hidden manna transforms us into a white stone. Eating the hidden manna transforms us into an acceptable stone, and this transformation is for God’s building. Eventually, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99169" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> indicates, the eating ones are built into God’s temple. By this we see that eating is for the building. At the showbread table, however, we still do not see the building. Hence, we must not stop here but continue on to our destination. </p>
<p data-content-id="-7psJDqorOUFFwhmtN2MdiM-ODM6BT4LW0n2K-L9dRY0OI1PJD-NzRXLSV8ZtC8nS"> From the showbread table we go to the lampstand and from there to the incense altar. At neither of these two stations do we see the building. Then we enter into the Holy of Holies, touch the ark, and find within it the budding rod. Why was the budding rod not found at the altar? If it were at the altar, you could never have any experience of the ark. If you enter into the Holy of Holies and experience the ark, you will discover that in the ark is a basic item—the budding rod. Following this, we must learn the significance of the budding rod—that it is related to God’s building. If you are seeking the Lord, you must realize that God’s goal is to bring you to the budding rod within the ark in the Holy of Holies. </p>
<p data-content-id="pnhep-1swI5hHB5N847IcQZHSCDODfkFej5Ckh2HbQV2ZFXVzDLdqnlvjBn5DFN_h"> As we have seen, the budding rod signifies that Christ, the resurrected One, should be our life, our living, and the resurrection life within us, and that this life should bud, blossom, and bear almonds. Is the Christ within you budding? Do not say yes doctrinally, but answer according to your experience. Is your Christ budding, blossoming, and bearing almonds, the fruit of resurrection? <span class="pg" data-page-id="691" id="691">[691]</span> </p>

In the past five messages we have somewhat covered the hidden manna and the budding rod. In this message we come to the tables of the law. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gGi1krUjO5_vgHIvZGO29rFui0ABZa_k8hB0IkA8RvqDpYwLHDRb1TMHp4sIipHHx">THE LAW BEING GOD’S TESTIMONY</h2><p data-content-id="eQJD4_jtknWQat9jcVOn8WRt7NNYK_r5XUDNpcDDJV6S5IySpcJb2P-RieMVJy8R6"> In the Bible it is difficult to find the term the tables of the law. The Old Testament frequently speaks of the tables of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99180" data-verses="Exodus 31:18">Exo. 31:18</span>), and the New Testament mentions the tables of the covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99181" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Heb. 9:4</span>). Why was the law called the tables of the testimony and the tables of the covenant? It is quite easy to understand why the law was called the tables of the covenant because in the Old Testament the law was the old covenant. It is difficult, however, to understand why the law was called the tables of the testimony. When God commanded Moses to build the ark (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99182" data-verses="Exodus 25:10">Exo. 25:10</span>), He said, “Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99183" data-verses="Exodus 25:16">Exo. 25:16</span>). The testimony in this verse undoubtedly denotes the law. God did not say to put the law in the ark; He said to put the testimony into it. Because the testimony was placed in the ark, the ark was called the ark of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99184" data-verses="Exodus 25:22">Exo. 25:22</span>). Furthermore, the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99185" data-verses="Numbers 17:8">Num. 17:8</span>, Heb.). Hence, we have the testimony, the ark of the testimony, and the tabernacle of the testimony. When the manna and the budding rod were placed before the law, they were put in front of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99186" data-verses="Exodus 16:34">Exo. 16:34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99187" data-verses="Numbers 17:10">Num. 17:10</span>). Whatever was placed in front of the testimony was before God <span class="pg" data-page-id="700" id="700">[700]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99188" data-verses="Exodus 16:33-34">Exo. 16:33-34</span>), for the testimony could not be separated from Him. When something was before the testimony, it was before God, and when it was before God, it was before the testimony. What is this testimony? We have seen that the ark is called the ark of the testimony and that the tabernacle is called the tabernacle of the testimony. The law was called the testimony because it testified of God. For this reason, it was God’s testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="59tq157xwce1XvZTZYWAGFKtzS6AdhVzhWKgIad9yUQA9xO1kuO2-Z98Caw01EdMR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99189" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> we are told that God created man in His own image. God’s intention is to have an expression through man. This expression is His testimony. Therefore, the testimony of God is the expression of God. It is God expressed. God’s intention has been, still is, and for eternity will be the same—to work Himself into man that He may be expressed and have a testimony. But before God accomplished this, man fell. In his fallen nature, man tried to do good in order to please God. Because of this, God gave man the law. God gave man the law because man did not know that, as a fallen being, he could neither satisfy God nor express Him. After the law was given, however, God immediately changed the term, calling it the testimony. What God gave man was the law, but it was not mainly called the law but the testimony. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99190" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> the word testimony is used many times to denote the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99191" data-verses="Psalms 119:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99192" data-verses="Psalms 119:88">88</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99193" data-verses="Psalms 119:168">168</span>). Every time this word is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99194" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> it refers to the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nra_GgDpimpsPAo0RrC1dOrHXi0642dTAWC_1CYoST56PQUyLyIACiL2qjOnKIM8F"> According to man’s concept, the law means the ten commandments. But God’s intention was not that the law should be some commandments, but that it should be His testimony. When I was in Christianity, I never heard the term testimony used with respect to the law. I only heard about the ten commandments. In Christianity, when many young people are examined for membership in the so-called churches, they must recite the ten commandments. Although you may be able to recite the commandments, perhaps you have never heard that the testimony in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99195" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> is the law. In fact, in the book of the Psalms the word testimony refers to the law. I say once again that in God’s intention and according to His concept, the law is His <span class="pg" data-page-id="701" id="701">[701]</span> testimony. But in the human concept, the law is the ten commandments. If you are trying to keep God’s law, it will certainly be the ten commandments to you. But if you know what life is, and if, instead of trying to keep the law, you walk with God, you will realize that the law is God’s testimony, God’s expression. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="t4L8xEj0I2Syz3opIRVCB7LKG1fQcLIbkhHFLMv5hfhFHVH0NYWJOPYxEA3M3z2Dv">THE TWO ASPECTS OF EVERY LAW</h2><p data-content-id="ce50k8tQiJj2hm-zVHrfB0wS5-8sx9bxTn4PDYyUCKmXbgGgJ_N3tdzwHbUeZPInF"> Every law has two aspects, the aspect of the law-keeper and the aspect of the law-maker. Laws are for people to keep. As we have mentioned several times in the past, the kind of law you make reveals the kind of person you are. If bank robbers could make laws, they would legalize bank robbing. Some legislators want to legalize such an evil thing as prostitution. This reveals that they themselves are evil. Evil lawmakers will enact evil laws. That the laws we make express the kind of people we are is true not only in a nation but also in a family. If the parents in a family get up very late every day and do not clean the house, they will make family laws which allow their children to get up late and to be messy. But if the parents are strict, clean, neat, and diligent, they will have a different family law. They will require their children to arise early in the morning, to wash themselves, and then to clean their rooms. If I visit this kind of home and see this type of regulation, I shall immediately know that the parents there must be diligent and clean. But if I go into a home where everything is a mess and where the children are allowed to sleep until late in the morning, I shall also realize what kind of people the parents in that home are. Since the laws we make testify to what we are, our law becomes our testimony. On the side of the law-maker, the law is a testimony; on the side of the law-keeper, the law is a commandment or regulation. God’s law also has these two aspects. To us who attempt to keep the law, it is the ten commandments, but to God, it is His testimony. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyH-WahB7CZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH">THE LAW AS A TYPE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="Exk_X4ZwoNzpPcXz877bIkjOlMfhZJx0Y8sYmtn5wXIbTlFsXe1YOEcisvE2Ef8z5"> I have read some books which say that the law is a type of <span class="pg" data-page-id="702" id="702">[702]</span> Christ. For a long time, I was troubled by this. How can the law, whose position is that of the concubine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99196" data-verses="Galatians 4:24">Gal. 4:24</span>), be a type of Christ? From the aspect of the law as commandments for us to keep, its position is that of the concubine. But from the aspect of the law as the testimony of God, it is a type of Christ. The real, living, full, and adequate testimony of God is just Christ Himself. Thus, the law typifies Christ as God’s living testimony. Christ expresses God. The law was given, but Christ came to be the living expression of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99197" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>). In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99198" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>). Then the Word became flesh, full of grace and reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99199" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>), for the purpose of being the expression of God. Because God is embodied in Christ, Christ is the living, full, and adequate testimony of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="19J7BMpUdAP-KQCUvDLCkUz_U2_Zvr1TF44VGLYr0Wq30Cf62POCZtTmD67IMB8WQ"> If we would thoroughly understand and apprehend the law of life, we must understand the basic concept of the divine revelation in the Bible. The basic and central concept in the Bible is that God intends to work Himself into us in order to make us His living expression. God desires to work Himself into His chosen people that they may be born of Him and have Him as their life and thus become His expression. This is God’s desire and intention. The only way for God to have such a living expression is for Him to work Himself into us. Although this basic concept is found throughout the Bible, it has nearly been lost by fundamental Christianity. Fundamental Christianity mainly stresses redemption. But redemption is not the goal; it is a way, a procedure, to reach the goal. The goal is to have God wrought into our being that we might be born of Him and that He might become our life. He is our Father and we are His sons. Being His sons, we all have Him in us as our life. Eventually, this life will transform us and conform us to His very image, making us His living expression in the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41fxUZ60oMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg"> Although this basic concept has nearly been lost, we thank God that now, in these last days, He has opened up to us this matter in His Word. For more than forty years, we have been burdened to minister this basic concept to God’s people. It is for this reason that we have been falsely accused of teaching heresy, of preaching and teaching something that is not according to the Bible. Our opposers say this because their understanding of the Bible is lacking and <span class="pg" data-page-id="710" id="710">[710]</span> inadequate. A little knowledge is dangerous, for it makes people short-sighted and even kills them. We praise God that under His mercy we have seen the basic revelation in the Scriptures. This is not simply a matter of redemption. No, it is something deeper and higher than this. God is now working Himself into us that we may have His life, that we may be one with Him, and that He may be one with us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXo8_BR4q_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB">THE SON OF GOD<br/>COMING INTO US AS LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdikmf2R5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> I say again that the way in which God accomplishes His intention is by coming into us, causing us to be born of Him. In order that we might be born of Him, God comes into us in the Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and God Himself, is God’s image. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99209" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> says that Christ is the image of the invisible God. The Son is the image, the expression, of the Father. Thus, when you see the Son, you see the Father. At the moment we believed in Him, the Son of God came into us. This does not mean that He gave us something; it means that He Himself came into us. We need to discard the concept that when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, God gave us His life. This understanding is incorrect. It was not that we believed in the Lord Jesus and that God in heaven gave us something and put it into us. No, it was that we believed in the Lord Jesus and that the Son of God, the very God Himself, came into us as life. God did not give us His life; He came into us as life. What a great difference! </p>
<p data-content-id="nGm-eJrwx-DRz6RAx60bKiQUow-iP-3qER1EiyiqV-1eQ6SXHd83e5a9vAuFAVRIG"> When God comes into us, He comes in the Son and as the Son, not as the Father. This involves the Trinity. It is at this point that we are accused of teaching heresy. But we do not teach heresy—we speak the truth according to the pure word of God. The very person who has come into our being is God Himself. But when He comes into us, He does not come as the Father but as the Son. The Father is the source, and the Son is the expression of the source. The expression and the source are one. <span class="pg" data-page-id="711" id="711">[711]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="u4VI6PwMV9YLyodQonZhWhVS3_evTx71vxZI3U8v6Kn8u6sybJckax5dbxTnzWMOb">THE FIRSTBORN SON AND THE MANY SONS</h2><p data-content-id="fuOTOIbl26ICXoDfOfmO0fk26jO5N_EbrL-zVhjSApM5ECRzMvL1jcqgw8vvh-fDb"> Because God comes into our being as the Son, we have been born of God in the Son and have the sonship. This means that we all have become sons of God. We are not simply saved sinners but also sons born of God. This is not a small thing. Before Jesus Christ resurrected from the dead, God had only one Son, the One whom the Bible calls the Only Begotten Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99210" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>). Before His resurrection, Christ was the unique Son of God. But after His resurrection, He was no longer the unique Only Begotten Son of God, for in resurrection He became the Firstborn among many brothers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99211" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="IUDJqdl9X6vy3Vq-crvLafLhsYVwghlxQoAehr9Bor-YhLUZxsqlKZZQEkrirqIrE"> How many sons does God have? On the one hand, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99212" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> speaks of the Only Begotten Son. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99213" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span> says that God is leading many sons into glory, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99214" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Romans 8:29</span> says that Christ is the Firstborn among many brothers. Does God have two kinds of sons? No, He has just one kind. In China, the Fukienese like to have many sons. If they cannot beget enough sons, they may buy some others. A certain man may beget only two sons and later buy another ten sons, giving him a total of twelve. These twelve sons, however, are of two kinds, the born sons and the purchased sons. Deep in his heart, this man feels that only two of his sons are sons in life, sons in reality, while the other ten are merely sons in term. Does God have two kinds of sons, the Only Begotten Son being one kind and the many sons being the other kind? No, the Bible reveals that the Only Begotten Son of God has become the Firstborn among many sons, proving that God has just one kind of son. The Firstborn is the Son of God, and the many sons are also sons of God. The Firstborn Son and the many sons are all of the same one Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99215" data-verses="Hebrews 2:11">Heb. 2:11</span>). </p>

If God has only one kind of son and if we also are the <span class="pg" data-page-id="712" id="712">[712]</span> sons of God, then are we not the same as Jesus Christ? How can we answer this question? Are you exactly the same as Jesus Christ, the Son of God? Jesus Christ has come into our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99216" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99217" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). According to our spirit, we are exactly the same as Christ. But, as a human being, we also have a soul composed of the mind, the emotion, and the will. Although in our spirit we are the same as the Son of God, in our mind, emotion, and will we are not yet the same as He. </p>
<p data-content-id="klFSgkmZ7z6TtXkmgUNGl_b11gto0ptrC0ipW-rLe2wiLoKboQqxl2qT2E6BWveTU"> The Son of God is in us, not partially but wholly. The complete Person of the Son of God is in us. He did not cut Himself into pieces and then put a small piece of Himself into us. Christ, the Son of God, has come into us as a whole, perfect Person. Although the whole Person of Christ is in our spirit, time after time our thinking does not originate with Christ in our spirit but with our ugly mind. Perhaps even today you were thinking about a certain brother, saying to yourself, “I don’t like Brother So-and-So. He should be excluded and cut off.” But as long as he is a brother, whether he is good or bad, you should not say that you do not like him. This thought comes from your ugly mind, not from Christ in your spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="J1JYlwCOelExNYExkRji8z3kcNJ67hWsK8o7BCO9o5g1KcqitJI9Vxej8NhnohsR2"> What about your emotion? When you love, do you love from the spirit where the Son of God is, or do you love from your emotion? I do not ask what you love, but from where you love—from your natural emotion or from the indwelling Christ. If we, like Christ, are sons of God, then why is our emotion different from His? Because Christ is only in our spirit. He has not yet spread into our emotion, and thus our emotion is still independent of Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6ET1FvM6XM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX"> The central thought of the whole Bible is that God wants to have many sons for His expression. In order to accomplish this, God must firstly have a model, a prototype. This prototype is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. When Christ came the first time, He came as the Only Begotten Son of God. As the Only Begotten Son of God, He became a genuine man in the flesh. Although He was a real man with the human nature, He was still the Only Begotten Son of God. When He was on earth, He often called Himself either the Son of God or the Son of Man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99229" data-verses="John 10:36">John 10:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99230" data-verses="John 5:25">5:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99231" data-verses="John 1:51">1:51</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99232" data-verses="Matthew 8:20">Matt. 8:20</span>). When the demons met the Lord Jesus, they addressed Him as the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99233" data-verses="Matthew 8:29">Matt. 8:29</span>), but He commanded them not to say this. The Lord seemed to be saying, “You demons, the followers of the Devil, must realize that I am here as the Son of Man. I have come as a man in the flesh to deal with the Devil and with you.” It was by His death in the flesh that Christ destroyed the Devil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99234" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). Therefore, the Devil and all the demons were afraid of Him as the Son of Man. When the Devil tempted the Lord in the wilderness, he said, “If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99235" data-verses="Matthew 4:3">Matt. 4:3</span>). The Lord Jesus replied, “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99236" data-verses="Matthew 4:4">Matt. 4:4</span>). The Lord seemed to be saying, “Satan, you must know that I am here not as the Son of God, but as the very man promised in <span class="pg" data-page-id="720" id="720">[720]</span> the book of Genesis. I have come as a man to bruise your head.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Z-QbeF7eFSCsrR20PWwNFmdXjOdizFUNBnmIQqNZgJ_0WMRdgwQ1A7MTTYXlofxbP"> In today’s Christianity there are the so-called modernists. In ancient times there were the ancient modernists, called the Sadducees, who believed neither in angels, nor in demons, nor in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99237" data-verses="Acts 23:8">Acts 23:8</span>). Today’s modernists are followers of those Sadducees. The Sadducees, along with the Pharisees, thought of the Lord Jesus simply as a Jew whose parents were Mary and Joseph. When Jesus came to such a person, He always stressed that He was the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99238" data-verses="John 5:17-18">John 5:17-18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99239" data-verses="John 5:25">25</span>). While the demons are afraid of Jesus being the Son of Man, the modernists, under the inspiration of the Devil, do not confess that He is the Son of God. Once the demons admit that Jesus is the Son of Man they are destroyed, and once a man confesses that Jesus is the Son of God he is saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99240" data-verses="John 20:31">John 20:31</span>). Who is Jesus? He is the Son of God and the Son of Man. To us, He is the Son of God, and to the enemy, He is the Son of Man. </p>
<p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCcqJPt7-2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> Recently, two young men, aged eighteen and twenty-one, came to me with an argumentative spirit, saying, “<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99241" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> says that Jesus is the Only Begotten Son of God, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99242" data-verses="Hebrews 13:8">Hebrews 13:8</span> says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. How can you say that the Only Begotten became the Firstborn? This means that Jesus has changed. But the Bible says that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.” Before His incarnation, Christ was only the Son of God; He was not a man. Was not His incarnation a great change? According to the Greek, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99243" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says, “The Word became flesh.” This certainly indicates a change. If Christ had never had such a change, we would still be in a pitiful situation. If He had not become a man but had forever remained only as the Son of God with divinity, how could we have been saved? Christ has changed. He changed from being just the Son of God into a man. Consider the Lord’s incarnation. Before His incarnation, He was the Son of God, and He did not have the human nature. He was solely, singly, and absolutely the divine Son of God, having only divinity. He had no flesh and blood. But by His incarnation He <span class="pg" data-page-id="721" id="721">[721]</span> changed radically. In making this radical change, He did not put off His divinity. No, keeping His divinity, He took on humanity. Hence, in His incarnation, He had divinity plus humanity. Many Christians today have only been taught that Jesus is the Only Begotten Son of God. They have never learned that this Only Begotten Son has become the Firstborn Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssGQDSgXngzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99244" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says that the Word became flesh, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99245" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> says that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99246" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> we have another “became.” Firstly, Christ was the Son of God. In His incarnation He became flesh, and then, as a man in the flesh, He became the life-giving Spirit. We believe <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99247" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> which says that the Word became flesh, and we believe <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99248" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> which says that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. I have been condemned as a heretic for saying that Jesus became the Spirit. According to their old, traditional teaching of the Trinity, the opposers say that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit. But now they are troubled, for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99249" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> says that Christ became the life-giving Spirit. How many Spirits are there? There is only one. Is Christ the Son or the Spirit? He is both the Son and the Spirit and also the man. This does not mean that when Christ became the man He was no longer the Son of God, nor that when He became the Spirit He was no longer the man and the Son of God. He is all-inclusive. </p>
<p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7LiwIEiZ8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> Suppose you have a glass of pure water. When you add tea into it, you do not eliminate the water, do you? When you add milk, you still have the water and the tea. The water, the tea, and the milk make an all-inclusive drink. When we drink the water, we drink the tea and the milk. Basically, this drink is plain water, but it has been enriched with the elements of tea and milk. Who is Jesus today? He is the life-giving Spirit who includes divinity and humanity. Our Savior today is not the same as He was before the incarnation, nor the same as He was when He was on earth. Before His incarnation, He was purely divine, having no human <span class="pg" data-page-id="722" id="722">[722]</span> element. When He was born of Mary in the manger at Bethlehem, He was mingled with humanity and put on human nature. While He was on earth, He was both divine and human. Being the Son of God and the Son of Man, He was both God and man. By His resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. This absolutely does not mean that He is no longer the Son of God nor the Son of Man; it means that as the Son of God He has brought the Son of Man into the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nra_GgDpimpsPAo0RrC1dPLHewU642dTAWC_1CYoST56PQUyLyIACiL2qjOnKIM8F"> When I was young, I was only taught that the man Jesus Christ was the Son of God. I was never told that through resurrection this wonderful God-man became the life-giving Spirit. I was only told that He died on the cross for our sins, resurrected from the dead, and ascended into heaven where He is now sitting as the Savior who is living, mighty, and able to save us to the uttermost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99250" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Heb. 7:25</span>). But, being a thoughtful young man, I wondered how Jesus could save me to the uttermost. I said to myself, “How can this be? He is sitting on the throne in heaven far away from me, and I am here on earth far away from Him. How can He save me to the uttermost?” Although I tried to solve this problem, I could not do it. Undoubtedly, Jesus is now sitting on the throne in heaven. How then can He save us to the uttermost? He can do it because He is not only in heaven but also in our spirit. This wonderful One is in heaven and in our spirit at the same time. I have often used the illustration of electricity. The electricity which we use in our homes is also in the power plant. The same one electricity is in both places at the same time. </p>

Since God is divine and we are human, how can we become God’s divine sons, becoming the same as He is in both life and nature? In order to have many sons, God in the Son firstly took the step of incarnation. By incarnation, He put on human nature. Before His incarnation He had only divinity, not humanity. But by being incarnated, He put on human nature and became a man. Although He became a man, He was still the very God, for He did not put off His divinity to become a mere human being. He was the God-man having both divinity and humanity. How wonderful that our God, the unique God, the Creator, became a man with flesh and blood! As far as human nature is concerned, He became exactly the same as we are. He was a real man with flesh and bones. Never forget that this real man, named Jesus Christ, was also God. He was the real God and the genuine man. Before He could make us like Him, He had to become like us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2p-Clb9asquxf4mQ9n64j5FN-fz_IFbKGR1gkxbP1RjXC1oK7CumV6zeFKsjKYYc6">THE MYSTERY OF THE RESURRECTED<br/>AND INDWELLING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="u4VI6PwMV9YLyodQonZhWh1Swt-vTx71vxZI3U8v6Kn8u6sybJckax5dbxTnzWMOb"> Having become a man in the flesh with human nature, Christ was crucified on the cross, was buried, and was resurrected. In resurrection He then took another step: as the last Adam, He became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99270" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). This is mysterious. On the day of His resurrection, the Lord appeared to His disciples. “When the doors were shut where <span class="pg" data-page-id="732" id="732">[732]</span> the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you.” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99271" data-verses="John 20:19">John 20:19</span>, Recovery Version). The doors had been tightly closed, but, to the surprise of the disciples, Jesus came. When the disciples were terrified, supposing that they had seen a spirit, the Lord Jesus said, “Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99272" data-verses="Luke 24:39">Luke 24:39</span>). Speaking to Thomas eight days later, the Lord said, “Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and put it into My side,” and Thomas said, “My Lord and my God!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99273" data-verses="John 20:27-28">John 20:27-28</span>, Recovery Version). The Lord seemed to be saying to the disciples, “Don’t think that I am a spirit. I am standing here with a body of flesh and bones. Look, the marks of My crucifixion are still upon Me. You can even touch the prints in My hands and feet.” </p>
<p data-content-id="fuOTOIbl26ICXoDfOfmO0fE28x-5N_EbrL-zVhjSApM5ECRzMvL1jcqgw8vvh-fDb"> The Lord was not only the Spirit; He was the wonderful One with a body of flesh and bones in which could be seen the prints of the nails. The wonderful Christ today is the life-giving Spirit; yet He has a body of flesh and bones. Furthermore, the New Testament reveals that this wonderful Christ is in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99274" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Col. 1:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99275" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:5">2 Cor. 13:5</span>); He is in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99276" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99277" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). Christ in resurrection still possesses a body of flesh and bones and He is in us. We cannot explain how He, having flesh and bones, can be in us. This is beyond our knowledge. Although we cannot understand Him, He is real and wonderful. </p>
<p data-content-id="IUDJqdl9X6vy3Vq-crvLafrhlKVwghlxQoAehr9Bor-YhLUZxsqlKZZQEkrirqIrE"> According to the New Testament, Christ has had two “becomings.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99278" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says, “The Word became flesh,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99279" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> says, “The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.” Through these two becomings, Christ has become a wonderful Person. He is the very God, the very man, and the life-giving Spirit. As the Son of God, He became a man, and after becoming a man, He became the life-giving Spirit consisting of divinity and humanity. In Him we see the real God and the genuine man. Today this God-man is also the life-giving Spirit. If He were not the Spirit, He could never have come into that locked room to <span class="pg" data-page-id="733" id="733">[733]</span> meet with the disciples. Nevertheless, He still has a body of flesh and bones. I cannot explain this because I am limited, but I do know that He lives in me, and I cannot deny that He has done many things for me. Even now, He is living in and for me. </p>

Through incarnation and resurrection, He mingled divinity and humanity, humanity and divinity, into one. This is our Lord Jesus Christ. Not many Christians have this concept of the Lord Jesus. But this is the very Savior whom we received into our being when we believed in Him and called on His name. The Christ who dwells in us is such a wonderful One. Now He is not only the Savior and the Lord; He is also the wonderful life-giving Spirit with two natures. Most Christians have missed the mark, having never heard that the very Christ who dwells in us has the two natures of divinity and humanity, and that both these natures are in the life-giving Spirit. As the wonderful life-giving Spirit, He is now working all that He is into our being, transforming our being into His. </p>

In Christianity, there are two main religions: the religion of teachings and the religion of miracles. Many Christians are obsessed with miracles. The basic revelation of the New Testament, however, is focused on one crucial point: that Christ is one with the Father; that He sends the Spirit, who is just Himself, that He might abide in us and that we might abide in Him; and that Christ is living, moving, and working in our spirit, even transforming our very being that we might be His expression. <span class="pg" data-page-id="734" id="734">[734]</span> Although this matter is found again and again in the New Testament, not many Christians pay attention to it. </p>
<p data-content-id="ypPAS58zX4Yp4txU9VRAV7eABFSToz5xsxInBUpzhFwkU2SoOph-gkqdH4Klv2TIx"> Fundamental Christianity stresses teaching, but at least two verses in the Bible, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99280" data-verses="Hebrews 8:11">Hebrews 8:11</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99281" data-verses="1John 2:27">1 John 2:27</span>, say that we do not need anyone to teach us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99282" data-verses="Hebrews 8:1">Hebrews 8</span> reveals that because we have the law of life within us, we do not need anyone to teach us. Not even the smallest among us needs anyone to teach him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99283" data-verses="1John 2:27">First John 2:27</span> says that because the anointing abides in us, we do not need anyone to teach us. Since we have the law of life and the anointing working and moving within us, we do not need the outward teachings of man. Some may oppose this point, but where do they put <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99284" data-verses="Hebrews 8:10-11">Hebrews 8:10 and 11</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99285" data-verses="1John 2:27">1 John 2:27</span>? We should take the clear and pure Word of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="84okqF5cvI0bg6kUHs7LFDcRH-pwcHBvGjGpN1rNBBuRGicOwNm3X9M9mskDimAHR"> In so-called Pentecostal Christianity, people stress the exercise of the gifts, especially speaking in tongues. If they come to a meeting where there is no tongue speaking or manifestation of the so-called gifts, they are unhappy. But only a very small percentage of the verses in the New Testament is devoted to speaking in tongues. A far greater percentage of the verses speak of the indwelling Christ. Here we see the subtlety of Satan. On the one hand, fundamental Christianity stresses the teachings; on the other hand, Pentecostal Christianity stresses tongues. Even when the tongues are false, they still enjoy them, and even if their prophecies are not fulfilled, they are still addicted to them. More than twelve years ago, some people prophesied that Los Angeles would fall into the ocean. Although that prophecy was not fulfilled, so many of the Pentecostalists are still addicted to their prophecies. I am not against these things, but I do have a burden for the children of God. </p>

Sonship is God’s desire. God can only satisfy His desire for sonship by having His Son become the model and prototype. This prototype must be wrought into our being. What is being wrought into us is not only the Savior or the divine life, but also the prototype of the sonship, the Firstborn Son of God. As we have pointed out, there is a great difference between the Only Begotten Son of God and the Firstborn Son of God. With the Only Begotten Son, there was no humanity. He was divine, but He was not human. With the Firstborn Son, on the contrary, there are both divinity and humanity because He is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man. The Son of Man has been brought into sonship through His resurrection. Now this Firstborn Son, constituted with both divinity and humanity, has been wrought into our very being. </p>

It begins <span class="pg" data-page-id="742" id="742">[742]</span> with regeneration and it will be completed with glorification. Between regeneration and glorification there is the process of sanctification, transformation, and conformation. Many Christians have heard about sanctification. However, the concept of sanctification in Christianity is much different from that found in the Bible. The vocabulary, the terminology, is the same, but the understanding is vastly different, because the dictionary of today’s Christianity differs from the dictionary of the Bible. According to the pure word of the Bible, the meaning of sanctification is to be saturated with the element of the prototype. The more we are saturated by the element of the Firstborn Son as the prototype, the more we are separated unto God from the world. Through sanctification we are separated from the world, not by teachings or miracles, but by being permeated with the element of the divine and human nature of the prototype. </p>
<p data-content-id="0LzTaf-UCCdfAz45OTRucexTE1ZWe9bD9g-xeDycbaQml7QnmCMyvs8NwZmgFWFwe"> Our whole being is like a black spot. One day, the wonderful element of the prototype came into our spirit and sanctified it. What about the remainder of our being? We must admit that it is still very dark. Although you may consider yourself to be good, moral, ethical, and even “spiritual,” you are still dark. Perhaps you are in a dark grave. Whether you are good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral, ethical or unethical, “spiritual” or unspiritual, your being is still dark. Whenever others contact you, they sense your opaqueness. You dwell in the gloomy dungeon of your religion and ethics, and there is nothing transparent about you. Because you are so dark and non-transparent, you need to be sanctified by having the wonderful element of the prototype saturate your being. The more Christ spreads into you, the more you will be sanctified and separated from the world. This is sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="9eJTM6CgBRzAWgpzEb41fxkZ9mIMtRShG7JrLhucPjwmNjRD5dLWMLQRvMouSoEHg"> Transformation is related to sanctification. The more we are saturated with the element of Christ, the more we are sanctified, and the more we are sanctified, the more we are transformed. As we have pointed out several times, transformation is not an outward change, adjustment, or correction. It is an inward metabolic change, a change in life, <span class="pg" data-page-id="743" id="743">[743]</span> nature, and form. Sanctification is for transformation and transformation is for conformation. We must be transformed in order to be conformed to the image of the Firstborn Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99289" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). By the Lord’s mercy, we are in the proper church life being sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God’s Firstborn Son. This is deeper, higher, and more profound than being moral, ethical, or even “spiritual.” Some teachings regarding so-called spirituality are merely vanity. Genuine spirituality is conformation. Being spiritual depends upon being conformed to the image of the Firstborn Son of God. No human effort, labor, or imitation can manufacture this. It can only be produced by the indwelling prototype, the real and living Firstborn Son of God, who automatically works in us. As He works in us by the law of life, He continually anoints us from within. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jy1CHFUA6YEvojUNBLfXo8PBXqa_CILIgWPE_eRMZNR7A-ua563o49qPUVxF--2XB">THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</h2><p data-content-id="TIZSZro023yAJ3NVsErdikWf_D5EUshByQ_CTtNpWHIhqcoUjaA38cAhqu8xF6n_C"> Because we are sons of God according to the law of life and the anointing, we are God’s people. God is our God according to the law of life and the anointing. In ancient times, God called His people, the children of Israel, out from among the Gentiles and gave them the law. God was their God and they were His people according to the outward law of letters. If they were right with the law, then they were right with God. Since the people went astray from the law, the prophets came in. Hence, the Old Testament is composed of the law and the prophets. </p>
<p data-content-id="nGm-eJrwx-DRz6RAx60bKigUgiuiP-3qER1EiyiqV-1eQ6SXHd83e5a9vAuFAVRIG"> The law corresponds to God’s unchanging nature. For time and eternity, God’s nature will remain the same. Although the law does not change, the prophets do change. A prophet of God may tell you one thing today and the opposite thing tomorrow. If you consult a prophet about going to a certain place today, he may say that it is all right to go, but if you ask him the same question tomorrow, he may tell you not to go. God is living. As the living God, He is the highest Person, having the full right to tell us one thing today and another thing tomorrow. Due to this, the word of the prophet may change. The law is according to God’s nature, but the <span class="pg" data-page-id="744" id="744">[744]</span> prophets are according to God’s activity, God’s move. God may want you to stay where you are today, but tomorrow He may want you to go elsewhere. The law is always the same for everyone. For example, the law commands you to honor your parents. God will never tell you to honor your parents today and then command you to hate them tomorrow. No, the law remains constant. However, if you read the Old Testament, you will see that the prophets differ from one another. In ancient times, God was a God to His people according to the law and the prophets, and God’s people were a people to Him also according to the law and the prophets. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ZZlu4J5HfdMhfEfUJ3LiMT5uSWBO4c3a__L7gn1p3skFN8-BJcPmokYabiuqvwyt"> What do we have in the New Testament which corresponds to the law and the prophets in the Old Testament? For the law, we have the law of life, and for the prophets, we have the anointing. Today, God is our God according to the inner law of life and according to the anointing, and we are His people according to the inner law of life and according to the anointing. The inner law of life corresponds to God’s nature, and the anointing corresponds to God’s move. The law of life always remains the same. As far as the law of life is concerned, there is no change either with you or with others. If you attempt to go to a movie tonight, the inner law will forbid you. It will also forbid you tomorrow and at any other time. The anointing, however, may change. Tonight the anointing may not allow you to go to the department store, but tomorrow the anointing may encourage you to go. While the law of life will never allow you to buy a fancy lamp, the anointing may or may not allow you to go to the department store. Furthermore, the anointing may permit one brother to go shopping, but it may forbid another brother to do the same thing. By this we see that the anointing changes. If I intend to speak to you in a condemning way, the law of life will always say, “No, don’t do that.” But whether or not I should speak on Hebrews in the meeting tonight depends on the anointing. Tonight the anointing may encourage me to speak on Hebrews for forty-five minutes, but in the next meeting the anointing may say, “Don’t speak anything in <span class="pg" data-page-id="745" id="745">[745]</span> this meeting. Be at rest.” By all these examples we see that the law remains the same but the anointing constantly changes. It is according to this law and this anointing that we are a people to God and God is a God to us. How different this is from religion! Here there are no outward regulations, forms, rituals, or controls. There is only the law of life and the anointing. </p>

God’s intention is to express Himself. In order to have His expression, He must have many sons. Do not think that salvation is the center of God’s revelation. The center of His revelation is sonship. God wants many sons. When God sent His Only Begotten Son into the world, His intention was to beget many sons through Him, making Him His Firstborn Son. Although the Lord Jesus came the first time as the Only Begotten Son of God, when He comes the second time, He will come as the Firstborn Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99298" data-verses="Hebrews 1:6">Heb. 1:6</span>). Being the Firstborn Son means that He is the first among many sons, the Firstborn Son among many brothers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99299" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dY63Ns4YQPAy0AY63eLj-dwJuvKw209Dd3yRfmCJvmFRPo7bCwFO5qUAj0SHHhN9d">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SONSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="Qpdn89MhLxfVrIv8GWTBaXSsTZw55oZqOEuk2qvXDTa4ELyWoRmN1r_WYV01cf7Lc"> In the Bible, the significance of sonship is the expression of the Father. A son always expresses his father. When we look at a boy, we see in him the expression of his father. A human father may need only one son to express him, but the divine Father, who is marvelously and wonderfully great, needs millions of sons to be His expression. One day the earth will be filled with the sons of God, and wherever we go, we shall see the image of the Father, the expression of God. If you read the New Testament carefully, you will see that God does not want a company of sinners who have been redeemed, cleansed, and brought into heaven. This is meaningless. God wants many sons to be His corporate, universal expression. Wherever these sons are, there the Father will be expressed. This is sonship. “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called <span class="pg" data-page-id="754" id="754">[754]</span> the sons of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99300" data-verses="1John 3:1">1 John 3:1</span>). This is the basic concept in the Scriptures. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw_R27tNjq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF">THE SONS OF GOD<br/>HAVING THE DIVINE NATURE</h2><p data-content-id="lkvZM26z559Bj3lTSOUy8fZugokXSx0PljTjoOkXjCBX2Rdfb66sdAUBGOBf9pyrf"> If you spend time with a father and his son, you will discover that the son not only bears his father’s image, but that he also carries his father’s nature. As his father’s son, he has his father’s nature. Likewise, if we have truly been born of God, then we must have His nature. The nature in life is a very significant thing. Every life has a nature. The nature of a life is the very substance of that life. If there is no nature, then there is no life. Regardless of the kind of life it is—vegetable, animal, human, or divine—as long as it is a life, it has a nature. The substance and essence of a life are in its nature. What the nature is, that is what the life is also. An apple tree produces apples because it has an apple-tree nature. In like manner, a dog has a dog’s life because it has a dog’s nature, and a man has a human life because he has a human nature. Could we be human without having a human nature? Of course not. We are human beings because we have a human nature. Because we have a human nature, whatever we do, think, and say is human. Similarly, whatever a dog does is according to the dog’s nature. This nature is the source of the law of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ONTNfoex8_cVo12DfRG57mXGCVfSxsp3NoQW_8wi-97vKUKUb_GzJXFfUITjZc8rP">THE LAW OF LIFE BEING THE WORKING<br/>OF THE NATURE OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="BhJ-n36lqS0UcUiN1wr0KnIZMcNUher91PB-kBiUFhBIlo-aenucKZDNqDK2y4PMW"> The law of life is not only according to the nature of life; it is also of the nature of life. The law of life comes out of the nature of life. Because a particular life has a certain nature, it has a certain law. An apple tree has an apple-tree nature; hence, its law is the law of the apple-tree nature. Why does an apple tree bring forth apples? Because the life law regulates it according to its life nature. In this we see that the law of life is actually the working of the nature of life. When the nature of a life works, the law of that life also works. Suppose we have two trees, an apple tree and a <span class="pg" data-page-id="755" id="755">[755]</span> peach tree. If these trees fail to bring forth fruit, we cannot see the law of life. But if the apple tree spontaneously produces apples and if the peach tree spontaneously produces peaches, we see the working of the law of life regulating each tree according to the nature of its life. Therefore, the law of life is simply the working, the functioning, of the nature of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_sAht-CzAXtKkmmj7dnqgqigwMWCe0KAZJWr-WPiU9nPsuMkJriGkb9ON1xZfUb0"> Suppose a dog and a man are standing in front of you. If the dog and the man do not move, you will not see the function of the law of life. But if the man behaves in a human way and if the dog begins to bark, these actions will indicate the working of the nature of each life, which is the law of that life. You may command the dog, saying, “Little dog, you must imitate this man. I charge you to follow him and to be one with him, saying and doing whatever he does.” But the more you speak this way to the dog, the more it will react according to the working of the law of its nature. If, on the contrary, you command the man to behave like the dog, he will find it impossible, for he does not have a dog’s nature. </p>

His way to have the many sons is to make His Only Begotten Son the prototype. Christianity misses this, having never seen the difference between the Only Begotten and the Firstborn Son of God. Most Christians consider the Only Begotten and the Firstborn Son as being the same. However, there is a great difference between Jesus’ being the Only Begotten Son and His being the Firstborn Son. As the Only Begotten Son, He was not the prototype. In order to be the prototype, He had to become the Firstborn Son of God. In the Only Begotten Son there was only divinity, no humanity, but in the Firstborn Son of God there is humanity as well as divinity. This humanity has been “sonized,” that is, it has been begotten of God in Christ’s resurrection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99301" data-verses="Psalms 2:7">Psalm 2:7</span>, God said to the Son, “Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.” Because Christ’s human nature, His humanity, <span class="pg" data-page-id="756" id="756">[756]</span> has been “sonized” in His resurrection, He is no longer merely the Only Begotten Son of God, but the Firstborn Son of God with divinity and humanity. Hence, He is the prototype. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Qpdn89MhLxfVrIv8GWTBaXSsUKQ55oZqOEuk2qvXDTa4ELyWoRmN1r_WYV01cf7Lc">THE MASS PRODUCTION OF THE PROTOTYPE</h2><p data-content-id="KELlE9VjwIKV1F7mYtuw_R27reTq4XKfC-gXHvnhBi1C7kU234ugTrB61GM5uBsEF"> God’s way to mass-produce this prototype differs from the mass production in a factory. In a factory, a company first produces a prototype and then mass-produces the models according to the prototype. God’s way is to work His living prototype, the Firstborn Son, into our being to be our life and nature. This life is the divine life, and this nature is the divine nature. Now God is working to spread this divine life and nature into every part of our being, transforming our natural being into that of the Firstborn Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="lkvZM26z559Bj3lTSOUy8fZup7kXSx0PljTjoOkXjCBX2Rdfb66sdAUBGOBf9pyrf"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99302" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99303" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>, this is transformation. In the process of transformation, the living prototype spreads from our spirit into every part of our being. Transformation wholly depends upon the imparting of the law of life into our spirit. The law which has been imparted into our spirit is the function of the divine life; it comes from the nature of the divine life. Since the day this law came into our spirit, it has been awaiting the opportunity to spread into our mind, emotion, and will. Eventually, it will spread throughout our being. As it spreads, the one law will become several laws. Because the law is the working of the nature of the divine life, when it works, it produces sonship. Its working will always produce the image of God. </p>

Out of a hundred Christians, probably less than five know this law or have heard about it. In Christianity, there is no word or message on the law of life. Because most Christians have gone astray from the law of life, there is the need of the anointing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="757" id="757">[757]</span> </p>

The anointing was upon the tabernacle, for the tabernacle and everything in it were anointed with oil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99314" data-verses="Exodus 40:9">Exo. 40:9</span>). As we have seen, the inmost item of the tabernacle was the tables of the law, the testimony of the law. By this picture we see that the anointing was outside but that the law of life was inside. In the Old Testament the anointing was for inauguration into function. For example, there was an altar in the outer court, but before it was anointed it could not function. Likewise, although the tabernacle had been erected, it could not function until it had been anointed. Hence, anointing is neither a matter of life nor of nature; it is a matter of inauguration for function. Every time you are anointed, you are inaugurated into your function. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y7yCkcLiWXHtLQ1FETGyH82alTLCZiXSyk0sJK8XEHWH_FWwwVxwVgnqokGkW1mVH"> The law was not spread upon the tabernacle; it was placed in the center of it. At the center of God’s people, the children of Israel, was the tabernacle which was enclosed by a wall of linen curtains. Within the tabernacle was the Holy Place, within the Holy Place was the Holy of Holies, within the Holy of Holies was the ark, and within the ark was the heart of the universe, the place where God was. In ancient times, God did not require His people to work nor to engage in certain activities; He required them to live and walk according to the law. If anyone was wrong with the law, he was wrong with God. God was the God of the children of Israel according to the law, and they were His people according to the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="Exk_X4ZwoNzpPcXz877bImDOiefhZJx0Y8sYmtn5wXIbTlFsXe1YOEcisvE2Ef8z5"> In the New Testament the anointing is mentioned several times. For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99315" data-verses="Luke 4:18">Luke 4:18</span> the Lord Jesus said <span class="pg" data-page-id="768" id="768">[768]</span> that He was anointed to preach the gospel, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99316" data-verses="Hebrews 1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span> says that the Lord was anointed with the oil of gladness. The Apostle John also speaks of the anointing a number of times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99317" data-verses="John 9:6">John 9:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99318" data-verses="1John 2:20">1 John 2:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99319" data-verses="1John 2:27">27</span>). The New Testament also mentions the inner law of life which comes out of the nature of God. In the New Testament the divine life is referred to more than a hundred times. This divine life has been imparted into our being. Most Christians pay attention to the outward anointing, but neglect the inner law of life. Many of those in the so-called Pentecostal movement talk about the anointing. Although they may experience the anointing which is upon the tabernacle, they do not enter into the ark in the Holy of Holies and touch the tables of the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="D0hW7peMyKatW3Yyp1pjV0q1lmZR3tlI4jM_n3qZwVMLHLzSUtNKlGG2jUwn-109y"> Our eyes must be opened to see that the Lord’s recovery is not so much in the anointing as it is in the law of life. In the New Testament the anointing is mentioned less than twenty times, while life is mentioned more than a hundred times. Many Christians are familiar with verses like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99320" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>, which says, “Not I, but Christ liveth in me,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99321" data-verses="Galatians 4:19">Galatians 4:19</span>, which says, “My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.” Although many Christians know these verses, they pay no attention to them. Rather, the Pentecostalists devote their attention to the manifestation of the gifts. In His recovery, the Lord turns us again and again from the outward to the inward. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SX28q2m5JZZaou8YzwMxjk_hlV-9-jFM-0R967a0R103rK0Jy6qGdc5kFkKIhC-VV">THE NEED TO TOUCH CHRIST HIMSELF</h2><p data-content-id="gGi1krUjO5_vgHIvZGO29pluu0ABZa_k8hB0IkA8RvqDpYwLHDRb1TMHp4sIipHHx"> Although we are saved and in the church life, many of us are still in the church’s outer court. Some might not even be in the outer court, but on the street outside the outer court. Others have gone farther than the outer court, having passed from the altar and the laver into the Holy Place where they enjoy Christ as the showbread and the lampstand, as the life supply and the light of life. Thank the Lord that many of us enjoy Christ in this way. However, this is still only the Holy Place. We must come forward and enter <span class="pg" data-page-id="769" id="769">[769]</span> into the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies we touch the ark, Christ Himself. The hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of life are all in Christ. How we need to touch Christ Himself! Christ today is in the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies signifies that our spirit has been joined to heaven, for the very Person of Christ is the ladder joining earth to heaven and bringing heaven down to earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="99322" data-verses="John 1:51">John 1:51</span>). If we continually touch Christ in our spirit, we shall enjoy Him as the hidden manna and as the budding rod. Then our daily life and walk will not be according to any teaching, work, activity, or movement, but according to the law of life, the function of the nature of the Triune God. God’s nature is now moving and working within us, adding Christ’s element into our being, transforming us, and producing the many sons whom God desires. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LsMUGHoOAyglcgXHKOT_9PAP8CewBBYWGd_3K1-drcYapSz78FtH6UNrSlSq3kKsG">THE DIVINE BIRTH</h2><p data-content-id="mVvGo0OS6NvmkcheRRp6EQ1FreKXM6xWaly_LJQkD9z1e1JxX1x8MRmtAl8ddddhX"> Most Christians are off-center. When I was young, I read a number of books about victory over sin. Those books presented various ways to overcome sin. However, not one of those ways ever worked. Eventually, I discovered a precious word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99323" data-verses="1John 3:9">1 John 3:9</span>: “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.” Whether we sin or not depends upon whether or not we have been born of God. He who has been born of God never sins. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="99324" data-verses="1John 5:4">1 John 5:4</span> says, “Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.” Therefore, overcoming sin and the world does not depend upon a method; it depends upon the birth of God. When we were born of God, the divine life with its nature and law was imparted into our being. As long as we have this divine life with its nature and its law, everything will be all right. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Z-QbeF7eFSCsrR20PWwNFldXkcdizFUNBnmIQqNZgJ_0WMRdgwQ1A7MTTYXlofxbP">THE SHAPING FUNCTION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="A2mj8uemUXnW86-EpqWCcpJPrpu2kRZVDC3-W3Mfifv7xfNEkEP5zqUStY6-qCe7Q"> In understanding the Bible, we have been influenced too much by our natural concepts. In the past, I said that the function of the law of life was to regulate us. According to this concept, if we are about to argue with our wife, the law <span class="pg" data-page-id="770" id="770">[770]</span> of life will regulate us. This teaching, which is according to our natural concept, is not accurate. Consider an apple tree. Its apple-tree life has the apple-tree nature, and issuing from this apple-tree nature is the law of the apple life. Does the law of life in the apple tree regulate it from being wrong? Absolutely not. The law of the apple life does not function this way. How then does it function? As the life of an apple tree grows, its law shapes the form of its life. Thus, when an apple tree bears fruit, it bears fruit with the proper form, the form of apples. The same is true of a peach tree. Hence, the law of life does not regulate us from doing wrong; it regulates the shape of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="FnJBp0iGjWO0dSVbq-ssGTDSpEHgzCYrToSpF9CniVEXcxasr3jqCnxyRJQRF4Wqr"> If a certain life does not grow, the law of that life cannot function. The law only operates as the life grows. The law of life does not primarily function in the negative sense of telling us what not to do. No, rather, while life grows the law of life functions in the positive sense of shaping us, that is, conforming us to the image of Christ. This is the function of the law of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="C42nH1geNRG7mYkFThC7LhwIMxp8dsyzKDCa6uWj6ya94tRDrcv5MW6FJdT7b6kY6"> Do not think that the law of life will always correct you. For example, when you are about to exchange words with your wife, the law of life will not merely restrict you from arguing with her. The working of the law of life is not as low as we have thought. Due to our human, natural, religious concept, we have greatly depreciated the function of the law of life. We all have been sin-centered and sin-conscious, but we should be neither sin-centered nor sin-conscious. Though we are occupied with overcoming sin, the world, our ugly flesh, and our bad habits, God would say, “Forget about these things! Don’t you realize that on the day you were regenerated you were transferred out of one realm into another? Will you please forget about the old realm?” Praise God that we have been born of Him! This divine birth has transferred us into a new realm, a realm in which there is no sin, world, or flesh. In this realm there is the function of the law of life. Remember that the law of life is not mainly regulating us; it is mainly shaping us, conforming us to the image of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="771" id="771">[771]</span> </p>
