<h1 class="title" data-content-id="qVbKRqoOAGu3MGxnR3afFqROYKQQJ683fkFd9Unt-pau-YfKbohX26ar8pj6Ztet-">A FOREWORD</h1><p data-content-id="ycRAO1PQyck3vYSrVBK6rEgApQRQUIW1z8hRVBub6MifAsRtiq85jQsSkWApHYCbK"> This message is a foreword to the life-study of the Gospel of John. We need to have an overview of the Bible as a whole. Many times in the past we have stressed that the Bible covers two main matters—Christ and the church. However, considered from another angle, the Bible is a book of life and building. Christ is life, and the church is a building. When we speak of Christ and the church, we must realize that Christ is life and that the church is a building. If you fail to realize that Christ is life and that the church is a building, then when you say these words they will simply be doctrinal terms. What is Christ? Christ is our life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71744" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Col. 3:4</span>). What is the church? The church is God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="8DJXQ5Z5MNoL38Tw6rh3i_CGTNIKyqqegEmV6n4XFlp5EG2WvIw21JD6sbOEnoo2p"> The Bible is very consistent. If you read it with insight and with the heavenly vision, you will discover that it begins with life and building. We see life and building in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71745" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>. Immediately after the creation of man, life was introduced. After the Lord God created man, He placed him in a garden in front of the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71746" data-verses="Genesis 2:7-9">Gen. 2:7-9</span>). Following this mention of the tree of life, we see the flowing river and three precious materials: gold, bdellium, which is pearl, and onyx, a precious stone. According to the further revelation of the Scriptures, especially <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71747" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span>, these precious materials are for God’s building. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71748" data-verses="Genesis 2:22">Genesis 2:22</span> we find specific mention of the building. “And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, builded he a woman, and brought her unto the man” (Heb.). God took a rib out of Adam’s side and used it to build him a wife. Thus, the man was created, but the woman was builded. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71749" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we see life, the materials that proceed out of the flow of life, and the building of a wife. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71750" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have life and building. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="0qg4Xe6SXa0i7DIioQPBurh0kmjnUFXxSvp-5BeODfOoXLrE4iTl60302dFOLF8PT"> The book of Revelation also speaks of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71751" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Revelation 2:7</span> says, “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.” This certainly is a reference to the tree of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71752" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71753" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">Revelation 2:17</span> says, “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone.” This verse speaks of a stone which, according to the Bible, has no purpose other than that of building. In the last two chapters of Revelation, which are the last two chapters of the Bible, we see the building of the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the river of life flows and the tree of life grows in the waters of the river (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71754" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Rev. 22:1-2</span>). Thus, it is clear that the Bible ends as it begins, with life and building. </p>
<p data-content-id="7fkTGT1KmmDoykHcn5OsR_exLLBusIlFpNkxlpqD2Abt5CGw7IP8GFtf4BNL-5J_z"> Between Genesis and Revelation, the two ends of the Bible, there is a wide gap, a broad span. What bridges this gap? The bridge is the Gospel of John. The book of John opens with the words, “In the beginning.” However, if you read this gospel carefully, you will discover that the history recorded in it has no end. Hence, it starts from the beginning in eternity past and it continues indefinitely into the future. Thus, it bridges the span between Genesis and Revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="_c-31afrsqWhR9jEDpe3L6dcuMq9xLD-ecnr7fV1PZOouCe3G2hx5BHraOpAV5inS"> We have seen that the Bible begins and ends with life and building. The Gospel of John, the bridge between the two ends of the Bible, is also a book of life and building. A few words from the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71755" data-verses="John 1:1">first chapter</span> of this gospel will convince us of this fact. “In the beginning was the Word...In Him was life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71756" data-verses="John 1:1">1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71757" data-verses="John 1:4">4</span>). The Gospel of John does not say, “In the beginning was doctrine, and in it was knowledge.” No, it says that in the beginning was the Word, that the Word was God, and that in this One, the Word who was God, was life. Therefore, we find life in the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71758" data-verses="John 1:1">first chapter</span> of John. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71759" data-verses="John 1:42">verse 42</span> of the same chapter speaks of a stone. When Simon was brought to the Lord by his brother Andrew, He gave him a new name, Cephas, which means a stone. In the same chapter we are told that in the Lord was life and that one of His disciples became a stone. What is the meaning of this? It means that life not only quickens, enlivens, and regenerates, but also transforms. Life will transform the believer into a stone. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="BIN7s6C3jIrwhmOtFjZQO3p98HXXDvzIG873PQJvi9ygFduggN23Zk5vk4njinT-6"> The purpose and function of the stone are revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71760" data-verses="John 1:51">1:51</span>. Speaking to Nathanael, the Lord said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” The ancient Jews knew the meaning of this word. It was the fulfillment of Jacob’s dream recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71761" data-verses="Genesis 28:10-22">Genesis 28:10-22</span>. In that dream Jacob saw a ladder set up on the earth, the top of which reached to heaven and on which the angels of God ascended and descended (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71762" data-verses="Genesis 28:12">Gen. 28:12</span>). Jacob called the name of the place at which he had the dream Bethel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71763" data-verses="Genesis 28:19">Gen. 28:19</span>), which means “the house of God.” During the night Jacob slept there, he used a stone as his pillow. Early the next morning he awoke and poured oil upon the stone, calling the name of that place Bethel. The Lord Jesus was referring to Jacob’s dream as He spoke to Nathanael. Therefore, in the light of all these verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71764" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span>, we can see that this gospel is concerned with life and building. </p>
<p data-content-id="5w-j5wr_UufC5LfaEzLLY0gNbg8EjHeZRqKuWbOgeqQ6qwIVYLcWYffP9g4uA2B9B"> We have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71765" data-verses="Genesis 2:22">Genesis 2:22</span> speaks of the building of a wife, a bride for Adam. John also mentions the bride. “He who has the bride is the bridegroom” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71766" data-verses="John 3:29">John 3:29</span>). Who is the bride? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71767" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span>, all the regenerated ones composed together become the bride. </p>
<p data-content-id="N4fmiTCMCnn3CkIWVN2YtwfDgyhJ12fvZLXKozkGfvmkz7BV-BxJS1lJhf9hBkG1i"> Moreover, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71768" data-verses="John 14:2">John 14:2</span> says, “In My Father’s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.” This verse tells us that the Lord was going to prepare a place of many abodes in the house of the Father. And if we love the Lord, He will come with the Father and make an abode with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71769" data-verses="John 14:23">14:23</span>). When we study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71770" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> we shall see that this denotes the building of God’s eternal habitation, a building which has many abodes. Thus, the Gospel of John is altogether a gospel on life and building. If you want to know the meaning of the Bible, you cannot stay away from the Gospel of John. The key to the whole Bible is in this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="t85mbqhlppdvhDFBMvHtGb-RvnuiSAQMtG9rBXOBr1lposGVhLl__LaYVRkVvwPem"> We have seen that Christ is life and that the church is a building. But what is life? It is correct to say that life is Christ and that Christ is life. However, we must realize that life is Christ as God dispensed into our being. Although many Christians talk about Christ being life, not all have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> experience of Christ as life. The genuine experience of Christ as life is in the realization that Christ is God Himself dispensed into our being. This is life. If you lack this realization, the word life may remain a mere term as far as you are concerned. Life is the Triune God dispensed and wrought into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="hXua0_pW3f46EmITi8M0RR_YjnS6MIc9iKH126QEiPABeTlJOgF_otvYI038EQlw6"> Although I do not drink alcoholic beverages, we may use the illustration of drinking a glass of wine. If I were to drink a tall glass of wine, after a short period of time my complexion would become colorful because of the effect of the wine upon my system. I would be bold, happy, and blissful. That would be the result of wine becoming life to me. However, if I only learn the meaning of the word wine, discussing it night and day and acquiring a great deal of knowledge about it, I would experience nothing. The wine would be unrelated to me. On the contrary, if you forget about discussing the wine and drink a large glass of it each day, you will know what wine is, for it will be dispensed into you, making you happy and ecstatic. Although this example may be poor, it is nevertheless very illustrative. </p>

In the Beginning the Word</h2>
<p data-content-id="4TUau6dLXXRywSAVL1aAoYPlFrgTjOpy_3LINqVcTISbRAG_tv46RgQoE2WRrdCmW"> The language of the Gospel of John is simple and brief, but this book is actually the most profound book in the Bible. Consider, as an example, the first clause of the whole book: “In the beginning was the Word.” Although the language of this clause is very simple, the depths of its meaning cannot be fathomed. What is the beginning? Do you understand what the beginning is? When was the beginning? How difficult it is to answer. Furthermore, what is the Word? If you say that the Word is Christ, I would ask you why Christ is designated as the Word in this verse. Why is He not designated otherwise? That such a term as “the Word” is used to designate Christ is very meaningful. Although this clause is exceedingly deep, let us try to understand it. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="oK5t_cujVUe-6UYwK7CNLlHtoQyZgAVvGBQeMC2vVG8ZOCjSk5ko7lPuMCUs_kVHC">1. The Beginning—the Eternity Past</h2><p data-content-id="3TL2o1JgaGVsB2drLrf3uCK6uVVBk0dUdsaHQHBjykhJ-X9KYQqJliD-60RdqUcyS"> The Bible begins with the words, “In the beginning.” However, what <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71866" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> says is different from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71867" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>. It says, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” Although two books, Genesis and John, start with the same phrase, the meaning of each is absolutely different. The phrase, “In the beginning,” in Genesis denotes the beginning of time, for it refers to God’s creation. Therefore <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71868" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> refers to the beginning of time in which God created all <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> things. The meaning of this phrase in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71869" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> is different, for it refers to eternity in the past without a beginning. The beginning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71870" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> starts from the time of creation, but the beginning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71871" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> is before the time of creation. In other words, the beginning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71872" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> is the beginning of time, and the beginning in John is the beginning before time existed; it refers to eternity past without a beginning. </p>
<p data-content-id="zBGhA3590E7XPL6icOf_E_OBnKECgCDATp-tFcRb9BVVdo8R8xctsKXmFfAC4TlQd"> As we pointed out in the last message, John’s ministry was a mending ministry. Mending means that something has been in existence for a length of time, that it has been damaged, broken, or hurt, and that it now requires mending. Mending always restores a situation to the condition which was present at the beginning. For example, I have had a particular jacket for seven years. At times, a part of this jacket has been torn, and my wife has had to mend it for me. After she mended the broken places, the jacket was restored to its original condition. Likewise, the church has been in existence since the day of Pentecost. However, not too long after its beginning, the church was damaged and injured by many different thoughts, opinions, concepts, philosophies, ideas, teachings, and doctrines. If you carefully read the New Testament along with church history, you will learn that many injurious concepts crept into the church through Judaism. These ideas damaged the ancient church. Moreover, in the early days, even in the first century, Gnosticism, a blend of Greek, Egyptian, and Babylonian philosophy, also crept into the church, causing considerable harm. Thus, the early church was damaged by both Jewish religious concepts and Greek philosophical ideas, all of which produced numerous doctrines and teachings and injured the church, making many holes in the spiritual net. </p>
<p data-content-id="a9NrvhD6wW1hRS7-gnQmrDF1fb7DU8q1AZlxJz81s5YFPu5MILIeqJhyavV3tDNAj"> The largest hole in the church net was caused by some so-called Christians who, in their philosophical concepts, did not recognize that Christ was God incarnated to be a man. They claimed to be Christians, but did not believe that Christ, the Son of God, had come in the flesh. These were called antichrists by John (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71873" data-verses="1John 2:18">1 John 2:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71874" data-verses="1John 2:22">22</span>). Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71875" data-verses="1John 4:1-3">1 John 4:1-3</span> says that we may test the genuineness of a spirit by asking it whether or not it recognizes that Christ has come in <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> the flesh, for “every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God.” Furthermore, in his second epistle John warned the believers about antichrist, a person who claims to be a Christian, but who does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71876" data-verses="2John 1:7">v. 7</span>). Those who preach Christianity without believing that Christ was God incarnated to be a man caused a large hole in the net. Thus, by His sovereignty, God prepared a mending ministry to patch up all the holes. John’s ministry fulfilled this task, testifying that Christ, the very God incarnated, came in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71877" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71878" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="btOmTWeLFFpscfgnMwcK5BYbahrI2rT3IwVxeSAiE7B_1vo4eGvaKTJstwR_ZClRW"> In principle, we face the same situation today as John faced in the first century. The spiritual net is broken and full of large holes because of many doctrines, teachings, concepts, and ideas. We must be brought back to the beginning. What was in the beginning? In the beginning was only one thing—life. “In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God...In Him was life.” The Gospel of John does not say, “In Him were many doctrines.” The way to mend the holes in the spiritual net is by life. We should not discuss doctrine; we should enjoy life. If you come to me for the purpose of arguing doctrine, I would say, “O Lord Jesus! Christ is so lovable, sweet, and dear. Let us call on Him. Dear brother, let us enjoy the Lord. As long as we have the Lord Jesus as our enjoyment, everything is wonderful. Let us forget doctrine and enjoy Him.” The mending ministry is accomplished by life, for life brings us back to the beginning. In the beginning there was nothing but life. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="qVbKRqoOAGu3MGxnR3qfH4BOYKQQJ683fkFd9Unt-pau-YfKbohX26ar8pj6Ztet-">2. The Word—the Definition, Explanation,<br/>and Expression of God</h2><p data-content-id="ycRAO1PQyck3vYSrVB66uXAApQRQUIW1z8hRVBub6MifAsRtiq85jQsSkWApHYCbK"> The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, it is God defined, explained, and expressed. God is mysterious. He needs the Word to express Him. If you want to appear mysterious, the best way to do it is to be silent, for the more silent you are, the more mysterious you become. However, the more you talk, the more you expose yourself. All that is deep within you is revealed by your words. This is the meaning of the Word. Although God is a mystery, Christ as <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> the Word of God defines, explains, and expresses Him. Thus, this Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God. Eventually, this Word is God Himself, not God hidden, concealed, and mysterious, but God defined, explained, and expressed. The Word is not the invisible God, but the very God who is visible. In the beginning this Word was with God; it was not separate from God, but always had God in Him. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="8DJXQ5Z5MNoL38Tw6rR3msyGTNIKyqqegEmV6n4XFlp5EG2WvIw21JD6sbOEnoo2p">B. The Word with God</h2><p data-content-id="0qg4Xe6SXa0i7DIioQ_Bp4h0kmjnUFXxSvp-5BeODfOoXLrE4iTl60302dFOLF8PT"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71879" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says that the Word was with God, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71880" data-verses="John 1:2">verse 2</span> says, “He was in the beginning with God.” The Word was always with God and always had God in Him; He was never separate from God. When many of the young people are away from home, they receive loving letters from their parents. These letters are a word from their mother or father. Suppose you receive a letter from your father. That letter is your father’s word coming to you. However, when that word comes to you, it cannot be a word with your father. Although the letter is the word of your father, it is not a word with your father, for you and your father are actually far away from each other. This means that the word of your father is separate from your father himself. It is different with Christ as the Word of God. Never think that this Word was separate from God. No, this Word was and always is with God. When the Word comes, God comes. When the Word is present, God is present. The Word is with God. Thus, we have another clause in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71881" data-verses="John 1:1">1:1</span> telling us that the Word was with God. </p>

<p data-content-id="SSy1z1-JelNs_byNvVxvokeYyIT6RoggYyiZmjl4crSpjkol7KqVeTafPqwkZ2tgp"> In the previous message we saw that Christ, as the Word, came as life and light for the purpose of bringing forth many children to be God’s enlargement and corporate expression. This is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71911" data-verses="John 1:1-13">John 1:1-13</span>. May we keep this point deep within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="gXvFaTgxHGUO-rzGzfbZspb1l8PodFDz2DYGuF1ZGVlt-c2zGVtRXg1oF_kS85QlB"> In this message we come to the second section of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71912" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span>, which is composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71913" data-verses="John 1:14-18">verses 14 through 18</span>. This section shows us that the very Christ who was the Word and who came as life and light to produce many children for God’s enlargement and expression was incarnated for our enjoyment. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71914" data-verses="John 1:1-13">John 1:1-13</span> tells us that Christ came to produce the children of God; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71915" data-verses="John 1:14-18">verses 14-18</span> indicate that all the children of God need the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="e1F2-TvVX-Wo06SOkBihlvB0AkxrzvfUAe3pb0V0IGQJ7M_YNjzT3VkMpObkgjnuy"> How can we enjoy Christ? By His incarnation. To be incarnated means to be consolidated. As the Word before His incarnation, Christ was mysterious. However, when He was incarnated, He became so real to us. Before His incarnation, He was intangible, invisible, and untouchable. By becoming flesh, He became solid, real, visible, and touchable. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71916" data-verses="John 1:14">Verse 14</span> says, “And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.” That was something solid. In becoming flesh to tabernacle among man, He became tangible. People could not only see Him, but could also touch Him. Hence, John says, “We beheld His glory as of an only begotten from a father.” In his first epistle, John tells us that they touched Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71917" data-verses="1John 1:1">1 John 1:1</span>). Thus, in His incarnation, Christ became tangible. </p>
<p data-content-id="5w-j5wr_UufC5LfaEzrLRmANbg8EjHeZRqKuWbOgeqQ6qwIVYLcWYffP9g4uA2B9B"> Although He became tangible through His incarnation, <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> we needed something more before we could enjoy Him. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71918" data-verses="John 1:14">1:14</span> says that He was “full of grace and reality.” It does not say that He was full of doctrines and gifts. When He became visible and touchable, He was full of grace and reality. When Christ was in the flesh with the disciples, they not only saw and touched Him, but they also enjoyed Him. If you could have asked Peter and Mary why they loved Him so much and why they liked being in His presence, they would have said, “We simply cannot put it into words. As long as we stay with Him, we have a certain enjoyment. No words can utter it. But we can all testify that it is so sweet to sit in His presence. There is such enjoyment and reality. We don’t know how to explain it or define it, but we know for sure that we enjoy it.” What did they enjoy? It was the Word in the flesh, full of grace and reality. </p>

<p data-content-id="9S6bAz339mYziRGej84HgjCxJB4XTlUEwBDRLoFRB3ON6PAI2cNs0NusS0QT3DlqC"> We have just stated that the Word became flesh for our enjoyment. Now we must see that He was incarnated that He might declare God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71919" data-verses="John 1:18">v. 18</span>). God “was manifested in the flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71920" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Tim. 3:16</span>). How did He declare God? He declared God in the flesh by presenting Himself to us for our enjoyment. He did not say to the early disciples, “My little children, I want you to know that I am the Son of God and that I have come in the flesh to declare God to you. You all must know God. Look at My face. You must realize who I am. When you know Me, you know God the Father.” If He had declared God in this way, all His disciples would have withdrawn from Him. Peter would have said, “I will return to my fishing in Galilee,” and Martha would have said, “Lord, I will go home and tend to my affairs.” No, Christ did not come in the flesh to declare God in the way of teachings, but in a way that was full of grace and reality. He did not say, “Little children, you must seek God in Me. Learn the lesson that I am here to declare God.” He declared God in the way of enjoyment, by presenting Himself as grace and reality. Thus, Peter could have said, “I will never go back to fishing. I <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> will stay with this man forever. Although I don’t know who He is, whether He is the Son of God, the Father, the Word, or the Creator, I do know that staying with Him is so sweet.” This is the way that Jesus, the Son of God in the flesh, declared God. He did not declare God to His disciples by teaching them, but by affording them such a sweet enjoyment. By simply looking at people He could capture them. How enjoyable was His presence! His presence was so charming. So many of the early disciples were charmed by Him. It seemed that no one could withstand His charming presence. That was His way of declaring God. </p>
<p data-content-id="jynNWp5yBJT7WjSB43O3PD5AJZ6z_-jTV1Xn0ETcxUCUGJkuR0mN5gJVD82YVb2pv"> God is not a God of teaching, doctrine, regulations, laws, or gifts. God is a God of enjoyment. God is grace and reality to us. God is our full enjoyment, and Jesus as the Son of God is the very embodiment of all the enjoyment of God. When He abides with you, you enjoy God. You taste God as One who is sweet, dear, and precious. Eventually, you gain His reality. We have no human words to explain this. Although we lack the utterance to describe this, we may enjoy it today. When we stay with the Lord for a period of time, calling on Him, saying, “Lord Jesus, I love You,” we sense sweetness, comfort, rest, refreshment, and strength. Not only so, we have His reality. People may ask you, “What kind of reality do you have?” Although I do not know how to describe it, I do have reality. Before spending time in the presence of the Lord I was empty, but now I am full. I have reality. I am satisfied and filled to the brim. </p>
<p data-content-id="TwQlMH4WYSvmZBpvUH3AUKe6we6-xicmxEL3iHsGvInd9AHz0HO8m2UzNBdzAcSKQ"> The Word was incarnated to declare God, becoming flesh for our enjoyment. The Son of God declares God to man in the way of enjoyment. This is wonderful. </p>
<p data-content-id="n8WSh8WU2BdpsjVRDD9TN4J5SG8QBnYwKIXlL0q3eeAFANq7Mk2tNf7lfC_nB1Vr0"> When the Word became flesh, He was “in the likeness of the flesh of sin” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71921" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Rom. 8:3</span>). In the Bible, the word “flesh” is not a good term; it denotes something fallen and sinful. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71922" data-verses="Romans 7:18">Romans 7:18</span> says that nothing good dwells in our flesh. When the Word says that Christ became flesh, does this mean that He became something sinful? Absolutely not. He became flesh in the “likeness of the flesh of sin.” The brass serpent lifted up on a pole by Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71923" data-verses="Numbers 21:4-9">Num. 21:4-9</span>) was a type of Christ being made in the likeness of the flesh of sin. <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> Although that brass serpent was in the form of the serpent, it did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent. Its nature was pure, clean, and good. It was made in the form of the serpent for the purpose of substitution. We shall see more of this when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71924" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>. For the time being it is sufficient if we realize that when Christ became flesh, He did not have the sinful nature of the flesh, but only the likeness of the flesh of sin. By His becoming flesh in this way, man was able to touch Him, participate in Him, and enjoy the fullness of God that was in Him. When He became flesh, He apparently became sin, for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71925" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span> says that God made Him to be sin. Actually, He did not have the sinful nature, but only the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="65XEpihaZD6ISNAVK6KJxxFYFIvvJdVmQZ8Nms4k0sV2bawyzQ5gp4-b5hMWcG5LI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71926" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span> we are also told that He “did not know sin.” We do not have the language to explain this. How can we say that the Lord Jesus did not know sin when He knew everything? Since He knew everything, He knew sin thoroughly. Nevertheless, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71927" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span> says that He knew no sin. What does this mean? According to my understanding, it means that Jesus had no sin and that He had nothing to do with it. In His nature and His substance there was no such thing as sin. Although He was made sin, within Him there was no nature of sin. All we can say is that He was in the form, in the likeness, of the flesh of sin. </p>

JESUS AS THE LAMB OF GOD WITH THE SPIRIT<br/>AS THE DOVE TO PRODUCE STONES<br/>FOR GOD’S BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="10MJntexVw9mtYnMyZbg2xDXBkYBi4_k9Sj8fkt-_KQkx6FVLKr6wXK38c_eWnUfc"> In this message we come to the last part of the first chapter of the Gospel of John (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71949" data-verses="John 1:19-51">vv. 19-51</span>). The main subject of this passage is Jesus as the Lamb of God, with the Holy Spirit as the dove, making the believers stones for the building of the house of God with the Son of Man. This subject is composed of five main points: the Lamb of God, the dove, the stones, the building of God’s house, and the Son of Man. The Lamb is for redemption; the dove is for life-imparting, transforming, and building; the stone is for material; the house is the building; and the very substance of God’s building is man. Firstly, man is redeemed by the Lamb, and then he is regenerated and transformed by the dove. Thus, man becomes a stone, and this stone is then builded by the dove. The dove is not only for regenerating, but also for transforming and uniting, which eventually result in the building of God’s house. The essence, the substantial element, of the house of God is not divinity, but humanity. Divinity is the dweller and humanity is the dwelling. Since the house is the dwelling place and not the dweller, the dwelling is humanity and the dweller is divinity. This humanity, however, is not a natural or a created humanity; it is a regenerated, transformed, and uplifted humanity, a humanity that has been processed through creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The humanity which has passed through such a wonderful process becomes the very substance of God’s building. Such a humanity is God’s dwelling place. In no other <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> books is this matter so clearly revealed as in the writings of John, in his gospel, epistles, and revelation. Thus, we must spend a great deal of time in John’s writings. </p>
<p data-content-id="9S6bAz339mYziRGej9IHmxyxJB4XTlUEwBDRLoFRB3ON6PAI2cNs0NusS0QT3DlqC"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71950" data-verses="John 1:19-51">John 1:19-51</span> is a long section composed of thirty-three verses. Why is this section so long? For years I was troubled by the length of this portion of John’s gospel. I said, “In the first eighteen verses, every word is economical. Not one word is wasted. Why does John use so many words in this part of the chapter?” I could not understand why John, a brief and simple writer, used so many verses. If I had written this portion of the Word, I would have used only seven or eight verses, telling how the Pharisees inquired of John whether or not he was the Messiah, Elijah, or the prophet, how John baptized people in water, how he introduced Jesus as the Lamb of God with the dove descending and abiding on Him, how five disciples were attracted to the Lord and began to follow Him, and how the name of one of them was changed. However, John used many more verses than this. What was his purpose in doing so? Very few Christians have seen John’s purpose in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71951" data-verses="John 1:19-51">verses 19 through 51</span>. Thus, we must take time to consider it. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="jynNWp5yBJT7WjSB42-3GR5AJZ6z_-jTV1Xn0ETcxUCUGJkuR0mN5gJVD82YVb2pv">A. The Religious People Expecting<br/>a Great Leader</h2><p data-content-id="TwQlMH4WYSvmZBpvUGHAcYO6we6-xicmxEL3iHsGvInd9AHz0HO8m2UzNBdzAcSKQ"> As you read through the Gospel of John, you will discover that the greatest opposition against Christ came from religion. Nothing was more troublesome or frustrating to Him than the Jewish religion. Religion is Christ’s enemy. It frustrates Christ as life. Eventually, religion sentenced Christ to death. It was not Roman politics that sentenced the Lord Jesus to death, for the Roman politics under Pilate was too weak to do that. Christ was sentenced to death by the Jewish religion which utilized the weak Roman politics. Thus, in his gospel, John shows us that the strongest opposition to Christ as life comes from religion. Therefore, he found it necessary to use many verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71952" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span> to describe the pitiful religious situation. John’s intention was to portray the pathetic condition of religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="_c-31afrsqWhR9jEDoO3Co9cuMq9xLD-ecnr7fV1PZOouCe3G2hx5BHraOpAV5inS"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71953" data-verses="John 1:19-25">Verses 19 through 25</span> reveal the concept of religious <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> people, which is entirely contrary to the divine thought. The religious people were looking for a great leader such as the Messiah, Elijah, or the prophet (according to the Scriptures, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71954" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">Dan. 9:26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71955" data-verses="Malachi 4:5">Mal. 4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71956" data-verses="Deuteronomy 18:15">Deut. 18:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71957" data-verses="Deuteronomy 18:18">18</span>). The religious concept is that of always looking to a great one such as the Messiah or to a great prophet such as Elijah. Religious people always think in terms of a great leader who will do wonderful things and perform marvelous miracles to save and deliver them. The Jewish leaders, therefore, sent people to ask John the Baptist if he was the Messiah. John, of course, replied, “I am not.” Then they asked if he was Elijah, and again he answered, “No.” In the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="71958" data-verses="Deuteronomy 18:1">eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy</span>, Moses promised Israel that a great prophet would come. So, from that day, Israel continually looked for the coming of that prophet, and when John the Baptist came upon the scene, they asked him if he was the one. Nevertheless, John said that he was not that prophet. The same principle still exists in today’s religious situation. People everywhere expect to have a great world-famous preacher. The religious people today, like the Pharisees and scribes and chief priests, are not for life; they are for a big movement, a great leader. Although they await a great religious leader who will stir them up, after such a leader comes and goes, they still remain in their deadness. </p>
<p data-content-id="BIN7s6C3jIrwhmOtFiJQGlZ98HXXDvzIG873PQJvi9ygFduggN23Zk5vk4njinT-6"> The contrast in this portion of the Gospel of John is very impressive. We have seen that the religionists were expecting a great leader and that they inquired of John the Baptist whether he was the Messiah, Elijah, or the prophet. When John repeatedly answered, “No,” they finally asked him, “Who are you? What do you say about yourself?” John answered, “I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness.” What is a voice? A voice is nothing. You hear it, and it is gone. You cannot touch it. John seemed to be saying, “I am nothing. I am nobody. I am just a voice. I am not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet.” The religious people were disappointed with him. How could they answer those who sent them? Perhaps they said to John, “Shall we go back to those who sent us and tell them that you said you were just a voice? <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> What is this? It’s nonsense.” Yes, as far as religion is concerned, life is nonsense. </p>

<p data-content-id="dVGN5WXLxIx0FItFRZquQe9hDedsgBGx6cSHcgladGc5IaMSTaHitKZaPlyR-YeoS"> When John saw Jesus coming, what did he say? He did not say, “Behold, Dr. Jesus Christ.” He said, “Behold, the Lamb of God.” If I had been John the Baptist, I would have said, “Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah.” How do you prefer to recommend Jesus—as the Lamb or as a strong lion? If you were to introduce Christ to me as a lion, I would flee, for I am afraid of lions. Jesus, however, was recommended as a Lamb. While the religionists were expecting a great leader, Jesus was recommended by John the Baptist as the little Lamb of God. Jesus did not come to be the great leader of a religious movement; He came to be the little Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. It is not a matter of a movement; it is a matter of redemption, of solving the problem of the sin of mankind. For our sin to be taken away we do not need a doctor of theology or a religious leader—we need a little Lamb. We need Jesus as the Lamb of God to die for us and to shed His blood for our redemption. The situation today is the same as it was in the time of John the Baptist. Religion still awaits a great leader for a great movement. However, in God’s economy, Jesus is not such a leader. He is simply the Lamb of God. As you read this message you need to say, “Lord Jesus, to me You are not a great leader. You are the Lamb of God who died on the cross for my sins. Thank You for Your death, Lord. Thank You for Your blood. Thank You for Your redemption. I don’t care for a great leader. I only care for this little Lamb who has accomplished redemption for me.” The religious concept is that a great leader will come, but the divine economy is that a Lamb die to redeem man from sin. Since the problem of sin requires a solution, the need of redemption is imperative. We need the Lamb of God to take away our sins. <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> </p>

He will not only be the Son of God, but also the Son of Man. Since the Word has been incarnated in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71997" data-verses="John 1:14">v. 14</span>), He is also a man, the Son of Man with humanity forever. After the incarnation, He is still God, but God and man. He is <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> still the Son of God, but the Son of God and the Son of Man. In addition to being the Son of God, for eternity in the future He will be the Son of Man. In eternity past He was God, solely and merely divine, having no humanity. However, in eternity future He will be God and man, the Son of God and the Son of Man, both divine and human, having divinity as well as humanity. He will have two natures, two essences, and two substances—divinity and humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="mplh2Ii9SxX3L81TB5guNE9vxczWHaVmNU91nzbGcnLT3uA9GiS-fWkrhi4wJZm5Z"> When Nathanael said to the Lord, “You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71998" data-verses="John 1:49">v. 49</span>), Jesus told him that he would see “the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” Who is greater—the Son of God or the Son of Man? Logically speaking, everyone would say that the Son of God is much greater than the Son of Man. Let me ask you, do you prefer to be the sons of man or the sons of God? Surely you would answer that you prefer to be the sons of God. Everyone desires to be a son of God. It certainly was wonderful for Nathanael to realize that Jesus, a little man from Nazareth, was the Son of God. Nevertheless, Jesus immediately replied that He was the Son of Man. Although men attempt to make Him great, He likes to remain small. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zo9dN5yT4RaGVzmheRujRbbwO4N0OSuZjtDQf5M2EBBxv1xMr6YswtQOIRp7t2MTg"> Which is more important—for Jesus to be the Son of God or to be the Son of Man? If you are not careful in giving an answer, you may be involved in heresy. How difficult it is to answer such a question! The Lord is both the Son of God and the Son of Man. If He were not the Son of God, He could never be our life. If He were not the Son of Man, He could never be the essence of the building of God. The Son of God is for life, and the Son of Man is for building. The Bible never requires that we believe that Jesus is the Son of Man before we can have life. In order to have life, we must believe that Jesus is the Son of God. We all must believe that Jesus, the little Nazarene, is the Son of God. If we believe this, we have eternal life. After we have received eternal life, we must further realize that this Jesus who is the Son of God is also the Son of Man. His divinity is life to us, but His humanity is for the building of God. God’s building needs His humanity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> We need Jesus as the Son of God, but God needs Him as the Son of Man. </p>
<p data-content-id="ArkzpradNTw3GL-xt8UsTzple4mOhZEhE3jL4qTNcdMIIImpgNveMgKcBQ6CboAjM"> To us, Jesus is the Son of God, but to God and to the devil, Satan, Jesus is the Son of Man. The devil is not afraid of Jesus being the Son of God. He is afraid of Jesus being the Son of Man. A number of times when Jesus was casting demons out of people and the demons addressed Him as the Son of God, Jesus silenced them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="71999" data-verses="Matthew 8:29">Matt. 8:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72000" data-verses="Mark 3:11-12">Mark 3:11-12</span>), for, in front of them, He was acting as the Son of Man. When the devil tempted Jesus in the wilderness by saying, “If You are the Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72001" data-verses="Matthew 4:3">Matt. 4:3</span>), Jesus, resisting the temptation to forsake His position as the Son of Man, said, “Man shall not live on bread alone” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72002" data-verses="Matthew 4:4">Matt. 4:4</span>). Jesus maintained His standing as a man. Satan is not afraid of the Son of God; he is afraid of man. Why is Satan afraid of man? Because God, in His economy, has decided that Satan must be defeated by man. </p>
<p data-content-id="FrmYRfBZSjDnCrN4tpZEVkXkRWCSzB_rjmbpjuq-YT3hx3woVYQsuazFaPOeRv_-P"> God has no intention of dwelling in Himself. Divinity cannot be God’s dwelling. God’s intention in His economy is to dwell in humanity. God’s intention is to defeat His enemy, Satan, by man and to make humanity His dwelling place. Thus, both for the defeat of Satan and for the dwelling place of God, there is the need of humanity. If the Lord Jesus were only the Son of God, He would only be qualified to impart life into man. He would have no substance by which to defeat the enemy or to become the dwelling place of God. Praise the Lord that He is the Son of God for us to have life, and He is the Son of Man for God to have a dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="CXFd3_7Beuoz4J7tR_eFumfQJa0_7BGOuSsi20bXHzK-QSP-l9xYLfC6UjhBDbvE3"> Did God have a dwelling place of humanity in eternity past? Surely the answer is no. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72003" data-verses="Isaiah 66:1">Isaiah 66:1</span>, God says, “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool:...where is the place of my rest?” Heaven is considered as God’s habitation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72004" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:15">Deut. 26:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72005" data-verses="1Kings 8:49">1 Kings 8:49</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72006" data-verses="Psalms 33:13-14">Psa. 33:13-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72007" data-verses="Isaiah 63:15">Isa. 63:15</span>); yet God says, “Where is the place of my rest?” God’s resting place is man gained by Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72008" data-verses="Isaiah 57:15">Isa. 57:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72009" data-verses="Isaiah 66:2">66:2</span>). Today God dwells in the heavens, but the heavens will not be His habitation for eternity in the new heaven and the new earth. In the new <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> heaven and the new earth, God’s habitation for eternity will be the New Jerusalem, which is composed of all His redeemed saints and which will come down from heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72010" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-3">Rev. 21:1-3</span>). What will be God’s eternal habitation? The regenerated, transformed, uplifted, and built up humanity which will eventually become God’s dwelling place. God will not dwell with a natural humanity, but with a regenerated, transformed, uplifted, and built up humanity. This humanity is regenerated, transformed, united, and built together by the divine life. The divine life will uplift our humanity to such a standard that we will become God’s dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="P_4KtsGyNhSbk86m7mIb-5XDwZ4sTm7hLI0PKhfCaFxOEgwCSzcqA_f6HNvLOq6uZ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72011" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> reveals Christ as both the Son of God and the Son of Man. He is the Son of God to impart God into us as our life, and He is the Son of Man to be the very essence of the building of God’s house. In eternity past there was no humanity, and there was no dwelling place for God. In eternity future there will be humanity, and God will have a dwelling place. </p>

How can God, who had no humanity in eternity past, have humanity in eternity future as His dwelling place? This will not happen overnight. Between these two sections of eternity is the bridge of time. In eternity past God planned and purposed, but He did not do anything. In eternity future God will not do anything, because, at that time, everything will have been accomplished. In eternity future He will simply enjoy His finished work. In eternity past He planned, and in eternity future He will enjoy. Everything that God needs to accomplish He accomplishes on the bridge of time. God is driving the car of His economy from the first section of eternity, through the bridge of time, into the last section of eternity. By driving His car across the bridge of time, all the necessary work is completed. Once God has traveled from eternity past, through the bridge of time, and into eternity future, He will declare, “Finished!” In eternity future God will enjoy His finished work. </p>

When John wrote his gospel, he was one hundred percent under the anointing of the dove, the Spirit. Thus, the composition of this gospel is marvelous. We have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72029" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span> gives an introduction to the whole book. Although some expositors of the Gospel of John say that the introduction includes only the first eighteen verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72030" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span>, the Lord has shown us that the entire first chapter is an introduction. The introduction begins with eternity past and ends with eternity future. Between eternity past and eternity future is the bridge of time on which five main events transpire for the accomplishment of God’s eternal purpose. We have seen this clearly in the last message. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72031" data-verses="John 1:1">John chapter one</span> is also an extract of the whole Gospel of John. In fact, it is an extract of the whole Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="WAJQg83IWdCfjdYL76QZxrFPVEx26GdlEPPkU9OnjGQWjiVZrhRbSL1RfcU528vmq"> After giving us such an all-inclusive introduction, John presents several cases to illustrate the matter of life. Although Jesus did a great many signs before His disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72032" data-verses="John 20:30-31">20:30-31</span>), John selected not more than twelve of them to illustrate the matter of life. Beginning with the case of Nicodemus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72033" data-verses="John 3:1">chapter three</span> and ending with the resurrection of Lazarus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72034" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, nine
cases are presented. If we add the incidents of the changing of water into wine, of the cleansing of the temple, and of the washing of feet, we have a total of twelve events. If you compare the record of the Gospel of John with that of the other gospels, you will find that they include many things which John does not, and that John records many things which they do not. For example, Matthew, Mark, and Luke say nothing about Jesus’ changing water into wine. Neither do they mention the Lord’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> conversation with Nicodemus regarding regeneration. Do not think that these differences are accidental. No, each gospel was carefully planned by the Divine Writer. Matthew wrote his gospel with a specific purpose—to prove that Jesus is the King and the Christ. In order to prove this, Matthew selected some incidents and cases in the life of Christ which demonstrate that Jesus is the King of Israel and God’s Christ. Since Luke’s purpose was to show that Jesus is the Savior of mankind, he selected the cases which prove that Jesus is the Savior. For instance, the story of the prodigal son is recorded in Luke, but not in Matthew, Mark, or John. Why is this story recorded in Luke? Because this story proves that Jesus is the Savior. Another incident recorded only in Luke is that of the thief on the cross who asked the Lord to remember him when He came into His kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72035" data-verses="Luke 23:39-43">Luke 23:39-43</span>). Luke also tells us of the Lord’s answer to that dying thief: “Today you shall be with Me in Paradise” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72036" data-verses="Luke 23:43">Luke 23:43</span>). Neither Matthew, Mark, nor John gives us such an account. In the same principle, all the cases recorded by John prove that Christ is life to meet our need. Based upon this principle, we must realize that the incident of changing water into wine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72037" data-verses="John 2:1-11">2:1-11</span>) is not merely the account of a story; it has a spiritual meaning with a special significance. Now we need to find out the spiritual significance of this event. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2Q5ugYZO8sPp0OavyWk7fiq3TFSV7Nsfngw8PljfG3IHcn7hxi9igE-N15TGlXeJl">I. LIFE’S PRINCIPLE—<br/>TO CHANGE DEATH INTO LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="ukeBrlETbXJ-IG3ca2SPrWrbNDo45cevyTWorYeIAd3f0-tCeAa1VKDztLfP8v9yK"> When I first heard the story of Jesus’ changing water into wine, I did not know the meaning behind this event. Later I came to understand that this was not simply a story, but an event accomplished by the Lord Jesus to establish the principle of life. What is the principle of life? The principle of life is to change death into life. In each of the nine cases recorded from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72038" data-verses="John 3:1">chapters three through eleven</span>, the principle is to change death into life. This is especially clear with the case of Lazarus. Lazarus was dead and had been buried for four days. He even smelled. He was full of death from top to bottom and from the inside to the outside. In every layer and corner of his being there was nothing but death. As the record <span class="pg" data-page-id="69" id="69">[69]</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72039" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span> tells us, when the Lord Jesus learned that Lazarus was sick, He did not go to see him. He waited until he was full of death, until he was dead and buried. Then He came to raise Lazarus from the dead. If we apply the principle of life to that case, we see that Jesus changed death into life. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdMBmskAexpdwW2wz1SDsXkynDv29Co6M5pbGhMnLA0lgGhFaxHSuJlcbe7THuX3M"> This principle not only applies to the last case, that of Lazarus, but to the first case, that of Nicodemus. Do you think that Nicodemus was not a person full of death? Because he was full of death, the Lord told him that he needed to be born again that he might have the eternal life which is God Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72040" data-verses="John 3:3">3:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72041" data-verses="John 3:5-6">5-6</span>). In a sense, Nicodemus was living, but in the eyes of God he was a living dead person. In God’s eyes, Nicodemus was dead. He also needed his death to be changed into life. Nicodemus did not even realize that he was sinful, much less that he was dead. Nevertheless, in the eyes of God, he was sinful, serpentine, and dead. As such a person, he needed the changing of death into life. </p>
<p data-content-id="IERNcQ0vWBnLmeh0j0O4v5ReUADpREG0qchAScpqLDYkBPlPEbaDbq1XEh-Wkl5Fg"> The same is true with the Samaritan woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72042" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span>. The Samaritan woman was thirsty, and thirst is a sign of death. When you are thirsty, it means that you are going to die. The fact that you are thirsty indicates that you have death’s element within you. Only the Lord Jesus can quench that thirst. To quench thirst means to change death into life. And so it is with every case recorded by John. Each incident illustrates the principle established in the event of changing water into wine—the principle of changing death into life. </p>

Some may ask, “How could Jesus come in resurrection when He had not been crucified yet? To say this is to allegorize.” Yes, the whole story of changing water into wine is an allegory, and we need to allegorize every part of it. <span class="pg" data-page-id="70" id="70">[70]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72044" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> the words “the next day” are used three times, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72045" data-verses="John 1:29">verses 29</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72046" data-verses="John 1:35">35</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72047" data-verses="John 1:43">43</span>. Why does it say “the next day” three times in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72048" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span> and then speak of “the third day” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72049" data-verses="John 2:1">2:1</span>? “The third day” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72050" data-verses="John 2:1">chapter two</span> should not actually be called the third day, but the fifth. Perhaps you should go to John and argue with him, saying, “Brother John, you did something wrong. You have three ‘next days’ and so the day mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72051" data-verses="John 2:1">2:1</span> should be the fifth day.” John would reply, “Dear brother, that was why I did not speak of the second day, third day, and fourth day in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72052" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span>, but called each of them ‘the next day’ until I called the day in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72053" data-verses="John 2:1">chapter two</span> ‘the third day.’” None of the events which transpired on the “next days” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72054" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span> were in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gx0vCOm6GtVjihAwbIds_pAqXBmKh5IqFjM4fTWKvX8bE_WTVKQYXTJ_fmTiGywyV"> Let us look at the three “next days” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72055" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span>. “The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72056" data-verses="John 1:29">v. 29</span>). Was that in resurrection? Certainly not. How can you say that was in resurrection? “Again the next day John and two of his disciples were standing, and looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72057" data-verses="John 1:35-36">vv. 35-36</span>). Although this happened on the second “next day,” it did not occur on “the third day.” The third “next day” is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72058" data-verses="John 1:43">verse 43</span>. “The next day He would go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip; and Jesus said to him, Follow Me.” This did not happen on “the third day,” because “the third day” is the day of resurrection. None of the events mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72059" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span> transpired on “the third day,” that is, in resurrection. Only as we come to the changing of water into wine in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72060" data-verses="John 2:1">chapter two</span> do we find mention of “the third day.” </p>

<p data-content-id="a9NrvhD6wW1hRS7-gmAmvR11fb7DU8q1AZlxJz81s5YFPu5MILIeqJhyavV3tDNAj"> It is quite interesting to see that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72110" data-verses="John 2:1">John chapter two</span> we firstly have the case of changing water into wine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72111" data-verses="John 2:1-11">2:1-11</span>) and then, following that, the case of dealing with the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72112" data-verses="John 2:12-22">2:12-22</span>). We must believe that both of these cases were recorded for the purpose of signifying something beyond the mere account of historical events. Why does the dealing with the temple follow the changing of death into life? It shows that life is for God’s temple. In other words, life is for God’s building. In the incident of the Lord’s changing water into wine, we saw the principle of life, that is, to change death into life. Now, in the case of the dealing with the temple, we see the goal, the purpose of life, that is, to build the house of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="btOmTWeLFFpscfgnMxMK-TYbahrI2rT3IwVxeSAiE7B_1vo4eGvaKTJstwR_ZClRW">A.

Satan, the enemy of God, is always trying to damage or to frustrate the temple of God. He attempts to defile it with many sinful things. This is the reason that the house of God needs cleansing. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="ycRAO1PQyck3vYSrVAq6nEgApQRQUIW1z8hRVBub6MifAsRtiq85jQsSkWApHYCbK">1. “The Passover Was Near”</h2><p data-content-id="8DJXQ5Z5MNoL38Tw6qB3u_CGTNIKyqqegEmV6n4XFlp5EG2WvIw21JD6sbOEnoo2p"> Jesus cleansed the temple at a time when “the Passover of the Jews was near” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72114" data-verses="John 2:13">2:13</span>). The Passover at that time was a remembrance of God’s salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72115" data-verses="Exodus 12:2-11">Exo. 12:2-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72116" data-verses="Deuteronomy 16:1-3">Deut. 16:1-3</span>) through which remembrance the Jews worshipped God in their temple. But, when the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem, their temple was filled with oxen, sheep, doves, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> money-changers. So, the temple needed a cleansing, and the Lord Jesus did it. </p>
<p data-content-id="-wcKCKo7UARjQdL8sf3zvHMD9JFIhNDZrBP0U3En8T5V9E0iPj-NnoE9Ye4IDqtEN"> The Passover was a prefigure of our remembrance of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72117" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:24-25">1 Cor. 11:24-25</span>). And we are the temple of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72118" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16">1 Cor. 3:16</span>). It is very possible that when we come to the Lord’s table to remember Him, we are filled with earthly things. So, we also need a cleansing that we may be the proper temple of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="WAJQg83IWdCfjdYL76AZ15VPVEx26GdlEPPkU9OnjGQWjiVZrhRbSL1RfcU528vmq"> Let us read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72119" data-verses="John 2:14-16">John 2:14-16</span>. “And He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting there. And having made a whip of cords, He drove them all, both the sheep and the oxen, out of the temple, and He poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned the tables; and to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away; do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise.” The Lord dealt with the house of God by cleansing it with a scourge or a whip made of cords. The King James Version says that the Lord made “a scourge of small cords,” but some versions say that the Lord made a scourge or whip out of rushes, which are inexpensive and ordinary. The Lord made a scourge or whip of ordinary things, of rushes, and used it to cleanse the temple. He drove out the oxen, sheep, doves, and coins. That signified the casting out of all earthly occupations. We are the temple of God, yet we are not filled with God. We are filled with so many things other than God. Although we, as the house of God, should be filled with God, yet the fact is that we are filled with merchandise, money, and tables of the money-changers. Therefore, the Lord must make a whip of cords to drive these things out of us. </p>
<p data-content-id="2Q5ugYZO8sPp0OavyW07YxK3TFSV7Nsfngw8PljfG3IHcn7hxi9igE-N15TGlXeJl"> Often, the Lord uses the ordinary and common things, such as the rushes, to cleanse us. Sometimes He uses someone common to purge you—such as your wife or husband, your parents or children, your employer or employees. We all have experienced the whip of cords which the Lord has made <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> of common persons or ordinary things to purge us. Sometimes the Lord comes to interfere with our lives by turning things upside down. He comes to cast out the sheep, oxen, and doves, and to overthrow the tables in order to bring confusion into the whole situation. For example, last year you gained a lot of money in business, but this year you lose everything—this is a scourge that the Lord uses to purge you. With every seeking Christian there is always someone or something purging him. </p>
<p data-content-id="ukeBrlETbXJ-IG3ca2CPtFbbNDo45cevyTWorYeIAd3f0-tCeAa1VKDztLfP8v9yK"> Generally speaking, a wife who is a seeking child of God always longs for her husband to be spiritual and to love the Lord, but it sometimes turns out to be just the opposite. A husband who loves the Lord always looks to the Lord that his wife might be spiritual and love the Lord, but it is sometimes contrary to his desire. Also parents who sincerely seek after the Lord and pray daily for their children sometimes suffer to see their children going astray. The scourge you experience is made by the Lord. If your husband or wife is quite spiritual, the Lord would have no scourge to purge you. If your sons are like Peter and John and your daughter is like Mary, there would be no rushes available for the Lord to make a scourge. If your parents are like Abraham and Sarah, nothing would purge you. On the one hand, you may daily enjoy the Lord as a feast, but, on the other hand, the Lord will send a scourge a number of times to purge you. Many times the Lord will even use the brothers and sisters in the church as a whip of cords to purge away the merchandise and the money-changers that exist within you. </p>

The Heart’s Desire of the Lord<br/>for the House of God</h2><p data-content-id="IERNcQ0vWBnLmeh0j0e4nqBeUADpREG0qchAScpqLDYkBPlPEbaDbq1XEh-Wkl5Fg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72120" data-verses="John 2:17">Verse 17</span> says, “His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house shall devour Me.” Within the Lord Jesus there was a zeal for the house of God. This zeal devoured Him, ate Him up, consumed Him. He was absolutely for the Father’s house. The Father’s house was His heart’s desire. When He saw the corrupted situation within the temple, He could not tolerate it, but cleansed it, even with a whip. He was driven by zeal for His Father’s house to drive <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> all the defilement out of it. His heart was pure for the Father. He could not suffer to see that the temple, His Father’s house, was defiled, contaminated by the things of man’s greed. So, He cleansed it. </p>
<p data-content-id="H9Hy-5vnqUPnqiRPX5hi8lYOo-iwdpLJdrxLbhLN-vMjiEwxd-HPBShE698D5XbLQ"> Satan tries his best to defile and to contaminate the church life with so many sinful and worldly things. Wherever there is a local church this will always happen. But praise the Lord that Satan’s contamination brings in the Lord’s cleansing. The enemy, Satan, is always busy. He never sleeps. Wherever a local church has been established, Satan will try to defile it. If we lack experience, we shall be very concerned about this. We shall be troubled that the church has been contaminated by the enemy. Let me speak a word to comfort you. If your local church has been contaminated, you should not be discouraged. You should say, “Lord, now is Your time. Lord, come in. Satan’s contamination only brings in Your cleansing.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Xzji_1UPvRreQsGaxtRGLPnah9uQPwAkM0FbIvQrU7oMHeCL0a9Zt9q1Aoejnd4aw">B. The Body of Jesus Being the Temple<br/>Destroyed and Raised Up Again in Resurrection</h2><p data-content-id="knc2QAb9j4ccOXQiYaeKy7A8PHO2T2KEihEStNALFHfsjrXJj2BXpKDG5-NN3oTu8"> Satan’s goal was not only to contaminate the temple, but to destroy it. His ultimate aim was to destroy the house of God. But what the enemy destroyed, the Lord raised up in three days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72121" data-verses="John 2:19">2:19</span>). This means that in His resurrection life the Lord built up what was destroyed by the enemy. It is needless for us to worry about the Lord’s recovery of the church, because the more the enemy damages, the more the Lord will build up in resurrection. The Lord’s word is, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72122" data-verses="John 2:19">2:19</span>). In other words, the enemy may damage and destroy the church, which is the house of God, but the Lord will build it up in resurrection and by resurrection. After the enemy has caused damage, the Lord, in resurrection, will rear up a building on a much larger scale. We should not worry about the confusion that may exist in the church, for the Lord’s Body, the church, is in the process of resurrection. The damage done by the enemy is necessary, because everything natural must be destroyed. Only that which is natural can be destroyed by the enemy. Afterward, the Lord will raise up His church in <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> resurrection. Every time, after trouble damages the church, the church will be recovered and raised up in the newness of resurrection life. During the past, I have seen much damage that really hurt the church, but the more the enemy damaged, the more the Lord built up His church in and by His resurrection. </p>

He uses these cases to signify some spiritual and meaningful points. These cases first expose the condition and need of man, and then they reveal how the Lord can deal with all the conditions and meet all the needs of man. Life meets the need of man’s every case. We must realize that life here means the Lord Himself, the Word which was God and which became flesh. Although the Lord might have dealt with thousands of human cases, John selected only nine of them to illustrate how the Lord as life could and still can meet the need of every human case. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dVGN5WXLxIx0FItFRaquXNdhDedsgBGx6cSHcgladGc5IaMSTaHitKZaPlyR-YeoS">MAN’S CONDITION AND NEED</h2><p data-content-id="QdS_HMSS3SdGPRtEE7VRWWLsrSqMQHxUS3POjiiKGElbtbOCx1j7HNi8K4jPqe1Qb"> Let us see, first of all, the condition of man in each case. The first case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72152" data-verses="John 3:1">chapter three</span> is about a high-class, moral person who came to the Lord. He is a superior gentleman, highly cultured, very religious, God-seeking, and God-fearing. The second case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72153" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span> shows forth exactly the opposite condition. The first case is about a moral man; the second case is about an immoral woman. The former is about a mild, high-class person, while the latter is about a wild, low-class person. This wicked woman had five husbands and was living with a sixth who was not her husband. The third case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72154" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span> is about a young man who was sick and about to die. The fourth case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72155" data-verses="John 5:1">chapter five</span> is about a man <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> who had been sick for thirty-eight years. He was utterly weak and unable to move even one step. The fifth case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72156" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> is about the hungry multitude who was seeking something to feed on. The sixth case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72157" data-verses="John 7:1">chapter seven</span> is about the thirsty people whose thirst could not be quenched by the best religion or by anything of this life. The seventh case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72158" data-verses="John 8:1">chapter eight</span> sets forth a sinful woman who committed a terrible sin and who was under the condemnation and bondage of her sin. The eighth case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72159" data-verses="John 9:1">chapters nine</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72160" data-verses="John 10:1">ten</span> concerns a blind man who was born blind. Finally, the ninth case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72161" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span> is about Lazarus who died and was buried for four days. </p>
<p data-content-id="KH2K8ov9UbVLXhVOivzrS4ZzrungwARtcHESrqPTSQ7WAQf4Mh3jfx5zndjYHF_CI"> The conditions of the people mentioned in these nine cases represent the conditions of all men. Some men are good like Nicodemus, while others are wicked like the Samaritan woman. Others, like the young man in Capernaum, are dying. Most are weak like the man who was sick for thirty-eight years. They desire to do good, but they do not have the strength to fulfill that desire. They know religion, but, because they are weak, they do not have the power to live out its standards or fulfill its regulations. Other people are hungry, craving for something to enjoy, while some are thirsting for something more than their human life can offer them. There are some people whose thirst is so great that nothing in this life can satisfy them. Some people continually commit sins and are under the condemnation and bondage of their sins. Some, like the blind man, are blind, not physically, but psychologically and spiritually. Finally, the last condition of all men is death, for they are in death and, at the same time, are on the road to death. They are dead already and yet they all will die later. All men are dead men who are going to die. Therefore, these nine cases portray the true conditions of all men. These conditions speak for man’s need, which only the Lord as life can fully meet. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lpmcG2OSgx4b8KfNcP9dF5OlNHSx6i6bvSlo1-scnq60V3T2e_f37EFbGHcUWveMa">EACH INDIVIDUAL’S CONDITION AND NEED</h2><p data-content-id="DPmqvJz2MlFezx9EOuwq5WRF0UwqGXmjgMdv89HHfju_NU1jX7KGYx7B706OzsP2g"> All the conditions of these nine cases can also be found in each individual person. One person can possess all the <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> conditions of all men. For example, you may be a good man, or, at least you have the intention of being a good man. You may also be quite religious, fearing God and seeking Him. At the same time, however, you may also have done something mean, something which is not honorable. You may be a religious gentleman with high morals and yet have done something low. On the one hand, you are a high-class person; on the other hand, you are a low-class person. </p>
<p data-content-id="SSy1z1-JelNs_byNvXBvs2uYyIT6RoggYyiZmjl4crSpjkol7KqVeTafPqwkZ2tgp"> You are also sick and about to die morally and spiritually. You may be very living physically, but you are dying morally and spiritually. Even physically you are also dying day by day. Apparently you are living; actually you are dying. </p>
<p data-content-id="gXvFaTgxHGUO-rzGzdrZr7b1l8PodFDz2DYGuF1ZGVlt-c2zGVtRXg1oF_kS85QlB"> Another condition of yours is that you are a weak person. You know that you should do good and you know what is right, but you lack the strength or the power to do it. Perhaps you are not yet twenty-five years old, but you have been sick for “thirty-eight years.” You know that you should love others, but you are weak; you want to keep all the laws of God and you desire to please God, but you are unable to do so. In other words, you have the desire to do good, but you do not have the ability to perform what you desire. You need the proper power of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="e1F2-TvVX-Wo06SOkDShj9R0AkxrzvfUAe3pb0V0IGQJ7M_YNjzT3VkMpObkgjnuy"> Hunger and thirst are also two items of your condition. Many times you feel that you are a hungry person; many times you are thirsty for a Ph.D. degree, for money, or for pleasure. You need the Lord as the bread of life to satisfy your hunger and you need the Lord’s living water to quench your thirst. </p>
<p data-content-id="5w-j5wr_UufC5LfaExbLY1gNbg8EjHeZRqKuWbOgeqQ6qwIVYLcWYffP9g4uA2B9B"> Another condition that can also be found in you as an individual is your sinfulness. You are sinful. You are a sinner and you commit sin. You need the forgiveness of the Lord as well as deliverance from the bondage of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="N4fmiTCMCnn3CkIWVPmYtxfDgyhJ12fvZLXKozkGfvmkz7BV-BxJS1lJhf9hBkG1i"> In another respect, you are in a state of blindness. Even though you may have perfect vision with your physical eyes, you cannot perceive the meaning of human life, and especially you cannot see spiritual things. You are blind and you need the Lord to open your eyes and to give you sight. <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="t85mbqhlppdvhDFBMtXtGa-RvnuiSAQMtG9rBXOBr1lposGVhLl__LaYVRkVvwPem"> Your last condition is that of a dead man who eventually will die. Have you ever realized that you are a dead person? No one is alive in spirit—everyone is dead. You need the resurrection life of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="hXua0_pW3f46EmITi-c0RQ_YjnS6MIc9iKH126QEiPABeTlJOgF_otvYI038EQlw6"> Every person has, in his fallen condition, every aspect of these nine cases. Every person, to a certain degree at least, is in each of these conditions. Every condition is an indication of everyone’s real need. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Uj2hgxuYFe-UC_239vdo7zgrEPXe5jTUAOGzaPqIwSAQiBsHQoHWtKOYJParAMEVp">THE LORD’S SUFFICIENCY IN MEETING MAN’S NEED</h2><p data-content-id="MWwn5_pxNxpNcbAwfb6k3nQ76ebi5X3DU0CvvMTPWuJQBSUmbGja3mdoHOKC8EYbl"> We have seen the condition and need of man in these nine cases. Now we must see how the Lord is able to come into man’s fallen condition and meet his every need. In every case, the Lord presents Himself as the One who could fulfill the deficiencies of man. These nine cases fully prove the Lord’s sufficiency to meet man’s every need. </p>
<p data-content-id="VMLFt4z73i1A5nc8-ZJUevnj8npBxae0I9fekDagnkfCayaI0rHPQg8monXBIOTyM"> The first case shows that the Lord can afford us regeneration, which even a superior person such as Nicodemus needed that he might have the life of God for the entrance into the kingdom of God. The case of the Samaritan woman, a sinful and unsatisfied woman, reveals how much the Lord can satisfy such a person with His living water. For the case of the dying man, the Lord is the healing power of life. The case of the weak man who had been sick for thirty-eight years demonstrates the enlivening power of the Lord’s life. In the case of the hungry multitude which needed something to feed on, the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life. In the case of the thirsty people, the Lord assures them that He can quench their thirst by the flowing river of living water. In the case of the woman living in sin, we see that the Lord is able to deliver such a one from her sinful situation and release her from the bondage of sin. In the case of the blind man, the Lord opens his eyes and gives him sight. Finally, in the case of Lazarus, who had died, had been buried, and was even decaying in the grave, the power of the Lord’s resurrection life is fully exhibited. </p>

The Flesh Begetting Flesh</h2><p data-content-id="Yb8KD0TEIsrERldUuGmHAiNpGwNXPZgTUQSWnXv9XEEyrD-PFldCdx1u3tLElwVtE"> Nicodemus thought that to be born anew was to go back to his mother’s womb and come out of it again. He did not realize that even if that could be done he would still be flesh. Regardless how many times a person could be born out of his mother’s womb, he would still be flesh because flesh begets flesh. So, the Lord told Nicodemus, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72175" data-verses="John 3:6">3:6</span>). Flesh here denotes the natural man with the natural life. Regardless of how many times we could be born of our parents, we still would be a natural man with a natural life. It can never change our nature. To be born anew is not to be born again of our parents, but to be born of God the Spirit that we may have His divine life with His divine nature, a life with a nature absolutely different from our natural life with its nature. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="EkcrSxIpLQOUHK3__pPJPVX9sf_ELGP9UGzvc5KrB8okn42Eg2P38C8PV4PVqU8cJ">4. The Spirit Begetting Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="DPmqvJz2MlFezx9EOugqwExF0UwqGXmjgMdv89HHfju_NU1jX7KGYx7B706OzsP2g"> To be born anew is to be born of the Spirit in our spirit. The divine Spirit regenerates our human spirit with God’s divine life. Regeneration, that is, receiving the divine life, is absolutely a matter that transpires in our spirit. Our spirit was made by God for this very purpose. We have such a special organ, our human spirit, deep within us. In His creation, God made us with a spirit for the purpose that one day we might exercise it to contact Him and to receive Him into our being. The function of the human spirit is to contact God. Regeneration is not a matter of our mind, emotion, or will; it <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> is altogether a matter in our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72176" data-verses="John 1:12-13">Verses 12 and 13</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72177" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> say, “But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.” In what part of our being are we born of God? In our spirit. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. God is a Spirit, and only a spirit can touch a Spirit. Only a spirit can be born of a Spirit. So, regeneration is absolutely a matter in our spirit. It does not matter whether you have a sober mind, a proper emotion, or a strong will. Such things are in another realm. Regeneration transpires in the realm of our spirit. Our spirit is the sphere in which regeneration transpires. In order to be regenerated, you do not exercise your mind, will, or emotion. Simply open yourself up, forgetting what you are, and from deep within your spirit, call on the name of the Lord Jesus, believing in Him. If you do this, immediately God the Spirit will touch your spirit. This will happen quickly, perhaps taking less than a second. If you open yourself from deep within your spirit, calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, in that one second, God the Spirit will enter into your spirit and you will be regenerated. The delivery of a reborn child happens very fast. There is no need of a midwife, nurse, or doctor. When you say, “Lord Jesus, I believe in You,” you are reborn in your spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="SSy1z1-JelNs_byNvXRvkkeYyIT6RoggYyiZmjl4crSpjkol7KqVeTafPqwkZ2tgp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72178" data-verses="John 3:6">verse 6</span>, the Lord said, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” Regeneration is not a birth of the flesh that brings forth flesh. Regeneration is a birth of the Spirit, God’s Spirit, that brings forth spirit, our regenerated spirit. Flesh is our natural man, our old man, our outward man, born of our parents who are flesh. But spirit, our regenerated spirit, is our spiritual man, our new man, our inward, or inner man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72179" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:16">2 Cor. 4:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72180" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">Eph. 3:16</span>), born of God who is the Spirit. When we were born of our parents, we were born flesh; when we were born again of God the Spirit, we were born spirit. The nature of the spirit is different from the nature of the flesh. The nature of the flesh is born human, but the nature of the spirit is born divine. Before we were regenerated, we lived by our flesh and had <span class="pg" data-page-id="105" id="105">[105]</span> our being in our flesh; our spirit was dead. By regeneration, our dead spirit was not only quickened, made alive, but also imparted with the divine life of God by the Spirit. Now our spirit is a regenerated spirit and becomes our new being. Formerly our flesh was our being by which we lived; now our spirit is our being by which we should live. The first Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72181" data-verses="John 3:6">verse 6</span> is the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God, and the second spirit is the human spirit, the regenerated spirit of man. Regeneration transpires in the human spirit, by the Holy Spirit of God with God’s uncreated, eternal life. To be regenerated is to have the divine eternal life as the new source and the new element of our new being. </p>
<p data-content-id="H9Hy-5vnqUPnqiRPX6Bi8nYOo-iwdpLJdrxLbhLN-vMjiEwxd-HPBShE698D5XbLQ"> Once our spirit has been born of the Spirit of God with the life of God, it has the Spirit of God with the life of God in it and mingled with it. So it becomes a mingled spirit—our human spirit mingled with God’s divine Spirit, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72182" data-verses="Romans 8:16">Romans 8:16</span> says, “The Spirit...with our spirit.” It is in this mingled spirit that we are “one spirit” with the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72183" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). Because it is such a mingled spirit, in many places in the New Testament, such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72184" data-verses="Romans 8:4-6">Romans 8:4-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72185" data-verses="Romans 8:10">10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72186" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">Galatians 5:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72187" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72188" data-verses="Ephesians 4:23">Ephesians 4:23</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72189" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">6:18</span>, it is rather difficult to say whether the word “spirit” refers to God’s divine Spirit or to our human spirit. Now, the two spirits are mingled as one within us. This mingling comes from regeneration. Regeneration brings forth in us a newborn spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72190" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:26">Ezek. 36:26</span>), indwelt by and mingled with God’s divine Spirit. Now this spirit with God’s divine life in it is our new being by which we should live and walk. We should no longer walk according to the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72191" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">Gal. 5:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72192" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Rom. 8:4</span>). It is in this spirit that we are regenerated persons. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xzji_1UPvRreQsGaxuxGLNnah9uQPwAkM0FbIvQrU7oMHeCL0a9Zt9q1Aoejnd4aw"> It is also correct to say that we have been born again by the Word of God. However, we must realize that the Word in black and white letters cannot regenerate us. Only the Word that is the Spirit can do this (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72193" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>). God, the Word, and the Spirit—all must be the Spirit that regenerates us. God Himself is the Spirit in regeneration, and the Word also must be the Spirit. Whatever we preach when we preach the gospel must be in the Spirit, for it is the Spirit that gives life to people in their spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="knc2QAb9j4ccOXQiYZ-Kx7g8PHO2T2KEihEStNALFHfsjrXJj2BXpKDG5-NN3oTu8"> It is difficult to understand thoroughly what regeneration is because it is a matter accomplished by, with, and in the Holy Spirit. And it is difficult to define what is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is here. Can you define Him? He is present, constant, instant, prevailing, and available. Nevertheless, if you are to be born of the Spirit, some conditions must be fulfilled. The first condition is that you must repent and confess that you are a sinner. Then you need to believe in the Lord Jesus and call on His name. You should not just call with your lips, tongue, or throat, but open up from the depths of your being and say from deep within your spirit, “O Lord Jesus, I believe in You.” When you do this, the divine Spirit will enter into you immediately. When He comes into you, it is Christ coming into you. It is also the Triune God coming into you. The Holy Spirit is nothing less than Christ Himself. In fact, the Holy Spirit is nothing less than the Triune God. The Father is in the Son, and the Son today is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72194" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). When the Spirit comes into you, both the Son and the Father also come into you. Thus, from the time that you are born again, the Father, the Son, and Spirit are in you. This Triune God is the divine life. The divine life is not separate from the Triune God. From the very moment you are regenerated, you have the Triune God within your spirit as your divine life. Now you have two lives: the human life in your flesh and the divine life in your spirit. </p>

Although this chapter is so elevated, speaking about the rebirth, it seemed to me that suddenly, beginning at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72245" data-verses="John 3:22">verse 22</span>, it became rather low. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72246" data-verses="John 3:22">Verse 22</span> says, “After these things, Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea; and there He stayed with them and baptized.” When I read this verse as a young man, I thought that there was no need for it. It seemed to me that such a record was unnecessary. I felt the same about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72247" data-verses="John 3:23">verse 23</span>, which says that John was baptizing in Aenon near Salim because there was much water there. I was also bothered by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72248" data-verses="John 3:24">verse 24</span>, which says that John had not yet been thrown into prison. I asked, “What is all this about? After the mention of heavenly and spiritual things, why are things such as imprisonment mentioned?” The reason for this appears in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72249" data-verses="John 3:26">verse 26</span>. “And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.” Why did John include all of these verses? Simply for the purpose of exposing the tail of the fox. What is this tail? It is the matter of who will have the crowd and the following. Today people’s attitude is, “This is one who follows me. All of these are my following. Why should some of them go to you?” What we find today was also present in the time of John the Baptist. </p>
<p data-content-id="hXua0_pW3f46EmITj8c0VDvYjnS6MIc9iKH126QEiPABeTlJOgF_otvYI038EQlw6"> John’s reply begins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72250" data-verses="John 3:27">verse 27</span>. “John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven. You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72251" data-verses="John 3:27-28">vv. 27-28</span>). If I had <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> been there, I would have said to John, “Brother, if this is the case, you should go home and not baptize anymore. Since the One of whom you testified is now baptizing, you should stop your baptizing. If you continue to baptize, you will surely be cast into prison.” John was good, but he was not clear. The problem was that after Jesus came upon the scene, John was still there. John should have withdrawn and allowed the Lord Jesus to occupy the whole scene. There should have been only one main figure, not two. When I was young, I did not understand why John was cast into prison. Later I came to realize that he was put into prison because he did not withdraw from the scene. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Uj2hgxuYFe-UC_238tdo8jArEPXe5jTUAOGzaPqIwSAQiBsHQoHWtKOYJParAMEVp">I. THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="MWwn5_pxNxpNcbAweZ6kx3g76ebi5X3DU0CvvMTPWuJQBSUmbGja3mdoHOKC8EYbl"> Nevertheless John said, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full. He must increase, but I must decrease” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72252" data-verses="John 3:29-30">vv. 29-30</span>). Most Christians, especially most of the Christian teachers, misinterpret <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72253" data-verses="John 3:30">verse 30</span>. What does it mean for Christ to increase and for you to decrease? It means that you must withdraw from the scene and from having the following and allow Christ to be the only figure on the scene and to have all the following. All the following should go to Christ; none of it should go to John the Baptist or to anyone else. Since John did not make this matter clear to his disciples, they were jealous on his behalf. When John’s disciples saw that all the people went to Jesus, they were unhappy. They seemed to say, “Why do these people not follow our teacher, but they go to Jesus?” Do you see the point? If John had withdrawn from the scene, there would have been no problem. If he had told all of his disciples to go to the Lord Jesus, no longer accepting a following for himself, there would have been no difficulty. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="VMLFt4z73i1A5nc8_bJUU9Hj8npBxae0I9fekDagnkfCayaI0rHPQg8monXBIOTyM">A. Christ Coming<br/>as the Bridegroom for the Bride</h2><p data-content-id="idWE0reFGaAWAlr_laBPtpmCTiqbcPOP0DvCKdvLJMaSDuuVJK3S-muAf0I_c0Lu5"> However, in answering his disciples John made the matter clear to them that he was not the Christ, or the bridegroom <span class="pg" data-page-id="121" id="121">[121]</span> who came for the bride; he was only the friend of the bridegroom. He told them clearly that Christ was the bridegroom who came for the bride. People should not follow him; they should follow Christ so that He might have His bride. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Uj2hgxuYFe-UC_238tdo7xgrEPXe5jTUAOGzaPqIwSAQiBsHQoHWtKOYJParAMEVp">B. All the Regenerated Ones<br/>Becoming One as the Bride of Christ<br/>Given Him by God</h2><p data-content-id="MWwn5_pxNxpNcbAweZ6k3lQ76ebi5X3DU0CvvMTPWuJQBSUmbGja3mdoHOKC8EYbl"> John wrote his gospel under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. By his words we can see that all the regenerated followers of Christ are His increase. The increase in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72254" data-verses="John 3:30">verse 30</span> is the bride in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72255" data-verses="John 3:29">verse 29</span>, and the bride there is a living composition of all the regenerated people. This means that in this chapter on regeneration, regeneration is not only to bring the divine life into the believers and annul the satanic nature in their flesh, but also to make them the corporate bride for Christ’s increase. The last two points, to annul the serpentine nature in the believers and to make them the bride of Christ, are both fully developed in John’s writing of Revelation. The book of Revelation mainly reveals how Satan as the old serpent will be fully eliminated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72256" data-verses="Revelation 20:2">Rev. 20:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72257" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">10</span>), and how the bride of Christ as the New Jerusalem will be fully produced (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72258" data-verses="Revelation 21:2">Rev. 21:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72259" data-verses="Revelation 21:10-27">10-27</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="VMLFt4z73i1A5nc8_bJUdvHj8npBxae0I9fekDagnkfCayaI0rHPQg8monXBIOTyM"> Although most Christians are familiar with regeneration in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72260" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span>, very few see that each regenerated person should be a part of the increase of Christ, which is His bride. Regeneration is for the increase of Christ. It is for the producing of the bride. Regeneration is for you to be a part of the bride of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72261" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span> is a chapter of regeneration for the increase of Christ. Many Christians only see regeneration itself. They do not see the purpose of regeneration. Is regeneration just for you to have eternal life? No! It is for something more. Regeneration is for us to be built into the bride, which is the increase of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="idWE0reFGaAWAlr_laBPl72CTiqbcPOP0DvCKdvLJMaSDuuVJK3S-muAf0I_c0Lu5"> Originally we all were little serpents with a serpentine nature. By regeneration, the serpentine nature has been terminated. We saw this clearly in the last message. Furthermore, in regeneration we all have been germinated with the divine life. Since our serpentine nature has been terminated <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> and since we have been germinated with the divine life, we are all a part of the bride. Are you a serpentine person or are you a part of the bride of Christ? We are parts of the bride! We are parts of the increase of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="10MJntexVw9mtYnMzYbgxijXBkYBi4_k9Sj8fkt-_KQkx6FVLKr6wXK38c_eWnUfc"> The Gospel of John is a book about the increase of Christ. Christ as the bridegroom needs a bride. He came for this purpose. He came for His increase. How will He obtain His increase? By entering into us and making us a part of Himself. We all are parts of Christ. As parts of Christ composed together, we are the bride of Christ, His increase. Both salvation and regeneration are for this purpose, for the bride as the increase of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9S6bAz339mYziRGei8IHgiCxJB4XTlUEwBDRLoFRB3ON6PAI2cNs0NusS0QT3DlqC">C.

All of the reborn people are the increase of Christ, and this increase is the bride which becomes the counterpart of Christ. The bride is the church, the composition of all the regenerated people. All those who are regenerated are composed together as the corporate bride to match Christ. Without regeneration, Christ cannot have a bride as His increase. </p>
<p data-content-id="TwQlMH4WYSvmZBpvVHHAULe6we6-xicmxEL3iHsGvInd9AHz0HO8m2UzNBdzAcSKQ"> The bride as the increase of Christ is like Eve who was the increase of Adam. When Adam was first created, he was single—a so-called bachelor. In Adam’s single state, there was no increase. After God took a rib out of Adam and built a woman with it, this woman was married to Adam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72262" data-verses="Genesis 2:21-24">Gen. 2:21-24</span>). Once she was joined to Adam, she became the increase of Adam. Adam then had an increase and was no longer single. </p>

<p data-content-id="65XEpihaZD6ISNAVL6qJ1i1YFIvvJdVmQZ8Nms4k0sV2bawyzQ5gp4-b5hMWcG5LI"> In this message we come to the case of the Samaritan woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72280" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span>. This case is the second of the nine cases. There is a great contrast between this case and that of Nicodemus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72281" data-verses="John 3:1">chapter three</span>. Nicodemus was a moral, high-class man; the Samaritan woman was an immoral, low-class woman. The first case sets forth a man with superior attainments while the second sets forth a woman with dishonorable behavior. The man was a Jew whereas the woman was a Samaritan. The Jewish religion was very sound, proper, real, and genuine, but the Samaritan’s religion was false and very decadent. It is also interesting to note that the Lord talked with the man at night, but that He talked with the woman at midday. In the nighttime the man came to the Lord; in the daytime the Lord came to the woman. The place where the Lord talked with the man was in a house or a building, but He talked with the woman in the open air. </p>
<p data-content-id="RlO-2vedqmdQXARA-9q4CT2WiHInosSJJl_rxLF7T71PLsdG2vlqt0YIcHtVEPKWx"> In the case of Nicodemus the first need of mankind is covered. According to spiritual experience, mankind’s first need is regeneration. In God’s economy man’s first need is regeneration. God’s economy is that man have His divine life and be one with Him in life and nature for the fulfillment and accomplishment of His eternal purpose. God’s eternal purpose is to have a group of people who have been regenerated by His divine life and who are the same as He is in both life and nature, that they might become His <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> corporate expression for eternity. This is God’s eternal purpose and this is God’s economy. In order to fulfill this purpose, we must be regenerated that we may have His divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="sKcQzI-JcYxQ0t13gey9fs_QTOnJKztGW9tk91ziTD0CMYbh07w9aYssE7T5F0S5x"> The kingdom of God is entered only by birth, never by works. For example, a bird is in the bird kingdom only by birth; a fish can never enter the bird kingdom by any kind of work. The only possible way for you to enter any kind of kingdom is by having a particular kind of birth. Therefore, the first aspect of the Lord becoming our life is that He gives us divine life by means of a divine birth, which is the only way to share the things of the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="wdYDXrVTBi16uQIJGdAKIu_FAbXHIhsQrac_ssNkW8MNVZd8_yYP9-uGMvsFev98q"> What is man’s second need? What is his need following regeneration? The second need is satisfaction. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72282" data-verses="John 3:1">chapter three</span> the problem is that man is void of the divine life. Regardless of how good or superior you may be, it means nothing as far as God’s eternal purpose is concerned. As long as you have not been regenerated, you are void of the divine life. You only have human life. The human life is simply a vessel to contain the divine life. If you do not have the divine life, you are void. You are just an empty vessel. Although your human life may be wonderful, you do not have the divine life. The divine life is God Himself. You need this divine life to fill you up as your content. Your human life is a container to contain this divine life. When this divine life is within you, it becomes your content. As your content, it will also be your satisfaction. Before we were saved, we all had the experience of being empty. Regardless of our success or attainments, there was a continual emptiness within, the sensation of having no satisfaction. Whether we were good or bad, we were empty. Although we had the container, the vessel, we did not have the content. We were empty. Young and old, rich and poor, high and low—all are empty. One day we received the Lord Jesus. We not only obtained God’s salvation, but we also received the divine life, which immediately became our content. Now we have satisfaction. Therefore, following the case showing the need of regeneration, we have a case showing genuine <span class="pg" data-page-id="133" id="133">[133]</span> satisfaction. Nothing can satisfy man except Christ Himself. As long as Christ is not the satisfaction of our human life, nothing can satisfy us. There is no satisfaction apart from Christ. As human beings, we always feel thirsty; only Christ can quench our thirst. </p>

A THIRSTY SAVIOR AND<br/>A THIRSTY SINNER</h2><p data-content-id="ycRAO1PQyck3vYSrUBK6uWAApQRQUIW1z8hRVBub6MifAsRtiq85jQsSkWApHYCbK"> The case of the Samaritan woman reveals that Christ is real satisfaction. While Nicodemus was a pure-blooded Jew, the Samaritan woman was of mixed blood. Everything related to her was a ruin; nothing was pure or good. The Samaritans claimed to be the descendants of Jacob. At most, they were his descendants by mixed blood. While the name of Nicodemus is given, no one knows the name of the Samaritan woman. Because she was mean and low, the Bible does not divulge her name. She was altogether a mixture. She was an extraordinary case among all of the cases. If you read the Bible carefully, you will find that everything about her was extraordinary. Even her coming out to the well to draw water was extraordinary. According to the custom in the Middle East, the women come to draw water in the late afternoon, not at noontime. When the sun is going down, the women come to draw water in companies. However, this Samaritan woman came to draw water at noontime by herself. Why did she do this? Because she had a bad name, and no one would keep company with her. She was afraid of being talked about, of being criticized, and she did not dare come in the late afternoon when so many other people would be there. She came at noon when the sun was blazing and when no one else would come out of the house. This woman was poor and immoral. She had had five husbands and was living with one that was not her husband. No one cared for her. She knew this and came to draw water at such a lonely time, expecting that no one would see her. </p>
<p data-content-id="8DJXQ5Z5MNoL38Tw7rh3mtyGTNIKyqqegEmV6n4XFlp5EG2WvIw21JD6sbOEnoo2p"> In the case of the Samaritan woman there are many signs. The case itself is a sign, but within this sign, there are many signs. The case itself signifies that Christ is our <span class="pg" data-page-id="134" id="134">[134]</span> satisfaction, but one of the signs within the case is the woman. </p>
<p data-content-id="0qg4Xe6SXa0i7DIipQPBp5h0kmjnUFXxSvp-5BeODfOoXLrE4iTl60302dFOLF8PT"> According to the types and figures in the Scriptures, what does a woman signify? Firstly, a woman signifies that humanity needs to rely upon God. Man can never stand alone; he must rely upon God, who is both his Maker and Husband (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72283" data-verses="Isaiah 54:5">Isa. 54:5</span>). Brothers, allow me to ask you this question: Is your standing before God that of a male or a female? If you were to ask me, I would tell you that although I am a man of over sixty years of age, I do realize that my standing before God is that of a female. My position before God is not that of a man, but of a woman, because I can never stand alone. I need God to rely upon. A woman signifies a person who cannot stand alone. This is both your position and mine. In figure, we are either males or females, but in reality we are all females. None of us can stand by himself. Man can never be independent. Nowadays people proclaim independence, but I must tell you that you can never be independent. You were created to be dependent upon God. Whenever anyone tries to be independent, he will be dissatisfied, because God created man inherently dependent. </p>
<p data-content-id="7fkTGT1KmmDoykHcm5OsXtOxLLBusIlFpNkxlpqD2Abt5CGw7IP8GFtf4BNL-5J_z"> A woman also signifies weakness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72284" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">1 Pet. 3:7</span>). We human beings must realize that we are weak. We are all weak because we are all human. Do not think that your wife is a weak vessel and that you are a strong one. Although this may be true figuratively, in fact both men and women are weak. In some cases, as far as spiritual things are concerned, the brothers are weaker than the sisters. When the Lord Jesus was about to be betrayed and put to death, the sisters in the New Testament were stronger than the brothers. The sisters were much stronger at the time of the Lord’s death, resurrection, and ascension. Even in loving the Lord, Mary was the strongest. So, brothers, do not proudly think that you are the strongest. We are all human and we were all made weak and dependent so that we would have to rely upon the Lord. </p>

The living water is good, but if we do not have a way to take it, it means nothing to us. What good is it to have something marvelous and excellent in the heavens if we cannot reach it? But here we find the living water and the way to take it. </p>
<p data-content-id="piHiQSgOUStVtrqyqGSWVVp9Yfx9XL-jvmOyYyXYXCi31VAdk39LRDLmD7JuKz1I5"> The Lord Jesus was a simple, brief, yet prevailing preacher. He did not give a sermon; He simply had a short talk with the Samaritan woman. By that short talk, she was attracted. I hope that all the young people will learn the way of preaching the gospel from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72304" data-verses="John 4:1">John chapter four</span>.

The Lord was a good preacher. He seemed to say, “If you knew who I am and if you knew God’s gift, and if you knew the living water that I give, you would certainly ask for it.” The woman asked for it immediately. In our foolish talk with people, the more we talk, the more we keep them away. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="144" id="144">[144]</span> the Lord Jesus spoke very briefly and the woman was attracted and asked for the living water. </p>

To Repent of and Confess Her Sins—<br/>“Husbands”</h2>
<p data-content-id="RlO-2vedqmdQXARA-9a4FB2WiHInosSJJl_rxLF7T71PLsdG2vlqt0YIcHtVEPKWx"> When the woman asked the Lord for the water, He did not rebuke her, telling her to repent and make a thorough confession of her sins. No, the Lord spoke softly and gently, saying, “Go, call your husband and come here” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72306" data-verses="John 4:16">4:16</span>). The Lord seemed to be saying, “I want your husband. You ask Me for the living water, and I ask you for your husband. Let us trade. You trade your husband for the living water.” This word was intended to touch her conscience with her immoral history that she might repent of her sins. “The woman answered and said, I don’t have a husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I don’t have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you said truly.” Did the woman lie or tell the truth? It was a truth, yet it was a lie. She told a lie by speaking the truth. It was a truthful lie. This is the deceptive nature of fallen man. However, the Lord was gentle with her and did not rebuke her. He even appreciated her, saying, “You have well said, I don’t have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you said truly” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72307" data-verses="John 4:17-18">4:17-18</span>). The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.” The Lord’s words frightened her. She seemed to say, “Isn’t this man a Jew? He has never lived in our town. How did he get to know my background? Who told him that I had five husbands and that the one I have now is not my husband?” This is the way to have a gospel talk. Do not talk vainly to people, but touch their conscience, not in the way of rebuking them, but in the way of unveiling them. By the Lord’s gracious and wise words that woman’s conscience was touched. The proper way to minister the gospel is to touch people’s conscience. </p>
<p data-content-id="sKcQzI-JcYxQ0t13geC9Z-vQTOnJKztGW9tk91ziTD0CMYbh07w9aYssE7T5F0S5x"> The thirst of this Samaritan woman had led her to many wrong things, such as having five husbands and living with a <span class="pg" data-page-id="145" id="145">[145]</span> man who was not her husband. That was the kind of life she found herself in. She sought the physical things to satisfy her, but found only dissatisfaction. The six men represent the physical and material things, which could never satisfy people. </p>
<p data-content-id="wdYDXrVTBi16uQIJGdwKB9fFAbXHIhsQrac_ssNkW8MNVZd8_yYP9-uGMvsFev98q"> Besides the physical things, she also had sought satisfaction in religion. Although she was such a simple person, she was also religious. She was very weak, yet it is strange that she talked about religion. Mere religion can never help. Furthermore, she had tradition, for the well of Jacob represents the traditional things. She had a traditional heritage which she inherited from her forefathers. But soon she found emptiness in her tradition. Therefore, this Samaritan woman had three categories of things—the physical things, the religious things, and the traditional things. These three categories represent everything we can get out of human life. There is nothing else in human life other than that which is physical, religious, or traditional. None of these physical, religious, or traditional matters can ever satisfy people, for the more they get these things, the more they become thirsty. There is never an end to their thirst. </p>
<p data-content-id="L2ANrEyjfbJ7B2dFQ1OoheGOFniVzGXaJCUsnvi40kXchfitT6kS-85r480rXaxQ_"> The husbands of this woman are a sign. Christ should be the only husband. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72308" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:1">2 Corinthians 11</span>, the apostle Paul told us that he has espoused us to Christ. In other words, he has engaged us to Christ. Christ is the real husband. But this woman had five husbands besides one other man. The reason this woman was wicked and immoral was because she was thirsty. Because her many husbands could not satisfy her, she remained dissatisfied. When the first husband did not satisfy her, she sought satisfaction from her second husband. But her second husband did not satisfy her inner thirst either. Then she married the third one, but this one also could not satisfy her; neither could her fourth and fifth husbands satisfy, because the living water was her only need. Regardless of how much she drank the earthly water in her many husbands, she still felt thirsty. Therefore, the Lord told her that whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again. Anyone who drinks the water of physical, religious, and traditional <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> things will thirst again. Only the Lord Jesus has the living water that can quench our thirst. </p>
<p data-content-id="mplh2Ii9SxX3L81TA4QuNF9vxczWHaVmNU91nzbGcnLT3uA9GiS-fWkrhi4wJZm5Z"> What do her husbands signify? They signify anything that is other than Christ. Anything outside of Christ may become sinful. If we depend upon anyone or anything other than Christ, that may be quite sinful. The husbands of the Samaritan woman became the history of her whole sinful life. As we have seen, the Lord touched her sinful history in a very wise way. He did not condemn her sinfulness as a sinner or legally make her repent and confess her sins practically as some evangelists would. Since the Lord knows everything, He simply touched her conscience by asking her to bring her husband. By this way, the Lord helped her to confess her sins and repent. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zo9dN5yT4RaGVzmhfQejRabwO4N0OSuZjtDQf5M2EBBxv1xMr6YswtQOIRp7t2MTg"> Because the Lord’s word about her husbands touched her conscience, she immediately changed the conversation to the matter of worship. She was quite clever in doing this. Although she was such an immoral woman, she still talked about the worship of God. This proves where religion is. People may discuss religion and still live in immorality. This woman did not confess her sins, but turned the subject from her husbands to that of worshipping God, saying, “Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship.” This change of subject was the subtlety of the Samaritan woman. The woman’s problem with the matter of worship, like the questions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72309" data-verses="John 8:3-7">8:3-7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72310" data-verses="John 9:2-3">9:2-3</span>, was a matter of yes or no, which belongs to the tree of knowledge; but the Lord turns her to the spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72311" data-verses="John 4:21-24">vv. 21-24</span>), which belongs to the tree of life (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72312" data-verses="Genesis 2:9-17">Gen. 2:9-17</span>). When the woman changed the subject from her husband to worship, the Lord Jesus took the opportunity to reveal to her the proper way of receiving the living water. </p>

<p data-content-id="Xzji_1UPvRreQsGawsRGPfXah9uQPwAkM0FbIvQrU7oMHeCL0a9Zt9q1Aoejnd4aw"> Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee, the place of the weak and fragile people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72339" data-verses="John 4:43-46">John 4:43-46</span>). Cana is in Galilee, a despised place (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72340" data-verses="John 7:41">7:41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72341" data-verses="John 7:52">52</span>), which signifies the world of a low and mean condition where the weak and fragile people are. The Lord was here once during the first sign to change the death water into life wine. Now He comes back to the same place to do the second sign, which in the principle of life corresponds with the first sign—to change death into life. </p>

This case concerns the son of a royal official who was about to die. Mankind firstly needs regeneration, secondly satisfaction, and thirdly healing. We all need a certain amount of healing. In a sense, we are living; in another sense, we all are dying. When a baby is newly born, his mother would think that he is growing. Actually the baby is dying. Everyone on earth is dying. If you are young, still under thirty years of age, you may not have the sense that you are dying. However, when you reach the age of sixty or seventy, you realize that you are dying. A life span of seventy years may be likened to seventy dollars. Each year that is lived is the equivalent of spending a dollar. Once you have lived sixty years, you have spent sixty dollars. When you reach the age of sixty-nine, it means that you have only one dollar left. Once that dollar has been spent, you will be exhausted. So, human beings are apparently living, but actually dying. This is why I do not ask my <span class="pg" data-page-id="160" id="160">[160]</span> children or grandchildren to celebrate my birthday, for my birthday tells me that I am dying. Tell me, is your age increasing or decreasing? The longer we live, the less time we have to live. I do not want to reach the age of seventy. I would like to stay back, but I cannot do it. We all need healing. </p>
<p data-content-id="zBGhA3590E7XPL6idOP_NtuBnKECgCDATp-tFcRb9BVVdo8R8xctsKXmFfAC4TlQd"> We have been regenerated and, day by day, we may contact the Lord, the living Spirit, for our satisfaction. In addition to this, we need healing. We are all sick and dying people. We are fallen people, weak and fragile, who are dying and who need the Lord’s healing. If you have the healing of the Lord Jesus, your dying will become living. </p>
<p data-content-id="a9NrvhD6wW1hRS7-hnAmjR11fb7DU8q1AZlxJz81s5YFPu5MILIeqJhyavV3tDNAj"> Let me share with you my secret prayer to the Lord. I have told the Lord, “Lord, the time of Your coming is near. Do me a favor—keep me from seeing death. Lord, I want to see You physically face to face. Keep me living until You come.” Hallelujah, He is coming! While He is coming, He is healing. While He is on His way, He is healing our spirit, soul, and body. If you want to be healthy, you need to enjoy the healing of Jesus. Jesus is the real health food store. Come to Jesus, contact Him, and enjoy Him. If you participate in Jesus continually, you will have the best food, the real health food. How we need the healing of the divine life! </p>

Our mortal body will be enlivened, quickened, and healed with the divine life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72343" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> reveals that our spirit, soul, and body all may receive the divine life. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, He, as the life-giving Spirit, comes into our spirit. Since He is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72344" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> is called the Spirit of life, meaning that the divine Spirit is life. When we called on the Lord Jesus, this divine Spirit who is life came into our spirit and enlivened it. Therefore, our spirit is life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72345" data-verses="Romans 8:10">Rom. 8:10</span>). When we set the mind of our soul upon the spirit, our mind also becomes life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72346" data-verses="Romans 8:6">Rom. 8:6</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="161" id="161">[161]</span>). If we give ground to the indwelling Spirit, the Spirit will spread Himself from within our spirit through our soul into our body, making our mortal body a body full of life. Eventually, this divine life becomes a fourfold life: the life in the divine Spirit, the life that fills our spirit, the life that will saturate our soul, and the life that will permeate our body. Our whole being—spirit, soul, and body—will be filled, saturated, and permeated with the divine life. This is healing. Whenever the divine life enters into a part of our being, it heals that part. This means that the divine life changes the death of that part of our being into life. Death is swallowed up by life—this is healing. </p>
<p data-content-id="QdS_HMSS3SdGPRtEF5lRQE7srSqMQHxUS3POjiiKGElbtbOCx1j7HNi8K4jPqe1Qb"> We need regeneration, satisfaction, and healing. Many of us, particularly the sisters, need healing in our emotions. The sisters need healing in their unbalanced emotions, for there is a kind of sickness in their emotions. Why do you sisters cry so easily? Probably because of the sickness in your emotions. You need healing. The brothers need healing in their unbalanced mind and in their stubborn will. Why are you brothers so stubborn in your will? Once you make up your will, nothing on earth can change it. That is a disease, a sickness. We need healing. Praise the Lord that He is healing! To tell you the truth, even this morning I received some healing through my dear wife. My wife was not the healer, but she was the dispenser of the heavenly medicine. We all need healing. This healing is the transformation. The more we are healed in our mind, emotion, and will, the more we are transformed. </p>

The man believed the word which Jesus said to him and went his way” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72349" data-verses="John 4:50">4:50</span>). The royal official believed the word out of the mouth of the Lord. When he learned from his slaves that the boy was living, he and his whole household <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> believed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72350" data-verses="John 4:51-53">4:51-53</span>). Hallelujah for the life-giving word! We love the life-giving word, not the word in dead letters, but the word that is the Spirit. The Lord simply spoke the life-giving word, and the dying boy was healed. Today the Lord is still sending forth His healing word. When the dying people receive this word through believing, they are healed with life. Once the life-giving word has been transfused into us, whether or not we are conscious of it, we can never be the same. The life-giving word brings about a real change in our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="OmAqQ18Wpl0cohVFljInYyB7NlRn8E3s18gEOw62GPpG9u6ni9v0XbHYnRZDBjgL3"> When dying people receive the word through believing and are healed with life, this, in principle, is changing death into life. Death’s deadening power is overcome by life. Praise the Lord for His healing life and for the life-giving word that heals all our sicknesses! Death is of the source of the tree of knowledge, and life is of the source of the tree of life. We were born into the sickness of death. The Lord’s word of life heals our death. All we need is to receive and believe in His life-giving and healing word. </p>
<p data-content-id="4TUau6dLXXRywSAVK1KAuL_lFrgTjOpy_3LINqVcTISbRAG_tv46RgQoE2WRrdCmW"> The case of the healing of the son of the royal official signifies that there is no need for us to contact the Lord physically. As long as we have the Lord’s word, it is sufficient. Even though we do not have the Lord’s physical presence, as long as we have His word and work, it is good enough, and nothing more is needed. When we have the word of the Lord, we shall be saved and filled with the Lord. Just His word is enough to heal and save us. </p>

THE INADEQUACY<br/>OF RELIGION’S LAW-KEEPING AND<br/>THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE SON’S LIFE-GIVING</h2><p data-content-id="_c-31afrsqWhR9jECoO3F6dcuMq9xLD-ecnr7fV1PZOouCe3G2hx5BHraOpAV5inS"> The case of the impotent man exposes the inadequacy of religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72352" data-verses="John 5:1-9">5:1-9</span>). No religion on earth is better than the Jewish religion, for it is the genuine and typical religion formed according to God’s holy oracle. The Jewish religion was formed according to the Divine Word. It worships the one true God in the correct way. No other religion can compare with it. </p>
<p data-content-id="BIN7s6C3jIrwhmOtEiJQA3p98HXXDvzIG873PQJvi9ygFduggN23Zk5vk4njinT-6"> However, religion does not belong to God’s economy and it cannot fulfill God’s purpose. God never intended to have a religion. Yes, God did give to His people His Holy Word, the Old Testament, and He did tell them how to contact Him. There is no doubt about this. However, God had no intention of having a religion. Religion is a human invention, a product of the fallen human mind. It is the best invention of human culture. But, concerning God’s economy, religion is God’s worst enemy. It is absolutely against His economy. I say again that God had no intention of establishing a religion. His intention was to give His Holy Word to His people, revealing to them that the coming One, the Son of God, would be their salvation and life for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> coming One would be everything to them—righteousness, holiness, redemption, and glory. The Jewish people did not have this realization. Instead, they selected portions of the commandments in God’s Holy Word and used them to devise rituals and regulations. They put together these commandments, rituals, and regulations and formed a religion. What is a religion? The best definition of it is not found in Webster’s dictionary. Religion is to worship God and to behave ourselves without Christ. Religion is just you trying your best to worship God, to behave properly to please God, and to be a perfect person—all without Christ. Although everything may be good—you worship God according to the regulations and you behave yourself—it is all void of Christ. It seems that people have Christ in Christianity, but mostly that is simply Christ in term. If you only have Christ in term, that also is religion. We must have Christ as reality. Only with Christ as our reality are we outside of religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="xOo-j224Hj5u9Wh_E2IK7Pxj7GP-Eq9xBADShaZxPMlXAITSSXmqqrcQZSIT_Aurv"> When the Lord Jesus came, He came as the One who was prophesied in the Old Testament. He was the One who came to be salvation, life, righteousness, holiness, redemption, glory, and everything to God’s people. But, when He came, God’s people, the Jews, were fully occupied with their religion. They had no room in their hearts for this coming One. If you read the four Gospels, you will see that wherever the Lord went and wherever He was, He was opposed by that typical religion formed according to God’s Holy Word. Those religionists opposed this living One according to their religion. They thought that they were opposing Christ for God. They even sentenced this living One to death in their attempt to protect God. According to their realization, when Jesus said that He was the Son of God, He was speaking blasphemy, making Himself equal to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72353" data-verses="John 5:18">5:18</span>). It seems that they said, “We have only one God and no other. Our God is Jehovah Elohim. We don’t have a God by the name of Jesus. If You say that You are the Son of God, You are making Yourself equal to God and are blaspheming. We must put You to death.” That was religion. <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="rLGBtKAwOkfYXgIGPtzW7jwVg5s0ZxG50AlbMCy9cko_zYUvRELw3BdMHVjcPV4To"> In principle, the situation is the same today. Many religious people worship God and try their best to please Him, to behave themselves, and to make themselves perfect. Yet, it is all without Christ. This kind of religion is always in opposition to Christ and to the genuine followers of Christ in life. This opposition is not revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72354" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span> or <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72355" data-verses="John 4:1">4</span>; we find it in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72356" data-verses="John 5:1">John 5</span>. In the case of the impotent man, the opposition from religion is completely exposed. This chapter unveils the inadequacy of the typical religion and its opposition to Christ. In this chapter, the main thing on the negative side that we must see is the inadequacy, the vanity, of this religion and the opposition of this religion to Christ. Praise the Lord that on the positive side this chapter shows us the adequacy, the sufficiency, of Christ, the Son of God, as life to enliven people. Christ as life is sufficient to enliven us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ArkzpradNTw3GL-xs8EsTyple4mOhZEhE3jL4qTNcdMIIImpgNveMgKcBQ6CboAjM"> This case is an allegory, and every aspect of it must be allegorized. For many years I read this chapter again and again. I did not understand it and I was very troubled. In studying the Bible, I was accustomed to finding the central point. But even after studying this chapter many times, I could not discover the central point. It was easy to find the central point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72357" data-verses="John 3:1">chapter three</span>—regeneration—and also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72358" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span>—the living water. Tell me, what is the central point of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72359" data-verses="John 5:1">chapter five</span>? I used <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72360" data-verses="John 5:24">verse 24</span> of this chapter quite often in gospel preaching, but I still did not grasp the central point of this chapter as a whole. </p>

Law-keeping was the main thing in Judaism. Every Jew respects the law and believes in keeping it. The Jews realize that, apart from keeping the law, they have no way to please God, to behave themselves, and to perfect themselves. Any typical Jew will tell you that, next to God, nothing is as great or as important as the law. God is number one and the law is <span class="pg" data-page-id="166" id="166">[166]</span> number two. So, law-keeping is everything to that typical religion. </p>

The Good Things of the Typical Religion</h2><p data-content-id="-wcKCKo7UARjQdL8tfHzvGMD9JFIhNDZrBP0U3En8T5V9E0iPj-NnoE9Ye4IDqtEN"> The Jewish religion includes at least seven items: the holy city Jerusalem, the holy temple, the holy feast, the holy Sabbath, the angels, Moses, and the Holy Scriptures. When you add these seven items together, they equal Judaism, the Jewish religion. These items are excellent and wonderful things. If you ask me what is in Judaism, I will tell you at least seven things: (1) the holy city, (2) the holy temple, (3) the feasts for enjoyment, (4) the Sabbath days of rest, (5) the visiting angels, (6) Moses, the law-giver, and (7) the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="piHiQSgOUStVtrqyqHyWTGZ9Yfx9XL-jvmOyYyXYXCi31VAdk39LRDLmD7JuKz1I5"> Along with these seven items of Judaism, there was also the means of healing, because there was the healing pool of water. The significance of this picture is that the means of healing are always with the typical religion. Judaism is the typical religion which has something that can heal you. The pool in Jerusalem signifies that the means of healing are in that typical religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="vJzJG0X_ryJcmFgag6-54AY3uDbkeoRUBxT4ZWdjQGDJUapB8oOTU0vXOvnnlXEHm"> But there is a requirement—you must have strength in order to walk and act. Whenever a chance is given for you to receive the benefits of this religion, you must have the strength to be first and the ability to walk. This case is a sign, showing us that here is a typical religion with many good and holy items which can heal you, but it requires your strength to walk and act. Even though you are second, you will not obtain the benefits of this good religion, because you are not first. </p>

The sheepgate (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72361" data-verses="John 5:2">5:2</span>) signifies the entrance to the law-keeping religion’s sheepfold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72362" data-verses="John 10:1">10:1</span>). The name of the pool, Bethesda, means house of mercy, signifying that the people who practiced law-keeping realized that they needed the mercy of God because they were impotent, weak, <span class="pg" data-page-id="167" id="167">[167]</span> and wretched, as portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72363" data-verses="Romans 7:7-24">Romans 7:7-24</span>. The porches, like a sheepfold, signify the law-keeping religion’s shelter, and the number five denotes responsibility. The angel who stirred up the water signifies the agent through which the law, which could not give life, was given (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72364" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">Gal. 3:19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72365" data-verses="Galatians 3:21">21</span>). The stirring up of the water to make people well signifies the practice of the law-keeping trying to make people perfect. By considering these aspects, we can see the situation of law-keeping, which is the major thing in the typical religion. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="ukeBrlETbXJ-IG3cb2yPtGbbNDo45cevyTWorYeIAd3f0-tCeAa1VKDztLfP8v9yK">3.

Just as people cannot walk up to the heavens, neither can they keep the law. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72366" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> says that it is impossible to keep the law, because the law is weak through the flesh. All flesh is too weak to keep the law. This is clearly portrayed in the case of the impotent man. </p>

<p data-content-id="4TUau6dLXXRywSAVK0qAqYPlFrgTjOpy_3LINqVcTISbRAG_tv46RgQoE2WRrdCmW"> The Gospel of John is a book of pictures. It speaks of the divine life and of the functions of this divine life. Both the divine life and its functions are spiritual things. Since it is very difficult to describe them in human language, the Apostle John received the wisdom from the Lord to write his gospel, not only with plain words, but also with figures. Because plain words are inadequate, John also used figures and pictures. In a sense, every case is a picture. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72426" data-verses="John 5:1">chapter five</span> we saw a vivid picture of the enlivening of the impotent man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72427" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> we have another picture showing us the need of the hungry and life’s feeding. </p>

The scene in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72433" data-verses="John 5:1">chapter five</span> is in the holy city, but the scene in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72434" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> is in the wilderness. A pool is in the scene of the previous case, and a sea is in this case. The people in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> former case are associated with the pool, and the people in the latter case are involved with the sea. The pool is related to religion’s healing, while the sea is related to the people’s living. The person in the fourth case was very weak, needing healing and enlivening, but the people in the fifth case are hungry, needing food and satisfaction. The pool is sacred, being of the Jewish religion; the sea is secular, being of the human society. The person by the pool was impotent, needed life’s enlivening, and was waiting for healing. The people in this case are hungry, need life’s feeding, and are seeking for nourishment. </p>

The sea represents Satan’s organized and systematized world where humanity is occupied and enveloped. In this world mankind is hungry and has no satisfaction. In this world mankind is troubled and has no peace. The scene in this chapter portrays all of humanity living in the world corrupted by Satan. They are not living on the land created by God. In the world corrupted by Satan there is no real satisfaction; there is always hunger. Neither is there any peace, for the wind and the waves are always on the sea making trouble for man. </p>

Moses was brought to a mountain in order to receive God’s revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72435" data-verses="Exodus 24:12">Exo. 24:12</span>). The Lord Jesus went to the top of a mountain when He was transfigured (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72436" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-2">Matt. 17:1-2</span>). The Apostle John was also brought to the transcendent position of a mountain when he saw the eternal vision concerning the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72437" data-verses="Revelation 21:10">Rev. 21:10</span>). So, in this picture the sea is on a low level, and the mountain is in a transcendent position. The sea signifies the world corrupted by Satan, and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> mountain signifies the high, transcendent position where Christ is and where we must be with Him. The Lord did not feed the people by the sea. He led the multitude to the top of a mountain. If you wish to be fed by Christ and to be satisfied with Christ, you must go with Him to a high place. Satisfaction with Christ depends upon our being led to and fed with Christ on the mountain. The mountain is above both the Satan-corrupted world and the God-created earth. Neither the sea nor the earth is a suitable place for us to feed on Christ. If we are going to feed on Him, we must be transcendent above the Satan-corrupted world and above the God-created earth. If we are to enjoy His feeding, we must be on the mountain with Him. </p>

At the Passover, people slay the redeeming lamb, strike its blood, and eat its flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72440" data-verses="Exodus 12:3-11">Exo. 12:3-11</span>). This typifies Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God who was slain that we might eat His flesh and drink His blood, thus taking Him in as the life supply for us to live by. </p>
<p data-content-id="gXvFaTgxHGUO-rzGye7Zr6b1l8PodFDz2DYGuF1ZGVlt-c2zGVtRXg1oF_kS85QlB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72441" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Genesis 2:9</span>, Christ was typified by the tree of life. The tree of life, belonging to the vegetable life, is good for producing and generating, but has no blood for redeeming. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72442" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, man was not yet involved with sin and thus had no need for redemption. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72443" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> man fell. Immediately after man’s fall, God came in to deal with that fall by slaying sacrificial lambs to redeem Adam and Eve and to make coats of skins to cover their nakedness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72444" data-verses="Genesis 3:21">Gen. 3:21</span>). Thus, the vegetable life itself is no longer adequate for fallen man; there is the need of the animal life. We need life not only for feeding, but also for redeeming. So, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72445" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> of John we firstly have the barley loaf, which belongs to the vegetable life and is good for feeding. As we shall see, since <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> man has fallen and needs redeeming as well as feeding, the Lord Jesus turned the bread into flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72446" data-verses="John 6:51">6:51b</span>). The bread is made from barley, while the flesh contains blood. Barley bread is of the vegetable life, but the flesh with the blood is of the animal life. Eventually, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72447" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> Christ is shown not only as the tree of life signified by the bread, but also as the Lamb of God signified by the flesh and blood. In the Lamb of God there are two elements: the blood for redeeming and the meat, the flesh, for feeding. At the Passover, the people struck the blood and ate the meat. It is the same with us today. We accept Christ in the way of redeeming as well as in the way of feeding. He is both the vegetable life and the animal life, the feeding life and the redeeming life. </p>

Barley Signifying Christ Resurrected</h2><p data-content-id="t85mbqhlppdvhDFBNuHtFbeRvnuiSAQMtG9rBXOBr1lposGVhLl__LaYVRkVvwPem"> Barley signifies Christ resurrected. According to the Scriptures, barley represents the firstfruit of resurrection. The Lord told His people in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72448" data-verses="Leviticus 23:1">Leviticus 23</span> to offer the firstfruits of their harvest each year. In the land of Palestine, barley ripens earlier than any other crop and is the first of the harvest. Hence, it typifies the resurrected Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72449" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10">Lev. 23:10</span>). Therefore, barley signifies the resurrected Christ, who is our life supply. As the firstfruit, He can become our bread of life. So, barley loaves represent Christ in resurrection as food to us. The feeding Christ is the resurrected Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="hXua0_pW3f46EmITj9M0SRfYjnS6MIc9iKH126QEiPABeTlJOgF_otvYI038EQlw6"> Perhaps someone will ask how Christ could have been resurrected in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72450" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> when He had not yet been crucified. Even before His crucifixion, Christ was the resurrection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72451" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span> He said, “I am the resurrection and the life.” He did not say, “I shall be the resurrection,” for He was the resurrection already. When the Lord told Martha that her brother would rise again, she, through her poor expounding of the Scriptures, postponed the resurrection for two thousand years to the coming age. When she did that, the Lord seemed to say, “I am the resurrection now. With Me, the eternal One, there is no time element. The past, present, and future are all the same to Me.” Eternal means to have no time element. Both before and after His crucifixion, He is the resurrected Christ. It is the resurrected Christ who can be life to us and can be bread to feed us. We are feeding on the resurrected Christ. </p>

Christ walked on top of all the waves. It seemed that the more waves there were, the more He enjoyed walking upon them. The waves terrified His disciples, but He trod upon them. He seemed to say, “Demons, please cause bigger waves. Then I will have more enjoyment. I can walk on top of your waves.” This is the peace-giving Christ. </p>

If you receive Him into your family, your family will be at peace. If you accept Him into your job, your job will be peaceful. Without Christ, the world is hungry.

<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="zBGhA3590E7XPL6idPf_E9OBnKECgCDATp-tFcRb9BVVdo8R8xctsKXmFfAC4TlQd">1. Coming to Man by Being Incarnated<br/>to Give Life to Man</h2><p data-content-id="a9NrvhD6wW1hRS7-hmQmrBF1fb7DU8q1AZlxJz81s5YFPu5MILIeqJhyavV3tDNAj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72477" data-verses="John 6:35-51">Verses 35 through 51</span> reveal that the Lord has come to man by being incarnated that He might give life to man. By what way can we take the Lord as food, as the bread of life? This chapter reveals the way figuratively, but for many generations people have overlooked it. First of all, the Lord said that He “came down from heaven” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72478" data-verses="John 6:33">6:33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72479" data-verses="John 6:38">38</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72480" data-verses="John 6:41">41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72481" data-verses="John 6:42">42</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72482" data-verses="John 6:50">50</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72483" data-verses="John 6:51">51</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72484" data-verses="John 6:58">58</span>). By what way did He come down from heaven? He came down by incarnation. He became a man by partaking of flesh and blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72485" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). He came in the flesh and He came as a man. The devil and the evil spirits hate this. The only way to test whether or not a person has an evil spirit is to ask the demon or spirit if he would confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72486" data-verses="1John 4:2">1 John 4:2</span>). Incarnation is the first step that the Lord took in order to become our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="btOmTWeLFFpscfgnNxcK6B4bahrI2rT3IwVxeSAiE7B_1vo4eGvaKTJstwR_ZClRW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72487" data-verses="John 6:35">Verse 35</span> says, “Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst.” The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food, like the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72488" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>), which is also the life supply “good for food.” He who comes to the Lord shall never hunger, and he who believes in Him shall never thirst. In the principle set forth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72489" data-verses="John 2:1">chapter two</span>, this also is the changing of death into life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="194" id="194">[194]</span> Death is of the source of the tree of knowledge, and life is of the source of the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="qVbKRqoOAGu3MGxnQ2qfE4hOYKQQJ683fkFd9Unt-pau-YfKbohX26ar8pj6Ztet-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72490" data-verses="John 6:46">Verse 46</span> says, “Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father.” The Greek preposition translated “from” means “by the side of.” The sense here is “from with.” The Lord is not only from God, but also with God. While He is from God, He is still with God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72491" data-verses="John 8:16">8:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72492" data-verses="John 8:29">29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72493" data-verses="John 16:32">16:32</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ycRAO1PQyck3vYSrUA66tWgApQRQUIW1z8hRVBub6MifAsRtiq85jQsSkWApHYCbK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72494" data-verses="John 6:47">verse 47</span> the Lord says, “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.” To believe into the Lord is not the same as to believe Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72495" data-verses="John 6:30">v. 30</span>). To believe Him means to believe that He is true and real, but to believe into Him means to receive Him and be united with Him as one. The eternal life mentioned in this verse is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which is not only everlasting as far as time is concerned, but is eternal and divine in nature. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="8DJXQ5Z5MNoL38Tw7qR3ltSGTNIKyqqegEmV6n4XFlp5EG2WvIw21JD6sbOEnoo2p">2.

He died for us, not in an ordinary way, but in a very extraordinary way. He was slain by being crucified on the cross. This death separated His blood from His flesh. If you were a Jew living during that time, you would have been very familiar with this. I once read an article describing how the Jews slew the lamb during the Passover. The article said that the Jews put the lamb on a cross. Of course, we all know that the Roman Empire used the death penalty of the cross to crucify criminals, but the Jews used this method long before the Roman Empire to slay the lamb at their Passover. They took two wooden bars and formed a cross. They tied two legs at the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the crossbar. Then they slew the lamb so that all its blood was shed. They needed all of its blood to sprinkle on their door frames; therefore, the blood was completely separated from its flesh. </p>

<p data-content-id="9S6bAz339mYziRGei94HkxyxJB4XTlUEwBDRLoFRB3ON6PAI2cNs0NusS0QT3DlqC"> We have covered five of the nine cases in this gospel. In the first case, the Lord talked with a superior, moral man about the regeneration of life. Through the new birth, the Lord is our second life, the divine life. In the second case, the Lord spoke to an inferior, immoral woman about the satisfaction of life. The Lord Himself is the living water which satisfies the dissatisfied hearts. In the third case, the Lord healed a dying child. The Lord heals the dying people by His life-giving word through believing. In the fourth case, the Lord enlivened an impotent man who had been sick for thirty-eight years. This shows that the Lord enlivens the impotent by life. In the fifth case, the Lord fed the five thousand with the bread of life. This indicates that He is the living, heavenly bread with which to satisfy the hungry multitude. Therefore, in brief, the Lord regenerates with His divine life in the first case, gives the living water in the second case, heals the dying by the life-giving word in the third case, enlivens the impotent in the fourth case, and feeds the multitude with the bread of life in the fifth case. </p>
<p data-content-id="jynNWp5yBJT7WjSB52O3IR5AJZ6z_-jTV1Xn0ETcxUCUGJkuR0mN5gJVD82YVb2pv"> Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72549" data-verses="John 7:1">chapter seven</span> we come to the sixth case—the need of the thirsty. This case is in contrast with the fifth case, the need of the hungry. In the previous case the Lord is clearly revealed as the bread of life to satisfy our hunger, but in this case the Lord brings the flow of living water to quench our thirst. In the fifth case the people are hungry, but in the sixth case they are thirsty. The fifth case presents the living bread, and the sixth case introduces the living water. The bread of <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> life is for hungry people, and the rivers of living water are for thirsty people. For the thirsty, Christ is the quenching life. He is the very life that is able to quench man’s thirst. </p>
<p data-content-id="TwQlMH4WYSvmZBpvVG3ASYO6we6-xicmxEL3iHsGvInd9AHz0HO8m2UzNBdzAcSKQ"> The thought that the Lord is our food and water is seen throughout the Scriptures. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72550" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> the tree of life is a picture of the Lord as our life supply of food. Beside the tree of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72551" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> there is the river of water, which is a portrait of the Lord bringing us the rivers of living water. In other words, this pictures the Lord’s purpose in the creation of man—man must eat and drink. If he fails to eat, he will become hungry, and if he fails to drink, he will become thirsty. The Lord is the food to satisfy our hunger, and He has the living water to quench our thirst. </p>
<p data-content-id="n8WSh8WU2BdpsjVRCC9TErp5SG8QBnYwKIXlL0q3eeAFANq7Mk2tNf7lfC_nB1Vr0"> Later in the Scriptures, the children of Israel, as they traveled through the wilderness, also had both food and water. On the one hand, they had the manna from heaven as their daily food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72552" data-verses="Exodus 16:14-15">Exo. 16:14-15</span>); on the other hand, they had the living water flowing from the smitten rock to quench their thirst (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72553" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">Exo. 17:6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="65XEpihaZD6ISNAVL7KJ5i1YFIvvJdVmQZ8Nms4k0sV2bawyzQ5gp4-b5hMWcG5LI"> In the Gospel of John, the Lord also is the living bread and He offers the living water to satisfy the hunger and the thirst of the multitude. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three Persons of the Triune God, are very much related to this matter of food and water. God the Father is the source, God the Son is the food, and God the Spirit is the drink. The first Person of the Triune God is the source of the second Person as the food, from whom the third Person flows out as the drink. </p>
<p data-content-id="5w-j5wr_UufC5LfaFyrLY0gNbg8EjHeZRqKuWbOgeqQ6qwIVYLcWYffP9g4uA2B9B"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72554" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:3-4">First Corinthians 10:3-4</span> also points out these two things. There, Christ Himself is the spiritual food and He is the smitten rock from which flows the spiritual drink. The Holy Spirit is the spiritual drink flowing out of the crucified Christ. Therefore, Christ is our food, and the Holy Spirit who flows out of Christ is our drink. </p>
<p data-content-id="N4fmiTCMCnn3CkIWUMWYtwfDgyhJ12fvZLXKozkGfvmkz7BV-BxJS1lJhf9hBkG1i"> Finally, we come to the end of the Scriptures, where we see the New Jerusalem. Again, the flow of the living water is the Holy Spirit, and the tree of life growing in the flow is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72555" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Rev. 22:1-2</span>). Hence, there is a line running <span class="pg" data-page-id="207" id="207">[207]</span> throughout the whole Scriptures showing us that Christ is our spiritual food, that the Holy Spirit is our spiritual drink, and that man needs both to eat and to drink in order to satisfy his hunger and thirst. </p>
<p data-content-id="t85mbqhlppdvhDFBNuntGb-RvnuiSAQMtG9rBXOBr1lposGVhLl__LaYVRkVvwPem"> The Gospel of John is a book of pictures. The writer used figures and pictures as well as plain words because the matters of life are too deep, profound, mysterious, and abstract. If John had only used plain words, it would have been difficult for people to probe into the riches. So John, under God’s inspiration, used various pictures. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72556" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span> we have a picture of a thirsty Savior and a thirsty sinner meeting at Jacob’s well. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72557" data-verses="John 5:1">chapter five</span> we see a multitude of sick, blind, lame, and withered people waiting by a pool. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72558" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> we see a wilderness, a mountain, and a stormy sea. On the sea is a boat, tossed to and fro, and the people in the boat are terrified. Suddenly a man comes to them walking upon the waves. This is the man who fed the hungry crowd with five loaves and two fishes. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72559" data-verses="John 7:1">chapter seven</span> we see still another picture. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hXua0_pW3f46EmITj9s0RR_YjnS6MIc9iKH126QEiPABeTlJOgF_otvYI038EQlw6">I. THE SCENE OF THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Uj2hgxuYFe-UC_238sto7wgrEPXe5jTUAOGzaPqIwSAQiBsHQoHWtKOYJParAMEVp">A. In Contrast with the Scene<br/>of the Feast of the Passover in Chapter Six</h2>
<p data-content-id="MWwn5_pxNxpNcbAweYKk3kQ76ebi5X3DU0CvvMTPWuJQBSUmbGja3mdoHOKC8EYbl"> The sixth case is a continuation of the fifth case, because the matter of food is related to water. In this connection, there is also another contrast. In the scene of the fifth case, there was the feast of the Passover. In the scene of this case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72560" data-verses="John 7:1">chapter seven</span>, there is the feast of Tabernacles. The feast of the Passover is the first of the annual Jewish feasts, and the feast of Tabernacles is the last (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72561" data-verses="Leviticus 23:5">Lev. 23:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72562" data-verses="Leviticus 23:34">34</span>). The feast of the Passover, as the first feast of the year, implies the beginning of man’s life (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72563" data-verses="Exodus 12:2-3">Exo. 12:2-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72564" data-verses="Exodus 12:6">6</span>), which involves man’s seeking for satisfaction and results in man’s hunger. The feast of Tabernacles, as the last feast of the year, implies the completion and success of man’s life (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72565" data-verses="Exodus 23:16">Exo. 23:16</span>), which will end and result in man’s thirst. In the scene of the feast of the Passover, the Lord presented Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man’s hunger. In the scene of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="208" id="208">[208]</span> feast of Tabernacles, the Lord promised that He would flow forth the living water, which quenches man’s thirst. </p>
<p data-content-id="VMLFt4z73i1A5nc8_a5UduHj8npBxae0I9fekDagnkfCayaI0rHPQg8monXBIOTyM"> The feast of the Passover occurred early in the year, when the people were working and laboring hard. The case of the feeding of the five thousand finds the people working to fill their hunger, but failing to be satisfied. They labored, they worked, they sought something to satisfy, but they failed. The feast of Tabernacles, on the contrary, occurred at a time when the harvest was over. The people had reaped the corn and the wine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72566" data-verses="Deuteronomy 16:13-14">Deut. 16:13-14</span>). Everything of the harvest had been reaped, and the people were to come together at the feast of Tabernacles and enjoy everything with their families and even with their servants. We must realize that during the feast of Tabernacles the people do not labor because the work is over, the crop has been reaped, and the corn and wine have been harvested. That was the time to rejoice in their enjoyment—but they were still thirsty! The sixth case reveals that their thirst was not quenched even by their success. </p>
<p data-content-id="idWE0reFGaAWAlr_lbxPl62CTiqbcPOP0DvCKdvLJMaSDuuVJK3S-muAf0I_c0Lu5"> If you read the verses concerning the Passover in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72567" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>, you will see that the Passover indicates or implies the beginning of life. The Passover, of course, is for salvation. When we were saved, we had a new start. The Passover was always in the first month of the year. Hence, it marked a new beginning. In a sense, all of the young people are in the Passover, for their life has just begun and they have many high expectations. Although perhaps you have not yet graduated from college, you expect that after graduation you will be a professor, doctor, or attorney. This is the feast of the Passover. We have already seen that the feast of the Passover always ends in hunger. After your graduation there will be nothing but hunger. The higher position you attain in your profession, the more hunger you feel. The more money you earn, the more dissatisfied you will be. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72568" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span>, the feast of the Passover, as the initial step in life, ends in hunger. </p>

This is an accurate picture of today’s religion, for religion, in principle, is the same today. On the one hand, the religionists worship God, while on the other hand, they plot to kill God’s real seekers. If you are a true seeker after life, you must be prepared to find that religion will attempt to kill you. This has happened from the first century down to the present time. In every century the real seekers after life have been persecuted by the religionists. Madame Guyon, for example, was imprisoned by the religionists of her day. As long as you go along with the Lord according to the inner life and not according to the outward things, you will be persecuted by the religious people. </p>

However, as a man He suffered the persecution of His creatures (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72586" data-verses="John 7:1">7:1</span>). It was not an easy thing for the Creator to suffer the persecution from His creatures. What patience He must have had! What humiliation it must have been! But the Lord did it. Even the religious feast provided an opportunity for this persecution (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72587" data-verses="John 7:2">7:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72588" data-verses="John 7:11">11</span>).

Since the Jewish religionists were plotting against the Lord Jesus, He had to be somewhat careful. If He had been even a little careless, He would have fallen into their hands. He was not able to act freely. Although the Lord is the Almighty God, He, as a man under persecution, was limited in His activity. While the religionists were seeking to kill Him on the one hand, His unbelieving brothers were challenging Him to seek worldly glory on the other hand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72595" data-verses="John 7:3-4">7:3-4</span>). His brothers seemed to say to Him, “Why don’t you go to Jerusalem? You should make a big name for yourself.” Both the persecution of the Jews and the challenge from His brothers came from one enemy, Satan. Satan stirred up the Jews to seek to kill the Lord and he stirred up His unbelieving brothers to challenge Him to go to Jerusalem and to make a name for Himself that He might receive glory. The situation is the same today. Occasionally some brothers propose that we do certain things to get a name and be publicized. But it is awful to be publicized and to have a name. If you are going to have a name, it is better to get a bad name. </p>

The Lord was willing to lose His freedom, to be bound in the matter of time, and to do the will of the Father so that He could minister the living water of life to us. The whole of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72599" data-verses="John 7:1">chapter seven</span> reveals how the Lord acted as a man limited in every respect. </p>

He would not act freely. Although the Lord is the omniscient <span class="pg" data-page-id="215" id="215">[215]</span> God, He, as a lowly man, appeared to be illiterate. “The Jews then marveled and said, How does this man know letters, having never learned?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72602" data-verses="John 7:15">7:15</span>). Although the Lord had little education, He knew everything. He not only knew the letters; He knew the minds, hearts, and spirits of men.

For quite a while I was not happy with the Lord concerning what I felt was His lack of frankness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72610" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span>. It seemed to me that He was somewhat sneaky. He told people that His source was God the Father, but He came from Nazareth. There is a vital principle here: with everything concerning the Lord, the outward appearance will never look good, but the inward content will be marvelous. This also is true of the Lord’s recovery today. If you look at the recovery according to the outward appearance, it does not look very attractive. However, the situation is entirely different inside. Do not be troubled by the outward appearance. The people who looked at Jesus outwardly saw Him as just a Nazarene. He had no form, comeliness, beauty, or attraction. But within, He is the very God. At times I told the Lord, “Lord, why are so few of the people whom You have brought into Your recovery in this country good looking? Even some do not dress appropriately for the meetings.” But I have come to see that there is a treasure in those earthen vessels. The Lord has told me not to care for the outward appearance. The Nazarene has an unattractive appearance but an excellent and heavenly content. </p>

The last day signifies the ending of all the enjoyment of any success in human life. Regardless of the kind of success you have, there will be a last day. For instance, although you may have a marvelous marriage, your marriage will not last forever. </p>

However, these are two different kinds of last days. The last day in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72615" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> is the ultimate last day in the remote future when the Lord will raise us up. The last day in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72616" data-verses="John 7:1">chapter seven</span> refers to the many last days during our human life. The greatest last day is in the future, but before that day, during our human life, there are many last days. There will be a last day for an article of clothing that you value; there will be a last day for your marriage. Everything has its last day. The feast of Tabernacles continued for seven days, but the seventh day was the last day of the feast. The last simply means an end. Regardless of how wealthy you are, there is an end. Regardless of how healthy you are, there is an end. There is a last day for your riches, a last day to your health, a last day with your family, a last day with your dear wife or husband, a last day with your parents, a last day with your children, a last day with all of your circumstances—in short, a last day! </p>

When you were born, life began at dawn. At forty, life has reached the noon hour. After forty, life is in the afternoon. Probably sometime after sixty, life will be ended.” Sooner or later, there will come the last day of life. </p>

The first six cases, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72663" data-verses="John 3:1">chapters three through seven</span>, form one group of signs, signifying, on the positive side, the aspects of the Lord as our life and life supply: the regenerating, the satisfying, the healing, the enlivening, the feeding, and the quenching. The last three cases, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72664" data-verses="John 8:1">chapters eight through eleven</span>, form another group of signs, signifying, on the negative side, that the Lord is life to us to deliver us from the three main negative things: sin, blindness, and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdMBmskAexpdwW2wy2iDiXkynDv29Co6M5pbGhMnLA0lgGhFaxHSuJlcbe7THuX3M"> As fallen human beings, we are constantly troubled by sin, blindness, and death. Blindness actually means darkness. When you are blind, you are in darkness, for nothing causes so much darkness as blindness. Blindness, darkness, and death come from sin. Sin is the basic factor of blindness, darkness, and death. If we are sinful, we are surely blind because blindness always accompanies the sinful things. Sin brings in death, but between sin and death there is always blindness. After you have sinned and before you reap death, you have darkness. Therefore, sin, blindness, and death are the three negative things that the Lord must deal with. The only way these negatives can be dealt with is by the Lord becoming our eternal and heavenly life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> </p>

No chapter in the entire Bible covers the problem of sin as widely and thoroughly as does the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72666" data-verses="John 8:1">eighth chapter of John</span>. In this chapter we have the answer to all the problems of sin. As we shall see, following this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72667" data-verses="John 9:1">chapters nine</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72668" data-verses="John 10:1">ten</span>, the matter of blindness is dealt with in a thorough way. Lastly, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72669" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, the matter of death is thoroughly taken care of. After <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72670" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, there will be no additional cases because the positive cases have been covered and the negative things have been dealt with.

THE RELIGION OF LAW VERSUS<br/>THE GREAT I AM</h2><p data-content-id="Xzji_1UPvRreQsGawuxGDfXah9uQPwAkM0FbIvQrU7oMHeCL0a9Zt9q1Aoejnd4aw"> This case reveals that the religion of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72671" data-verses="John 8:5">8:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72672" data-verses="John 8:17">17</span>), as represented by the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72673" data-verses="John 8:2">8:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72674" data-verses="John 8:20">20</span>), cannot set people free from sin and its death, but that the Lord Jesus as the I Am, becoming the Son of Man lifted up on the cross for the serpent-poisoned people, can do what religion and law cannot do. The religion of law-keeping is versus the great I Am. This chapter reveals that among human beings on earth there are two things—a religion and a living Person. This religion is excellent, high, and superior. It is not a heathen religion or a religion of superstition. It is the typical religion, which helps people to worship God, to know God in the outward way of letters, and to assist people to keep the law of God in order to please God and to perfect themselves. This religion is the best, and all the typical Jews are proud of it. If you consider the orthodox religion of the Jews, you will realize that it is the highest religion. It is not false; it is absolutely real and genuine. Everything related to this religion is the best. This religion has many holy things. Among these many holy things is the Holy Word of God. No one can deny this. </p>
<p data-content-id="10MJntexVw9mtYnMzaLgxjjXBkYBi4_k9Sj8fkt-_KQkx6FVLKr6wXK38c_eWnUfc"> The Jewish religion is the only real religion. Islam is a counterfeit of Judaism, and the Koran, the Moslem Bible, is the counterfeit of the Old Testament and part of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="227" id="227">[227]</span> New Testament. Mohammed did not compose anything new. He simply copied the Old Testament and parts of the New Testament. Thus, Islam is a counterfeit religion. Besides Judaism and Islam, there are no other religions. Buddhism is not a typical religion; it is nonsense. Religion helps people to worship God by teaching them in the proper way. However, in Buddhism there is no God. In Buddhism everyone can become a Buddha. According to Buddhism, if you practice until you attain a certain degree of perfection, you can become a Buddha. This is absolute nonsense; it contains no proper teaching whatsoever. Hence, it should not be considered as a proper religion. What about the teachings of Confucius? They are not a religion; they are ethical teachings. The teachings of Confucius tell people how to behave, but they do not tell them how to worship God. Never consider the teaching of Confucius as a religion. Therefore, there is on earth only one typical, genuine, and true religion, the religion formed by the Jews according to the Holy Word. Christianity, including Catholicism, is an outgrowth of Judaism. Thus, there is only one typical religion on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="9S6bAz339mYziRGei-YHgjCxJB4XTlUEwBDRLoFRB3ON6PAI2cNs0NusS0QT3DlqC"> There is only one Bible. We have already pointed out that the Koran is a satanic counterfeit of the Holy Word. No one can invent something like the Bible. Who could write another Bible? Could Plato or Confucius? No one can write another Bible because there is only one God, and only God can write such a wonderful book. Since God would never write another Bible, there will never be another one. No one can write it. Whoever is able to write such a book as the Bible is qualified to be God. Who can imitate such a book? Who can imitate the depths of its wisdom? If you can do it, you must be God. Do you believe that the Gospel of John was merely written by a fisherman of Galilee? Do you believe that John himself could write such a book? “In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God,” “I am the light of the world,” “I am the bread of life,” “I can give you living water”—only Jesus can say such things. Only Jesus can write such a book as the Gospel of John. </p>
<p data-content-id="jynNWp5yBJT7WjSB51u3PD5AJZ6z_-jTV1Xn0ETcxUCUGJkuR0mN5gJVD82YVb2pv"> However, God’s elect, His chosen people, had the wrong <span class="pg" data-page-id="228" id="228">[228]</span> concept. They did not pay full attention to the focus: that God Himself in the Son and as the Spirit wants to come into man to be his life and his everything. God’s people missed this mark, collecting all the regulations, laws, and other good points, and putting them together to make a religion with which to kill themselves. How pitiful! Thus, by the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72675" data-verses="John 8:1">John 8</span>, there were two things on earth: a religion and a living Person. We all must see this contrast. </p>
<p data-content-id="TwQlMH4WYSvmZBpvVFXAUKe6we6-xicmxEL3iHsGvInd9AHz0HO8m2UzNBdzAcSKQ"> The Jewish religion was genuine and wonderful. It was good in every respect except one—it was versus the great I Am. Religion may be good, but it cannot give you life. It cannot help you because you are dead. A dead person does not need something good; he needs something of life. Only life can help a dead man. Suppose you say to a dead person, “Poor man, here are gold and diamonds. You shouldn’t be dead. Look at the gold—how valuable! Look at the diamonds—how precious!” It would be foolish to speak to a dead man in such a way. He could hear nothing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72676" data-verses="John 5:1">chapter five</span> we saw the porches near the pool on which were the blind, the lame, and the withered. If you were to preach to such people they would say, “Don’t waste your time. I don’t need something good. I need life.” </p>
<p data-content-id="n8WSh8WU2BdpsjVRCBdTN4J5SG8QBnYwKIXlL0q3eeAFANq7Mk2tNf7lfC_nB1Vr0"> Who is the Lord Jesus? He is the very Jehovah, the I Am. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72677" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, God’s name in relation to His creation is Elohim, God. After creation, however, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72678" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, when God was attempting to form a relationship with man, God’s other name was mentioned—Jehovah, I Am that I Am. Jehovah is God’s name in His relationship with mankind. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72679" data-verses="John 8:1">John 8</span>, Jehovah stood there in the form of a little man by the name of Jesus, which means Jehovah the Savior. Again I say that you must learn the lesson not to care for the outward appearance. If you merely care for the outward appearance, you will certainly miss the mark. The Jewish religionists of the day missed the mark because they despised that little Jesus. Jesus had no form, comeliness, beauty, or attraction. Nevertheless, He was the great I Am. </p>

This light is not outside of us; it is in us. When we received the Lord, He entered into us as our life. This indwelling life now shines within us. That is light. Gradually and spontaneously, this shining of the indwelling life sets us free. To be set free from the bondage of sin is not an overnight matter; it takes time.

<p data-content-id="0qg4Xe6SXa0i7DIiqQfBgrh0kmjnUFXxSvp-5BeODfOoXLrE4iTl60302dFOLF8PT"> We may use our temper as an illustration. Everyone has a temper. If you do not have a temper, you are not a human being. A table has no temper. Regardless of how much you pound on a table, it will never lose its temper because it has no temper to lose. But how about you? Every person has a certain amount of temper, and this temper is the first expression of our serpentine nature. The primary expression of Satan in us is our temper. Whenever a person loses his temper, he has the appearance of a serpent. No one looks like an angel when he loses his temper. When you lose your temper at your wife, you look like a demon. When a kind mother loses her temper toward her child, the child will be frightened because his mother looks like a demon. When we lose our temper, the serpentine nature is expressed. Our temper bothers us very much; it besets us all the time. <span class="pg" data-page-id="238" id="238">[238]</span> During the fifty years that I have been a seeking Christian, nothing has bothered me more than my temper. How difficult it is to be freed from our temper! From my experience I can testify that since the day the Lord Jesus came into me He has been my life. This life has been shining within me continually. The more Jesus shines within me, the more I am set free from my temper. Sometimes when I was losing my temper, this light shone strongly. Have you not experienced this as well? While you are losing your temper at your wife, the light shines. The more unbelievers lose their temper, the more temper they have to lose. However, when we, the seeking Christians, begin to lose our temper, we find that we have less and less temper to lose. Sometimes a brother or sister is stopped by the inward shining while he is losing his temper. Something inward shines over him, killing the serpentine nature. After fifty years of experience, I can say that now it is difficult for me to lose my temper. For fifty years the heavenly radium has been killing the serpentine nature of temper. </p>

Since the Lord is the embodiment of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72719" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>), He is the reality of what God is.

This reality, which is the divine element imparted into us and realized by us, sets us free from the <span class="pg" data-page-id="239" id="239">[239]</span> bondage of sin by the divine life as the light of man. The Son of God as the very fullness of the Godhead is the reality. While He shines in us as life, He works His reality, His divine element, into our being. This is not merely shining; it is a shining that brings the reality of what God is into our being. Eventually, day after day, and year after year, this divine element will be accumulated in our being. Thus, within our being there will be a certain amount of divine reality.

This positive element will supply nourishment to the tissues of my body. Eventually, the disease will be swallowed up. By such a metabolic process, the old element is discharged and replaced by a new element. This is the way that the divine life sets us free from the bondage of sin. It is not a matter of reckoning yourself dead according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72720" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span>. Many of us have tried this in the past and found that it does not work. No, you must experience the living Jesus in you as the shining light and as the divine element that works inwardly. Eventually, the heavenly, divine element will be added into your being. This is our salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="dVGN5WXLxIx0FItFTYquQe9hDedsgBGx6cSHcgladGc5IaMSTaHitKZaPlyR-YeoS"> How can the Lord keep us from sinning anymore? How can He set us free from the slavery and bondage of sin? Simply because the great I Am has become our life, and this life is the light of life. When we received Him, He became our <span class="pg" data-page-id="240" id="240">[240]</span> life, and this life becomes the very light that brings us out of the darkness of sin. Only the light of life can set us free from the bondage and slavery of sin. The Lord could forgive us because He is the Son of Man who died for us by being lifted up on the cross. Now the Lord can deliver us and set us free from the bondage of sin because He is the great I Am living within us. He now becomes the life that is the light within us. This light of life can set us free from the bondage of sin and deliver us out of the darkness of sin. We must realize, therefore, that we are set free only by Christ becoming our life and light. Furthermore, this life and light will also bring us into the truth, that is, into the reality. After you receive and enjoy the Lord Jesus as your life and light, you will find that this very divine life and light will bring you into reality. After you are brought into reality, you will be delivered from falsehood. The reason why people easily commit sin is that they were born in falsehood. Since they were born of the devil, the enemy of God, they were all born liars. The devil, the father of liars, is the greatest liar. Hence, the father of liars has brought all sinners into the darkness of falsehood. The devilish life has brought them into darkness, and darkness has brought them into falsehood. Thus, it is very easy for people to commit sin as long as they are in falsehood. But, praise the Lord, we now have received the Lord within us as our life and light. This life and light bring us into reality, which will free us from the bondage and slavery of sin. </p>

<p data-content-id="QdS_HMSS3SdGPRtEG5FRUWLsrSqMQHxUS3POjiiKGElbtbOCx1j7HNi8K4jPqe1Qb"> As we have mentioned before, the nine cases in the Gospel of John are divided into two groups. The first six cases signify how the Lord as our life can deal with positive things, while the last three cases signify how the Lord as our life can deal with negative things. Let us review them once more. The first six cases reveal that the Lord as life is for regenerating, satisfying, healing, enlivening, feeding, and quenching. These six signs compose one group because they deal with the positive aspects of His life. The last three cases deal with the negative matters of sin, blindness, and death. Sin causes blindness and results in death. Therefore, these three—sin, blindness, and death—are grouped together showing how the Lord is our life in dealing with the negative things. In the first six cases the Lord brings us <em>to</em> something positive, but in the last three cases the Lord delivers us <em>from</em> something negative because He delivers us from sin, blindness, and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="KH2K8ov9UbVLXhVOgtjrc4ZzrungwARtcHESrqPTSQ7WAQf4Mh3jfx5zndjYHF_CI"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72746" data-verses="John 20:30-31">20:30-31</span>, the writer indicated that Jesus did many signs. From all of these cases, the writer selected only nine as signs. Therefore, these signs must be very meaningful, and the order in which they are presented must also be quite significant. For example, the first case is about regeneration, and the last is about the resurrection from the dead. Thus, the first case is about the regeneration in the beginning of life, and the last is about resurrection after the end of life. Furthermore, in the last group of cases, sin is placed first among the negative things because sin is the origin of blindness and death. Blindness originates from sin, and death is <span class="pg" data-page-id="246" id="246">[246]</span> the ultimate end of sin. In this message we shall deal with the matter of blindness. </p>
<p data-content-id="lpmcG2OSgx4b8KfNeNtdL5OlNHSx6i6bvSlo1-scnq60V3T2e_f37EFbGHcUWveMa"> Some readers of the Bible are not clear that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72747" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> is a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72748" data-verses="John 9:1">John 9</span>. However, if you read carefully, you will see that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72749" data-verses="John 10:1">chapter ten</span> is a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72750" data-verses="John 9:1">chapter nine</span>. Hence, these two chapters form one section of the Holy Word. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72751" data-verses="John 10:21">John 10:21</span> helps us to realize that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72752" data-verses="John 10:1">chapter ten</span> is a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72753" data-verses="John 9:1">chapter nine</span>, for the question is asked, “Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” Nevertheless, each chapter covers a different point. In these two chapters, two major aspects of the Lord’s being are revealed: the Lord’s giving sight to the blind and the Lord’s shepherding of the believers outside of religion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OmAqQ18Wpl0cohVFmjonRhh7NlRn8E3s18gEOw62GPpG9u6ni9v0XbHYnRZDBjgL3">I. LIFE’S SIGHT FOR THE BLIND</h2><p data-content-id="4TUau6dLXXRywSAVJ1qAmYPlFrgTjOpy_3LINqVcTISbRAG_tv46RgQoE2WRrdCmW"> This case continues to prove that the religion of law could not do any good to a blind man, but that the Lord Jesus, as the light of the world, could impart sight to him in the way of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72754" data-verses="John 10:10">10:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72755" data-verses="John 10:28">28</span>). This sign was performed on the Sabbath day. It seems that the Lord again did a sign purposely on the Sabbath day to expose the vanity of the rituals of religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="wdYDXrVTBi16uQIJFdAKB8fFAbXHIhsQrac_ssNkW8MNVZd8_yYP9-uGMvsFev98q"> Blindness, as sin in the previous chapter, is a matter of death. A dead person surely is blind. “...the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving.” So they need “the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ” to shine forth to them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72756" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4">2 Cor. 4:4</span>), “to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72757" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>). In the principle set forth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72758" data-verses="John 2:1">chapter two</span>, this is also the changing of death into life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="L2ANrEyjfbJ7B2dFT1-ohfGOFniVzGXaJCUsnvi40kXchfitT6kS-85r480rXaxQ_">A. Born Blind</h2><p data-content-id="mplh2Ii9SxX3L81TD4guNE9vxczWHaVmNU91nzbGcnLT3uA9GiS-fWkrhi4wJZm5Z"> Let us read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72759" data-verses="John 9:1-3">9:1-3</span>. “And as He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind? Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him.” The question raised by the disciples was according to their religious knowledge. They thought that the blindness must have been due to the man’s sin or the sin of his parents. <span class="pg" data-page-id="247" id="247">[247]</span> This question, like those in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72760" data-verses="John 4:20-25">4:20-25</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72761" data-verses="John 8:3-5">8:3-5</span>, is a matter of yes or no, which belongs to the tree of knowledge resulting in death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72762" data-verses="Genesis 2:17">Gen. 2:17</span>), but the Lord’s answer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72763" data-verses="John 9:3">9:3</span> points them to God, who is the tree of life resulting in life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72764" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>). We have seen that the Lord in the Gospel of John never answers such questions with an answer of yes or no, right or wrong. This is because the Gospel of John is a book of life, not a book of the knowledge of good and evil. Therefore, the Lord said that the man’s blindness was so that “the works of God might be manifested in him.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Zo9dN5yT4RaGVzmhcQujRbbwO4N0OSuZjtDQf5M2EBBxv1xMr6YswtQOIRp7t2MTg"> Why is it that the Lord never answers with a yes or a no? Because yes-or-no answers are from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Good and evil are just like yes and no. While both yes and no belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, in this gospel the Lord comes to us as the tree of life. The tree of life is God as our life. Consequently, in this gospel the Lord never answers people with a yes or a no. He always refers them to God. The Lord does not refer to yes or no for an answer, but to God as the tree of life. The Lord’s answer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72765" data-verses="John 9:3">9:3</span> brought His disciples directly to God, that is, it brought them to the tree of life. At this point, the disciples were still very religious, holding to their religious concepts, which belong to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but the Lord was trying again and again to turn them from the tree of knowledge to the tree of life. Those disciples were under the Lord’s training in this matter for three and a half years. Even after that time, one of the disciples, Peter, had not thoroughly been delivered from the religious concepts, for in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72766" data-verses="Acts 10:9-16">Acts 10:9-16</span> we see that Peter was still religious, still influenced by the knowledge of good and evil. Perhaps we consider ourselves as free from the tree of knowledge, but even now we may still be mainly under its influence. </p>
<p data-content-id="ArkzpradNTw3GL-xv9UsTzple4mOhZEhE3jL4qTNcdMIIImpgNveMgKcBQ6CboAjM"> When we were sinners, we lost our sight and could not see anything. Our blindness was due to our sinful nature. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72767" data-verses="John 9:1">chapter nine</span> the man was born blind, signifying that blindness is in the nature of a person when he is born. We sinners were blind by nature because we were born that way. Have you ever realized that every sinner was born blind? <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> Therefore, if we confess that we are sinful, we must also admit that we are blind. </p>

<p data-content-id="P_4KtsGyNhSbk86m5nIb-5XDwZ4sTm7hLI0PKhfCaFxOEgwCSzcqA_f6HNvLOq6uZ"> When the Lord Jesus saw this blind man, He said, “While I am in the world, I am the light of the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72768" data-verses="John 9:5">9:5</span>). The Lord is the light of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72769" data-verses="John 8:12">8:12</span>). Blindness comes from the shortage of the light of life. Every dead person is a blind man. Undoubtedly, the dead cannot see anything. Therefore, blindness indicates the lack of life. If you have life, then you have sight, for light opens your eyes. So, first of all, the Lord pointed out that the blind man needed the light of life. </p>

What He did was very strange. No one likes to touch a person’s spittle. But the Lord Jesus mixed His spittle with the ground and made clay. Then He used the clay to anoint the man’s eyes. The Gospel of John is a book of pictures, and this incident is a picture. We should not understand it merely according to the black and white letters. We must pray and look to the Lord that we may receive the true meaning. </p>

This is a very interesting chapter, but it is also a misunderstood chapter. This chapter is actually a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72795" data-verses="John 9:1">chapter nine</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72796" data-verses="John 10:21">Verse 21</span> helps us to realize this, for the question is asked, “Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” Both chapters center around the record of the case of the man born blind. The thought in this chapter is deep. On the surface, it seems easy to understand, but actually it is not easy to understand this parable or allegory. The Lord brought out this allegory about the sheepfold immediately after He cured the blind man who was cast out of the synagogue by the Jews. This incident, therefore, became the setting for the parable of the sheepfold. </p>

<p data-content-id="gXvFaTgxHGUO-rzGxfLZipb1l8PodFDz2DYGuF1ZGVlt-c2zGVtRXg1oF_kS85QlB"> We must now consider the significance of the sheepfold in this parable. It is not easy to define the sheepfold. Perhaps you know something about the Bible and especially about the gospels. Perhaps you were told from your youth about the stories from the gospels in Sunday School. Perhaps you have even graduated from seminary. Let me ask you this question: <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> what do you realize about the sheepfold? What have you been taught about this matter? The key to unlocking the secret of this parable depends very much upon the meaning of the sheepfold. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="e1F2-TvVX-Wo06SOmByhrvB0AkxrzvfUAe3pb0V0IGQJ7M_YNjzT3VkMpObkgjnuy">1. The Sheepfold<br/>Signifying the Law, or Judaism,<br/>the Religion of the Law</h2><p data-content-id="OmAqQ18Wpl0cohVFmjYnYzB7NlRn8E3s18gEOw62GPpG9u6ni9v0XbHYnRZDBjgL3"> The sheepfold, in its better usage, signifies the law of the Old Testament, but in its common and ordinary usage, it signifies Judaism, the religion of the law. Originally, before the first advent of Christ, God gave His law to the people of Israel. What was God’s purpose in giving them the law? Did He expect them to keep it? No, that was not His purpose. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72797" data-verses="Galatians 3:23-26">Galatians 3:23-26</span> reveals God’s purpose in giving the law. “But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed. So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor; for you are all the sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.” Before faith in Christ came, we were kept under the law. In other words, we were kept like sheep in a fold. The Greek word translated “kept” means confined. Before faith came—that is, before Christ came—the chosen people of God were confined under the law. They were “shut up” under the law. “Shut up” is a special word in Greek, meaning to be kept in custody or under special care in a ward. For instance, if the parents of a family pass away, the children might be put in the custody of their aunt or uncle. In other words, they are put under the care of someone else. This shows how the chosen people of God were placed under the custody of the law before faith in Christ came. The law kept God’s people under custody “unto the faith,” which is better translated as “for preparation to the faith.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72798" data-verses="Galatians 3:24">Galatians 3:24</span> says that “the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ.” Actually, the translation of the King James Version for this verse is not adequate. In the Greek text it means that the law was our <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> slave to bring us to our schoolmaster, who is Christ. In ancient times, the children of the rich, Jewish families were escorted to their schoolmaster by a trained slave. Likewise, the law served as a slave to bring us to Christ. Before we were brought to Christ, the schoolmaster, we were under the care of a slave, the law. God the Father used the law as a slave to take care of us and to bring us to Christ. Before Christ came, we were put under the hand of the law which was to be our custodian. The law was responsible for the care and protection of God’s chosen people and eventually it brought them to Christ. Once we have been brought to Christ, we are justified by faith. Since faith has come—that is, since Christ has come—we are no longer under the custody of the slave. </p>
<p data-content-id="4TUau6dLXXRywSAVJ1aAuK_lFrgTjOpy_3LINqVcTISbRAG_tv46RgQoE2WRrdCmW"> Now we understand what is the sheepfold. Before Christ came, God put His chosen people under the custody of the law. The law was the fold. For example, if you visit the ranch country, you will discover that the sheep do not stay in the fold most of the time. Most of the year the sheep stay in the pasture. The pasture is the permanent place for them to stay, but the sheepfold is merely a temporary place. Only when the pasture is not ready will the sheep be kept in the fold. The fold is used temporarily to keep and protect the sheep until the pasture is ready. This illustrates that Christ is the pasture, the permanent place for the Lord’s children to stay. But before Christ came, God prepared the law as the sheepfold to keep and confine His chosen people temporarily. </p>
<p data-content-id="oK5t_cujVUe-6UYwI7CNC3HtoQyZgAVvGBQeMC2vVG8ZOCjSk5ko7lPuMCUs_kVHC"> However, when the Lord came, the Jewish religion had utilized the law to form Judaism. Judaism had become the sheepfold. Before the blind man was healed by the Lord, he was one of the sheep confined in Judaism. When he was cast out of the synagogue, he was actually driven out of Judaism. Therefore, he was put out of the fold. Formerly, he had been one of the sheep in the fold; now, he was cast out of the fold of Judaism. </p>

In eternity past, God <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> with His foresight had chosen His people. In time, before Christ came, God put His chosen people into the custody of the law. After Christ came, He wanted all of His people to come out of the law’s custody. The blind man who was cast out of the Jewish synagogue and who came to the Lord Jesus is one of God’s chosen people. He was under the custody of the law, but he was taken out of it unto the Lord Himself. </p>

Most Christians think that the door is for people to enter into heaven. Perhaps some of you reading this message still hold on to this concept. But the door here is not for you to go to heaven, for this door enables people to go in and out. If this door were the door into heaven, how could people go out of it? This door is not the door into heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkcrSxIpLQOUHK3_9r_JJGH9sf_ELGP9UGzvc5KrB8okn42Eg2P38C8PV4PVqU8cJ"> The Lord is the door to the sheepfold. Originally, the fold was the law, and the Lord was the door into the law. The Lord was not only the door into the law; He is also the door for people to come out of the law. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72799" data-verses="John 10:9">Verse 9</span> says, “I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.” Christ is the door, not only for God’s elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc., in the Old Testament time before Christ came; but also for God’s chosen people, such as Peter, James, John, and Paul, to come out of the fold of the law after Christ came. So the Lord indicates in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72800" data-verses="John 10:9">verse 9</span> that He is the door not only for God’s chosen people to go in, but also for God’s chosen people to go out. Those who went into the law were people like Moses, the psalmists, and the prophets. Christ was the door for these people to go into the fold of the law. In other words, they went into the fold through Christ and for Christ. If we adopt this point of view when reading the writings of Moses, the psalmists, and the prophets, we will realize that they entered into the <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> law of God through Christ. Christ was their entrance into the law. </p>

<p data-content-id="MWwn5_pxNxpNcbAwdZKkz3g76ebi5X3DU0CvvMTPWuJQBSUmbGja3mdoHOKC8EYbl"> The case of raising Lazarus from the dead is certainly a wonderful case. Here we see the case of a man who had died, who had been buried for four days, and who had begun to stink. Nevertheless, he was resurrected. Why do the other three Gospels give us no record of this wonderful case? Although this case is marvelous, the other Gospels say nothing about it. This case of resurrection does not fit in with the purposes of the other three Gospels; it only suits the purpose of the Gospel of John. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are Gospels with purposes other than life. John is the Gospel on life. Therefore, the Holy Spirit kept this case for John. This proves that the Gospel of John is a book of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VMLFt4z73i1A5nc88b5Ua9Hj8npBxae0I9fekDagnkfCayaI0rHPQg8monXBIOTyM">I. THE DEAD AND HIS NEED</h2><p data-content-id="idWE0reFGaAWAlr_maxPjpmCTiqbcPOP0DvCKdvLJMaSDuuVJK3S-muAf0I_c0Lu5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72829" data-verses="John 11:1-4">11:1-4</span> we see the dead and his need. Lazarus was not only sick but also dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72830" data-verses="John 11:14">11:14</span>). Thus, he did not need healing but resurrecting. In the Lord’s salvation He does not merely heal the sick; He also gives life to the dead. So He remained two days until the sick one had died (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72831" data-verses="John 11:6">11:6</span>). The Lord does not reform people or regulate them; He regenerates people and raises them out of death. Hence, the first of the nine cases is on regeneration and the last is on resurrection, revealing that all of the different aspects of Christ as life to us, as unveiled in the other seven cases, are in the principle of regeneration and resurrection. This last case is the actual changing of death into life. </p>
<p data-content-id="10MJntexVw9mtYnMwYrg4xDXBkYBi4_k9Sj8fkt-_KQkx6FVLKr6wXK38c_eWnUfc"> Before going into the matter of Christ raising Lazarus from the dead, we must realize that the Gospel of John reveals two things. On the positive side, it reveals that Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> came to be our life. The Son of God is the Word of God, which is the expression of God. As the expression of God, He came in the flesh to be our life. This central thought is found in every chapter throughout the entire Gospel. On the negative side, this book also shows that religion, even the Jewish religion of Judaism, is very much against Christ as life. By reading this book carefully, you will see how even the sound and genuine religion opposes Christ as life. Within the first ten chapters of this Gospel, the only opposition our Lord met came from the Jewish religion. Religion opposed Him, rejected Him, repudiated Him, and persecuted Him. Eventually, at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72832" data-verses="John 10:1">chapter ten</span>, He was forced to desert religion. He forsook the temple, the holy city, and all the good things of the Jewish religion and came to a new standing. </p>
<p data-content-id="9S6bAz339mYziRGeh84HoxyxJB4XTlUEwBDRLoFRB3ON6PAI2cNs0NusS0QT3DlqC"> In every chapter from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72833" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one through chapter ten</span> we can see one point concerning religion versus Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72834" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span> we see that religion was expecting a great leader to come. Religion looked for the so-called Messiah, Elijah, or the promised prophet. However, Christ did not come as a great leader, but as the little Lamb of God to accomplish redemption and with a little dove to produce the transformed stones for God’s building. Thus, even in the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72835" data-verses="John 1:1">first chapter of this Gospel</span> we find an indication that religion takes the wrong way, a way other than the way of life. There is a great discrepancy between religion and life. </p>
<p data-content-id="-wcKCKo7UARjQdL8ue3zvHMD9JFIhNDZrBP0U3En8T5V9E0iPj-NnoE9Ye4IDqtEN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72836" data-verses="John 2:1">chapter two</span> we see that religion will try to destroy life, for religion will try to destroy Jesus. But Jesus as the divine life will raise Himself out of that destruction. Life not only can withstand destruction, but can raise Himself up out of the destruction of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="piHiQSgOUStVtrqypGCWTHZ9Yfx9XL-jvmOyYyXYXCi31VAdk39LRDLmD7JuKz1I5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72837" data-verses="John 3:1">chapter three</span> we see that Nicodemus, a high-class man, held a religious concept of the Lord Jesus, addressing Him as rabbi and referring to Him as a teacher sent from God. All such concepts are religious. </p>
<p data-content-id="vJzJG0X_ryJcmFgaj7O54BY3uDbkeoRUBxT4ZWdjQGDJUapB8oOTU0vXOvnnlXEHm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72838" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span> we see that even a poor, mean, immoral, low-class Samaritan woman held a religious concept. At a certain point in her conversation with the Lord she began to speak about the worship of God. Although the religion among <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> the Samaritans was not orthodox, it was a religion. The Samaritans had a religious tradition and inheritance. </p>
<p data-content-id="WAJQg83IWdCfjdYL57AZ15VPVEx26GdlEPPkU9OnjGQWjiVZrhRbSL1RfcU528vmq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72839" data-verses="John 5:1">chapter five</span> we see religion’s opposition to life fully aroused. This was due to the fact that the Lord Jesus enlivened the impotent man on the Sabbath day. To the Jews, it seemed that He broke their regulations about the Sabbath. Consequently, they began to oppose Him. In fact, they began to be very much against the Lord. By this case we can see how the rules and regulations of religion are in opposition to the Lord as life to the needy. The Lord who is our life is one thing, but religion with all of its rules and regulations is another. Christ as life and religion with its regulations can never go together. </p>
<p data-content-id="2Q5ugYZO8sPp0OavwX07YxK3TFSV7Nsfngw8PljfG3IHcn7hxi9igE-N15TGlXeJl"> We also see something of religion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72840" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span>. When the people saw that Jesus had fed the multitude with five loaves and two fishes they said, “This is truly the prophet who is to come into the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72841" data-verses="John 6:14">6:14</span>). They were about to force the Lord to be their King (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72842" data-verses="John 6:15">6:15</span>). That was a religious concept. The Lord Jesus withdrew from them, for He wanted to remain as the small bread, good for people’s food. </p>
<p data-content-id="ukeBrlETbXJ-IG3cY3CPtFbbNDo45cevyTWorYeIAd3f0-tCeAa1VKDztLfP8v9yK"> We see another religious concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72843" data-verses="John 7:1">chapter seven</span>. The people at the religious feast were discussing Jesus, but Jesus stood and cried, asking them to turn from their dry religion and come to the source of living water. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdMBmskAexpdwW2wx0CDlEkynDv29Co6M5pbGhMnLA0lgGhFaxHSuJlcbe7THuX3M"> We see more of religion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72844" data-verses="John 8:1">chapter eight</span>. The religious scribes and Pharisees tried to trap the Lord by asking Him, in their religious way, how to deal with an adulterous woman. But the Lord answered in the way of life, exposing their folly in holding on to their religion and silencing them with shame. </p>
<p data-content-id="IERNcQ0vWBnLmeh0h1e4nqBeUADpREG0qchAScpqLDYkBPlPEbaDbq1XEh-Wkl5Fg"> The opposition of religion to life is strengthened in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72845" data-verses="John 9:1">chapter nine</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72846" data-verses="John 5:1">chapter five</span> the Lord enlivened an impotent man on the Sabbath. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72847" data-verses="John 9:1">chapter nine</span>, He gave sight to a blind man. He purposely did this on the Sabbath day. Why did not the Lord Jesus go to the blind man before or after the Sabbath day? He did it purposely to break the dead rituals of dead religion. That stirred religion’s opposition against life. The Lord purposely broke the Sabbath regulation before the eyes of the religious Jews. The eyes of the blind man received <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> sight, but the eyes of the Pharisees received blindness due to their opposition. The Jews thought that Jesus was very much against their religion because He broke the regulations of their religion. Hence, they became very angry with the Lord and began to oppose Him. They even excommunicated the man who had been healed by the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72848" data-verses="John 9:34">9:34</span>). When they cast the blind man out of their synagogue, they excommunicated him from their Judaistic religion. Then the Lord took the opportunity to tell them that Judaism was nothing other than a sheepfold which keeps the sheep for a while. Now that the pasture is ready, the sheep will be released from the fold and brought into the pasture. The Lord Jesus let them know that since they had excommunicated the blind man from their religion, a sheep was released from that fold and brought into Christ as the living pasture. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72849" data-verses="John 10:1">chapter ten</span>, the Lord walked out of the fold of the Jewish religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="H9Hy-5vnqUPnqiRPV4hi8lYOo-iwdpLJdrxLbhLN-vMjiEwxd-HPBShE698D5XbLQ"> In the first ten chapters of this Gospel we see the fighting, the struggle, between religion and life. Eventually, the Lord deserted that religion and went outside of it. Where is He now? He is outside of religion. He has nothing to do with it. Now, in His new standing, there is no religious element. All the elements of religion have been excluded. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Xzji_1UPvRreQsGazsRGLPnah9uQPwAkM0FbIvQrU7oMHeCL0a9Zt9q1Aoejnd4aw">II. FRUSTRATION OF HUMAN OPINIONS</h2><p data-content-id="knc2QAb9j4ccOXQiabeKy7A8PHO2T2KEihEStNALFHfsjrXJj2BXpKDG5-NN3oTu8"> Now we come to the last case. This case is not in the Judaistic fold; it is outside of it. After the Lord went out of Jerusalem, He went to a home in Bethany of one brother and two sisters who loved Him very much. Before He came, something happened in this home. The brother, Lazarus, became seriously ill, and the sisters sent a message to the Lord, which means that they prayed to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72850" data-verses="John 11:3">11:3</span>). There is nothing wrong with prayer. If you are in trouble, you must send a message to the Lord. At any time you can send a word to Him. You may send Him the information about any situation. But what He would do is up to Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="sKcQzI-JcYxQ0t13jfi9ds_QTOnJKztGW9tk91ziTD0CMYbh07w9aYssE7T5F0S5x"> By considering the signs in the Gospel of John, we can realize that the Lord firstly comes to us as life. The first category of hindrances that He met was the Judaistic religion, and the second category was that of the human opinions held by those who loved Him. The hindrance of human opinions is exactly the same today in His church. Countless opinions of those who love the Lord the most hinder the Lord from being resurrection life in the church. Outside the church, it is religion that prevents the Lord from being life. But inside the church, it is the endless opinions that hamper Him from being our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="wdYDXrVTBi16uQIJFcQKGu_FAbXHIhsQrac_ssNkW8MNVZd8_yYP9-uGMvsFev98q"> These nine cases are very meaningful because they show that the Lord as life starts with regeneration and ends with resurrection. All of these cases are signs signifying that the Lord comes to us as life in several different aspects. The experience of the Lord as our life begins with regeneration and reaches the climax with resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="L2ANrEyjfbJ7B2dFT0uonN2OFniVzGXaJCUsnvi40kXchfitT6kS-85r480rXaxQ_"> The Lord Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72876" data-verses="John 11:25">11:25</span>). Resurrection is superior to life. By itself, life can only have existence, but resurrection can withstand any kind of attack, even the attack of death. The Lord is not only life, but He is also resurrection. Death cannot hold Him because He can conquer death. Death cannot retain Him, because He is not only life—He is also resurrection. Life is the power to exist, but resurrection is the power to conquer everything that is against life. Therefore, because resurrection can defeat every attack against life, it is superior to life. </p>
<p data-content-id="mplh2Ii9SxX3L81TD5wuEW9vxczWHaVmNU91nzbGcnLT3uA9GiS-fWkrhi4wJZm5Z"> According to the Scriptures, death is a great power. When death comes upon a man, he cannot escape it. Not even atomic <span class="pg" data-page-id="286" id="286">[286]</span> power can overcome death. Only the Lord Himself as resurrection can defeat death. He can deliver all of the dead persons from death because He is not only life but also resurrection. Since He is the resurrection, He can break the power of death. Even Hades is unable to confine our Lord to the tomb. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zo9dN5yT4RaGVzmhcR-jZJLwO4N0OSuZjtDQf5M2EBBxv1xMr6YswtQOIRp7t2MTg"> We must learn how to apply this resurrection life day by day. We must not only live by the Lord as life, but we must also conquer by the Lord as resurrection. Many times our circumstances affect us like death. But praise the Lord that all matters which contain the touch of death are a test because these matters prove whether or not the Lord is the resurrection. Nothing can confine us, for we have the Lord as our resurrection life. Regardless of the pressure or trouble we are bearing, we can stand it because we have resurrection life. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72877" data-verses="John 11:25">11:25</span>, the Lord did not say that we will not die, but that we will prove to the whole universe that the Lord in whom we believe is the resurrection! Satan will try his best to put us permanently into death. One day, though we all may die, we will all be resurrected. Throughout the whole universe this will be the greatest victory, the victory that will testify that the Lord is the resurrection. However, even in our daily life we may have the foretaste of the ultimate victory of that resurrection. This is why the Apostle Paul said, “To know Him and the power of His resurrection” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72878" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="DPmqvJz2MlFezx9EMtwq5WRF0UwqGXmjgMdv89HHfju_NU1jX7KGYx7B706OzsP2g"> The human opinion is always in the way of experiencing the Lord as the resurrection life in the church. Therefore, human opinion must be given up before it is possible to have the church life. How we need to learn the lesson of being silent in the church instead of voicing our opinion! We must be even more quiet than Mary. We should not say a word. We should simply send a message to the Lord—that is all. Then Lazarus will be saved. Whether the Lord answers or not and whether He comes or not, we are simply quiet. We just leave the matter completely in the hands of the Lord. Then we will never be wrong and He will never be late. When He comes, we must not say a word. We should just let Him speak and give Him the opportunity to do whatever He wants. We <span class="pg" data-page-id="287" id="287">[287]</span> should simply be available to cooperate with Him. This is the proper way to have the church life. If we do this, we shall experience Christ as the resurrection life. </p>
<p data-content-id="SSy1z1-JelNs_byNtUBvs2uYyIT6RoggYyiZmjl4crSpjkol7KqVeTafPqwkZ2tgp"> This chapter in John is very meaningful when it is related to the church life. The Lord is the One who comes to the church as the resurrection life, but there are two categories of hindrances. One is religion and the other is human opinion. Even Christianity as a religion is absolutely a hindrance to the Lord’s purpose of bringing life. Today, there are many so-called free groups of Christians who have given up Christianity as a religion. They have come out of the denominations and other Christian organizations. Nevertheless, how endless are the human opinions among these free groups! Although there may be nothing like religion among them, yet how much their human opinions stand in the Lord’s way! Therefore, we must learn the lesson of not only giving up the Christian religion but also of forsaking our own opinions. Then we will afford the Lord a free course to be life in our midst. Once the Lord can express Himself, then the Lord will have a living church. Let us remember that religion and opinion are the two main categories of frustration to the flow of the Lord as our life. </p>
<p data-content-id="gXvFaTgxHGUO-rzGxerZr7b1l8PodFDz2DYGuF1ZGVlt-c2zGVtRXg1oF_kS85QlB"> Before going further into this last case, we must discover a principle. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72879" data-verses="John 2:1">chapter two</span> we saw that the first sign was that of changing the water into wine. The second sign, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72880" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span>, was that of making the dying son of the royal official live. We have mentioned several times that the intention of the Holy Spirit throughout this gospel is simply to make the Lord Jesus to be the life to meet all of our needs. These two signs in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72881" data-verses="John 2:1">chapters two</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72882" data-verses="John 4:1">four</span> reveal the principle of life out of death. In all nine cases there is the principle of life in the realm of resurrection to meet every human need. Now we can understand why the changing of water into wine was the “beginning of signs.” It contains the all-important principle of bringing life out of death. This is the basic principle in all of the nine cases. In every case there is nothing but water, which signifies death. All that we are and all that we have is nothing but the water of death. In other words, we are <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span> nothing more than the water of death and we have nothing other than the water of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="e1F2-TvVX-Wo06SOmAShj9R0AkxrzvfUAe3pb0V0IGQJ7M_YNjzT3VkMpObkgjnuy"> If you consider the condition of the people in each case, you will discover that in every case they had nothing but death. Look at the man named Nicodemus. He had nothing but the water of death. Look at the Samaritan woman. Her thirst meant that she was under the threatening of death. Look at the dying son of the royal official. He was under the cruelty of death. Look at the man who was sick for thirty-eight years. What did he have? Death. Look at the multitude before they were fed by the Lord. They were hungry because they had nothing other than the water of death. Look at the thirsty religionists. The vanity with which their feast ended also spoke of death. Look at the sinful woman who was brought to the Lord by the Pharisees. She also had only the water of death. Spiritually speaking, even the blind man had only death. And Lazarus reeked of death. All the people involved in these nine cases had nothing but the water of death. According to the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72883" data-verses="John 2:1">second chapter</span>, the six waterpots, a type of humanity, were filled to the brim with the water of death. Likewise, every person in every case was filled with death. Death is revealed in every case. </p>
<p data-content-id="5w-j5wr_UufC5LfaGybLY1gNbg8EjHeZRqKuWbOgeqQ6qwIVYLcWYffP9g4uA2B9B"> However, the Lord came into these situations of death in order to be life in the principle of resurrection. He turned the death of each situation into life and brought life out of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="N4fmiTCMCnn3CkIWXMmYtxfDgyhJ12fvZLXKozkGfvmkz7BV-BxJS1lJhf9hBkG1i"> Let us apply this principle of life in resurrection to all of the cases. Firstly, the Lord spoke with Nicodemus about regeneration. Do you know what is the principle of regeneration? Regeneration simply means that the Lord has come to be our life in resurrection. How can the Lord regenerate people or cause them to be born anew? Simply by being their life in the principle of resurrection. </p>

<p data-content-id="piHiQSgOUStVtrqypHiWXVp9Yfx9XL-jvmOyYyXYXCi31VAdk39LRDLmD7JuKz1I5"> In this message we come to another major subsection in the Gospel of John. We have seen that this Gospel is composed of two sections: the eternal Word incarnated coming to bring God into man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72895" data-verses="John 1:1">chs. 1—13</span>), and Jesus crucified and Christ resurrected going to prepare the way to bring man into God, and as the Spirit coming to abide and live in the believers for the building of God’s habitation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72896" data-verses="John 14:1">chs. 14—21</span>). We have already covered the first three subsections of the first main section: an introduction to life and building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72897" data-verses="John 1:1-51">1:1-51</span>); life’s principle and life’s purpose (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72898" data-verses="John 2:1-22">2:1-22</span>); and life meeting the need of man’s every case (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72899" data-verses="John 2:23">2:23—11:57</span>). The principle of life is to change death into life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72900" data-verses="John 2:1-11">2:1-11</span>), and the purpose of life is to build the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72901" data-verses="John 2:12-22">2:12-22</span>). Beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72902" data-verses="John 3:1">chapter three</span>, we see nine cases which illustrate how Christ as life can meet mankind’s every need for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. This brings us to the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72903" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. After this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72904" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, this Gospel reveals the issue of Christ being life to man: the producing of the church. The church, a house of feasting, is the place where the Lord can rest and obtain His satisfaction. The issue of Christ being life to man is the church. What then is life’s multiplication? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72905" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span> we see a small church. It is small in number, in size, and in the growth of life. How can this church be multiplied? It is by the multiplication of life. The issue of life is to produce the church, and the multiplication of life is to increase the church in size, in number, and in the growth of life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="298" id="298">[298]</span> </p>

That resurrection issued in the church life. We all were dead persons. Then the Lord came in to resurrect us. After He resurrected us, we became the church. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72909" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span> we see Lazarus resurrected and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72910" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span> we see that the resurrected person becomes the very place where the Lord can find rest and satisfaction. This is the church. Now we need to consider the church as the house of feasting. </p>

Outside of Religion</h2><p data-content-id="Xzji_1UPvRreQsGaztxGLNnah9uQPwAkM0FbIvQrU7oMHeCL0a9Zt9q1Aoejnd4aw"> This house of feasting is outside of religion. It was not in Jerusalem, the holy city, or in the holy temple. It was in a little house in Bethany, outside of Jerusalem and outside of religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="knc2QAb9j4ccOXQiaa-Kx7g8PHO2T2KEihEStNALFHfsjrXJj2BXpKDG5-NN3oTu8"> The Lord being life to people to meet all of their needs brought about His rejection by the Jewish religion. Judaism could not tolerate seeing the Lord being life to so many kinds of people. So the religious ones rejected the Lord as life. This rejection began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72911" data-verses="John 5:1">chapter five</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72912" data-verses="John 5:16">vv. 16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72913" data-verses="John 5:18">18</span>) and reached its climax in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72914" data-verses="John 10:1">chapter ten</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72915" data-verses="John 10:31">vv. 31</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72916" data-verses="John 10:39">39</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72917" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span> the Jewish religionists even held a council on how to put the Lord to death because He had raised Lazarus from the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72918" data-verses="John 11:53">11:53</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72919" data-verses="John 11:57">57</span>). The Jewish leaders also plotted to put Lazarus to death for the same reason (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72920" data-verses="John 12:10">12:10</span>). This shows how much religion is against the Lord as life. It not only persecuted the Lord, but also tried to destroy those who participated in the Lord as life. Religion always renounces and rejects the Lord as life. </p>
<p data-content-id="J4tx36WD8sSYvG3X3mK3S77wvrh2fuKH6QNE9Gs4JzvDXVEmUt3P5UvoURVrInZGe"> As we study the Gospel of John, we must see the difference between religion and Christ as life. The Lord Jesus came to <span class="pg" data-page-id="299" id="299">[299]</span> earth in His incarnation not to be a religious leader but to come into man and to be man’s life. From the first case of regeneration in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72921" data-verses="John 3:1">chapter three</span> to the last case of resurrection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72922" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, all that the Lord did was to present Himself as life to people outside of the Jewish religion. If we look at religion, including Christianity, from a viewpoint other than that of life, we shall be easily cheated and misled, for religion teaches people how to know God and worship Him. It even teaches the Bible. It seems that there is nothing bad about it. However, if the Lord has mercy on us and if His Spirit opens our eyes, we shall see that what God is doing in the universe is not merely to make people worship Him or serve Him. In this age God’s desire and intention are to come into man in the Son, by His Spirit, and through His Word to be man’s life that man might live by Him. This is absolutely different from religion and altogether contrary to the religious concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="zBGhA3590E7XPL6iePv_E-OBnKECgCDATp-tFcRb9BVVdo8R8xctsKXmFfAC4TlQd"> When the Lord came as life to man, He was rejected by the Jewish religion. Throughout all the succeeding centuries, He has been continually rejected by religion. Whether that religion is Catholicism or Protestantism, as long as it is a religion it will not and cannot purely take the Lord as life. In this matter of taking the Lord as life, both the religion of Catholicism and the religion of Protestantism have been great frustrations to people, just as the religion of Judaism was in the Lord’s time and still is today. Therefore, we must be aware and alert concerning any kind of religion. If not, we might be led astray. </p>

But there was also a positive issue brought forth by the Lord’s being life to people—a home for Him in His rejection, a place where He could rest, feast, dwell, and be satisfied. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="72923" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span> we see that the Lord has come out and has hidden Himself from the religion that rejected Him and has come into a home of His Jewish believers in Bethany. By making Himself the resurrection life to His believers, He found a home. This home may be considered a shadow of His church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> On the one hand, He was rejected by Judaism and gave it up; on the other hand, He obtained a home where He could stay and rest. He had a place where He could feast and be satisfied. Formerly, the Lord had “nowhere that He may lay His head” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72924" data-verses="Matthew 8:20">Matt. 8:20</span>). But now, after raising Lazarus from the dead, He obtained a place for resting and feasting. After the Jewish religion had rejected Him, He was no longer willing to stay in Jerusalem. He always went away to stay in Bethany (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72925" data-verses="Matthew 21:17-18">Matt. 21:17-18</span>). There He could not only stay and rest but also feast and be satisfied. This spiritually signifies that He was absolutely separated from the Jewish religion of the Old Testament and was and still is dwelling in the church as His home wherein He can rest, feast, and be satisfied. </p>
<p data-content-id="qVbKRqoOAGu3MGxnT2afH5BOYKQQJ683fkFd9Unt-pau-YfKbohX26ar8pj6Ztet-"> Although there was nothing outwardly attractive about that little house, inwardly it was filled with feasting, resting, and satisfaction. Not only the Lord Jesus was feasting and resting, but so was everyone else who was there. It must be this way in the church life. When you look at the church life outwardly, nothing is attractive. Neither the building nor the chairs nor anything may seem to be very good. Outwardly, everything may be poor; inwardly, however, everything is precious, sweet, and dear. We have the sweet sensation that we are with the Lord and that the Lord is with us. He is feasting with us and we are feasting with Him. Both He and we are resting. Everyone is at rest and everyone is satisfied. This is the church life. </p>

Firstly, it was produced by resurrection life. Lazarus was present as a sign that the church is produced by resurrection life. The church does not come into being by man’s organization, man’s wisdom, man’s work, or man’s teaching. It comes into being by resurrection life. </p>

In the first part of this chapter we see, in a shadow, that the church has come into existence through the Lord as resurrection life. We have the church by His resurrection life. But how can the Lord increase the church? This is shown in the second part of this chapter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72950" data-verses="John 12:12-36">vv. 12-36a</span>). The first part shows how the church is here, but the second part shows how the Lord can increase the church through His death and resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="a9NrvhD6wW1hRS7-imQmtR11fb7DU8q1AZlxJz81s5YFPu5MILIeqJhyavV3tDNAj">A. The Golden Time for Jesus</h2><p data-content-id="btOmTWeLFFpscfgnOxcKwTYbahrI2rT3IwVxeSAiE7B_1vo4eGvaKTJstwR_ZClRW"> At this point, according to the worldly view, Jesus was in His golden time. The raising up of Lazarus from the dead was such a miracle that it shook all the people. It was a real miracle for a dead person, buried for four days and even stinking, to be raised up. Because the Lord had raised Lazarus from the dead, a great crowd of the Jews highly esteemed Him and warmly welcomed Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72951" data-verses="John 12:12-19">vv. 12-19</span>). They welcomed Him by shouting, “Hosanna, blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!” Humanly speaking, this very hour was the most glorious time for the Lord while He was on earth. All the people praised Him, welcomed Him, honored Him, and respected Him. Even the Greeks came to seek Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72952" data-verses="John 12:20-22">vv. 20-22</span>). The Jewish people welcomed Him, and the Gentiles, the Greeks, sought to follow Him. Could the <span class="pg" data-page-id="312" id="312">[312]</span> Lord have produced and increased the church by accepting this kind of welcome and honor? No, this is not the way to produce or increase the church. This is not the way to bring the church into existence and increase it in life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="qVbKRqoOAGu3MGxnT2qfPqROYKQQJ683fkFd9Unt-pau-YfKbohX26ar8pj6Ztet-">B. As a Grain of Wheat to Fall into the Ground</h2><p data-content-id="Uj2hgxuYFe-UC_23_s9o7xgrEPXe5jTUAOGzaPqIwSAQiBsHQoHWtKOYJParAMEVp"> At that very moment, when the Lord was welcomed and honored by both Jews and Greeks, what did He say? If we had been there, or if such a welcome had been extended to us, we would have said, “Praise the Lord. Now is the time for us to do something to glorify God.” The Lord Jesus, however, was not excited. The greater the welcome, the more calm He became. The more He was sought after, the colder He was to those who sought for Him. He told the seekers that He was a grain of wheat. He said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="72953" data-verses="John 12:24">v. 24</span>). This was the Lord’s attitude toward such a human welcome. This was His reaction toward the glory of human honor. What is the way for a grain of wheat to multiply? It is not by being welcomed or honored, but by falling into the ground to die. This is absolutely contrary to the human concept. Nevertheless, we must remember that this is the only way to bring the church into being and to increase it in life. Whenever a human welcome comes to you, you must say, “I must die.” Whenever human honor comes to you, you must reply, “I must be buried.” Do not say, “Hallelujah, praise the Lord!” This is not the best time for you to do something, even if your intention is to glorify God. The proper way to glorify God is for you to die and be buried. </p>
<p data-content-id="MWwn5_pxNxpNcbAwdYak3lQ76ebi5X3DU0CvvMTPWuJQBSUmbGja3mdoHOKC8EYbl"> The Lord Jesus did not seize the golden opportunity as the means to have His increase. If He had, He would have made a great mistake. The golden opportunity is never for the increase. If you read church history, you will see that whenever the church had an increase it was not the result of a golden opportunity but of persecution. The time for the church to increase is during persecution, not during a warm welcome. When the enemy puts the church into death, that is the time for the church to be increased. The more persecution and opposition there are, the more increase the church will <span class="pg" data-page-id="313" id="313">[313]</span> have. The persecution at the hands of the Roman Empire did not frustrate the growth of the church during the first two centuries, but rather helped it to grow. What then did damage the church? The welcome of the Roman Empire. When the Roman Empire turned its persecution into welcome, the church life was ruined. Do not be excited by man’s welcome. Man’s welcome will always ruin and corrupt us. Praise the Lord that man’s persecution and opposition are the golden opportunity for the increase of Christ. He is a grain of wheat, and there is no other way for that grain of wheat to increase except for it to fall into the ground and die. This is the way to have the multiplication of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="VMLFt4z73i1A5nc88apUdvHj8npBxae0I9fekDagnkfCayaI0rHPQg8monXBIOTyM"> Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it will simply remain one grain and will never produce anything. But, praise the Lord, after it dies and grows up, the one grain becomes the many grains or the much fruit. These many grains or much fruit are the church. This is the way for the church to come into being. This is also the way for the Lord to increase the church. This has to be the way for us to bring the church into existence and to increase it. We must face human welcome by death, by taking the cross. The way for the church to come into being and to increase is not by human glory; it is by the death of the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="idWE0reFGaAWAlr_mbhPl72CTiqbcPOP0DvCKdvLJMaSDuuVJK3S-muAf0I_c0Lu5"> Although many good missionaries were sent to China by the leading missions, such as the one formed by Brother Hudson Taylor, history proves that there was not much result for the proper church life. Among the many missionaries who went to China was a sister named Margaret E. Barber who was sent there by a British mission. She was accused falsely, called back to England, and later vindicated by the Lord. Then the Lord burdened her to return to China. She was not sent by any mission but went there by faith, settling in a little town named Pagoda, very close to Brother Watchman Nee’s hometown. She stayed there purposely, not visiting other places. In a sense, the Lord sowed her there as a grain of wheat. She remained there for years, dying there in 1929. </p>
<p data-content-id="10MJntexVw9mtYnMwZ7gxijXBkYBi4_k9Sj8fkt-_KQkx6FVLKr6wXK38c_eWnUfc"> Brother Nee told me personally the complete story regarding his contact with Sister Barber. Along with other young people, Brother Nee went to her to receive help. She was deep <span class="pg" data-page-id="314" id="314">[314]</span> in the Lord and was very strict. She often rebuked the young ones. Brother Nee told me that most of them could not stand her rebukes. Eventually he was nearly the only one who kept going to her, presenting himself to her as an offering for her rebukes. He did this purposely. After a certain period of time had passed, he would feel the need for further rebuking and would go to her for another rebuke, and she did it. In 1929 she went to the Lord. She did not have much that anyone could inherit except a Bible containing many notes, which she willed to Brother Nee. Sister Barber was a seed that was sown, and Brother Nee was a grain that grew out of that seed. Brother Nee, as a seed that grew out of her, became a great vessel for the recovery of the proper church life. This is the way to produce and increase the church in life. It is absolutely not a matter of a golden opportunity. </p>
<p data-content-id="9S6bAz339mYziRGeh9oHgiCxJB4XTlUEwBDRLoFRB3ON6PAI2cNs0NusS0QT3DlqC"> In 1940, during the Sino-Japanese War, Brother Nee conducted a training in Shanghai. I attended that training. In China during that time, there were some prevailing Chinese preachers. They always had the greatest following, and large crowds attended their preaching. Brother Nee, on the contrary, used to tell us that the work is not a matter of the endeavor of outward activity, but of the outflow of the inner life. The work that the Lord needs is the overflow of the inner life. In Brother Nee’s training in 1940 there were not more than eighty trainees. But Brother Nee was satisfied with such a small number. Whenever he held a conference, there were, at the most, not more than 350 people. He always stressed that the work is the overflow of inner life, not the endeavor of outward activity. Today we see the issue of Brother Nee’s ministry: many churches produced in the Lord’s recovery throughout the world. </p>

<p data-content-id="BIN7s6C3jIrwhmOtHi5QC3p98HXXDvzIG873PQJvi9ygFduggN23Zk5vk4njinT-6"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73000" data-verses="John 13:1">John 13</span>, a very interesting and meaningful chapter. Probably all Christians know that such a chapter about the Lord’s washing of the disciples’ feet exists in the Gospels. It seems easy for anyone to understand this chapter, but actually it is not at all easy to realize its true meaning. Usually Christians merely believe that to wash the feet of others is to show love to them. Some believers even insist on the washing of feet every time they come to the Lord’s table. At the Lord’s table they wash one another’s feet to express their love for one another. This is not wrong unless it is made legalistic. If it is not made legalistic, then these occasions of showing love to one another by washing one another’s feet are all right. Several times in the past I have washed the feet of others, and others have washed my feet. At times, we must allow the Lord to lead and guide us to do this to one another. But this matter of foot-washing signifies something more important. As we have seen, everything mentioned in this Gospel is a sign that indicates something deeper and spiritual. Therefore, foot-washing is also a sign signifying something deeper and spiritual. But it is rather difficult to discover the spiritual significance of this sign. What is its deeper, spiritual significance? </p>
<p data-content-id="xOo-j224Hj5u9Wh_H24K1Pxj7GP-Eq9xBADShaZxPMlXAITSSXmqqrcQZSIT_Aurv"> Before answering this question, we must first realize the position of this chapter in the Gospel of John as a whole. It is positioned as a turning point in the Gospel. The Gospel of John is divided mainly into two sections. The first section, <span class="pg" data-page-id="326" id="326">[326]</span> composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73001" data-verses="John 1:1">chapters one through thirteen</span>, tells how the Lord as the eternal Word, which is God Himself, and as the Son of God came through His incarnation to bring God into man to be man’s life to produce the church. The second section, composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73002" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen through twenty-one</span>, unveils how the Lord as the Son of Man went through His death and resurrection to bring man into God, that man and God, God and man, may be built together as a mutual abode. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73003" data-verses="John 13:1">Chapter thirteen</span>, at the end of the first section, is a dividing line and a turning point. It turns the record from one direction to another. </p>
<p data-content-id="rLGBtKAwOkfYXgIGMtDW1jwVg5s0ZxG50AlbMCy9cko_zYUvRELw3BdMHVjcPV4To"> What is the central thought of the first part of the Gospel of John? It is the Lord as the eternal Word, who is the expression of God, coming to be our life, meeting all of our needs, and making us the members of His Body. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73004" data-verses="John 1:1">Chapter one</span> reveals the Lord as the eternal Word, that is, as the expression of God. Then we see the Lord coming to be our life, coming that we might take Him in as our life to meet all our needs. The nine cases selected show that the Lord as life can meet all of our needs. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73005" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span> reveals that the Lord, as a grain of wheat, has to pass through death and resurrection to produce us, the many grains, who are being blended together as one loaf, which is His Body, the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="dVGN5WXLxIx0FItFTZauZNdhDedsgBGx6cSHcgladGc5IaMSTaHitKZaPlyR-YeoS"> The central point of the second part is that the Lord who was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. He was transfigured from the expression of God in the flesh into the Spirit so that He could come into us as life. Please notice that I use the word <em>transfigured</em>. The Lord was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit so that He might be able to come into our spirit, be our life in our spirit, and be one with us in our spirit. As the Spirit, He is in us and we are in Him. Now He and we, we and He, can be mingled together as one. </p>
<p data-content-id="QdS_HMSS3SdGPRtEG4lRYWLsrSqMQHxUS3POjiiKGElbtbOCx1j7HNi8K4jPqe1Qb"> In the first part of John’s Gospel the Lord comes to bring God into us, and in the last part the Lord goes to bring us into God. In the first twelve chapters the Lord comes by incarnation to bring God into man; in the last eight chapters the Lord goes by death and resurrection to bring man into God. The first section shows how He comes, and the last <span class="pg" data-page-id="327" id="327">[327]</span> section shows how He goes. He comes by incarnation that He may bring God into us. He goes by death and resurrection that He may bring us into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ycRAO1PQyck3vYSrXAq6uWAApQRQUIW1z8hRVBub6MifAsRtiq85jQsSkWApHYCbK"> Between these two sections <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73006" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> stands as the turning point. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73007" data-verses="John 13:3">Verse 3</span> says, “Jesus, knowing...that He had come forth from God, and was going to God.” He had come from God and was going to God. For this reason I say that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73008" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> is the turning point in the Gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="8DJXQ5Z5MNoL38Tw4qB3mtyGTNIKyqqegEmV6n4XFlp5EG2WvIw21JD6sbOEnoo2p"> For quite a long time I was deeply bothered by this chapter. I wondered why foot-washing was not recorded before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73009" data-verses="John 11:1">chapter eleven</span> or after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73010" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. I wondered why it was there in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73011" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. I was troubled by the position of this chapter because I had come to realize that from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73012" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one through twelve</span> the Lord as the Word had come to impart Himself as life to many people and that eventually the church came out. The church is there in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73013" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. The Lord was the Lamb of God taking away sin, He was lifted up in the form of a serpent to deal with the serpentine nature, and He was also the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died to bring forth many grains. In a sense, by the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73014" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span> everything is completed. It seemed to me that there was no need for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73015" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. So I was troubled, thinking that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73016" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> should immediately follow <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73017" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span> and that there was no need for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73018" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> at all. I spent much time with the Lord to find out why <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73019" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> was necessary. Eventually, the Lord told me why we need to have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73020" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73021" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. It is very significant that foot-washing is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73022" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73023" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, the very turning point of the Gospel of John, the Lord washed His disciples’ feet. The significance of this is deeply meaningful. </p>

Hence, the foot-washing is a matter of love, a love to the uttermost. <span class="pg" data-page-id="328" id="328">[328]</span> Without this, the Lord’s love toward us would not have been to the uttermost but would have fallen short of our need. This shows the importance of foot-washing. This is our uttermost need. In the nine foregoing cases, the Lord has met all our needs. After all this, we still have the need of foot-washing. Therefore, the Lord has to take care of this by showing us His love to the uttermost. </p>

It was because He knew “that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was going to God.” At that time He realized three things: (1) that the Father had given all into His hands; (2) that He had come forth from God; and (3) that He was going to God. Because of these three things He washed the feet of His disciples. The “all” that the Father had given Him was mainly the disciples; His coming forth from God had brought God into His disciples; and in His going to God He was to leave these disciples. The Father had given the disciples, and the Lord had brought God into them, but now He was going to leave them. By His coming forth from God and His bringing God into them, a relationship between the disciples and God in Him came into existence. Now He was going to leave them. After He had left them, how could this relationship between the disciples and God be maintained? It is to be maintained by the foot-washing. Foot-washing is the washing away from the feet of all the dirt that frustrates the fellowship of the relationship between God and man. In doing it, the Lord showed His disciples the way for them to maintain their relationship with God in Him. </p>

Now I want to share something about the foot-washing by the believers among one another (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73036" data-verses="John 13:12-17">vv. 12-17</span>). We need not only the foot-washing that is exercised directly by the Lord Himself but also the mutual foot-washing of one another. The Lord told us to wash one another’s feet. As I have mentioned already, sometimes we must keep the Lord’s word literally, but to an even greater degree we must keep His word spiritually. We must wash one another’s feet by ministering the work of the Holy Spirit, by ministering the enlightenment of the Word, and by ministering the operation of the inner life. In this way, I help you, you help me, and we help one another to be washed in the work of the Holy Spirit, in the light of the Word, or in the operation of the inner life. Whenever we brothers come together for fellowship and prayer, we need to minister the spiritual foot-washing to one another. It is the spiritual foot-washing ministered to one another that keeps us clean from the earthly touch. Dear brothers, have you considered how much you need this kind of mutual foot-washing? While you are walking and working on this earth, you need not only the Lord’s foot-washing ministered directly within your spirit but also the foot-washing from the brothers and sisters. <span class="pg" data-page-id="338" id="338">[338]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="cYGn4xmNBVjFrfZmVBIv2I9m_9fxL63wVykF5p86Aez0RDjJtznd2riwP4UqqLC1-">A. Following the Example of the Lord</h2><p data-content-id="Yb8KD0TEIsrERldUsG2HOiNpGwNXPZgTUQSWnXv9XEEyrD-PFldCdx1u3tLElwVtE"> When the Lord washed the disciples’ feet, He laid aside His garments. We have seen that, in figure, garments here signify the Lord’s virtues and attributes in His expression and that the laying aside of His garments signifies the putting off of what He is in His expression. If the Lord had maintained the expression of His virtues and attributes, He would have been unable to wash the feet of the disciples. Likewise, whenever you are about to wash others’ feet, you need to lay aside your attainments, virtues, and attributes. This is real humility, the genuine humbling of yourself. We need to humble ourselves to such a degree that we can wash others’ feet. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkcrSxIpLQOUHK3_9pfJBVX9sf_ELGP9UGzvc5KrB8okn42Eg2P38C8PV4PVqU8cJ"> In the Scriptures a garment signifies what we do and how we act. Whatever we do and however we act become our garment. If you have good behavior, you have an excellent garment, something that is beautiful and glorious. However, if you want to minister spiritual foot-washing to others, you must lay aside what you have attained, what you have been doing, and how you have been behaving. Every time you come together with the brothers to minister some spiritual foot-washing to them, you must lay aside the way you have conducted yourself. This means that you must humble yourself. Do not think that your conduct is good enough. Your deeds and behavior may have been very beautiful and glorious, so you became proud. You are proud of your garments, proud of what you have been doing. On the other hand, I may think in my heart that I am so humble and that you are too proud. With this kind of attitude and motive, we can never minister any foot-washing to others. I need to lay aside all of my good deeds and forget all of my virtues. This laying aside of the garments is very practical. Whenever you are proud, you can never minister spiritual foot-washing to anyone. You must be humble and lay aside your garments. To lay aside your garments means to humble yourself, to empty yourself, to take something off of you and to strip something from you. </p>
<p data-content-id="n8WSh8WU2BdpsjVRBBNTN5J5SG8QBnYwKIXlL0q3eeAFANq7Mk2tNf7lfC_nB1Vr0"> Allow me to speak very frankly. During my Christian life I have met a good number of brothers and sisters in my travels <span class="pg" data-page-id="339" id="339">[339]</span> to various places. Many are so spiritual, but they are also proud. They are proud of their spirituality. They wear a garment of spirituality. When they come together, they look down on others, thinking that the others have never seen a heavenly vision or known anything spiritual. What is this? This is their pride. They are proud of being spiritual. If we take this attitude, it will be impossible for us to minister foot-washing to others. Whenever we come together with the saints, on the contrary, we must take off our garments and forget our attainments. We must be carefully aware of this matter. We all have been guilty of this attitude. How often we have had the thought, “Oh, they do not know the church life; they do not know how to walk in the spirit; they have never learned the lessons of the inner life.” This is pride. If we take this proud attitude, we can never help others. We must lay aside our garments, our attainments, our spirituality. We must lay aside all degrees of spirituality and become simple and general, saying to ourselves, “I am nothing, and nothing within me is special. I have only a towel, a piece of cloth, to gird me.” We should not come to each other in the uniform of a policeman; otherwise, we shall be fearful and scared of one another. Sometimes people come threateningly with the attitude of a policeman wearing a uniform. Some come wearing a uniform of spirituality, while others wear the uniform of the deeper life, and still others are clad with the uniform of the so-called gifts. They all must lay aside their uniforms before they can minister any kind of foot-washing to others. We should not say this to others; we must say it to ourselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="65XEpihaZD6ISNAVI46JxwFYFIvvJdVmQZ8Nms4k0sV2bawyzQ5gp4-b5hMWcG5LI"> It is not an easy thing to lay aside our garments and humble ourselves in order to wash others’ feet. Suppose a certain brother offends me unconsciously. Although he is unaware that he has offended me, I am conscious of the offense. What should I do? I must look to the Lord for His grace not to condemn my brother, but to wash his feet. If I try to wash him without the grace, the result will be a big blow up. Why? Because he offended me, it will be so easy for me to rebuke him, even without having the intention of doing so. I need to lay aside my garments and come down to his level. Whenever we have the sensation that someone has offended us, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> always consider ourselves higher than that person, thinking that he is lower, that he owes us something, and that we have a claim upon him. Herein lies the difficulty. You need to put aside your garments, lower your standard, and come down from your throne. In a sense, laying aside your garments means to dethrone yourself. Do not sit on the throne judging your brother, saying, “You offended me, you offended me.” As long as you have this attitude, the tail of the fox will come out. Eventually, you will rebuke the offending brother, and the result will be a quarrel, for he will deny that he did anything to offend you. Immediately, the entire situation becomes a sinful one. </p>
<p data-content-id="RlO-2vedqmdQXARA9_64FB2WiHInosSJJl_rxLF7T71PLsdG2vlqt0YIcHtVEPKWx"> Not only do we need to lay aside the garments of our attainments, but we also need to be girded with a towel. This means that we must be bound, that we must lose our liberty. The feet were washed with water and also wiped with the towel with which the Lord was girded. In other words, the more we are willing to be bound for the sake of others, the more we shall be able to minister to others and wipe their feet. Otherwise, the more we are free, the more we shall damage others. Brothers, when we come together, we must not only lay aside our attainments, but we must also be bound and be willing to lose our liberty. We simply give up our liberty for the purpose of ministering something to our dear brothers and sisters. We must be willing to be girded and bound in order to minister something that wipes the brothers and sisters. </p>

<p data-content-id="N4fmiTCMCnn3CkIWXP2YpivDgyhJ12fvZLXKozkGfvmkz7BV-BxJS1lJhf9hBkG1i"> In this message we come to the very heart, the center, of the Gospel of John. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73048" data-verses="John 14:1">Chapter fourteen</span> is the first part of the message that the Lord gave to His disciples before His death. In order to understand this message, we must remember that this Gospel reveals two main points: one, that the Lord comes to be our life; two, that the Lord will build us together in oneness with Himself and with God. As we have already mentioned, the two most important words in this Gospel are <em>life</em> and <em>building.</em> The word <em>building</em> is clearly referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73049" data-verses="John 2:1">chapter two</span>, for there we are told that the Lord will build up the temple, the house of God, in three days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73050" data-verses="John 2:19">v. 19</span>). Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73051" data-verses="John 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> the Lord prayed that those who take the Lord as life may be one in the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73052" data-verses="John 17:21-23">vv. 21-23</span>). This oneness in the Triune God is the spiritual building. When we take the Lord as life, the Lord as the Spirit will build us together as one in the Triune God. Life and building, the central thought of this Gospel, are two items which must definitely be remembered. As we have pointed out, this Gospel is divided into two main parts. The first part shows the Lord’s coming, and the second part shows the Lord’s going. The Lord’s coming brings God into us by incarnation, and the Lord’s going brings us into God through His death and resurrection. By the Lord’s coming we take Him as life, and by His going He builds us into God. Unless this <span class="pg" data-page-id="348" id="348">[348]</span> matter is clear to us, the real meaning and central thought of this Gospel can never be realized. </p>
<p data-content-id="t85mbqhlppdvhDFBOtHtBJ-RvnuiSAQMtG9rBXOBr1lposGVhLl__LaYVRkVvwPem"> The first section of the Gospel of John, composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73053" data-verses="John 1:1">chapters one through thirteen</span>, shows how Christ as the eternal Word came through incarnation to bring God into man to be the life and the life supply to man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73054" data-verses="John 14:1">Chapter fourteen</span> begins the second major section of this book. We need to be clear that as far as the Lord’s coming to be our life to produce the church is concerned, everything has been completed at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73055" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. If you study this Gospel carefully, you will see that the revelation regarding Christ as life for the producing of the church is fully completed in these thirteen chapters. Do not think that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73056" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen through twenty-one</span> contain a further revelation. No, this portion is a repetition, a development, of what is revealed in the previous thirteen chapters. In the first thirteen chapters we see that the Lord, as the Word of God and the Son of God, came to be life to His disciples that they all might have eternal life and become parts of the church. Although this matter is clear, we are not told the way in which the Lord imparts Himself into us as life. During the three and a half years that the Lord spent with His disciples, He told them that His coming to mankind was for the purpose of being life to people that they might be regenerated with the divine life and become the house of God. Nevertheless, by the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73057" data-verses="John 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> this was still simply a revelation. How could this be carried out? How could the Lord come into His disciples and be their life? Although He spoke about being in them as life, as yet He was only with and among them; He was not yet able to get into them. If we had been there, we probably would have asked Him, “Lord, please tell us how You can be our life. How can we have the divine life? Since the divine life is in God, how can God’s life get into us? Lord, You say that You are the life and that You have come that we might have life and might have it abundantly. But how can we have it? Lord, You have said that we all shall be Your increase, but how can we become Your increase? It seems that You are You and we are we. You are among us, no longer just in the heavens, but still You are You and we are we. How could we be a part of You, <span class="pg" data-page-id="349" id="349">[349]</span> and You be one with us?” If you are a thoughtful person, you will undoubtedly raise such a question. The answer to this question is found in the second section of this Gospel, for the second section is a full development of the revelation found in the first section. Do not think of it as another revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="hXua0_pW3f46EmITg-M0XDvYjnS6MIc9iKH126QEiPABeTlJOgF_otvYI038EQlw6"> Let us now consider the content of this second section. This section, composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73058" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen through twenty-one</span>, shows us Jesus crucified and Christ resurrected going to prepare the way to bring man into God, and as the Spirit coming to abide and live in the believers as their life for the building of God’s habitation. Here we shall see Christ’s going and coming. In His crucifixion and resurrection He went to prepare the way that man might be brought into God. Then as the Spirit He comes to abide and live in the believers as their life for the building of God’s habitation. We need to spend a great deal of time to get into this matter thoroughly. </p>

Regardless of how much time you have spent reading or studying these chapters, I doubt that you have ever seen what is revealed here. Have you ever seen in these chapters the matter of the building of God’s habitation? In a very detailed way, these three chapters unfold that Christ, as the indwelling life, is for the building of God’s habitation. </p>
<p data-content-id="MWwn5_pxNxpNcbAwdbqk_3g76ebi5X3DU0CvvMTPWuJQBSUmbGja3mdoHOKC8EYbl"> Now we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73060" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. This chapter covers a very significant matter: the dispensing of the Triune God for the producing of His abode. Here we see two points: the dispensation of the Triune God and the producing of His abode. Tell me honestly, before reading this message did you ever realize that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73061" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> speaks of the dispensing of the Triune God for the producing of His abode? All three of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are clearly mentioned in this chapter. Although many Christians talk about the Triune God, not many realize that the full revelation of the Triune God is here in this chapter. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73062" data-verses="John 14:1">Chapter fourteen</span> is not only a revelation of the Triune God but a revelation of the dispensing of the Triune God into the believers for the building <span class="pg" data-page-id="350" id="350">[350]</span> of His abode. In this message we shall cover only the first few verses of this chapter. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dVGN5WXLxIx0FItFTa6uQf9hDedsgBGx6cSHcgladGc5IaMSTaHitKZaPlyR-YeoS">I. JESUS GOING THROUGH DEATH<br/>AND CHRIST COMING IN RESURRECTION<br/>TO BRING THE BELIEVERS INTO THE FATHER</h2><p data-content-id="QdS_HMSS3SdGPRtEG7FRQE7srSqMQHxUS3POjiiKGElbtbOCx1j7HNi8K4jPqe1Qb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73063" data-verses="John 14:1-6">14:1-6</span> we see Jesus going through death and Christ coming in resurrection to bring us, the believers, into the Father. This matter is crucial. Please notice that it is not Christ going and Jesus coming, but Jesus going and Christ coming. This does not refer to Jesus’ going to heaven and coming back at the time of the second advent. No, it refers to Jesus’ going through death and Christ coming in resurrection to bring the believers into the Father. This crucial matter is covered in the first six verses of this chapter. </p>
<p data-content-id="KH2K8ov9UbVLXhVOgvjrbqZzrungwARtcHESrqPTSQ7WAQf4Mh3jfx5zndjYHF_CI"> In both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73064" data-verses="John 13:3">13:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73065" data-verses="John 14:2-3">14:2-3</span> we are told of the Lord’s going. At that time the Lord told His disciples that He was going. According to the natural concept, the Lord’s going meant that He was leaving the disciples in order to go some place else. The disciples did not understand what the Lord meant. In fact, for almost two thousand years the saints have misunderstood this chapter. Even today it is not easy to understand what the Lord meant when He said that He was going. Now, by the help of the Holy Spirit, we have found the correct meaning: the Lord was going by death and resurrection. When He said that He was going, He meant that He was going to die and be resurrected. </p>

Many Abodes Being Many Members<br/>of the Body of Christ,<br/>Which Is the Church</h2><p data-content-id="n8WSh8WU2BdpsjVRADNTKrp5SG8QBnYwKIXlL0q3eeAFANq7Mk2tNf7lfC_nB1Vr0"> In the Father’s house are many abodes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73109" data-verses="John 14:2">14:2</span>). The Greek word for <em>abodes</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73110" data-verses="John 14:2">verse 2</span> is the plural form of the word translated <em>abode</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73111" data-verses="John 14:23">verse 23</span>. What does <em>abode</em> mean? The many abodes are the many members of the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73112" data-verses="Romans 12:5">Rom. 12:5</span>), which is God’s temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73113" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16-17">1 Cor. 3:16-17</span>). The Lord’s Body has many members, and each member is an abode. That the many abodes are the many members of the Body is adequately proven by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73114" data-verses="John 14:23">verse 23</span>, which says that the Lord with the Father will make an abode with the one who loves Him. Every lover of Jesus is an abode. We all are the abodes of God’s building. This building is the Body of Christ, and all the abodes are the members of the Body of Christ. </p>

Going through Death and Resurrection<br/>to Bring Man into God<br/>for the Building of God’s Habitation</h2><p data-content-id="RlO-2vedqmdQXARA8964MT2WiHInosSJJl_rxLF7T71PLsdG2vlqt0YIcHtVEPKWx"> The words <em>I go</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73115" data-verses="John 14:2">verse 2</span> mean that the Lord was going through death and resurrection to bring man into God for the building of God’s habitation. This is the building of the church mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73116" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>, where the Lord said, “I will build My church.” Here, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73117" data-verses="John 14:2">verse 2</span>, the Lord says, “I go to prepare a place for you.” Are these two separate things? It is <span class="pg" data-page-id="360" id="360">[360]</span> impossible. The Lord has only one work. He is not going to prepare a place for us in heaven and at the same time building a church on earth. This is not logical. If we put these two portions of the Word together, we shall see that the preparing a place is just the building of the church. In order for the Lord to build the church, He had to go to prepare a place. The consummate result of this will be the building of the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73118" data-verses="Revelation 21:2">Rev. 21:2</span>). The Lord is now building the church. This building of the church is equal to the building of the New Jerusalem. As we have seen, in all the universe God has only one building—the building of His living habitation with His redeemed people. </p>

It means that the Lord would pave the way for us to be in God. This is the central thought of this chapter. If we are going to allow God to dwell in us, we must firstly get into Him. If we do not get into Him, He will not get into us. Once we dwell in God, then He will dwell in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="FrmYRfBZSjDnCrN4uoJEVlXkRWCSzB_rjmbpjuq-YT3hx3woVYQsuazFaPOeRv_-P"> But how can sinful people like us get into God? How can we get into the righteous and holy God? It is impossible. We are a people separated from God. Do you know how far we are from God? It must be a long, long distance. Have you ever measured the distance between you and God? Have you ever counted how many obstacles there are between you and Him? The first obstacle is sin, the second is our many sins, the third is the world, the fourth is the devil, the ruler or prince of the world, and the fifth is death. In addition, the flesh, the self, and the old man also increase the separation between us and God. We are far, far away from God. How can we be brought into Him? How can sinners get into God? All of the separating elements, the obstacles of sin, sins, the world, the devil, death, the flesh, the self, and the old man must be abolished. Then we shall be brought near to God, and not only to God, but into God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="361" id="361">[361]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="CXFd3_7Beuoz4J7tS-OFunfQJa0_7BGOuSsi20bXHzK-QSP-l9xYLfC6UjhBDbvE3"> For this, some work, some preparation, was needed. The Lord had to do a work of preparation. He had to go, not to the heavens, but to the cross to remove all the obstacles. All the obstacles have been removed by the Lord’s all-inclusive death. On the cross the Lord abolished all the barriers between us and God. He dealt with sin, sins, the world, the prince of this world, the flesh, the self, the old man, and even death. By death and resurrection the Lord paved the way and prepared the place that we might be brought into God. I believe that this is the correct meaning of <em>I go to prepare a place for you.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="P_4KtsGyNhSbk86m4nYb-4XDwZ4sTm7hLI0PKhfCaFxOEgwCSzcqA_f6HNvLOq6uZ"> In the United States there are many freeways and highways. The Lord’s death and resurrection have prepared a highway that brings us into God. Before He was crucified, there were many obstacles, many frustrations, that hindered our going into the Father. There was no way to get into Him. But by His death and resurrection, the Lord cut and prepared the way and paved the highway that can bring any person into God immediately. The Lord removed all the mountains, filled all the gaps, paved the highway, and paid all the tolls. There is no charge for us to pay. We may come directly into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="-wcKCKo7UARjQdL8veHzvGMD9JFIhNDZrBP0U3En8T5V9E0iPj-NnoE9Ye4IDqtEN"> By His death and resurrection the Lord has not only opened the way into God but also prepared a standing for us before and in God. Listen to the good tidings: A place before and in God has been prepared for us. As long as we believe in the name of the Lord Jesus, we have a standing before God and in God. We all must shout, “Hallelujah! I have a standing before God. I even have a standing within God. Even God Himself cannot reject me. Oh, because of the preparing work of Christ, the righteous God can never cast me out. I have such a firm standing in God.” I can testify to you that I am so secure about the fact that I am in God. Without the crucified and resurrected Christ we could never have this assurance. But since the Lord has gone through the cross and has been raised from the dead, we know that we have a position before God and a standing in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="piHiQSgOUStVtrqyoGyWTGZ9Yfx9XL-jvmOyYyXYXCi31VAdk39LRDLmD7JuKz1I5"> Do not think that the Lord was going to heaven to prepare a mansion there in heaven so that some day we may go to <span class="pg" data-page-id="362" id="362">[362]</span> heaven and live in that mansion. This thought is too low. It is similar to Buddhism. This thought is held by the teachings of Catholicism and even, to an immense extent, by the teachings of Protestantism also. We all must rid ourselves of this kind of thought, which is similar to that of Buddhism. The Chinese version of the Bible even adopted the phrase <em>the heavenly mansion</em> for <em>heaven</em> in its translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73119" data-verses="Hebrews 9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73120" data-verses="1Peter 3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>. All the Chinese know that the term <em>the heavenly mansion</em> is a Buddhist term. It is a term invented by Buddhism. I am very sorrowful that Christianity has adopted this thought. Catholicism adopted many things from heathenism. This is the leaven spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73121" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">Matthew 13:33</span>, where the Lord told us of the woman putting leaven in the fine flour. The fine flour of this parable denotes the Son of God as the living bread to be our nourishment, and the woman represents the Roman Catholic Church. The leaven that she took is symbolic of the sinful, unclean things, such as paganism and heathenism. The Catholic Church brought paganism into the doctrines and teachings concerning Christ. This thought of going to live in a heavenly mansion is a kind of leaven in the fine flour. </p>

The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73137" data-verses="John 14:7-14">vv. 7-14</span>), and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73138" data-verses="John 14:16-20">vv. 16-20</span>). In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, and as the Spirit the Son is revealed and realized. The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers. God the Father is hidden, God the Son is manifested among man, and God the Spirit, entering into man to be his life, his life supply, and his everything, is realized within man.

<p data-content-id="Gx0vCOm6GtVjihAwYJts_oAqXBmKh5IqFjM4fTWKvX8bE_WTVKQYXTJ_fmTiGywyV"> When the Lord said that He was the way and that He was going to bring the believers into the Father, Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73139" data-verses="John 14:8">v. 8</span>). The Lord replied, “Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73140" data-verses="John 14:9-10">vv. 9-10</span>). The Lord seemed to be saying, “I have been with you for three and a half years and all this time you have been seeing Me, and still you have not known the Father? Don’t you know that if you see Me, you see the Father, that if you know Me, you know the Father? I am in the Father and the Father is in Me.” Even up until this very moment, the Lord’s word here remains a mystery. What does it mean? On the one hand it means that the Father and the Son are just one and on the other hand that They are still two. If you were to ask me how this could be, I would say, “I don’t know. I know only that on the one hand the Father and the Son are one, that if you see the one then you see the other because the two are one. The Father is in the Son. If you see the Son, then surely you see the Father. But, on the other hand, They are still two.” This is the mystery of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="cYGn4xmNBVjFrfZmUDYvwaNm_9fxL63wVykF5p86Aez0RDjJtznd2riwP4UqqLC1-"> Here I must issue a warning: Never consider that the Father and the Son are two separate gods. That is heresy. We do not have three gods. We have one unique Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. At this point I am even careful not to use the word <em>person.</em> Although sometimes, for our speaking and understanding, we use the word <em>person,</em> we should not press this term too far into tritheism. We cannot explain the Triune God adequately, but it is a fact that God is triune. If you have seen the Son, you have seen the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son to be seen among the believers. The Son is the embodiment and the expression of the Father. <span class="pg" data-page-id="369" id="369">[369]</span> </p>

What a mystery this is! The Lord says that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son! Since the Father is in the Son, when the Son speaks, the Father, who abides in the Son, does His work. The Father does His work in the Son’s speaking because They are in one another. </p>

Again I say, we cannot explain this matter adequately because it is very difficult for our limited mentality to understand how They two could be one. In our limited understanding, the Son is the Son, the Father is the Father, and the two are distinctly separate one from the other. But the Lord tells us clearly that the Son and the Father are one. Here I strongly say that the Lord never says that He and the Father are two. We have to take the mystery of the Trinity according to the Lord’s definite and clear word, not according to our suppositions. </p>

This verse says, “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.” A son is given, yet His name is called the everlasting Father, just as a child is born, yet He is called the mighty God. Is He the Son or the Father? We must say that He is both, just as He is both the child and the mighty God. How can the Son be the Father? I do not know. I know only that the Bible tells me so. Praise the Lord that the Bible tells us that the Son is called the Father, just as the Bible tells us that the child is called the mighty God. Therefore, according to the clear word of the Bible, the Son is the Father. None of us should be a Philip. But at that time even Philip was made clear. <span class="pg" data-page-id="370" id="370">[370]</span> </p>

Since He was the embodiment of the Father in the flesh, He was among the disciples to express the Father and to be seen by them. But while He was in the flesh, He had no way to enter into the disciples. So there is the need of the following section of this chapter, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73144" data-verses="John 14:16-20">verses 16 through 20</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="t85mbqhlppdvhDFBPvHtFbeRvnuiSAQMtG9rBXOBr1lposGVhLl__LaYVRkVvwPem">B.

Now we must see that the Son is realized as the Spirit entering into and abiding in the believers. Notice that we do not say in the Spirit but as the Spirit. In order to abide in us the Lord had to be transfigured, transformed, from the flesh into the Spirit. He came in the flesh to be among us, but He had to be transfigured into the Spirit before He could come into us. After coming in the flesh to be among us, His next aim was to be in us. How was the Lord transfigured? He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit by His death and resurrection. His going was not His leaving; it was another step of His coming. He was coming in another form, in the form of the Spirit. The first step of His coming was in the flesh; the second step of His coming was as the Spirit. This chapter has the Lord’s going and it also has His coming. His going was by death and resurrection, and His coming was as “another Comforter.” The other Comforter is His other form, His other figure. By His coming as the Spirit, He enters into us and makes us to live just as He does. The life He lives is the resurrection life. After His resurrection He comes to enter into us as the Spirit. So He lives, and we live by Him also. He lives by the resurrection life, and we live by Him, sharing Him as the resurrection life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="371" id="371">[371]</span> </p>

This chapter unfolds that the Triune God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, is dispensing Himself into the believers in Jesus Christ; that this very God and the believers are being built together, a building of divinity with humanity; that eventually this building becomes a mutual abode; and that God dwells in man and man in God. This is the basis for the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73188" data-verses="John 15:4">15:4</span>, “Abide in Me and I in you.” This is a mutual abiding, for we abide in Him and He abides in us. For the sake of this mutual abiding there is a mutual abode. How could we have the abiding without the abode? Although the mutual abiding is clearly revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73189" data-verses="John 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, where is the mutual abode?

The King James Version translated the Greek word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73198" data-verses="John 14:2">verse 2</span> as “mansions” instead of <em>abodes.</em> This translation has caused a great deal of trouble. Please be impressed that the abode is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73199" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> and that the abiding is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73200" data-verses="John 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>. First, we need an abode. Then we can have the abiding. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xzji_1UPvRreQsGaysBGNfXah9uQPwAkM0FbIvQrU7oMHeCL0a9Zt9q1Aoejnd4aw"> Nearly all Christians talk about the abiding in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73201" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> without realizing where the abode is, where it comes from, or how it is formed. Although there is the clear word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73202" data-verses="John 15:4">15:4</span> which says, “Abide in Me and I in you,” where is the abode and how was it formed? The abode is found in the foregoing chapter, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73203" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, and it is formed by the Triune God dispensing Himself into the believers. In this way He and the believers, divinity and humanity, are built together into one. </p>
<p data-content-id="knc2QAb9j4ccOXQibbOK4pg8PHO2T2KEihEStNALFHfsjrXJj2BXpKDG5-NN3oTu8"> As we have seen, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73204" data-verses="John 14:1-6">14:1-6</span> tells us that the Lord Jesus was going to prepare a place for us. Now we understand that He was not going to prepare a mansion in heaven. No, He was going to cut the way and prepare the standing for us to get into God. We must be very clear about this. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73205" data-verses="John 14:6">verse 6</span> the Lord Jesus said that He was the way and that the Father was the destination. He was saying that He was the way for us to come to the Father. So the way is a living person, and the destination must also be a living person. The Son is the way to bring us to the Father as the destination. </p>
<p data-content-id="J4tx36WD8sSYvG3X2n63aprwvrh2fuKH6QNE9Gs4JzvDXVEmUt3P5UvoURVrInZGe"> Beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73206" data-verses="John 14:7">14:7</span> the Lord Jesus goes on to tell us how we can get into the Father. In order to get into the Father, we need to get into the Son because He is in the Father. Once we get into Him, spontaneously we are in the Father. The Lord said that He was going to prepare a place for us so that where He is there we also may be. Where is He? He is in the Father. But when He spoke these words, we were not in the Father. Therefore, He was going to do all that was necessary to bring us to the very place where He is. That place is not a physical place; it is a person, the Father. He was in the Father and He was going to bring us into Himself. Since He is in the Father, once we get into Him, we shall also be in the Father. So, eventually, where He is, there we also may be. Now we are able to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73207" data-verses="John 14:20">14:20</span>, which says, “In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in <span class="pg" data-page-id="379" id="379">[379]</span> you.” This is the mingling of divinity with humanity. This mingling of divinity with humanity is the mutual abode. God dwells in man and man dwells in God. God abides in man and man abides in God. This is the mutual abode, the mutual abiding. This is the central thought of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73208" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="2Q5ugYZO8sPp0OavxXk7YwK3TFSV7Nsfngw8PljfG3IHcn7hxi9igE-N15TGlXeJl"> As we have seen, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73209" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> the Father is the source, origin, essence, and element. The Son is the expression, manifestation, and embodiment of all that the Father is. Without the Son, the Father cannot be seen, but with the Son, the Father is embodied, manifested, expressed, and seen among men. Men can see the Son. As long as they see the Son, they see the Father, for the Father is embodied in the Son. But before His death and resurrection the Son still could not get into man. He could be among men and be seen by them, but He could not enter into them. Therefore, the Son had to go to the cross and pass through the process of death and resurrection. By being processed through death and resurrection, the Son has had His form transfigured. He has been transfigured from the form of the flesh into the form of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="ukeBrlETbXJ-IG3cZ3SPtEbbNDo45cevyTWorYeIAd3f0-tCeAa1VKDztLfP8v9yK"> This resembles the transfiguration of a large watermelon into juice through the process of cutting and pressing. As a result of this process, the juice can easily enter into anyone. Before the Lord was processed in this way, the Spirit was “not yet” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73210" data-verses="John 7:39">7:39</span>), but after this process, the Spirit of life is here. In like manner, before the watermelon was processed, the juice was “not yet.” There was only a large melon. But after the process, we have watermelon juice for drinking. </p>
<p data-content-id="fdMBmskAexpdwW2ww0SDlFkynDv29Co6M5pbGhMnLA0lgGhFaxHSuJlcbe7THuX3M"> What is the Spirit? It is the reality, the realization, of all that God the Father and God the Son are. Whatever the Father and the Son are is realized in the Spirit. This Spirit reaches us, enters into us, and abides in us. In this way the Triune God is dispensed into us. By this dispensing we all can know that the Son is in the Father, that we are in the Son, and that the Son is in us. He and we, we and He, become a mingled entity. This mingled entity is the mutual abode of divinity and humanity. With this abode there is the mutual abiding. We abide in Him and He abides in us. This is God’s dispensation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> </p>

When the Son spoke, the Father worked. I mention this to show you that the Father is the source and that the Son is the expression.

<p data-content-id="8DJXQ5Z5MNoL38Tw5rB3i_CGTNIKyqqegEmV6n4XFlp5EG2WvIw21JD6sbOEnoo2p"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73249" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>. We should not consider this chapter separate from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73250" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73251" data-verses="John 16:1">sixteen</span> because all three chapters are one message given by the Lord Jesus before He was betrayed and arrested. There is no doubt that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73252" data-verses="John 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> is the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73253" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>, where we see the mutual abode, the mingling of divinity with humanity. Once we understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73254" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span>, we are prepared to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73255" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="0qg4Xe6SXa0i7DIirQvBurh0kmjnUFXxSvp-5BeODfOoXLrE4iTl60302dFOLF8PT"> Most Christians are very familiar with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73256" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>, a wonderful chapter about the Lord as the vine and us as the branches. Apparently, it is easy for us to understand this chapter because we know what a vine is, what branches are, and what the relationship between a vine and its branches is. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73257" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> is possibly the deepest chapter in the New Testament. If we are to properly and adequately understand the deeper meaning of this chapter, we must understand the central thought of God and the intention of the Holy Spirit in writing the Gospel of John. This Gospel reveals that the Lord Jesus is the expression of God, that He is the very God expressed in the form of man. He was expressed in this way that we might take Him as our life and our everything. His intention is to work Himself into us until He becomes our life and everything. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73258" data-verses="John 3:1">Chapters three through eleven</span> reveal that He can meet all of our needs by becoming our life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73259" data-verses="John 12:1">Chapter twelve</span> shows us the issue and multiplication of His being life to us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73260" data-verses="John 13:1">Chapter thirteen</span> indicates the way to maintain our <span class="pg" data-page-id="392" id="392">[392]</span> fellowship in life. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73261" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> unfolds to us that He can work Himself into us by His death and resurrection and by His being transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. By the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73262" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> He has wrought Himself into us through the Spirit of reality. Now He is our life and our essence. He is living within us, waiting for us to cooperate with Him that He might reveal and manifest Himself to us more and more. The Father also comes in with Him to visit us, stay with us, and make His abode with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73263" data-verses="John 14:23">14:23</span>). In other words, the Father in Him and through the Spirit will be absolutely mingled with us. The Father in the Son and through the Spirit will be our abode, and we shall be the abode of the Triune God. In this way, the Triune God and we, we and the Triune God, will be built together, that is, God and man, man and God, will be built up together as one. This wonderful oneness is the central thought of God. The ultimate intention of God in the whole universe is that the Father in the Son as the Spirit might be wrought into us and mingled with us until the Triune God and humanity become a mutual abode. We have seen this in our study of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73264" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. This is the background of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73265" data-verses="John 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="7fkTGT1KmmDoykHck5usR_exLLBusIlFpNkxlpqD2Abt5CGw7IP8GFtf4BNL-5J_z"> The revelation of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73266" data-verses="John 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> is meaningful, profound, and all-inclusive. The thought and meaning of this revelation are very deep. The first thing to be pointed out in this chapter is that the Triune God is clearly revealed. God the Father is revealed as the husbandman who is related to a husbandry, a plantation, or a harvest. A husbandman is the source, the originator, the founder, and the planter of a husbandry. He is one who engages in an enterprise. The whole universe is the enterprise of the Father. In other words, the Father has a divine plan, an eternal purpose, and He wants to accomplish the intention behind His purpose. This is what is meant by the Father’s being the husbandman. He is the husbandman of the vineyard who plans to carry out a certain purpose. He is the source, the founder, and the first one to accomplish certain things according to His mind and purpose. Furthermore, as the details found in other parts of the Scriptures disclose, it is the Father’s pleasure that all that He is, all the riches of His divine nature, and all the fullness of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="393" id="393">[393]</span> Godhead be the riches of the vine. All that the Father is, all that the Father has, all the riches of the Father’s divine life, and all the fullness of the Godhead are in the vine. This is all for the vine which is the embodiment of it all. The vine is the embodiment of the fullness of the riches of divinity and of the Godhead. All that God the Father is and has is embodied in the vine. </p>
<p data-content-id="_c-31afrsqWhR9jEAp-3L6dcuMq9xLD-ecnr7fV1PZOouCe3G2hx5BHraOpAV5inS"> This chapter not only reveals the Father but also the Son as the vine. As the vine, the Son is the center. The whole universe is pictured as a vineyard, and centered in this vineyard is the vine who is the Son. God the Son is the center. Everything is centralized in Him. He, as the vine, is the center of the vineyard. We have seen that God the Father is the source and founder, and now we see that God the Son is the center. Everything that God the Father is and has is for the center, is embodied in the center, and is expressed through the center. God the Father is expressed, manifested, and glorified through the vine. So God the Father is the source, and God the Son is the center. </p>
<p data-content-id="BIN7s6C3jIrwhmOtGj5QO3p98HXXDvzIG873PQJvi9ygFduggN23Zk5vk4njinT-6"> Finally, in the last two verses of this chapter the Spirit is revealed. Here God the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality. This means that the Spirit is the reality. Whatever God the Father is in the Son and whatever He has centralized in the Son will be realized by the Spirit. All that God the Father is in the Son is a reality in God the Spirit. Everything centralized in the Son is revealed, testified, witnessed, and realized by the Spirit of reality. Therefore, God the Father is the source, the founder; God the Son is the center, the embodiment, and the manifestation; and God the Spirit is the realization, the reality. This is exceedingly profound and deep. </p>
<p data-content-id="5w-j5wr_UufC5LfaHzrLY0gNbg8EjHeZRqKuWbOgeqQ6qwIVYLcWYffP9g4uA2B9B"> Moreover, in this revelation there is not only the Triune God but also the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the church. In this revelation the church is likened to the branches of the vine. The branches of a vine are simply the body of the vine. If you take away the branches from the vine, the vine will have no body. Without the branches the vine has nothing remaining except the root and the stem. Hence, the branches are the body of the vine. <span class="pg" data-page-id="394" id="394">[394]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="N4fmiTCMCnn3CkIWWNWYtwfDgyhJ12fvZLXKozkGfvmkz7BV-BxJS1lJhf9hBkG1i"> If we look to the Lord, we shall see what a wonderful and mysterious matter this is. All that God the Father is and has is centralized and embodied in God the Son, and all of this is realized in God the Spirit. Now all of this has been wrought into us and will be expressed and testified through us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73267" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> has four very important items: God the Father as the source and founder, God the Son as the center and manifestation, God the Spirit as the reality and realization, and the branches as the Body, the corporate expression. The branches are very vital, for they express what God is in Christ as the Spirit. Without the branches there can be no full expression. The full expression depends upon the branches, the Body, for what God is in the Son and as the Spirit will be expressed by the branches, the Body. All that God the Father is and has is in the Son, all that the Son is and has is realized as the Spirit, and all that the Spirit has is in the Body, in the church, in us. In other words, God the Father as the source is embodied in God the Son as the center who is now realized as God the Spirit as the reality. All that the Spirit has is expressed in us, that is, in the branches, the church. The Triune God is expressed, manifested, and glorified in the church. </p>

<p data-content-id="4TUau6dLXXRywSAVI06AoYPlFrgTjOpy_3LINqVcTISbRAG_tv46RgQoE2WRrdCmW"> As we pointed out in the last message, if we are to abide in the vine, we must see the fact that we are the branches in the vine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73308" data-verses="John 15:5">v. 5</span>). Our abiding in Christ depends upon a clear vision that we are branches in the vine. If we see that we are already in Him, then we shall be able to abide in Him. We will not want to stay away from Him. </p>

Any insulation will separate us from the rich supply of the vine tree. A little disobedience, a sin, or even a sinful thought can be the insulation that separates us from the riches of the vine. If we do not condemn such things but hold on to them, they will insulate us from the rich supply of the vine tree. First, we must see that we are branches. Then we need to maintain the fellowship between us and the Lord. Nothing should be between Him and us. There is a hymn in our hymnal that opens with the words <em>Nothing between, Lord, nothing between.</em> From experience we know that even a small thing can insulate us from the rich supply of the vine tree. We <span class="pg" data-page-id="408" id="408">[408]</span> need to pray to the Lord, “Lord, let there be nothing between You and me separating me from Your rich supply.” </p>

To Let the Son Abide in Us</h2><p data-content-id="a9NrvhD6wW1hRS7-jmwmrDF1fb7DU8q1AZlxJz81s5YFPu5MILIeqJhyavV3tDNAj"> We need to let the Son abide in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73309" data-verses="John 15:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>). This is very meaningful. We abide in Him and He abides in us. But many times we do not give Him the ground, the space, to abide in us. The Lord desires to spread His abiding within us. However, we like to narrow down His abiding. We restrict Him. There is constantly a gentle struggle between the abiding Christ and us. While Christ’s abiding is gradually spreading within us, there is something within that restricts this abiding Christ. The abiding Christ wants to gain more ground gradually, even inch by inch. But sometimes there is a struggle over His gaining even one inch. Christ wants to gain another inch, but we restrict Him from doing so. As a result, we bargain with Him. If you do not bargain with the Lord, you must be a Christian in the third heaven. Probably even today many of us have bargained with Him. Although we have shouted, “We have been ruined by Him,” still within us we may say, “Lord Jesus, I will give You just this much. I can’t afford to give You more space. Lord, have mercy on me. Be patient until I am ready to give You another half an inch. Until then, Lord, stay where You are.” Although we may not say this audibly, many times we have this thought deep within us. The Lord may say, “I would like to take another five inches.” Then you begin to bargain with Him once more. After this, He remains silent, turning His face aside. He refuses to talk to you anymore, and you lose His presence. Although you gained the ground, the five inches that the Lord wanted, you lost His presence. Oh, how we need to keep our fellowship with Him and be willing to allow Him to take more ground and to expand within us! May we allow the Lord to spread Himself within us, taking as much ground as He wants. If we do this, we shall have the real growth of life. We shall see the growth of life within. </p>
<p data-content-id="btOmTWeLFFpscfgnPx8K5BYbahrI2rT3IwVxeSAiE7B_1vo4eGvaKTJstwR_ZClRW"> Why do so many of the saints scarcely grow in life? Simply because they do not allow the Lord to spread within them. There may be no insulation, but there is too much limitation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="409" id="409">[409]</span> This matter of abiding is very delicate and tender. Please keep in mind that we must take care of two things—not to have any insulation and not to have any limitation. It is easier to eliminate the insulation than it is to remove the limitation. I am afraid that even as you read this message you may not be ready to take away every limitation. Praise the Lord that He is patient and kind. He will never leave you. He is waiting. At the most, He will turn His face aside. That is all that He will do. But He will stay here. May we look to Him for mercy and grace that we may always give Him the ground to expand within us, allowing Him to spread into every corner and avenue of our inner being. This is the way to have the growth in life. </p>

Apart from the Son We Can Do Nothing</h2><p data-content-id="ycRAO1PQyck3vYSrWAa6uXAApQRQUIW1z8hRVBub6MifAsRtiq85jQsSkWApHYCbK"> Apart from the Son we can do nothing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73310" data-verses="John 15:5">v. 5</span>). A branch of a vine cannot live by itself, for it will wither and die apart from the vine. The relationship between the branches and the vine pictures the relationship between us and the Lord. We are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing apart from Him. What we are, what we have, and what we do must be only in the Lord and by the Lord in us. It is very important for us to abide in the Lord and for the Lord to abide in us. Otherwise, we shall be finished and be nothing. Apart from Him we are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing. Since we are the branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="8DJXQ5Z5MNoL38Tw5qx3msyGTNIKyqqegEmV6n4XFlp5EG2WvIw21JD6sbOEnoo2p">5. To Let the Son’s Instant Words Abide in Us</h2><p data-content-id="0qg4Xe6SXa0i7DIirRfBp4h0kmjnUFXxSvp-5BeODfOoXLrE4iTl60302dFOLF8PT"> As we abide in the Lord, we must allow His words to abide in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73311" data-verses="John 15:7">v. 7</span>). The Greek word for <em>words</em> in this verse is <em>rhema,</em> meaning the instant and present spoken word. To let the Lord’s instant words abide in us is quite demanding. The Son desires to spread His abiding in us. As He abides in us, He is always speaking. This speaking is the rhema, the instant word. He speaks mainly one word to us—no. However, at times His speaking is a requirement or a demand. How we need to love Him and keep His instant words! When He speaks the instant rhema, we must listen to it and keep it. If <span class="pg" data-page-id="410" id="410">[410]</span> we do not keep this instant word, we shall immediately be cut off from the fellowship. But if we do keep it, we shall absorb all of the riches of His fullness, of His life, and have an overflow of life for fruit-bearing. </p>
<p data-content-id="7fkTGT1KmmDoykHck4esXsOxLLBusIlFpNkxlpqD2Abt5CGw7IP8GFtf4BNL-5J_z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73312" data-verses="John 15:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> the Lord tells us that He abides in us, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73313" data-verses="John 15:7">verse 7</span> He changes the wording a little to say that His words abide in us. Instead of Christ Himself abiding in us, now it is His words abiding in us. Why did the Lord change “Abide in Me and I in you” to “Abide in Me and My words abide in you”? It is because the Lord’s abiding by itself is too mysterious and too objective. Just to say that the Lord abides in us is something that is too far beyond us. For example, when the Lord told the Jewish people that He is the food and the bread of life and that people can eat and feed on Him as the living food and the living bread, the Jews were astonished and surprised, being unable to understand. They asked themselves what it meant to eat and feed on Him. Then the Lord Jesus told them that His flesh is the real meat and His blood is the real drink (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73314" data-verses="John 6:55">6:55</span>). The Lord simply meant that He had to die, for His blood had to be separated from His flesh. He had to die so that He could impart Himself to us through death and resurrection. The Lord said all of this in view of the background of the Jewish Passover. During the Passover the Jews always slew the lamb, sprinkled its blood on the doorpost, and fed upon its flesh. Knowing that the Jews had such a background, the Lord intended that they should understand what He said. Hence, the Lord said that His flesh is eatable and His blood drinkable. Nevertheless, they could not understand and asked one another how this man could give them His flesh to eat. Then the Lord pointed out to them that the flesh profits nothing, that it is the Spirit who gives life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73315" data-verses="John 6:63">6:63</span>). The Lord even said that the words that He speaks are spirit and life. </p>

THE BRANCHES LOVING ONE ANOTHER<br/>TO EXPRESS THE DIVINE LIFE IN FRUIT-BEARING</h2><p data-content-id="gXvFaTgxHGUO-rzGwe7Zspb1l8PodFDz2DYGuF1ZGVlt-c2zGVtRXg1oF_kS85QlB"> We have covered the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73334" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73335" data-verses="John 15:1-11">verses 1 through 11</span>, which shows the relationship between us and the Lord. The second part, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73336" data-verses="John 15:12-17">verses 12 through 17</span>, shows our relationship with one another. In this part of the chapter we see that the branches should love one another to express the divine life in fruit-bearing. These verses reveal that fruit-bearing has very much to do with our loving one another. We must keep a right relationship with one another in life, that is, in love by life. We must keep our relationship in love and love one another by the life that is in us. This life is the Lord Himself. Loving one another is the church life, the Body life. The Body life is a life of love and a life in love. We should not love one another with a human love but in the divine life and with the divine love. </p>
<p data-content-id="e1F2-TvVX-Wo06SOnAChlvB0AkxrzvfUAe3pb0V0IGQJ7M_YNjzT3VkMpObkgjnuy"> We are not branches of many separate trees; we are all branches of the same tree. So we need to maintain a good fellowship with all the other branches as well as with the tree. This is why in this chapter the Lord also tells us to love one another (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73337" data-verses="John 15:12">vv. 12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73338" data-verses="John 15:17">17</span>). If we do not love one another, it will be very difficult to bear fruit. If we do not love one another, it means that our fellowship with the vine tree has been cut off. Therefore, there is no way for us to bear fruit. In order to bear fruit we must love one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="5w-j5wr_UufC5LfaHyLLRmANbg8EjHeZRqKuWbOgeqQ6qwIVYLcWYffP9g4uA2B9B"> The life within all of us is one life. The life in you is exactly <span class="pg" data-page-id="420" id="420">[420]</span> the same as the life in me. This resembles the circulation of the blood in our physical body. The blood in our body circulates through every member of our body. In like manner, the inner life of all the branches is one. This life should continually circulate through all the branches. Then all the branches will be so living and filled with the riches of life in order to bear fruit. </p>

The branches are not the Lord’s slaves; they are His friends. Because they are the Lord’s friends, the branches can know the Father’s desire that He be expressed in a corporate Body. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73340" data-verses="John 15:16">verse 16</span> the Lord said, “You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.” The King James Version uses the word <em>ordained</em> instead of <em>appointed.</em> I like the term <em>ordained.</em> We all have been ordained. To be ordained means to be appointed. <em>Ordained</em> is an old-fashioned word for the modern word <em>appointed.</em> All of the sisters, including the younger sisters, must realize that they have been ordained. Do you know that we all have been ordained? We have been ordained to bear fruit. Do not say that you are too young for this. Regardless of how young you may be, you have been chosen and ordained to bear remaining fruit. </p>
<p data-content-id="65XEpihaZD6ISNAVJ7qJxxFYFIvvJdVmQZ8Nms4k0sV2bawyzQ5gp4-b5hMWcG5LI"> In this chapter there are four ways of referring to the fruit: bearing fruit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73341" data-verses="John 15:2">v. 2</span>), much fruit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73342" data-verses="John 15:8">v. 8</span>), more fruit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73343" data-verses="John 15:2">v. 2</span>), and remaining fruit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73344" data-verses="John 15:16">v. 16</span>). How long the fruit remains depends <span class="pg" data-page-id="421" id="421">[421]</span> on how much life we impart into it. It all depends upon the amount of life we impart into the new converts. This determines how long they will remain. Often in bringing people to the Lord we impart into them only a small amount of life. Therefore, they scarcely remain. It is difficult for them to remain for a longer time. </p>

When we pray for fruit-bearing, we must pray in the Son’s name. To ask in the Lord’s name requires us to abide in the Lord and to let Him and His words abide in us that we may actually be one with Him. Then our asking will be His asking. This kind of asking is related to the fruit-bearing and surely will be answered by the Father. As we pray in this way, we must claim that we are one with the Son. We should not beg but rather claim that we are one with Him. Whatever the Son is and has is ours, and we are in His name. Pray in this way. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="wdYDXrVTBi16uQIJEcAKB-fFAbXHIhsQrac_ssNkW8MNVZd8_yYP9-uGMvsFev98q">2.

This matter is very crucial. Our prayer depends upon our living. We must be one with the Lord in our living. Then we can be one with Him in our prayer and pray in His name. It is by this kind of living and prayer that we can bear fruit that can remain. </p>

We need to love one another in the Lord’s life, the divine life, in the Lord’s love, and in His commission of fruit-bearing. Life is the source, love is the condition, and fruit-bearing is the goal. If we all live by the Lord’s life as the source, in the Lord’s love as the condition, and for fruit-bearing as the goal, we surely will love one another. Having different sources of life, <span class="pg" data-page-id="422" id="422">[422]</span> different conditions, or different goals will separate us and prevent us from loving one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="ArkzpradNTw3GL-xu8UsQyJle4mOhZEhE3jL4qTNcdMIIImpgNveMgKcBQ6CboAjM"> Christians are fond of talking about loving one another. If we love one another in our human life, that will bring in death. If we love one another in an emotional way or for our own purpose, that also will result in death. We must love one another in the life of Christ, in the love of Christ, and in the commission of Christ. We must not love one another in our natural life, with our emotions, or for our own purpose. We must love one another in the divine life, with the divine love, and for the purpose of bearing much fruit that the Father may be glorified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73345" data-verses="John 15:8">v. 8</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="idWE0reFGaAWAlr_nbhPhpmCTiqbcPOP0DvCKdvLJMaSDuuVJK3S-muAf0I_c0Lu5"> If we are clear about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73377" data-verses="John 14:1-2">John 14 and 15</span>, it will be easy to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73378" data-verses="John 16:1">John 16</span>. Basically, nothing is new in this chapter. In the previous two chapters, the Lord has already covered the main principles. By reading and comparing these three chapters, it seems as if the Lord is repeating Himself. Although the utterances are changed, the basic principles are still the same. Thus, as we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73379" data-verses="John 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, we must remember the main principles that the Lord dealt with in the previous chapters. Before we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73380" data-verses="John 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, let us review these principles. </p>
<p data-content-id="10MJntexVw9mtYnMxZ7g2xDXBkYBi4_k9Sj8fkt-_KQkx6FVLKr6wXK38c_eWnUfc"> The first main principle is that the Lord had to go, meaning that He had to die and be resurrected. His going did not mean that He was leaving the disciples. His going was His coming. He was coming in another step. By going to die and to be resurrected, He was taking another step in His coming. The first step of the Lord’s coming was by incarnation that He might be able to be with us and among us. But at that time He was still unable to come into us. His first step of incarnation was the means by which the eternal God became a man in order to contact us. But a second step was necessary before He was able to come into us and be mingled with us. That step was His death and resurrection. It was by His death and resurrection that He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. His flesh was the form by which He came to be with and among us, but the Spirit is His other <span class="pg" data-page-id="430" id="430">[430]</span> form by which He comes into us and is mingled with us. This is the first main point that the Lord dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73381" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73382" data-verses="John 15:1">fifteen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="9S6bAz339mYziRGeg9oHmxyxJB4XTlUEwBDRLoFRB3ON6PAI2cNs0NusS0QT3DlqC"> The second main principle is that the Lord went through death that He might return in resurrection as the Spirit of reality. All that the Lord is can be realized by the Spirit. If we have only the teachings, doctrines, and letters about the Lord without the Spirit, we do not have the reality. Doctrinal teaching about the Lord is not reality. The reality of the Lord is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the reality of the Lord. For example, we know that the Lord is life. But if we do not have the Holy Spirit, we can never have life. Since the Holy Spirit is the reality of Christ, we can have the reality of Christ by having the Holy Spirit. Then we have life. Furthermore, we know that the Lord is light. To have the Holy Spirit is to have light. If we do not have the Holy Spirit, we do not have light. The Lord is also the way. If we have the Holy Spirit, we have the way and we know how to do everything. However, if we do not have the Holy Spirit but have only doctrinal teachings, we do not have the real way. The reality of Christ is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of reality. The coming of the Spirit of reality means the coming of the reality of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="jynNWp5yBJT7WjSB72e3GR5AJZ6z_-jTV1Xn0ETcxUCUGJkuR0mN5gJVD82YVb2pv"> The third basic principle in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73383" data-verses="John 14:1-2">John 14 and 15</span> is the mutual abode. By the coming of Christ as the Spirit of reality, He will abide in us and we will abide in Him. He and we, we and He, will thus become a mutual abode. We will be the abode to the Father in the Son as the Spirit, and the Triune God will be the abode to us. We can abide in the Triune God, and the Triune God can abide in us. In this way, the Triune God mingles Himself with us. Humanity and divinity, divinity and humanity, are mingled together as one. This is the central thought of these two chapters. In fact, this is the main thought, the basic principle, of the divine intention. It is the mystery of the whole universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="TwQlMH4WYSvmZBpvXGnAcYO6we6-xicmxEL3iHsGvInd9AHz0HO8m2UzNBdzAcSKQ"> It is difficult for many brothers and sisters to see this matter of the mingling of divinity with humanity. Time after time, I have prayed and looked to the Lord that He would reveal this to the saints. The concept of the mingling of God <span class="pg" data-page-id="431" id="431">[431]</span> with man is contrary to the human concept. Some revelation and heavenly vision are needed before the eyes of our spirit, heart, and mind can be opened to see this mystery. This mystery of God’s mingling Himself with humanity is more real than you are. It is the central and basic thought of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73384" data-verses="John 14:1-16">John 14 through 16</span>. In these three chapters the Lord deals mainly with this one matter: that the Father in the Son as the Spirit has come into us to mingle Himself with us and to make us an abode to Him and Him an abode to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="_c-31afrsqWhR9jEAou3Co9cuMq9xLD-ecnr7fV1PZOouCe3G2hx5BHraOpAV5inS"> When the Lord first showed this to me, I was very excited, because I realized that I had received the Triune God and that He was mingled with me. This is God’s economy. It is not a religion nor a doctrinal teaching; it is the Triune God mingled with humanity. These three chapters of the Gospel of John simply reveal what God’s economy really is to us: it is the Father in the Son as the Spirit coming into us and mingling Himself with us. This basic principle needs to be repeated again and again until we are deeply impressed. </p>

He said that if He did not go, the Spirit would not come.

According to this chapter the work of the Spirit is in three categories: to convict the world; to glorify the Son by revealing Him with the fullness of the Father to the believers; and to disclose what is to come. John’s writings are also of three categories: the Gospel, the Epistles, and the Revelation. His Gospel is mainly to preach the gospel and convict the world, his Epistles are mainly to reveal the Son with the fullness of the Father, and his Revelation is the book unveiling all the things to come in the future. </p>

To convict people is the work of the Spirit in winning, quickening, and regenerating sinners. But the work of the Spirit involves much more than this. The second category of the Spirit’s work is to glorify the Son by revealing Him with the fullness of the Father to the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73441" data-verses="John 16:12-15">16:12-15</span>). We may say that the first category of the Spirit’s work is to bring people in, and that the second category is to edify the believers and build them up by revealing the Son with the fullness of the Father to them. This is the building work of the Holy Spirit. The first category of the Spirit’s work is to convince sinners to repent, believe, and be regenerated. The second category is the Holy Spirit’s dwelling in the regenerated believers to reveal Christ, to glorify Christ, and to make Christ real in the believers. </p>

He makes all that Christ is and has real to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="P_4KtsGyNhSbk86m4mob-5XDwZ4sTm7hLI0PKhfCaFxOEgwCSzcqA_f6HNvLOq6uZ"> Let us now consider some examples of how the Spirit makes God in Christ real to us. The Bible says that God is light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73447" data-verses="1John 1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). The Bible also says that Christ is light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73448" data-verses="John 8:12">John 8:12</span>). This means that the very light, which is God Himself, is the Son. But how can this light be realized? How can it be real to us? It is realized through the Spirit. When the Spirit moves within us, the light is shining. The light is both the Father and the Son. The Father is the source and the essence of light, and the Son is the embodiment and expression of this light. We realize this light in actuality by the Spirit. When the Spirit moves within us, He is the reality of light. </p>
<p data-content-id="-wcKCKo7UARjQdL8vf3zvFMD9JFIhNDZrBP0U3En8T5V9E0iPj-NnoE9Ye4IDqtEN"> The same is true with the matter of life. God is life. The Son also is life. God the Father is the source and the essence of life, and the Son is the embodiment and expression of this life. How can this life be ours? By the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73449" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> says that the Spirit is the Spirit of life. When the Spirit moves within us, He is not only the shining and enlightening light but also the very life which enlivens, nourishes, and strengthens us. </p>
<p data-content-id="piHiQSgOUStVtrqyoHCWTFZ9Yfx9XL-jvmOyYyXYXCi31VAdk39LRDLmD7JuKz1I5"> The Spirit is the reality of all that the Father and the Son are. Without the Spirit there is the essence of what the Father and Son are, but there is no realization. Take the example of electricity. Although we may have electricity, it still needs to be applied for a specific purpose. That application of electricity is the realization of the electricity. Likewise, the Spirit is the application of all that the Father and the Son are. Without the Spirit as the realization and application, everything may be real, but it is not available or applicable. If we would apply all that God and Christ are, we need the Spirit. We must praise the Lord that today He is not only the Father and the Son but also the Spirit. He is not only the source and the course but also the application. The Spirit reaches us, entering into us and applying all that we need of the Father and the Son. This is wonderful. </p>
<p data-content-id="vJzJG0X_ryJcmFgai6O57B43uDbkeoRUBxT4ZWdjQGDJUapB8oOTU0vXOvnnlXEHm"> The church life is absolutely dependent upon the Spirit. Mere doctrines concerning the Father and the Son are inadequate. We need a living application of the Father in the Son by means of the Spirit. The Spirit glorifies the Son by <span class="pg" data-page-id="446" id="446">[446]</span> revealing Him with all the fullness of the Father. Let us take the example of humility. No one is born humble. People wrongly say that children are humble, but every little child is proud. We are proud by birth and by nature. Moreover, we are proud in our living. What is humility? Humility is Christ. Christ is the reality of every human virtue and every divine attribute. All the human virtues and all the divine attributes are simply Christ Himself. In a good and positive sense, Christ is everything. He is humility, love, patience, and submission. Outside of Him nothing, including us, is good. Every virtue and every attribute is Christ. How does the Spirit glorify Christ? He glorifies Christ by revealing Him item by item. For instance, in all that Christ is, there is an item called humility. One day the Spirit reveals Christ to you as your humility. This is not a doctrine of humility; it is the living person of Christ revealed to you as humility. Spontaneously, a living humility will come out of you. That is the glorification of Christ. The Spirit glorifies Christ, the Son of God, in this way. He does not do it by teaching you about Christ as humility, but by directly revealing Christ as humility to you. This humility then comes out of your very being, and this coming out of humility is the glorification of the Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="WAJQg83IWdCfjdYL46AZ251PVEx26GdlEPPkU9OnjGQWjiVZrhRbSL1RfcU528vmq"> Eventually, every characteristic of Christ will be expressed in the church life. There will be no Jewish, Greek, American, British, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, or any other kind of expression. There will be only the expression of Christ. This is what it means to say that the Spirit glorifies the Son by revealing Him in the fullness of the Father to the believers. We all need to have much experience of this. This will enrich, strengthen, and uplift the church life. If the church life has all of these actualities, it will surely grow. </p>

<p data-content-id="WAJQg83IWdCfjdYL45wZxrFPVEx26GdlEPPkU9OnjGQWjiVZrhRbSL1RfcU528vmq"> In this message we come to the profound prayer uttered by the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73505" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span>. This prayer is the completing prayer of the Lord’s message given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73506" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73507" data-verses="John 15:1">fifteen</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73508" data-verses="John 16:1">sixteen</span>. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73509" data-verses="John 14:1-17">John 14 through 17</span> carefully, we shall realize that these four chapters have a very specific flavor in utterance and composition. This flavor is altogether different from the other chapters in the Bible. Although the whole Bible undoubtedly is God-breathed, these four chapters have a special taste, a special flavor, that no one can imitate. This flavor is not only holy but divine. No human being can utter something that is so divine. The flavor of these chapters is special, impressive, and unique because it is absolutely divine. The person who composed these chapters must have been divine. No human could have written something like this. No human being could say, “Father, glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.” Only the Son of God could utter such words. Although you may not understand these chapters, if you are in the spirit as you read them, you will sense the divine flavor. This is the divine speaking, the divine utterance, and the divine flow with the divine flavor. I am confirmed in my belief that the Bible is the Word of God. Who besides God could have composed these four chapters? Could John, a fisherman from Galilee, utter such things? It is impossible. If we gather together two hundred men with Ph.D.’s, they would not have the substance to compose a writing with such a flavor. How we must worship the Lord for these four chapters! We must worship Him for the message He gave before His death, and we must worship Him for His concluding prayer. <span class="pg" data-page-id="456" id="456">[456]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="2Q5ugYZO8sPp0OavxVE7fiq3TFSV7Nsfngw8PljfG3IHcn7hxi9igE-N15TGlXeJl"> In order to understand the meaning of His prayer, we must remember the central thought of the message given by the Lord in the previous three chapters. The central thought of that message is rich, deep, and profound. The first aspect of this central thought is that the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, was sent by the Father to be among us. Then He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit that He might be able to come into us. In other words, He was transfigured into the Holy Spirit, and He comes into us as the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit comes into us, He comes as the Spirit of reality to make the Lord Jesus real to us in every respect. By doing this, the Lord brings us into the Father and brings the Father into us. This is the mingling of divinity with humanity. Included in this mingling is the mutual abode. We become the abode to the Triune God, and the Triune God becomes the abode to us. We can abide in the Triune God, and the Triune God can abide in us. This is the central thought of the profound and glorious message given by the Lord in these three chapters. After giving that message, the Lord offered a closing prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="ukeBrlETbXJ-IG3cZ1yPrWrbNDo45cevyTWorYeIAd3f0-tCeAa1VKDztLfP8v9yK"> What is the subject, the central thought, of this prayer? Although the subject of this prayer depends very much upon the central thought of the preceding message, it is still difficult to discover what this subject is. I spent much time on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73510" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span> without having any idea about the meaning of this prayer. When I was young, I heard that the Lord’s prayer in this chapter was for oneness. But oneness, or the unity among the Lord’s disciples, is not the subject. Oneness is on the surface. Something deeper and more profound lies beneath the surface, and it is not easy for us to dig it out. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73511" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span> is a deep chapter, and it is difficult to fathom it. How we thank the Lord that gradually, little by little, He has shown us the real meaning, the true significance, the central thought, of His prayer in this chapter. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fdMBmskAexpdwW2ww2yDsXkynDv29Co6M5pbGhMnLA0lgGhFaxHSuJlcbe7THuX3M">I. THE SON TO BE GLORIFIED<br/>THAT THE FATHER MAY BE GLORIFIED</h2><p data-content-id="IERNcQ0vWBnLmeh0g3u4v5ReUADpREG0qchAScpqLDYkBPlPEbaDbq1XEh-Wkl5Fg"> The basic concept of the Lord’s prayer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73512" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span> is glorification. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73513" data-verses="John 17:1">verse 1</span> the Lord said, “Father, the hour has come; <span class="pg" data-page-id="457" id="457">[457]</span> glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.” This is the subject, the central point, of this prayer. If we see the main points of the three previous chapters, we shall be able to understand what it means to have the Son glorified that the Father may be glorified. The Father is to glorify the Son so that the Son may glorify the Father. This is a mutual glorification between the Son and the Father. If the Father will glorify the Son, then the Son will glorify the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="OmAqQ18Wpl0cohVFnh4nYzB7NlRn8E3s18gEOw62GPpG9u6ni9v0XbHYnRZDBjgL3"> As a prayer that follows a message conveys the main point of the message, so the Lord’s concluding prayer covers the main point of the message He gave in the preceding three chapters. Keep this in mind, for it will help you to understand this prayer. The main point of the Lord’s message in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73514" data-verses="John 14:1-16">John 14 through 16</span> was that the Son may be glorified so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. In what way is the Father to be glorified in the Son? Through the organism of the vine tree. As we have seen, the organism of the vine tree is for the propagating and spreading of life, that is, for the multiplication and reproduction of life, and also for the expression of the Triune God. When the Triune God is propagated, multiplied, and expressed through this organism, the Son is glorified, and in the Son’s glorification the Father is glorified also. Thus, the Lord prayed that He, the Son, would be glorified so that the Father also might be glorified. </p>
<p data-content-id="4TUau6dLXXRywSAVI36AuK_lFrgTjOpy_3LINqVcTISbRAG_tv46RgQoE2WRrdCmW"> God’s eternal purpose, His ultimate intention, is to manifest, to express, Himself. As I have pointed out several times in the past, glorification simply means manifestation. To be glorified is to be manifested and expressed. For example, electricity that is not manifested is hidden. Before a lamp is switched on, the electricity is hidden within the lamp. But when the lamp is turned on, the electricity is manifested and expressed. Likewise, it is God’s intention to manifest and express Himself. As the electricity is glorified when it is manifested, so God is glorified when He is manifested. </p>
<p data-content-id="oK5t_cujVUe-6UYwJ5iNC3HtoQyZgAVvGBQeMC2vVG8ZOCjSk5ko7lPuMCUs_kVHC"> In creation God created man in His own image (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73515" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). Image denotes some sort of expression. Without a certain kind of image, God could never be expressed. Hence, the image is the very expression of God. God’s intention in creating man in His own image was that He might be <span class="pg" data-page-id="458" id="458">[458]</span> expressed. The Lord Jesus is God who became incarnated as a man for the purpose of declaring the invisible God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73516" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span> says that no one has ever seen God but that the Son has declared Him. God is unseen and invisible. No one except the Son of God has ever seen Him. Now, in His incarnation, the Son has declared Him. To declare God means to express God. The Lord Jesus is the very image of the invisible God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73517" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Col. 1:15</span>), which means that He is the very expression of the invisible God. </p>
<p data-content-id="3TL2o1JgaGVsB2drIp_3mQa6uVVBk0dUdsaHQHBjykhJ-X9KYQqJliD-60RdqUcyS"> The best illustration of glorification is the blossoming of a flower. A carnation seed, for example, is sown into the earth. After it grows up out of the earth, it blossoms. This blossoming is the glorification of the carnation seed. The carnation seed contains the life element and the life shape of the carnation flower. The style, color, and beauty of the flower are all contained in a little carnation seed, but no one can see this style, color, and beauty until the seed grows out of the earth and blossoms. The blossom is the glory of the seed. The blossoming is the glorification of the seed, for it is by blossoming that the seed is glorified, that is, expressed. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gx0vCOm6GtVjihAwYL9s_pAqXBmKh5IqFjM4fTWKvX8bE_WTVKQYXTJ_fmTiGywyV"> When Jesus Christ came in the flesh, He was like that little carnation seed. In Him, that is, in His human form, His human shell, were all the beauty and shape of the divine life. All the colorful aspects of the divine life were concealed and confined in that little Nazarene. One day, He was sown into the earth. After He died, He grew up and blossomed in His resurrection. In His resurrection, the beauty, form, style, color, and riches of life were released and expressed. That was the glorification of the Son. Since all that God the Father is has been embodied in the Son, when the Son is glorified, the Father is also glorified in the Son’s glorification. </p>

In this message we come to the second part of this prayer. The first part, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73549" data-verses="John 17:1-5">verses 1 through 5</span>, gives us the subject of the prayer, and the second part, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73550" data-verses="John 17:6-24">verses 6 through 24</span>, deals with oneness. The purpose of oneness is for the glorification of the Son that the Son may glorify the Father. The people in this oneness include all the disciples, all those whom God has chosen and given to the Lord Jesus, all those to whom the Lord has given eternal life. </p>

THE BELIEVERS TO BE BUILT UP INTO ONE</h2><p data-content-id="qVbKRqoOAGu3MGxnS1afBqROYKQQJ683fkFd9Unt-pau-YfKbohX26ar8pj6Ztet-"> In order to have oneness, there must be the building up. Without the building up, there is no oneness. Do not think that a piling up of materials is oneness. No, that is not oneness. Consider a house. There is a genuine oneness among all the materials in the house, and that oneness is the building up. Every piece of material has been fitly framed together. This is oneness. The oneness that many Christians are talking about today is just a piling up. Sometimes, however, it is not even a piling up; it is a matter of one person who is far away from another, saying, “We are one.” Brother Nee describes this kind of oneness as shaking hands over the fence. But the oneness today often is not even a shaking hands over the fence, but a begging of people who are far away from one another. One on the east coast may plead with one on the west coast to be one with him, saying, “Dear brother, I am one with you.” The one on the west coast may reply, “Yes, I am one with you,” yet in his heart he says, “If we <span class="pg" data-page-id="470" id="470">[470]</span> don’t keep a safe distance between us, we shall offend one another.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ycRAO1PQyck3vYSrWDK6nEgApQRQUIW1z8hRVBub6MifAsRtiq85jQsSkWApHYCbK"> If this is real oneness, where is the Body? The situation today is that the shoulder is afraid of the neck, wanting to keep a safe distance away from it. The eye is also afraid of the nose, saying, “Brother nose, you are too strong. I dare not stay with you. I want to be polite to you and nice to you, but I must keep a safe distance from you.” Most Christian workers are not willing to be one with others. Such a situation is not oneness. The genuine oneness is the building up. Look at the oneness of your physical body: that oneness is a matter of being built up. We all must see that this building is what the Lord needs today. Two thousand years ago, the Lord said, “I come quickly” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73551" data-verses="Revelation 22:20">Rev. 22:20</span>). Two thousand years have passed, and still He has not come. Why? Because it is a shame for Him to come back without having a real building. There must be a small remnant which will respond to the Lord’s heart and be willing to lose their identification in order to be built up together as one. This will be a shame to the enemy. The enemy, Satan, hates this building. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73552" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span>, the Lord prayed for it. </p>
<p data-content-id="8DJXQ5Z5MNoL38Tw5ph3u_CGTNIKyqqegEmV6n4XFlp5EG2WvIw21JD6sbOEnoo2p"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73553" data-verses="John 17:6-24">verses 6 through 24</span> the Lord prayed for the believers to be built up into one. This oneness is in three stages: in the Father’s name by the eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73554" data-verses="John 17:6-13">vv. 6-13</span>); in the Triune God through sanctification by the holy word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73555" data-verses="John 17:14-21">vv. 14-21</span>); and in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73556" data-verses="John 17:22-24">vv. 22-24</span>). </p>

In the Father’s Name by the Eternal Life</h2><p data-content-id="piHiQSgOUStVtrqyoEiWTHZ9Yfx9XL-jvmOyYyXYXCi31VAdk39LRDLmD7JuKz1I5"> The real oneness, the building up of the believers, is in the Father’s name by the eternal life. Eternal life is the reality of the Father’s name. The Father’s name is Father, and the reality of the Father is the divine life. This is even true with respect to our physical father, for our physical father’s reality is his life. If our father had no life to impart into us, he could never have been our father. My father is my father in reality because he has the life which has been imparted into me. The very life which has been imparted into me by him is the reality of his being my father. The word Father must not merely <span class="pg" data-page-id="471" id="471">[471]</span> be a title; it must be a reality. The divine life, which is the eternal life, is the reality of the title Father. </p>

<p data-content-id="2Q5ugYZO8sPp0OavxVU7YxK3TFSV7Nsfngw8PljfG3IHcn7hxi9igE-N15TGlXeJl"> The Father is the source of life. This is indicated by the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73557" data-verses="John 5:26">5:26</span>, which says, “The Father has life in Himself.” In the entire Scripture, especially in the Gospel of John, the Father denotes the source of life. Even in a human family, the father is the source of the life of that family. As the father of a family is the very source and origin of life, so the name Father reveals the Father as the source of life. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="ukeBrlETbXJ-IG3cZ1iPtFbbNDo45cevyTWorYeIAd3f0-tCeAa1VKDztLfP8v9yK">b. For the Propagation and Multiplication of Life</h2><p data-content-id="fdMBmskAexpdwW2ww2iDlEkynDv29Co6M5pbGhMnLA0lgGhFaxHSuJlcbe7THuX3M"> The Father, the source of life, is for the propagation and multiplication of life. The father of a human family, who is the source of the life of that family, is for the propagation of life. Although a man may be quite young, as long as he becomes a father with a source of life, he has some propagation. Originally, a man might have been alone, but later he has four little ones. After getting married, this man’s life, which is the father’s life as the source of a family, begins to be propagated. As the propagation of life goes on, there is also the multiplication of life. The Father’s life is for propagation and multiplication. </p>

Therefore, we have propagation, multiplication, and expression. We have seen that this concluding prayer is the confirmation and strengthening of the foregoing message in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73559" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen through sixteen</span>. In that message we saw the propagation of life and the multiplication of life for the expression of the Triune God. Now we have the same points in this concluding prayer: the Father is propagating, bringing forth, many sons for His expression. <span class="pg" data-page-id="472" id="472">[472]</span> </p>

Without having the divine life, God could never be the Father. How is it possible for a man to be a father? Only by his life. If you do not have life, you cannot be a father. A father is a producer. A father does not produce by manufacturing but by begetting. A father has a begetting life. Without that life, a man has no reality of being a father. Remembering that the Father has the divine life for begetting, propagating, multiplying, and bringing forth many sons will help us to understand the Gospel of John much better. If a man is unable to beget children, he is not a father. The qualification of your being a father rests with your children. The more children you have, the greater you are as a father. Suppose a man could have a hundred children. He would certainly be the greatest father on earth, for he would have such a rich life in begetting. Consider how many children our Father has. He not only has hundreds of children but millions of them. What a great Father He is! What propagation of life there is with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="J4tx36WD8sSYvG3X2lK3R7bwvrh2fuKH6QNE9Gs4JzvDXVEmUt3P5UvoURVrInZGe"> Whenever we call Him Father, we must understand that this title is realized by His divine life. Without His divine life, the name Father is merely an empty term without content or reality. Since the reality of the title Father is the divine life, to say that we are one in the name of the Father means that we are one in the divine life. </p>

In the Triune God through Sanctification<br/>by the Holy Word</h2><p data-content-id="dVGN5WXLxIx0FItFVYquXNdhDedsgBGx6cSHcgladGc5IaMSTaHitKZaPlyR-YeoS"> In this message we come to the second factor of genuine oneness. The first factor is being in the Father’s name by the eternal life, and the second is being in the Triune God through sanctification by the holy word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73587" data-verses="John 17:14-21">vv. 14-21</span>). The holy word is the sanctifying word. The second stage, or the second ground, of oneness is separation from the world by the word. Although we all have been born of the same Father and into the same family, it is regrettable that many of the brothers and sisters are not home, but have been attracted to worldly things such as surfing, movies, sports, and even gambling. If we have been attracted by such worldly things, although we are all children of the Father and have the same life, it will be difficult for us to keep the genuine oneness because we are still in the world and are unsanctified. After we have been born again as the children of God, we must be separated from the world by the holy word of the Lord. The word of the Lord has the sanctifying power to separate us from the world. Once we have been separated from the world by the holy word, we shall be centralized to realize genuine oneness. </p>

Both kinds of words are holy, having the sanctifying power to separate the believers from the world. The more we take either the Lord’s constant word or instant word into us, the more we are sanctified. The more we are nourished, saturated, and permeated with the Lord’s constant or instant word, the holier we become. And the more holiness we partake of, the more we are in the genuine oneness. </p>

The evil one is the devil, and the world is an evil system arranged systematically and ruled by the devil, Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73593" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>). Satan has systematized all the things on earth, especially those related to mankind, and the things in the air into his kingdom of darkness to possess people, to distract them from the enjoyment of God, and to frustrate them from fulfilling God’s purpose. Every aspect of the world, regardless of what it is, belongs to this satanic system. Since the whole world lies in the evil one, the believers must be kept from the evil one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73594" data-verses="John 17:15">v. 15</span>), and they need to pray to be delivered from the evil one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73595" data-verses="Matthew 6:13">Matt. 6:13</span>). </p>

They have not been taken out of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73599" data-verses="John 17:15">v. 15</span>) but have been sent into the world for the Lord’s commission (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73600" data-verses="John 17:18">v. 18</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73601" data-verses="John 17:18">Verse 18</span> says, “As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.” The Father sent the Son into the world with Himself as life and everything to the Son. In the same way, the Son sends His believers into the world with Himself as their life and their everything. The Son sends us, the believers, in the same way as the Father sent Him. When I came to this country, I had the deep sense within that the Lord had sent me, and I could say to Him, “Lord, You sent me to this country. Since You have sent me, You must come with me. Lord, if You won’t go, I won’t go either.” This is the way the Lord sends us into the world for His testimony. <span class="pg" data-page-id="483" id="483">[483]</span> </p>

The Words Being the Truth</h2><p data-content-id="5w-j5wr_UufC5LfaAzbLY1gNbg8EjHeZRqKuWbOgeqQ6qwIVYLcWYffP9g4uA2B9B"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73602" data-verses="John 17:17">verse 17</span> the Lord prayed, “Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.” The Father’s word carries with it the Father’s reality. When the word says, “God is light,” it conveys God as light. Hence, it is the reality, the truth, unlike Satan’s word, which is vanity, a lie (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73603" data-verses="John 8:44">8:44</span>). The word, being the truth, works as reality in the believers to sanctify them. </p>
<p data-content-id="N4fmiTCMCnn3CkIWRNmYtxfDgyhJ12fvZLXKozkGfvmkz7BV-BxJS1lJhf9hBkG1i"> God’s living word works in the believers to separate them from anything worldly, separating them from the world and its occupation unto God and His purpose, not only positionally (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73604" data-verses="Matthew 23:17">Matt. 23:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73605" data-verses="Matthew 23:19">19</span>) but also dispositionally (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73606" data-verses="Romans 6:19">Rom. 6:19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73607" data-verses="Romans 6:22">22</span>). This is what it means to be sanctified by the Lord’s word as the truth, the reality. This sanctification not only changes our position but also our disposition, our inward being. In the Bible, sanctification has these two aspects—the positional aspect and the dispositional aspect. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73608" data-verses="Matthew 23:17">Matthew 23:17</span> we see that the gold is sanctified by being put into the temple. When the gold is in the market place, it is common, unholy, but when it is put into the temple, its position is changed and it is immediately sanctified, becoming the holy gold in the holy temple. But this kind of sanctification does not affect the nature or element of the gold; it merely changes the gold’s position. Hence, the gold is sanctified positionally. Some Christians only see this much regarding sanctification; they do not see the matter of dispositional sanctification. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73609" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">First Thessalonians 5:23</span> says, “And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Here we are told that our spirit, soul, and body are to be sanctified. This does not refer to positional sanctification but to dispositional sanctification. The sanctification mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73610" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span> implies both aspects, for in order to maintain the proper oneness we must be sanctified both positionally and dispositionally. </p>

Consider the way He contacted the Samaritan woman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73612" data-verses="John 4:5-7">4:5-7</span>). The Lord did not meet her at night in a private home but during the day in the open air. As far as the Lord Himself was concerned, He could have met with the Samaritan woman, who was an immoral person, at any place and at any time. But as a man a little over thirty years of age, it would not have been a good example for His disciples if He had contacted her privately in her home at night. If He had done that, the disciples might have been confused. But, in order to set a good example for His disciples, He behaved in a sanctified way. This one example was a great help to His disciples in the future. It is not right for any young preacher to contact a woman privately at night because there is too much temptation there. To do such a thing is not holy; it is worldly. Look at the example of the Lord Jesus: He talked with Nicodemus, an elderly gentleman, late at night in a private home (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73613" data-verses="John 3:1-2">3:1-2</span>), but He talked with the immoral Samaritan woman during the daytime in the open air.

All the believers are one in the Triune God. In order to be one in the Triune God, we must be sanctified by the holy word. After we have been sanctified, separated from the world by the holy word, we shall enjoy the Triune God and be one in Him. In order to be in the Triune God we must firstly be separated from the beach, the movie theater, the football stadium, the gambling house, and from all other worldly places, and be separated unto the Triune God. Many Christians have not yet been separated to God. Since they still remain in the worldly places, how can they be one? Although you are a brother in <span class="pg" data-page-id="485" id="485">[485]</span> life, where are you? You must be sanctified from all worldly amusements to God. In the Triune God, that is, in the Father through the Son as the Spirit, we shall be one. </p>

<p data-content-id="cYGn4xmNBVjFrfZmTDYv0I9m_9fxL63wVykF5p86Aez0RDjJtznd2riwP4UqqLC1-"> Although much has been said about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73649" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span>, still more is necessary. We must never forget this chapter, for in it the Lord prayed that God would glorify Him so that God might be glorified in and through Him. The words, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73650" data-verses="John 17:1">17:1</span>), are the subject of this prayer. How was the Son of God glorified so that God the Father might be glorified in and through the Son? It was by the resurrection which follows death. After His death, the Lord was resurrected, meaning that He was manifested and glorified. The Lord was released and manifested by resurrection; hence, He was glorified. When the Lord was thus glorified, the Father was glorified in and through the Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="Yb8KD0TEIsrERldUqEmHAiNpGwNXPZgTUQSWnXv9XEEyrD-PFldCdx1u3tLElwVtE"> We have seen how the Son was glorified in His resurrection. Now in what way will the Son be glorified today so that the Father might be glorified in and through the Son? It is by the church. When the church has been regenerated, sanctified, crucified, and united with Christ in glory, then the Son of God will be expressed and manifested. The Son of God will be glorified in the oneness of the church. The Son of God being thus glorified, the Father at that time will also be glorified in and through the Son. Therefore, the prayer, “Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You,” includes and depends upon the matter of the church being regenerated, sanctified, crucified, and united in oneness with the Son of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EkcrSxIpLQOUHK3_7rPJPVX9sf_ELGP9UGzvc5KrB8okn42Eg2P38C8PV4PVqU8cJ">ONENESS IN THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="DPmqvJz2MlFezx9EKsgqwExF0UwqGXmjgMdv89HHfju_NU1jX7KGYx7B706OzsP2g"> As we have seen, the Lord’s prayer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73651" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span> unfolds three stages of oneness. In this message, let us pay careful <span class="pg" data-page-id="494" id="494">[494]</span> attention to the verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73652" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span> that are concerned with oneness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73653" data-verses="John 17:11">Verse 11</span> says, “Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are.” We see here that oneness is a matter of being kept in the Father’s name. As we have already pointed out, the reality of the Father’s name is the Father’s divine life. Hence, the first factor of genuine oneness is the Father’s name with the Father’s divine life. This is the life mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73654" data-verses="John 17:2">17:2</span>, where the Lord said to the Father that He had given the Son “authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.” We must take care of these two verses in order to see the first main factor of genuine oneness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="SSy1z1-JelNs_byNrVRvkkeYyIT6RoggYyiZmjl4crSpjkol7KqVeTafPqwkZ2tgp">ONENESS IN THE HOLY WORD</h2><p data-content-id="H9Hy-5vnqUPnqiRPT4Bi8nYOo-iwdpLJdrxLbhLN-vMjiEwxd-HPBShE698D5XbLQ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73655" data-verses="John 17:21">John 17:21</span> is a wonderful, deep, and profound verse. “That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me.” The oneness in this verse is the oneness in the Triune God. When we all are in the Triune God, we have oneness. How can we be in the Triune God? Only through Christ’s death and resurrection. This is the reason why the Lord told us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73656" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> that He had to go in death and come in resurrection. It was through death and resurrection that His disciples were brought into the Triune God. In the Triune God is the real, genuine oneness. We must take <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73657" data-verses="John 17:17-18">verses 17 and 18</span> along with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73658" data-verses="John 17:21">verse 21</span>. “Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth. As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73659" data-verses="John 17:17">verse 17</span> we have the sanctifying word. Although we are in the Triune God, we may slip out of the Triune God into the world. Thus, we need the sanctifying word to separate us from the world back to the Triune God. Therefore, the second factor of genuine oneness is in the Triune God through sanctification by the holy word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Xzji_1UPvRreQsGa1sxGLNnah9uQPwAkM0FbIvQrU7oMHeCL0a9Zt9q1Aoejnd4aw">ONENESS IN THE DIVINE GLORY</h2><p data-content-id="knc2QAb9j4ccOXQicb-Kx7g8PHO2T2KEihEStNALFHfsjrXJj2BXpKDG5-NN3oTu8"> The third factor of oneness is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73660" data-verses="John 17:22">verse 22</span>. “And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that <span class="pg" data-page-id="495" id="495">[495]</span> they may be one, even as We are one.” The third factor of genuine oneness is glory—in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God. Since the glory which the Father has given to the Son has been given to us by the Son, genuine oneness is in the divine glory. What is glory? Glory is the sonship given to the Son by the Father with the Father’s divine life and nature to express the Father in His fullness. Notice that there are four aspects of glory: sonship, the Father’s life, the Father’s divine nature, and the expression of the Father in His fullness. These four things together equal the glory. This is the glory, which is a divine right and privilege, that we have in the Son. The Father has given this glory to the Son, and the Son is privileged to express the Father in this way. This is the very glory which has been given to us by the Son. Today we all have the sonship with the Father’s life and nature to express the Father in all His fullness in the Son. We need to become very familiar with these points, for it is in this divine glory that we are truly one. </p>
<p data-content-id="J4tx36WD8sSYvG3XxnK3S77wvrh2fuKH6QNE9Gs4JzvDXVEmUt3P5UvoURVrInZGe"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73661" data-verses="John 17:23">Verse 23</span> continues, “I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.” Here we see that being perfected into oneness still pertains to being in the Father and in the Son. If we take care of all these verses, then we shall be able to see real oneness. </p>
<p data-content-id="zBGhA3590E7XPL6iYOv_E-OBnKECgCDATp-tFcRb9BVVdo8R8xctsKXmFfAC4TlQd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73662" data-verses="John 17:24">verse 24</span> the Lord said, “Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me may also be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me, for You have loved Me before the foundation of the world.” The Lord was in the divine glory and prayed that all whom the Father had given Him would also be with Him in glory. We need to pay close attention to the tenses of some of the verbs in this verse. Here it does not say that they “shall be with Me” or that “they shall behold My glory.” According to the natural, religious concept, glory is in the future, in “the sweet by-and-by.” According to this concept, in “the sweet by-and-by” the glory will shine and we all shall come into that shining and be in glory. But the Lord Jesus did not use the future tense, but the present tense, saying, “I desire that those whom You have given Me may also be with Me where I <span class="pg" data-page-id="496" id="496">[496]</span> am, that they may behold My glory.” The Lord said, “may also be,” and, “may behold My glory.” Being with the Lord in glory and beholding His glory are not for “the sweet by-and-by”; we may experience them today. The Lord seemed to be telling the Father, “Father, You have given Me Your glory, the sonship with the divine life and nature to express You and Your fullness. This is the glory which You have given Me, and I am now in this glory. But those whom You have given Me are not yet in this glory. I pray that they also may be in this glory.” When was this prayer answered? Firstly, it was answered on the day of resurrection and secondly, on the day the church was raised up. When the church was raised up, all the disciples were brought into that same glory, into the sonship with the divine life and the divine nature to express God the Father in the Son in all His fullness. Hallelujah, we all are in glory with the Son! The Son has the sonship with the divine life and the divine nature to express the Father, and we also have this. Thus, we are now where the Son is—in glory. By this we see that real oneness is in the Triune God through the process of the death and resurrection of the Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="a9NrvhD6wW1hRS7-kngmrCF1fb7DU8q1AZlxJz81s5YFPu5MILIeqJhyavV3tDNAj"> The first stage of oneness is the oneness of life, the second stage is the oneness of sanctification, and the third stage is the oneness in the glorification of the Triune God. The last stage, the glorification of the Triune God, is simply the manifestation of the Triune God, that is, the glory of sonship. When we come together realizing that we have been regenerated, sanctified, and crucified, then we are one to express God, to manifest God, and to be perfected into the glorification of the Triune God. </p>

<p data-content-id="hXua0_pW3f46EmITm880VDvYjnS6MIc9iKH126QEiPABeTlJOgF_otvYI038EQlw6"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73674" data-verses="John 18:1-2">John 18 and 19</span> tell us about the Lord’s betrayal, judgment, crucifixion, and burial. By reading the account of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels, we discover that the first three Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are records along the same line. But the record of the Gospel of John is absolutely different. For example, in the first three Gospels the record of the Lord’s crucifixion and death on the cross is accompanied by many signs. For instance, the sky became dark, and the veil in the temple was rent from top to bottom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73675" data-verses="Matthew 27:45">Matt. 27:45</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73676" data-verses="Matthew 27:51">51</span>). Also, the Lord’s cry from the cross, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” is another sign in these Gospels that cannot be found in the Gospel of John. However, John’s record contains that which cannot be found in the first three Gospels, such as the soldiers’ mocking of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73677" data-verses="John 19:2-3">19:2-3</span>) and the blood and water pouring out from the Lord’s side (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73678" data-verses="John 19:34">19:34</span>). Therefore, these records are along two different lines. We must know the purpose behind these two lines. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uj2hgxuYFe-UC_235t9o8jArEPXe5jTUAOGzaPqIwSAQiBsHQoHWtKOYJParAMEVp"> According to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the main purpose of the Lord’s death was to redeem us. He died for us and for our sins that He might accomplish the work of redemption. The Lord cried, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” because it was at that very moment that God put all our sins upon Him and the Lord became the sin-bearer, becoming a sinner in our stead to bear our sins. Therefore, God forsook Him. Luke especially notes that the Lord was the Redeemer to redeem us from our sins, for he tells us that the Lord died <span class="pg" data-page-id="504" id="504">[504]</span> with two sinners, two thieves, one who was saved and one who perished (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73679" data-verses="Luke 23:32">Luke 23:32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73680" data-verses="Luke 23:39-43">39-43</span>). Such a record cannot be found in the Gospel of John. What then is the purpose of John’s record? Since the Gospel of John is the gospel of life, his record of the death of Christ follows the line of life. John’s purpose was to show that the Lord Jesus is the expression of God as our life and that He died on the cross for the purpose of releasing Himself to us as life. His death on the cross was for the purpose of imparting His divine life into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="MWwn5_pxNxpNcbAwbZakx3g76ebi5X3DU0CvvMTPWuJQBSUmbGja3mdoHOKC8EYbl"> At this point we need to visualize the whole Gospel of John. In this book, the writer, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, points out that the Lord Jesus as the expression of God came as life to meet all our needs, and that He had to die and be resurrected and transfigured into another form, the Spirit, so that He might come into us, be one with us, and bring us into God and God into us, making God and us a mutual abode. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73681" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span> the Lord prayed that all the disciples, being born of God, knowing the name and life of the Father, and belonging to the Father’s family, would be one in the Father’s name, separated from the world and sanctified to live in God, and be absolutely one in the Triune God, realizing the glory of being the sons of God. As this chapter reveals, by being in the life and nature of God, in sanctification, and in the glory of the Triune God, we all may be one as God’s corporate expression. In this way, the Lord, the Son of God, can be manifested and glorified through us, and the Father can be manifested and glorified in the Son through this corporate vessel. Following this, the writer gives a record showing how the Lord was crucified, went into death, and came out of death in resurrection. By considering this whole picture, we shall be able to see the purpose of the record regarding the Lord’s death in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73682" data-verses="John 18:1">chapters eighteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73683" data-verses="John 19:1">nineteen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="VMLFt4z73i1A5nc86bpUU9Hj8npBxae0I9fekDagnkfCayaI0rHPQg8monXBIOTyM"> I appreciate the title of this message—“Life Processed for Multiplication.” I especially like the words <em>processed</em> and <em>multiplication.</em> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73684" data-verses="John 18:1-21">John 18 through 21</span> reveal that life has undergone a process so that it might be multiplied. One grain has been multiplied into many grains (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73685" data-verses="John 12:24">12:24</span>). One unique only begotten Son has been multiplied into many <span class="pg" data-page-id="505" id="505">[505]</span> sons. When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73686" data-verses="John 20:1">chapter twenty</span> we shall see that the unique only begotten Son has produced many brothers in His resurrection and that these many brothers are His multiplication. How could the Lord have this multiplication? Only by passing through the process of death and resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="idWE0reFGaAWAlr_gahPtpmCTiqbcPOP0DvCKdvLJMaSDuuVJK3S-muAf0I_c0Lu5">I. DELIVERING HIMSELF<br/>IN VOLUNTARY BOLDNESS<br/>TO BE PROCESSED</h2><p data-content-id="Uj2hgxuYFe-UC_235t9o7xgrEPXe5jTUAOGzaPqIwSAQiBsHQoHWtKOYJParAMEVp"> The Lord delivered Himself in voluntary boldness to be processed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73687" data-verses="John 18:1-11">18:1-11</span>). This means that He went into death willingly. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73688" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> He told us that He would purposely give up His life for us. He is the Lord of life, and He is life. He has authority to die, and He has the authority to be resurrected. Of His own accord, He went into death and He came out of it. He does not have the problem of death; hence, it was unnecessary for Him to die. It was His prerogative whether He would die or not. He could will to die or will not to die. To us, however, death is not a matter of choice. When death comes to visit us, we cannot say, “Death, I am not ready. Please come again another day.” We have neither the power nor the authority to reject death. When death comes, everyone must be subdued by it. But this was not so with the Lord, because He is the Lord of life and also life itself. If He did not prefer to die, He had the power and authority to reject death and not die. He had the authority to send death away. Although He was not forced or compelled to die, He was willing to die because He had come to impart Himself to us as life. He knew that it was only through death that He could release Himself into us as life. In fact, He had already said that He was the one grain of wheat that was to fall into the ground and die (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73689" data-verses="John 12:24">12:24</span>). If a grain of wheat is unwilling to die, how can it release its life to bring forth many grains? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73690" data-verses="John 18:1-2">John 18 and 19</span> we see clearly that the Lord Jesus was very willing to die. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="MWwn5_pxNxpNcbAwbZak3lQ76ebi5X3DU0CvvMTPWuJQBSUmbGja3mdoHOKC8EYbl">A. Going to the Garden</h2><p data-content-id="VMLFt4z73i1A5nc86bpUdvHj8npBxae0I9fekDagnkfCayaI0rHPQg8monXBIOTyM"> The first proof of the Lord’s willingness to die was that He <span class="pg" data-page-id="506" id="506">[506]</span> went to the garden (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73691" data-verses="John 18:1">18:1</span>). This means that He went to a place where He could be captured. In His long message recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73692" data-verses="John 14:1-16">John 14 through 16</span>, He made the process so clear. Then, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73693" data-verses="John 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>, He prayed for the process. After He prayed, He went to the garden. According to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Lord went to the garden to pray. These three Gospels reveal that the Lord was the sin-bearer who was under the burden of bearing our sins. Thus, He had to go to the Father and pray. But there is no such record in the Gospel of John. John’s record shows that He went to the garden not to pray but to present Himself to the process. He went there to be captured, to be arrested, to be presented to death. This means that He voluntarily delivered Himself. The Lord did not hide but willingly offered Himself to be processed, delivering Himself to the people who were to put Him to death. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="idWE0reFGaAWAlr_gahPl72CTiqbcPOP0DvCKdvLJMaSDuuVJK3S-muAf0I_c0Lu5">B. Betrayed by the False Disciple</h2><p data-content-id="10MJntexVw9mtYnM2Y7gxijXBkYBi4_k9Sj8fkt-_KQkx6FVLKr6wXK38c_eWnUfc"> The Lord knew that Judas would betray Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73694" data-verses="John 13:11">13:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73695" data-verses="John 13:21-27">21-27</span>). He did not avoid it. This also proves that He voluntarily delivered Himself to be processed. Satan utilized the false disciple of the Lord to put Him to death, not knowing that by doing this he afforded the Lord the opportunity to be processed. The Lord took this as an opportunity to be glorified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73696" data-verses="John 13:31-32">13:31-32</span>), that is, to be multiplied through death and resurrection. </p>

<p data-content-id="65XEpihaZD6ISNAVO6KJ1i1YFIvvJdVmQZ8Nms4k0sV2bawyzQ5gp4-b5hMWcG5LI"> We have seen that the Gospel of John reveals the Lord as the very expression of God coming to us as life. By imparting Himself into us, He becomes everything to us and meets all our needs that He may bring God into us and bring us into God, mingling God with us until God is one with us and we are one with Him. In other words, the Lord is the very expression of God, imparting Himself to us as life, meeting all our needs, and mingling God with us as one. This is the main thought of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73775" data-verses="John 1:1">chapters one through seventeen</span>. All who have been regenerated by Him will be one in this divine life. In fact, we are one with one another in this divine life, even as we are one with God in this divine life. After such a revelation in these seventeen chapters, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73776" data-verses="John 18:1">chapters eighteen and nineteen</span> the Holy Spirit reveals the Lord’s willingness to go into death and to deliver Himself to death that He might be sown as a grain of wheat into the earth to die in order that He might rise up to release and impart Himself into us, thus bringing forth much fruit by His death and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="RlO-2vedqmdQXARA79K4CT2WiHInosSJJl_rxLF7T71PLsdG2vlqt0YIcHtVEPKWx"> The thought of the Holy Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73777" data-verses="John 18:1-2">John 18 and 19</span> is not mainly that of the Redeemer bearing our sins, dying for our sins on the cross, and redeeming us from the curse of our sins. The thought of the Redeemer and His redemption is seen mainly in the first three Gospels. The thought in the Gospel of John, especially in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73778" data-verses="John 18:1">chapters eighteen and nineteen</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span>, is mainly that of the Lord as the seed of life going into death and releasing Himself through death and resurrection. In this way, the one grain has been released to produce the many grains. Life originally was restricted to the one grain, but now, by death and resurrection, Christ’s very life has been released, has brought forth many grains, and is now in the many grains. This is the thought concerning the Lord’s death in the Gospel of John. </p>
<p data-content-id="sKcQzI-JcYxQ0t13leS9fs_QTOnJKztGW9tk91ziTD0CMYbh07w9aYssE7T5F0S5x"> We have seen that the Lord delivered Himself in voluntary boldness to be processed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73779" data-verses="John 18:1-11">18:1-11</span>), that He was examined in His dignity by mankind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73780" data-verses="John 18:12-38">18:12-38a</span>), that He was sentenced in man’s injustice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73781" data-verses="John 18:38">18:38b</span>—19:16), and that He was tested in God’s sovereignty by death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73782" data-verses="John 19:17-30">19:17-30</span>). In this message we come to the very crucial matter of the issue of the Lord’s death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73783" data-verses="John 19:31-37">19:31-37</span>). </p>

ISSUING IN BLOOD AND WATER</h2><p data-content-id="L2ANrEyjfbJ7B2dFV1eopN2OFniVzGXaJCUsnvi40kXchfitT6kS-85r480rXaxQ_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73784" data-verses="John 19:34">John 19:34</span> says, “But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.” Two substances came out of the Lord’s pierced side: blood and water. Blood is for redemption, dealing with sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73785" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73786" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Heb. 9:22</span>) for the purchase of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73787" data-verses="Acts 20:28">Acts 20:28</span>), and water is for imparting life, dealing with death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73788" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73789" data-verses="John 3:14-15">3:14-15</span>) for the producing of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73790" data-verses="Ephesians 5:29-31">Eph. 5:29-31</span>). On the negative side, the Lord’s death takes away our sins; on the positive side, it imparts life into us. Hence, it has two aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect. The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect. The record of the three other Gospels is only for the redemptive aspect of the Lord’s death, but John’s record is not only for the redemptive aspect but also for the life-imparting aspect. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73791" data-verses="Matthew 27:45">Matthew 27:45</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73792" data-verses="Matthew 27:51">51</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73793" data-verses="Mark 15:33">Mark 15:33</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73794" data-verses="Luke 23:44-45">Luke 23:44-45</span>, “darkness,” as a symbol of sin, appeared, and “the veil of the temple,” which separated man from God, “was rent.” Those were signs related to the Lord’s redemptive death. Furthermore, the words spoken by the Lord on the cross in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73795" data-verses="Luke 23:34">Luke 23:34</span>, “Father, forgive them,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73796" data-verses="Matthew 27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” <span class="pg" data-page-id="521" id="521">[521]</span> (because He bore our sin at that time), also depict the Lord’s redemptive death. But the flowing water and the unbroken bone mentioned by John in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73797" data-verses="John 19:34">verses 34</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73798" data-verses="John 19:36">36</span> are signs of the Lord’s life-imparting death. This life-imparting death releases the Lord’s divine life from within Him for producing the church, composed of all His believers into whom His divine life has been imparted. This life-imparting death of the Lord was typified by Adam’s sleep that produced Eve (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73799" data-verses="Genesis 2:21-23">Gen. 2:21-23</span>), and is signified by the death of the one grain of wheat falling into the ground for the bringing forth of many grains (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73800" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>) for the making of the loaf—the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73801" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:17">1 Cor. 10:17</span>). Hence, it is also the life-propagating, life-multiplying, regenerating, and reproducing death. </p>
<p data-content-id="ycRAO1PQyck3vYSrRBq6uWAApQRQUIW1z8hRVBub6MifAsRtiq85jQsSkWApHYCbK"> As we shall see, the Lord’s pierced side was prefigured by Adam’s opened side, out of which Eve was produced (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73802" data-verses="Genesis 2:21-23">Gen. 2:21-23</span>). The blood was typified by the blood of the Passover lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73803" data-verses="Exodus 12:7">Exo. 12:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73804" data-verses="Exodus 12:22">22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73805" data-verses="Revelation 12:11">Rev. 12:11</span>), and the water by the water that flowed out of the smitten rock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73806" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">Exo. 17:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73807" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Cor. 10:4</span>). The blood formed “a fountain” for the washing of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73808" data-verses="Zechariah 13:1">Zech. 13:1</span>), and the water became “the fountain of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73809" data-verses="Psalms 36:9">Psa. 36:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73810" data-verses="Revelation 21:6">Rev. 21:6</span>). </p>

Not One of His Bones Being Broken</h2><p data-content-id="0qg4Xe6SXa0i7DIisQvBp5h0kmjnUFXxSvp-5BeODfOoXLrE4iTl60302dFOLF8PT"> Every aspect of the Lord’s death was according to God’s sovereignty. Under God’s sovereignty, not one of the Lord’s bones was broken (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73811" data-verses="John 19:31-33">19:31-33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73812" data-verses="John 19:36">36</span>). The Jews, not wanting the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, asked Pilate that their legs might be broken. The soldiers then broke the legs of the two thieves who had been crucified with the Lord. But when they came to Jesus, they saw that He had already died. Since the Lord had already died, it was needless for them to break His bones. This indicates that, in a sense, the Lord Jesus was not put to death by human hands but that He died Himself. Although He was crucified, He died Himself, fulfilling His word spoken in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73813" data-verses="John 10:17-18">10:17 and 18</span>, where He said, “I lay down My life that I may take it again. No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have <span class="pg" data-page-id="522" id="522">[522]</span> authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again.” Apparently, Jesus was killed; actually, He laid down His psuche life, His soulish life, and died. While the two criminals were killed, Jesus was not. Rather, He laid down His psuche life for our redemption. Since He had already died, the soldiers did not break His legs. This sovereignly fulfilled the prophecy which said, “Not a bone of Him shall be broken” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73814" data-verses="John 19:36">19:36</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="7fkTGT1KmmDoykHcj5usXtOxLLBusIlFpNkxlpqD2Abt5CGw7IP8GFtf4BNL-5J_z"> One of the soldiers, being concerned that the Lord might not actually be dead, pierced His side with a spear. This fulfilled the prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73815" data-verses="Zechariah 12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span>: “They shall look on him whom they pierced.” It was absolutely of God’s sovereignty that these things happened in such a meaningful and wonderful way. This proves strongly that the Lord’s death was not accidental, but that it was planned by God “before the foundation of the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73816" data-verses="1Peter 1:19-20">1 Pet. 1:19-20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_c-31afrsqWhR9jEHp-3Cp9cuMq9xLD-ecnr7fV1PZOouCe3G2hx5BHraOpAV5inS"> The Lord’s having none of His bones broken was typified by the bones of the Passover lamb. In the institution of the Passover, God ordained that none of the lamb’s bones should be broken (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73817" data-verses="Exodus 12:46">Exo. 12:46</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73818" data-verses="Numbers 9:11-12">Num. 9:11-12</span>). This was a wonderful type. Later, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73819" data-verses="Psalms 34:20">Psalm 34:20</span> this was also prophesied. Both the type and the prophecy were fulfilled in the Lord’s death on the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="BIN7s6C3jIrwhmOtBj5QGkZ98HXXDvzIG873PQJvi9ygFduggN23Zk5vk4njinT-6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73820" data-verses="Genesis 2:21-23">Genesis 2:21-23</span>, we find the Scripture’s first mention of “bone,” which was a rib taken out of Adam for producing and building Eve as a match for Adam. Eve was a type of the church produced with the Lord’s resurrection life that was released out of Him. In other words, the church came out of the resurrection life, the unbroken life, the incorruptible life of Christ. His is the life which can never be hurt, damaged, or broken. If one of the Lord’s bones could be broken, it would mean that the Lord’s resurrection life could be hurt and broken by death. </p>

<p data-content-id="P_4KtsGyNhSbk86m_mYb6qHDwZ4sTm7hLI0PKhfCaFxOEgwCSzcqA_f6HNvLOq6uZ"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73855" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, a chapter about the Lord’s resurrection. The Lord’s death was for His resurrection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73856" data-verses="John 12:24">12:24</span> He said that He was the grain of wheat which would fall into the ground and die that it might be released to impart its life into many other grains. In other words, He had to die that He might rise up and become many grains. This seems strange and mysterious to the human mind. The human mind has never entertained the thought that there is such a thing as resurrection following death. Even Satan thought that death would put an end to the Lord Jesus. To Satan, death was the end. But to the Lord, death was not the end; it was the pathway for Him to enter into resurrection. Thus, to the Lord, death was not a defeat but a way to victory. By being put into death, He gained the victory because death became a door and an entrance into resurrection. Indeed, His death was for His resurrection. Without death, He never could have produced the church. Without death, He never could have regenerated us to be the members of His Body. Therefore, everything was dependent upon the Lord’s death which led into resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="-wcKCKo7UARjQdL8ofHzoVsD9JFIhNDZrBP0U3En8T5V9E0iPj-NnoE9Ye4IDqtEN"> The record in the Gospel of John regarding the Lord’s resurrection is different from that in the other three Gospels. The record of the Lord’s resurrection in Matthew, Mark, and Luke is nearly the same. John’s record, however, is vastly different. The Gospel of John always has the viewpoint of life. According to John’s Gospel, the Lord has come to be the expression of God to be received by us as life, and He died and resurrected to impart Himself into us as life. If we would <span class="pg" data-page-id="532" id="532">[532]</span> understand this book, we must keep this viewpoint in mind. This same viewpoint is seen in this record of the Lord’s resurrection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73857" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73858" data-verses="John 21:1">21</span> are written from this point of view, showing how the Lord was released by His death and imparted into us by His resurrection. The main purpose of these two chapters is that, after and by His resurrection, the Lord will come into us and be one with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="piHiQSgOUStVtrqyvHyWVVp9Yfx9XL-jvmOyYyXYXCi31VAdk39LRDLmD7JuKz1I5"> The whole Gospel of John is directed toward resurrection. The purpose of the Lord’s incarnation as a man was that He might impart Himself into many people and reproduce many sons of God. He was the only begotten Son of God, but God needed the reproduction and the multiplication of His only begotten Son. The only way in which the only begotten Son of God could be reproduced and multiplied was by death and resurrection. For example, the only possible way for a grain of wheat to be reproduced and multiplied into many grains is the way of death and resurrection. As we have seen, the entire Gospel of John points in this direction—toward the reproduction and multiplication of the only begotten Son of God. In this way, the only begotten Son becomes the many sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73859" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). In order to have His corporate expression, God requires the many sons. For this purpose, the only begotten Son of God had to be released through death and imparted into us through resurrection. </p>

RESURRECTING IN DIVINE GLORY</h2><p data-content-id="WAJQg83IWdCfjdYL_6wZ9rFPVEx26GdlEPPkU9OnjGQWjiVZrhRbSL1RfcU528vmq"> We have been considering how life was processed for multiplication. After passing through the examination, the sentencing, and the testing of death, He rested in human honor. Then, after passing through the death portion of the process, Christ resurrected in divine glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73860" data-verses="John 20:1-13">20:1-13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73861" data-verses="John 20:17">17</span>). Now, having resurrected, He is in the divine glory. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="n8WSh8WU2BdpsjVRHCNTN5J5SG8QBnYwKIXlL0q3eeAFANq7Mk2tNf7lfC_nB1Vr0">A. “On the First Day of the Week”</h2><p data-content-id="65XEpihaZD6ISNAVO76JxwFYFIvvJdVmQZ8Nms4k0sV2bawyzQ5gp4-b5hMWcG5LI"> The Lord resurrected “on the first day of the week” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73862" data-verses="John 20:1">20:1</span>). The resurrection of the Lord was a new start opening the way to a new generation and a new age. This is why the Lord resurrected “on the first day of the week.” This day is the greatest day in the Bible. That it is called “the first day of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="533" id="533">[533]</span> week” means that it is a new beginning. A week is a period of seven days, and the first day denotes a new start. Why did the Lord not rise up on the sixth or seventh day, or on any other day of the week? Because His resurrection ushered in a new period, a new age, a new generation. In the old creation there were seven days. God created for six days and rested on the seventh. These seven days were the generation of the old creation. By the resurrection of the Lord Jesus another generation was newly started. The old creation belonged to the seven days. Now, after the seven days, there is a new start with another first day. In other words, by the resurrection of the Lord, the old creation has passed away and a new creation has begun; the old generation is over and the new generation has started. Thus, the first day of another week signifies the beginning of a new creation, a new generation, and a new age. </p>
<p data-content-id="RlO-2vedqmdQXARA7864FB2WiHInosSJJl_rxLF7T71PLsdG2vlqt0YIcHtVEPKWx"> Have you ever noticed the type in the Old Testament which indicated that the Lord would resurrect on the first day of the week? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73863" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10">Leviticus 23:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73864" data-verses="Leviticus 23:11">11</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73865" data-verses="Leviticus 23:15">15</span>, a sheaf of the firstfruit of the harvest was offered to the Lord as a wave offering on the “morrow after the sabbath.” That sheaf of the firstfruits was a type of Christ as the firstfruit in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73866" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:20">1 Cor. 15:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73867" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:23">23</span>). Christ resurrected exactly on the day after the Sabbath. In these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73868" data-verses="Leviticus 23:1">Leviticus 23</span>, the term “the first day of the week” is not used; instead, another term is used—“the morrow after the sabbath.” The Sabbath is the seventh day, and the morrow after the Sabbath is the first day of the week. The firstfruits of the harvest were offered to the Lord “on the morrow after the sabbath,” meaning the first day of the following week. The firstfruits of the harvest typify the resurrected Christ. He is the firstfruit of resurrection. Since the Lord resurrected from the dead as the firstfruit of the harvest, when was the firstfruit of the harvest offered to God? It was on the morrow after the Sabbath, that is, on the first day of the week. This is not only a type but also a prophecy which was fulfilled in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73869" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="sKcQzI-JcYxQ0t13lfi9Z-vQTOnJKztGW9tk91ziTD0CMYbh07w9aYssE7T5F0S5x"> The firstfruit of the harvest offered to the Lord was the wave offering signifying resurrection. The wave offering is <span class="pg" data-page-id="534" id="534">[534]</span> contrasted with the heave offering. The wave offering was offered with a back-and-forth motion signifying Christ in resurrection; the heave offering was lifted with an up-and-down motion signifying Christ in ascension. To wave indicates constant motion. Hence, Christ is moving in life because He has resurrected. He is the wave offering on the first day of the week. </p>
<p data-content-id="wdYDXrVTBi16uQIJDcQKB9fFAbXHIhsQrac_ssNkW8MNVZd8_yYP9-uGMvsFev98q"> Another matter to be considered here is the circumcision of the children of Israel. On what day did God instruct them to be circumcised? It was on the eighth day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73870" data-verses="Genesis 17:12">Gen. 17:12</span>). After a period of seven days, there is the first day of another period of seven days—that is, the eighth day. The significance of the Lord’s instructing the children of Israel to be circumcised on the eighth day was that they had to eliminate their old nature and live the resurrected life. They were born naturally and had to cut off their old nature and have a new nature which lives by the resurrection life. Thus, the Israelites were commanded to be circumcised on the eighth day. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73871" data-verses="Colossians 2:11-12">Colossians 2:11 and 12</span> declare that in Christ we all have been circumcised by His cross. It is God’s intention that His people put off the old nature and put on the new nature that they might live in the resurrection life. This is something of the eighth day, the first day of the week. This simply denotes resurrection because resurrection is a new beginning for a new generation in a new creation. </p>

How can it be revealed to us? How can we have this vision? Only by loving the Lord and seeking Him. The fact of the Lord’s resurrection has been accomplished, but it must be discovered and seen. Before Mary the Magdalene came to the tomb, the resurrection in life had in fact been accomplished. But Mary had to discover it by loving and seeking the Lord. This lays down a principle. Today the resurrection of Christ is an accomplished fact, yet so many people have not seen it. They have never come to the point where they have discovered it. Have you discovered the fact of Christ’s resurrection? Have you received the revelation or vision that the Lord has been resurrected? I know you have the knowledge, the doctrine, and the story of His resurrection, but have you discovered the fact of it in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="540" id="540">[540]</span> spirit? If we would make such a discovery, we must first love the Lord and seek Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="zBGhA3590E7XPL6iYPv_NtuBnKECgCDATp-tFcRb9BVVdo8R8xctsKXmFfAC4TlQd"> Why is it that when you come to a meeting you have nothing to minister or to testify about? It is simply because you have not made the discovery and lack the revelation. Look at Mary. What did she do after she made this discovery? She ran to the disciples to tell them something new. I am sure that when you meet the Lord in the morning and make a new discovery about Him, you will surely come to the evening meeting and burst out with something to tell us. The spiritual discovery, the spiritual revelation, the spiritual vision, depends very much upon seeking the Lord. If you do not seek Him, it will be rather difficult for you to share anything of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="a9NrvhD6wW1hRS7-kmgmjR11fb7DU8q1AZlxJz81s5YFPu5MILIeqJhyavV3tDNAj"> Mary the Magdalene had no knowledge. She was absolutely in life and was altogether not in the tree of knowledge. She did not know anything. In a human sense, it was foolish for her to come to the tomb and especially to come early in the morning. Nevertheless, she was the first to discover the fact of the Lord’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="dVGN5WXLxIx0FItFVZ6uQf9hDedsgBGx6cSHcgladGc5IaMSTaHitKZaPlyR-YeoS"> Sisters, you may love the Lord very much and might be the first to see the fact of His resurrection, but, like Mary, you still need the brothers to help you. Mary immediately ran to the two leading brothers, Peter and John, and told them of her discovery. It is interesting to note that when Mary went to the disciples, only two responded and went to the tomb. Why did the others not go? Possibly because, on the one hand, they were not seeking, and, on the other hand, they were lazy. They probably loved their bed. Only Peter and John ran to the tomb to see what Mary had discovered. John, who might have been younger than Peter, outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first, but, for some reason, he did not go in. Peter, who had more experience, was the first to enter into the tomb. When the two brothers saw the linen cloths and the napkin folded and left in a good order in the tomb, they were clear that the Lord must have resurrected from the dead. They were much clearer than their foolish sister who had said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73894" data-verses="John 20:2">20:2</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="541" id="541">[541]</span> Peter might have said, “I sympathize with my foolish sister and do not blame her. But now I realize that the Lord was not taken away. Look at the wrappings. He has certainly walked out of the tomb.” </p>
<p data-content-id="QdS_HMSS3SdGPRtEA4FRQE7srSqMQHxUS3POjiiKGElbtbOCx1j7HNi8K4jPqe1Qb"> This shows us a picture of how to seek the Lord. The first one who saw the tomb was Mary, and the first person who entered into the tomb was Peter. Here the brothers are really the brothers because they are clearer in the mind and find it easier to believe the fact than the sisters do. The two brothers saw the empty tomb, the linen cloths, and the napkin, and were very clear that the Lord must have been resurrected. Although they saw the fact, realized it, and believed in it objectively, they did not have the experience subjectively. After being satisfied with the objective fact, they left the tomb. However, Mary, the sister, lingered, for she was still waiting, looking, and expecting. It was her additional seeking that gained the experience of the Lord’s resurrection. Since the Lord revealed Himself to her, she not only received the fact but also the experience. She was the first to experience the resurrected Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="KH2K8ov9UbVLXhVOmsjrbqZzrungwARtcHESrqPTSQ7WAQf4Mh3jfx5zndjYHF_CI"> Here we see a picture disclosing the two sides related to the Lord—the fact and the experience. You may believe in the fact but not have the experience. Peter and John realized and believed in the fact, but they lacked the experience of the Lord’s resurrection. Mary had both the fact and the experience. For example, you may have the fact of the Lord’s crucifixion but fail to experience the cross. In the same principle, you may have the fact of the Lord’s resurrection but fail to experience the resurrected Lord. We need both the fact and the experience. Mary firstly saw the revelation of the fact, but she was not satisfied merely with the fact. She went further and received the experience of the resurrected Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="lpmcG2OSgx4b8KfNYMtdNrelNHSx6i6bvSlo1-scnq60V3T2e_f37EFbGHcUWveMa"> As a rule, the brothers are usually very objective and the sisters very subjective. According to the Scriptural principle, the man always represents the objective truth while the woman always represents the subjective experience. As an illustration, Abraham represents the doctrine of faith or the truth of faith, but Sarah represents the experience of <span class="pg" data-page-id="542" id="542">[542]</span> obedience. Faith is related to truth and is objective; obedience is related to experience and is subjective. Likewise, Peter and John believed in the fact of the Lord’s resurrection objectively, but Mary experienced it subjectively. Many Christians today have never seen the fact of the Lord’s resurrection. While a few definitely have the revelation of the Lord’s resurrection, they only have the revelation, not the experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="OmAqQ18Wpl0cohVFgionYyB7NlRn8E3s18gEOw62GPpG9u6ni9v0XbHYnRZDBjgL3"> In the church life the brothers are always more clear than the sisters. They are clear in the truth and in the fact, but they do not care much for experience. Perhaps Peter said to John, “Undoubtedly the Lord has resurrected from the dead. Let’s not waste time staying here. Let’s go back.” Although the two leading brothers went back, Mary, the foolish sister, remained, weeping. Mary might have said, “Who took the Lord away? I want to know where He is now.” But the two brothers could not help her. Many times in the church life the brothers cannot help the sisters. Thinking them to be foolish, we leave them where they are and go back home to rest. We are clear about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73895" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span>, having seen and believed the fact. Why must the sisters pray with tears and waste time? This is the real situation in every local church. All the leading brothers are the clear ones, and all the sisters are the weeping ones. Eventually, however, it is the foolish, weeping ones who have the experience. They do not care for the truth, the facts, or even for the faith. They only care for a real touch with the living Lord, declaring, “I don’t care about the wrapping. I only care for Him. I want to be with Him and touch Him. Tell me where you have put Him.” The sisters often pray this way in the prayer meeting. During the past forty years, I have been offended many times by these foolish, weeping prayers. But we brothers must learn not to blame or rebuke the sisters. We must appreciate the fact that we have so many foolish, weeping, seeking sisters, for they are the first to have the real experience of the Lord’s resurrection. </p>

<p data-content-id="7fkTGT1KmmDoykHcj4-sT_exLLBusIlFpNkxlpqD2Abt5CGw7IP8GFtf4BNL-5J_z"> We have seen that the Gospel of John is composed of two major sections. The first section, comprising <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73917" data-verses="John 1:1">chapters one through thirteen</span>, unveils the eternal Word incarnated coming to bring God into man. The second section, comprising <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73918" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen through twenty-one</span>, reveals Jesus crucified and Christ resurrected going to prepare the way to bring man into God, and as the Spirit coming to abide and live in the believers for the building of God’s habitation. In this second major section there are four subsections: life’s indwelling for the building of God’s habitation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73919" data-verses="John 14:1">14:1—16:33</span>); life’s prayer (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73920" data-verses="John 17:1-26">17:1-26</span>); life processed for multiplication (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73921" data-verses="John 18:1">18:1—20:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73922" data-verses="John 20:17">17</span>); and life in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73923" data-verses="John 20:14">20:14—21:25</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73924" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73925" data-verses="John 15:1">15</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73926" data-verses="John 16:1">16</span>, the Lord expounded how He would come into us to be our life and to be mingled and built together with us that there might be a mutual abode for God and man. This mingling of divinity with humanity is the very organism in which the Triune God grows and expresses Himself. After expounding this matter, the Lord prayed for it in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73927" data-verses="John 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>. After praying, He went through the process of examination, death, and resurrection. Having passed through the process and having come out of death, He is now the life in resurrection. When He is in resurrection, He is life as the Spirit, for He is the Spirit in resurrection. In this message we need to see how this life is now the Spirit in resurrection. </p>

APPEARING TO HIS SEEKER</h2><p data-content-id="BIN7s6C3jIrwhmOtBipQA3p98HXXDvzIG873PQJvi9ygFduggN23Zk5vk4njinT-6"> As life in resurrection, the Lord firstly appeared to His seeker (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73928" data-verses="John 20:14-18">20:14-18</span>). This was His first appearing after His <span class="pg" data-page-id="552" id="552">[552]</span> resurrection. Mary, however, could only see Him; she could not touch Him because the freshness of His resurrection was reserved for the Father. In His appearing to Mary, the Lord unfolded the revelation of the issue of His resurrection—the “brothers” and the “Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73929" data-verses="John 20:17">20:17</span>). This is the revelation of the brotherhood and the Fatherhood. In His resurrection, all His disciples have become His brothers, and His Father has become their Father. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xOo-j224Hj5u9Wh_B2oK7Pxj7GP-Eq9xBADShaZxPMlXAITSSXmqqrcQZSIT_Aurv">II. ASCENDING TO THE FATHER</h2><p data-content-id="rLGBtKAwOkfYXgIGKtTW7jwVg5s0ZxG50AlbMCy9cko_zYUvRELw3BdMHVjcPV4To"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73930" data-verses="John 20:17">20:17</span> the Lord Jesus said to Mary, “Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.” After He appeared in resurrection to His seeker, He secretly ascended to the Father on the day of resurrection. Many Christians have never seen this matter of the Lord’s secret ascension. Before the Lord ascended publicly in the sight of the disciples forty days later (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73931" data-verses="Acts 1:9-11">Acts 1:9-11</span>), He ascended secretly early in the morning of the day of His resurrection to the Father for the Father’s enjoyment and satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="ArkzpradNTw3GL-xp8ksTyple4mOhZEhE3jL4qTNcdMIIImpgNveMgKcBQ6CboAjM"> The Lord offered Himself to the Father as “a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest” for the “wave offering” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73932" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10-11">Lev. 23:10-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73933" data-verses="Leviticus 23:15">15</span>). According to the Old Testament, the harvest was taken to the barn, but the firstfruits were always brought into the temple as a wave offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73934" data-verses="Exodus 23:19">Exo. 23:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73935" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10-11">Lev. 23:10-11</span>). As we have seen, the wave offering, which was offered with a back-and-forth motion, typifies resurrection, and the heave offering, which was offered with an up-and-down motion, typifies ascension. The firstfruit, which was brought into the temple and offered in the presence of God as a wave offering, typifies Christ coming into the presence of God for His satisfaction early on the morning of the day of His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="FrmYRfBZSjDnCrN4pppEVlXkRWCSzB_rjmbpjuq-YT3hx3woVYQsuazFaPOeRv_-P"> Have you ever noticed that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73936" data-verses="Leviticus 23:11">Leviticus 23:11</span> speaks of “the sheaf”? A sheaf is not just one stock of harvested grain but many stocks which have been bound together. What is the significance of this? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73937" data-verses="Matthew 27:52-53">Matthew 27:52 and 53</span> say that after the Lord Jesus died, “the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after His resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared <span class="pg" data-page-id="553" id="553">[553]</span> unto many.” Thus, the firstfruits of resurrection were not only the Lord Himself, but also the others who had been raised from the dead. Together they were a sheaf. </p>

<p data-content-id="piHiQSgOUStVtrqyvHSWTGZ9Yfx9XL-jvmOyYyXYXCi31VAdk39LRDLmD7JuKz1I5"> Christ ascended to the heavens with a resurrected body, and now, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73944" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, He comes back to the disciples also with a resurrected body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73945" data-verses="Luke 24:37-40">Luke 24:37-40</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73946" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:44">1 Cor. 15:44</span>). With a resurrected body, the Lord came into the room where the disciples were with “the doors shut” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73947" data-verses="John 20:19">20:19</span>). Since the doors were shut, how could He enter with a body of bones and flesh? Our limited mentality cannot comprehend it, but it is a fact, and we must receive it according to the divine revelation. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73948" data-verses="Luke 24:37-40">Luke 24:37-40</span>, the Lord showed His disciples His physical body, and according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73949" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:44">1 Corinthians 15:44</span>, this body was a resurrected body. Consider the illustration of a carnation seed. A carnation seed has a tiny, round body. But when it has been planted and has grown out of the ground, it has a stem and a blossom. Is this not also a body? Before the carnation seed was sown into the ground, it had a little body. After growing out of the ground, it had a different body. This is exactly what Paul mentions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73950" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:44">1 Corinthians 15:44</span>: “It is sown a soulish body, it is raised a spiritual body.” The body is sown in one form and raised up from the ground in another form. The one sown is the original, natural body, and the one grown up is the resurrected body. After His resurrection, Christ had a resurrected body; yet it was physical and could still be touched. Even though the doors were shut, Christ entered into the room with this body. <span class="pg" data-page-id="554" id="554">[554]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vJzJG0X_ryJcmFgal6e54AY3uDbkeoRUBxT4ZWdjQGDJUapB8oOTU0vXOvnnlXEHm"> Although the Lord had a resurrected body, the prints of the nails were still in His hands and feet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73951" data-verses="John 20:20">20:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73952" data-verses="John 20:27">27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73953" data-verses="Luke 24:40">Luke 24:40</span>). Why did the resurrection not heal the prints, and why was His side still open? We do not understand it, but we know that it is so. Do not try to know so many things by your mentality. Do not trust in your limited ability to know, for there are a great many mysteries in this universe. Even we ourselves are a mystery. Tell me, where are your conscience and your soul? Are you able to locate your spirit? Many scientists refuse to believe in anything which they cannot see or understand. This is nonsense. I would ask those scientists if they have ever seen their conscience or their physical life. Although we have a physical life, we have never seen it. If we cannot understand ourselves, then how about the Triune God, the Divine Being? </p>

This was a fulfillment of the Lord’s promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73955" data-verses="John 16:19">16:19</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="73956" data-verses="John 16:22">22</span>, where He said, “You therefore now indeed have sorrow; but I shall see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.” Now the disciples saw the newborn “child” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73957" data-verses="John 16:21">16:21</span>), who was the resurrected Lord born in His resurrection as the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73958" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>). As we shall now see, this fulfillment by His coming back to His disciples brought them five blessings: His presence, His peace, His commission, the Holy Spirit, and the authority to represent Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="73959" data-verses="John 20:23">v. 23</span>). </p>

Peace is something which is often brought to us in the meetings. Many times we need to come to the meetings before we can have peace. The Lord brought peace to the church. Hence, we must attend the meetings, for it is in the meetings that we enjoy peace. <span class="pg" data-page-id="555" id="555">[555]</span> </p>

In the heavens, He is the Advocate with the Father; in our spirit He is the Comforter. This is why He is the ladder upon whom the angels of God are ascending and descending (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74043" data-verses="John 1:51">1:51</span>). As the ascended Lord, He is our Paraclete with the Father, taking care of our case in the heavens. As the indwelling Spirit, He is the “Paraclete with us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74044" data-verses="John 14:16-17">14:16-17</span>), the One alongside of us who is taking care of us. How I appreciate Him as the Comforter! He is both here and there at the same time. </p>

Before Christ’s resurrection, the Spirit was just the Spirit of God having only the divine element.

<p data-content-id="Yb8KD0TEIsrERldUqFGHHwNpGwNXPZgTUQSWnXv9XEEyrD-PFldCdx1u3tLElwVtE"> Our God today is the “processed” God; He is no longer the same as He was. Before His incarnation, He was only God with His divinity. By passing through the steps of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, He has become the “processed” God. Please do not reject this concept or attempt to argue with it. In eternity past, He was God. One day, He was incarnated as a man and lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through the experiences of human life. Was that not a process? Then He was put to death by being nailed to a cross. He entered death, visited it, passed through it, and eventually walked out of it. Was that not also a process? Certainly it was. Consider the process which the Passover lamb passed through. As the real Passover Lamb, Christ also has passed through a process. Through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the very God is now different from what He was before the incarnation. Never again will He be the same as He was in creation. In creation He was merely God, the Divine Being. But after passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, what a God He has become! Now He is God not only with divinity but also with humanity, human living, the all-inclusive crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. He is now such a wonderful Person with divinity, humanity, and so many virtues, <span class="pg" data-page-id="563" id="563">[563]</span> attributes, and attainments. This is our God today who reaches us and enters into us as the all-inclusive Spirit. This is the processed God for our enjoyment. Today we are enjoying such a processed God. Although some Christians may criticize me for using the term “processed,” the more they attempt to write books criticizing it, the more they will see the light. The truth is the truth. We are enjoying the “processed” God, and this “processed” God today is the life in resurrection. The very reality of this resurrection is the life-giving Spirit. Hence, the life-giving Spirit is the life in resurrection. Praise Him that after His resurrection, He became the life in resurrection which is the Spirit of the glorified Jesus. </p>

The Spirit of Jesus mainly refers to the Spirit of the Lord as a man living on earth and passing through all the human sufferings for the accomplishment of our redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74052" data-verses="Acts 16:7">Acts 16:7</span>). The Spirit of Christ mainly refers to the Spirit of the Lord resurrected as the divine Person with the uplifted humanity who dwells in our spirit as our life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74053" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Rom. 8:9</span>). The Spirit of Jesus Christ indicates that the Spirit today is the all-inclusive Spirit of the Lord as God and as man, including His divinity, His humanity, His human living, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and His ascension with all His divine attributes, human virtues, and attainments in His achievements. Hence, this all-inclusive Spirit has “the bountiful supply” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74054" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Phil. 1:19</span>). Regardless of what situation we are in and what need we may have, this all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, can render the proper supply to meet our need. While the apostle Paul wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74055" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Philippians 1:19</span>, he was suffering imprisonment. Under that kind of situation, he experienced the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit of the suffering Jesus and the resurrected Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="564" id="564">[564]</span> </p>

Therefore, now the Lord is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74058" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). The Lord has taken two steps in order to become our experience. In the first step of incarnation, He took the form of the flesh with the blood for accomplishing redemption for us. In the second step of resurrection, He was transfigured into the form of the Spirit for imparting Himself into us as our life. Through all these, we have been redeemed and regenerated to partake of Him as our life and our everything. </p>

This is for the life in John’s line. For the power in Luke’s line, the Spirit is likened to a mighty wind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74061" data-verses="Acts 2:2-4">Acts 2:2-4</span>) blowing upon the disciples. In John’s line, the Spirit is likened to the breath of life breathed into the disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74062" data-verses="John 20:22">20:22</span>) and abiding in them as their life.

Here we see that the Lord gave His disciples the authority to represent Him in forgiving people, granting them the authority to bind and loose. This is the authority to forgive people or to keep them under condemnation. Although the disciples had this authority, it was not to be exercised in themselves, but in the Holy Spirit. When we are in the Holy Spirit and filled with the Holy Spirit, we have the authority to decide whether or not a person is forgiven by <span class="pg" data-page-id="565" id="565">[565]</span> God. If we say that he has been forgiven, it must be so. But this authority can only be exercised when we are in the Holy Spirit and filled with the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, this authority must be in the fellowship of the Body and for the fellowship of the Body. It is in the fellowship of the Body that we have this authority to represent the Lord in forgiving people. This is also for the Body, that we, representing the Lord, may receive the God-forgiven people into the church, His Body. </p>

<p data-content-id="e1F2-TvVX-Wo06SOgDShnvB0AkxrzvfUAe3pb0V0IGQJ7M_YNjzT3VkMpObkgjnuy"> The intention of the Holy Spirit in writing the Gospel of John was to show us that we have been made the sons of God by the resurrection of Christ. This is wonderful and glorious. We human beings were worthless, sinful, low, mean, and dirty. But by the Lord’s death and resurrection, we have been made the sons of God. We have the life of God, the nature of God, and the fullness of God. Thus, we are the sons of God, just like the only begotten Son of God. How wonderful! The Lord has given us the glory which the Father gave Him from eternity past. What is this glory? It is the life and nature of God which we have received and which make us the sons of God for the expression of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="5w-j5wr_UufC5LfaAxbLfmANbg8EjHeZRqKuWbOgeqQ6qwIVYLcWYffP9g4uA2B9B"> Being the sons of God simply means to be the expression and the manifestation of God. In other words, Christ is the Son of God who has the life and nature of God and who is the very manifestation of God. This is the glory which God the Father has given to the Son, and it is the glory which the Lord has given us by His death and resurrection. By His death and resurrection, the Lord released Himself and imparted Himself into us so as to make us exactly the same as He is. He is the Son of God, and He has made us to be the sons of God. He has the life and the nature of God, and He has made us to have the life and the nature of God. He is the very expression and manifestation of God, and He has made us to be the expression and manifestation of God. Therefore, we have the same life, nature, and position that He has. This is the glory which the Lord has given us. It is truly wonderful! </p>
<p data-content-id="N4fmiTCMCnn3CkIWRPmYrivDgyhJ12fvZLXKozkGfvmkz7BV-BxJS1lJhf9hBkG1i"> As we have seen, the Lord sends us just as the Father sent <span class="pg" data-page-id="574" id="574">[574]</span> Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74107" data-verses="John 20:21">20:21</span>). The Father sent Him by being in Him and by being one with Him. Likewise, Christ sends us by being in us and by being one with us. Now we are the expression and the manifestation of God because the Son of God has been imparted into us and is now within us. Since He is now the Spirit, He is within us and is one with us. Hence, we have what He has, we are where He is, and we are exactly the same as He is. Consequently, He could send us and give us the divine and heavenly commission. This is the purpose of God which was designed in eternity past. God’s eternal purpose is simply to work Himself into us, mingling Himself with us so that we may become His expression and manifestation. </p>
<p data-content-id="t85mbqhlppdvhDFBItXtPJ-RvnuiSAQMtG9rBXOBr1lposGVhLl__LaYVRkVvwPem"> The Lord has accomplished all this by His death and resurrection. He was the one grain of wheat which was multiplied into many grains by death and resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74108" data-verses="John 12:24">12:24</span>). He was the only begotten Son who has been duplicated and multiplied into many sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74109" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10">Heb. 2:10</span>). By His resurrection He multiplied Himself, and after His resurrection He revealed to Mary that the disciples were now His brothers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74110" data-verses="John 20:17">20:17</span>). He was the only begotten Son, but now He has become the firstborn Son of many sons. Before His death, He was the only Son of God without any brothers. But after His resurrection, the only begotten Son became “the Firstborn among many brothers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74111" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). Consider the illustration of a grain of wheat. After it falls into the ground and dies, it is resurrected and multiplied into many grains. Where is the original grain of wheat? It is now in the many grains. In fact, it even is the many grains. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74112" data-verses="John 12:1">chapter twelve</span> Christ was the one grain, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74113" data-verses="John 20:1">chapter twenty</span> He became the many grains. This was made possible only by death and resurrection. Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74114" data-verses="John 18:1">chapter eighteen</span>, He was the only begotten Son of God, the only manifestation of God. Throughout the whole universe and among the entire human race, there was only one Person who was the very image and manifestation of God. But after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74115" data-verses="John 18:1">chapters eighteen and nineteen</span>, we have many sons of God and many manifestations of God. Through the death and resurrection of the only begotten Son of God, the many sons have been produced. The one grain has now <span class="pg" data-page-id="575" id="575">[575]</span> been multiplied into the many grains. Thus, all the Lord’s disciples have become His brothers. These brothers can now be the very manifestation of God and can now represent the Triune God. They have been committed with the divine, heavenly mission to do something on this earth whereby they can express and manifest God. This is the meaning of the Gospel of John. </p>
<p data-content-id="hXua0_pW3f46EmITm-c0ZDvYjnS6MIc9iKH126QEiPABeTlJOgF_otvYI038EQlw6"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74116" data-verses="John 20:1">chapter twenty</span>, everything is wonderful and complete. It seems that we have touched upon something divine, spiritual, heavenly, eternal, and beyond our conception, and that there is no need for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74117" data-verses="John 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>. What is the meaning and purpose of this additional chapter? By the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74118" data-verses="John 20:1">chapter twenty</span>, the Lord has come back as the Spirit to be with the disciples and to be everything to them. Therefore, this Gospel is closed there (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74119" data-verses="John 20:30-31">20:30-31</span>). Thus far, this Gospel presents something divine, but we are human. It reveals something heavenly, but we are still on earth. It unfolds something eternal, but we are still in time. In other words, although we have been born again as the sons of God, we are still in this physical body. We are the sons of God, yet we are still the sons of man. We have been committed with the heavenly commission, but we still must provide food for our eating and our living. How can the disciples make a living? What should they do to carry out the Lord’s commission? How should they follow Him after His resurrection? What will be their future? An additional chapter is needed to deal with these problems. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74120" data-verses="John 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> covers some very practical matters. We cannot always just sit here, praising the Lord and shouting, “Hallelujah, everything is wonderful, heavenly, divine, and eternal! Oh, now we are the sons of God! We have the life and the nature of God, we have the glory of God, and we are the representatives and manifestation of God!” But what about tomorrow? What shall we eat? Where shall we obtain money to buy food? We cannot fast all the time. Because of these additional problems, we have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74121" data-verses="John 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> to help us take care of our living, our family, and the many other things on this earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="2Q5ugYZO8sPp0Oav2VE7YwK3TFSV7Nsfngw8PljfG3IHcn7hxi9igE-N15TGlXeJl"> If we compare the levels of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74122" data-verses="John 20:1">chapters twenty and twenty-one</span>, we shall see that the level of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74123" data-verses="John 20:1">chapter twenty</span> is very high, <span class="pg" data-page-id="576" id="576">[576]</span> but that the level of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74124" data-verses="John 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> seems quite low. The reason for this is that the last chapter deals with such practical matters as our living and eating. How we earn a living is very practical. We need to understand the reason for having <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74125" data-verses="John 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74126" data-verses="John 20:1">chapter twenty</span>, for having an additional chapter after the conclusion. This chapter simply shows that after we have been wonderfully and divinely regenerated as the sons of God, we are still in this world, we are still on this earth, we are still in time, we still have some practical needs, and we still have some practical problems which must be solved. Because of this, the Holy Spirit continues to write another chapter. </p>

The Lord allowed him to utterly fail by denying Him to His face three times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74170" data-verses="John 18:17">18:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74171" data-verses="John 18:25">25</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74172" data-verses="John 18:27">27</span>) so that his natural strength and his self-confidence might be dealt with. Furthermore, Peter had just taken the lead in backsliding from the Lord’s call. <span class="pg" data-page-id="586" id="586">[586]</span> His natural confidence in his love toward the Lord must also have been dealt with by this failure. Since he might have been somewhat disappointed, the Lord came to restore his love toward Him, to charge him with the shepherding of His church, and to prepare him for his martyrdom, so that he would not follow Him with any confidence in his natural strength. </p>
<p data-content-id="N4fmiTCMCnn3CkIWRP2YtwfDgyhJ12fvZLXKozkGfvmkz7BV-BxJS1lJhf9hBkG1i"> When the Lord spoke to Peter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74173" data-verses="John 21:15-17">21:15-17</span>, He did not call him “Peter,” which was his regenerated name, the new name of his regenerated person. The Lord called him “Simon.” Simon was his old name, the name depicting his natural person. Because Peter was still a natural person, the Lord asked him, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?” The reason the Lord asked him this question first was because Peter had boldly told the Lord on the eve of His betrayal that he would not give up the Lord, even though all the other disciples would forsake Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74174" data-verses="Matthew 26:33">Matt. 26:33</span>). Peter had said that he would follow the Lord unto death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74175" data-verses="John 13:37">John 13:37</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74176" data-verses="Matthew 26:35">Matt. 26:35</span>). By saying this, Peter made himself different from the other disciples. Yes, he was different from them—in his weakness, not in his strength. When the Lord asked him, “Do you love Me more than these?” the Lord was reminding Peter of what he was. He was a man so self-confident and proud. </p>
<p data-content-id="t85mbqhlppdvhDFBItHtGb-RvnuiSAQMtG9rBXOBr1lposGVhLl__LaYVRkVvwPem"> Peter’s love toward the Lord was precious, but his natural strength had to be dealt with. Peter’s strength was dealt with in two ways: in his denying the Lord and in his taking the lead to backslide from the Lord’s call. Peter failed the first test by denying the Lord three times, and he failed the second test by going fishing. The reason the disciples went fishing was because they were without food. When Abraham was in Canaan, he also was tested by the same problem and went down to Egypt because of the famine. In the same principle, Peter and the other disciples went to the sea to fish, being tested by the lack of food. Peter thought that he was strong, and able to withstand any test, even death itself. He had told the Lord that he would follow Him even unto death. Thus, the Lord tested Peter twice, and Peter failed both tests. <span class="pg" data-page-id="587" id="587">[587]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="hXua0_pW3f46EmITm-M0RR_YjnS6MIc9iKH126QEiPABeTlJOgF_otvYI038EQlw6"> How did the Lord deal with Peter’s natural strength? By temporarily taking His hand off him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74177" data-verses="John 10:28">10:28</span>, the Lord said that no one is able to snatch the believers out of His hand. When Peter betrayed the Lord, denying Him to His face three times, it meant that the Lord had taken His hand off him for a while. The Lord seemed to be saying, “Peter, you have too much confidence in yourself. You don’t know that your standing depends upon My holding you in My hand. If I don’t hold you, you cannot stand. Let Me take My hand away for a while and see if you are able to stand.” Then the Lord stood back a little, and Peter fell. Do not think that you have the power to stand. No, an unseen hand upholds us all the time. I appreciate the fact that throughout the years, and even now, many saints have been praying for me. In my fellowship with the Lord in the spirit, I have the deep sense and appreciation that so many dear ones are praying for me. By myself, I cannot stand. By myself, I cannot minister. I know the source of the power of ministry. And I know that the source of the strength to stand is not in me—it is in Him. We all need to realize this. Because Peter was so strong, having too much confidence in himself, the Lord was forced to temporarily remove His hand. As a result, Peter fell and denied the Lord three times. Moreover, Peter could not stand the test of his daily living and took the lead to backslide to the sea. Perhaps Peter thought that he had reason to do this because, at that point, he had not seen the supply of the Lord. Nevertheless, by his backsliding Peter was exposed. The Lord withdrew His hand for a little while, and Peter was fully exposed. This was the Lord’s dealing. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uj2hgxuYFe-UC_235vNo7wgrEPXe5jTUAOGzaPqIwSAQiBsHQoHWtKOYJParAMEVp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74178" data-verses="John 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>, Peter was humble and very low. Undoubtedly he was quite disappointed. Thus, the Lord came in to recover, strengthen, and restore him. It is quite meaningful that, in front of all the other disciples, the Lord asked Peter, “Do you love Me more than these?” The Lord seemed to be saying, “Simon, have you forgotten that a few days ago you said, in the presence of all the others, that although they would forsake Me, you would follow Me to death? That was your word. Now, Simon, I ask you if you love Me more than these do?” If I had been Peter, I would not have had the face <span class="pg" data-page-id="588" id="588">[588]</span> to say anything. Peter simply replied, “Yes, Lord, You know that I love You” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74179" data-verses="John 21:15">v. 15</span>). Peter could not answer the Lord with a clear word, for he was in a very perplexing situation. He did not say, “Lord, I love You,” or, “Lord, I don’t love You.” How would you have answered the Lord if you had been Peter? Would you have said, “Yes, Lord, I love You more than all of these”? Would you have said, “Lord, I’m sorry I don’t love You,” or, “Lord, I’m sorry that I boasted and was unable to fulfill it”? Peter had lost his self-confidence and could say nothing except, “Lord, You know that I love You.” In other words, Peter seemed to be saying, “I don’t know whether I love You or not. Lord, You know. If I say that I love You, I know that this does not mean anything. Formerly, I told You that I loved You, but I failed. In fact, You told me that I would fail and deny You three times, and it was so. Now, Lord, it is up to You. You know—I don’t.” Here we see a man who had become a tested and broken person. </p>

The apostle John not only wrote the Gospel of John but also his Epistles and the book of Revelation. His writings are of three important categories. The Gospel of John is for the imparting of life, his Epistles are for the fellowship of life which is for God’s building, and the Revelation is for the consummation of God’s building. Thus, there are three stages of spiritual matters in his writings. The first stage is that of life imparting, the second stage is that of spiritual growth and building, and the last stage is that of maturity and the completion of God’s building. Therefore, after studying the Gospel of John, which is related to the first stage of spiritual matters, we must at least mention something about the second stage of spiritual growth and about the third stage of maturity and conclusion. Revelation is not an easy book, but we can still receive something about the ultimate conclusion, or ultimate completion, of God’s dealings throughout the generations. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Zo9dN5yT4RaGVzmhbQ-jVJLwO4N0OSuZjtDQf5M2EBBxv1xMr6YswtQOIRp7t2MTg">HIS COMING AND HIS GOING</h2><p data-content-id="ArkzpradNTw3GL-xo9EsUgJle4mOhZEhE3jL4qTNcdMIIImpgNveMgKcBQ6CboAjM"> We have seen that John’s Gospel is divided into two parts: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74216" data-verses="John 1:1">chapters one through thirteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74217" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen through twenty-one</span>. As we have pointed out, in the first part the Lord as the Son of God came to bring God to man, and in the second part He went to bring man to God. In other words, the first part reveals that the Lord is the manifestation of God who came to man, brought God to man, and mingled God with man. The little man named Jesus is the mingling of the very God with man; He is the unity of God with man. In Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="596" id="596">[596]</span> and through Him, God is one with man. In the little man named Jesus we see God (God is with Him), and we see man (man is with God). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74218" data-verses="Matthew 1:23">Matthew 1:23</span> Jesus is referred to as Emmanuel, which means God with us, or God with man. By His incarnation, God has mingled Himself with man. This refers to the Lord’s coming. </p>
<p data-content-id="FrmYRfBZSjDnCrN4ooJET3nkRWCSzB_rjmbpjuq-YT3hx3woVYQsuazFaPOeRv_-P"> The second part of this Gospel refers to the Lord’s going. Firstly, He came from God to man. Then He went from man to God and brought man into God. His death and resurrection prepared the way for man to be brought into God. Fallen man was separated from God and was a great distance from Him. But by His death the Lord eliminated the distance and all the hindrances which separated man from God. Now, through Christ’s death and by His blood, man can be brought into the presence of God—and not only into the presence of God, but also into God Himself. By His death and resurrection, the Lord not only went back to God from man; He also went to God with man and brought man into God. Therefore, by His coming, God is mingled with man, and by His going, man is brought into God. By the Lord’s coming and going, God and man, man and God, are mingled together as one. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CXFd3_7Beuoz4J7tU-OFn1fQJa0_7BGOuSsi20bXHzK-QSP-l9xYLfC6UjhBDbvE3">GOD IN MAN</h2><p data-content-id="P_4KtsGyNhSbk86m-nYb2qHDwZ4sTm7hLI0PKhfCaFxOEgwCSzcqA_f6HNvLOq6uZ"> There is another way of looking at this Gospel: it may be divided into three parts. The first part, composed of the first seventeen chapters, reveals that God is manifested in man. The first seventeen chapters present a picture showing that the very God Himself, the almighty, infinite, unlimited, and eternal God, has been manifested in a man. These chapters are a history of a man, a real man of flesh and blood, a man named Jesus who lived on earth and manifested God. When the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a man, He did not live by the life of man; He lived by another life, the life of God. In these seventeen chapters we do not see a human life lived out through this man; rather, we see a divine life lived out through Him. Thus, the unlimited and infinite God was manifested through this little man. It is for this reason that the Lord told people many times that He did not speak of Himself but of the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74219" data-verses="John 12:49">12:49</span>). Whatever He spoke was of <span class="pg" data-page-id="597" id="597">[597]</span> the Father, for it was the Father speaking in Him. Furthermore, whatever He did was not of Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74220" data-verses="John 5:30">5:30</span>). He did everything in and by the Father, for the Father was working in Him. Because He lived, not by man’s life, but by God’s life, God was manifested in and through Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zBGhA3590E7XPL6iZO__E_OBnKECgCDATp-tFcRb9BVVdo8R8xctsKXmFfAC4TlQd">LIFE IN DEATH</h2><p data-content-id="a9NrvhD6wW1hRS7-lnwmrDF1fb7DU8q1AZlxJz81s5YFPu5MILIeqJhyavV3tDNAj"> If we would divide this Gospel into three parts, the second part would consist of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74221" data-verses="John 18:1">chapters eighteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74222" data-verses="John 19:1">nineteen</span>. In these two chapters we see a picture of how the Lord was arrested, brought to trial, sentenced to death, and crucified on the cross. But we must realize that this picture is a revelation of life manifested through death. In the first part of this Gospel, God is manifested in man; in the second part, life is manifested in death. Everything that happened to the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74223" data-verses="John 18:1">chapters eighteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74224" data-verses="John 19:1">nineteen</span> was an aspect of death. Judas’ betrayal of the Lord, his bringing the soldiers to arrest the Lord, the judgment before the high priest and Pilate, the cruel treatment of the Lord, the false sentence against Him, and His being nailed to the cross—all were aspects of death. Nevertheless, all that happened to the Lord in these chapters did not put Him to death. If we say that the Lord was put to death, we are wrong. The Lord went into death voluntarily. Just as He was God coming into man, so now He is life going into death. As He was God manifested in man, so here He is life manifested in death. </p>
<p data-content-id="btOmTWeLFFpscfgnJw8K5BYbahrI2rT3IwVxeSAiE7B_1vo4eGvaKTJstwR_ZClRW"> Throughout the whole universe, nothing other than God is more powerful than death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74225" data-verses="Song of Songs 8:6">S. S. 8:6</span>). It is so powerful that no one can resist it. Only the God of resurrection can overcome it. Whenever death comes to a person, it is merciless, strong, and cruel. It does not care about your wife, children, or family. Therefore, everyone is afraid of death and no one would go into it voluntarily. Who would willingly offer himself to be visited by death? But in these two chapters we see that the Lord Jesus went into death willingly. He chose to go to the garden and to deliver Himself into the hands of the people. Knowing that His captors would come to the garden to seize Him, He went there deliberately for the purpose of being arrested. In doing this He showed that He is life. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="598" id="598">[598]</span> only way in which life can be manifested is by entering into death. In and by death, the real life is manifested. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74226" data-verses="John 12:24">12:24</span> the Lord referred to Himself as a grain of wheat. How do we know that there is life in a grain of wheat? We know it by putting the grain of wheat into death. By burying the grain of wheat in the earth, that is, in death, we see that life comes out. Thus, the life in the grain of wheat is manifested through death. If you bury a grain of sand in the earth, nothing will come out because there is no life in it. Hence, death is the means by which life is manifested. </p>
<p data-content-id="qVbKRqoOAGu3MGxnU3KfH4BOYKQQJ683fkFd9Unt-pau-YfKbohX26ar8pj6Ztet-"> As we have pointed out, everything the Lord Jesus experienced in these two chapters was an aspect of death. But the Lord, being life, was not afraid to die. He was never frightened nor troubled by death. Rather, He victoriously met every threat and attack of death. Even when the disciples were attempting to rescue Him, He told them not to resist, saying, “Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74227" data-verses="John 18:11">18:11</span>). When the Lord Jesus asked those who came to arrest Him whom they were seeking and they answered, “Jesus the Nazarene,” He said, “I am” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74228" data-verses="John 18:5-6">18:5-6</span>). When He said, “I am,” His captors, terrified by this word, “drew back and fell to the ground” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74229" data-verses="John 18:6">18:6</span>). This proves that if the Lord had been unwilling to deliver Himself up to them, they could never have arrested Him. Moreover, as the soldiers were arresting the Lord, He easily and calmly took care of the disciples, saying, “If therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74230" data-verses="John 18:8">18:8</span>). All this reveals that the Lord was the life manifested in death and that death could do nothing to Him. </p>

We are not simply those who have been redeemed, forgiven, justified, reconciled, and saved. We are actually a part of Christ! If we view the illustration from this angle, we shall realize how profound it is. Christ is the very embodiment of God, and we are pitiful, corrupted, fallen, and even devilish sinners. How could such sinners have become a part of Christ? Nevertheless, as profound as it may seem, we are truly a part of Him. </p>

Hence, the organism in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74261" data-verses="John 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> is not merely an organism of Christ, but of the Triune God. </p>

The Spirit is the sap, the life juice, in the vine. Therefore, we see that the Trinity comprises this organism, which includes us. The organism of the vine is constituted not only with divinity, but also with humanity. Praise the Lord that this universal organism is composed of both the Triune God and us! In fact, we are the crucial part of this organism. This is a matter of great significance. </p>

An organism is an organic body containing life and having organs. Many Christians think of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74263" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> merely as a parable used by the Lord to describe our relationship with Him. But it is not merely a parable; it is a reality that reveals the focus of God’s intention. God is life, and life needs an organic body in which to grow and express itself. Even the life element within the seed of a flower needs an organic body. The seed is the organic body whereby the life within it can grow and be fully expressed. God desires to grow within an organic body and to have Himself expressed by means of that body. This body is the organism of Christ and the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="n8WSh8WU2BdpsjVRGDdTN4J5SG8QBnYwKIXlL0q3eeAFANq7Mk2tNf7lfC_nB1Vr0"> The focus of the Bible is God as life growing in an organic body. This means that God is the growing life and that the growing life needs an organism, an organic body, in which God can grow and through which He can express Himself. We have been told that God was our Creator, the object of <span class="pg" data-page-id="607" id="607">[607]</span> our worship, and that we, the creatures, had to worship Him. Although this is not wrong, it is a very superficial understanding of the revelation in the Bible. It is definitely not the inner content of the focus of God’s revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="65XEpihaZD6ISNAVP6qJxxFYFIvvJdVmQZ8Nms4k0sV2bawyzQ5gp4-b5hMWcG5LI"> The inner content of the divine focus is that God is not only our Creator and the object of our worship, but that He is life. Life does not require worship. How foolish it would be to put a carnation seed on the table and worship it! If you did this and the carnation seed could speak, it would say, “Stupid man! What are you doing? The more you worship me, the more I suffer. Instead of worshipping me, please sow me into the soil. If you do this, I will be happy.” Ultimately, God is not the object of our worship; He is life and He desires to grow in an organic body so that He may be expressed. </p>

Through creation, He formed a spirit within man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74264" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zech. 12:1</span>). Because we have a spirit, we can receive God into us. God has also accomplished the work of redemption, and eventually, He became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74265" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). Now He is not only the Creator and Redeemer—He is the very <em>pneuma,</em> the life-giving Spirit, for us to contact Him. The moment we contact Him, He comes directly into our spirit. The entering of this Spirit into our spirit makes us part of this organic body. Now God is growing within us so that He may be expressed. This is the Lord’s desire today. </p>
<p data-content-id="wdYDXrVTBi16uQIJCdAKB-fFAbXHIhsQrac_ssNkW8MNVZd8_yYP9-uGMvsFev98q"> If we see that we are part of this divine organism in which God is growing and through which He is being expressed, so many things will fade away. All our religious concepts regarding worship will disappear. God does not care for our concepts; He wants to be the life growing within us that He may be expressed through us. This is the organism revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74266" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>. </p>

It is much higher than what is commonly considered the Christian life. If we would gain any understanding of what it means to bear fruit by the overflow of life, we need to see an all-inclusive picture of John’s Gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zo9dN5yT4RaGVzmhbQujSb7wO4N0OSuZjtDQf5M2EBBxv1xMr6YswtQOIRp7t2MTg"> This Gospel begins with the words, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” One day, the Word became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74268" data-verses="John 1:14">1:14</span>), and this flesh was the Lamb of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74269" data-verses="John 1:29">1:29</span>). When the Lord was crucified, He was not only the Lamb to accomplish redemption; He was also in the form of the serpent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74270" data-verses="John 3:14">3:14</span>). He was lifted up on the cross that He might deal with Satan, the old serpent. In His death He was not only in the form of the Lamb and the serpent, but also in the form of a grain of wheat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74271" data-verses="John 12:24">12:24</span>). As a grain of wheat, He died to produce the many grains, which include all of us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74272" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span> says, “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.” This life was the light of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74273" data-verses="John 8:12">8:12</span>). When the Word became flesh, He was full of grace and reality, truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="ArkzpradNTw3GL-xo9UsQyJle4mOhZEhE3jL4qTNcdMIIImpgNveMgKcBQ6CboAjM"> Thus far, we have ten significant words: the Word, God, flesh, Lamb, serpent, grain, life, light, grace, and truth. Christ was the Word, who was God and who became flesh. This flesh was the Lamb who was crucified for our redemption. In His crucifixion Christ was in the form of the serpent to destroy the devil, and in His death He fell into the ground as a grain of wheat to produce many grains. These many grains now have His life. This life has become their light. To them, this life is grace, and this light brings them reality. </p>
