<p data-content-id="RGCXnHgT_rEpVWXhBecEClbU60h1ObmEH_mbzcFdz0zzLSdYPtiyBuccoMjwH8zcE"> The subject of 1 Peter is the Christian life under the government of God. The book of 2 Peter is a continuation of 1 Peter, and it also emphasizes God’s government. However, in this Epistle we also see God’s provision. Therefore, we may say that the subject of 2 Peter is the divine provision and the divine government. </p>
<p data-content-id="sPZQZqcAzvuJSQXQ89xi_SILV1omyRcwrAR2Dx0Ak3HGwUH4bvmBqduKIVabe89xw"> With God’s government there is God’s provision. God grants us His provision so that we may cooperate with His government. In other words, if we would carry out God’s government, we need God’s provision; that is, we need the divine supply. In 2 Peter the writer first presents the divine supply. We see how God’s power provides all the supply for our need. This is the main significance of this book. Furthermore, the Epistle of 2 Peter shows us a continuation of the picture of God’s government unveiled in 1 Peter. Therefore, what we have in 2 Peter is the divine provision and the divine government. </p>

Simon refers to his old man by birth; Peter, to his new man by regeneration. The two <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> names are combined here as one to signify that the old man, Simon, has now become the new man, Peter. </p>
<p data-content-id="OtJdQofpqbOnICfMhqbwnHZn2K6higD03n30mdILDdGCxPHftPcK4Hnez2fu8tkLh"> The name Simon Peter may be an allusion to the old universe and the new universe. This Epistle indicates that under God’s government the old universe will be changed into the new universe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101943" data-verses="2Peter 3:10-13">3:10-13</span>). We may say that the new heaven and new earth are represented by Peter and that the old universe is represented by Simon. In the four Gospels we see Simon as the old man representing the old creation. Now in Peter’s Epistles we see a new man, a new person, representing the new universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="4V_X33TLt8nJffNPUwLgMuiDTrCnE2kI0fTZC2cfT1AdAWZDoyA6D4JOMoDi00mDr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101944" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">1:1</span> Peter refers to himself as “a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ.” In the first Epistle he mentions only that he is an apostle; he does not say anything about being a slave. But here Peter says that he is both a slave and an apostle of Jesus Christ. The word “slave” indicates Peter’s submission to the Lord, and the word “apostle,” the Lord’s commission to him. Submission and commission imply a two-way traffic between us and the Lord. When we submit ourselves to Him, He will commit something to us. With a slave there is submission, but with an apostle there is the Lord’s commission. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101946" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>, Peter refers to them as “the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.” </p>
<p data-content-id="GXoC5fvxHmc4uQenKb_5fXkGt3kvqUPLzjslntsAUByGAPVIniV9JiNrmt2wwSGSl"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101947" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>, Peter speaks of those “who have been allotted like precious faith.” As the children of Israel were allotted a piece of the good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101948" data-verses="Joshua 14:1-5">Josh. 14:1-5</span>), we have been allotted like precious faith. This implies that all the things which relate to life and godliness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101949" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">2 Pet. 1:3</span>), including the divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101950" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">v. 4</span>) partaken of by the believers through the like precious faith according to the precious and exceedingly great promises, are the real inheritance given to the believers by God in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="cdtvXCbPGcaG2FTGJdHSkOUFNN0WqhX2T_XbKIpqhw9kSmOmIVLEqwmQffG2WHScn"> The children of Israel with their twelve tribes were to possess the good land. The Lord told Joshua to make an <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> allotment of land to each of the twelve tribes. This was done through the Urim and the Thummim, which were on the breastplate worn by the high priest. By means of the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim, God could speak to His people. God used the Urim and the Thummim to reveal His will. It was through the Urim and the Thummim that Joshua came to know God’s instructions concerning which lot should go to each tribe. Once again, Peter uses an Old Testament term to describe a New Testament reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="YAgXYCd3xICwcjcOMT_R1KpfUtaNC0Po9MwGwTcBc0Rp5YjRWpXGlGve_IeOYufZS"> We know that the good land, the portion of the children of Israel in Old Testament times, typifies the all-inclusive Christ. Now, according to the New Testament, our portion is Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101951" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Colossians 1:12</span> refers to Christ as our portion: “Giving thanks to the Father, who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.” As the good land was the portion of the Old Testament saints, so Christ is the portion of the New Testament believers. Furthermore, in the Old Testament the good land was allotted to the twelve tribes, and in the New Testament precious faith is allotted to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="EOzyo_Xf9QpqGtiXm-z0cd7gVTu2G66jmYr2-Ld78dSeS4uxlA-r2KOfVkVBoROju"> The phrase “allotted like precious faith” causes a difficult problem for translation and exposition. How can faith be our allotted portion? According to the Bible, Christ is our portion. This means that it is Christ who has been allotted to us. But here Peter says that we have been allotted like precious faith. How are we to understand this? To speak of Christ being our portion may be somewhat doctrinal. It is more experiential to say that faith is our portion. If Christ is merely Christ to us and not also faith, we would not be able to participate in Him or share in Him. In order for us to partake of Christ, He must become our faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="DGUy1EmW61uiJBQNnxyXCaEoFLSVcfxz9pRLHVcEyOBLSK0TzyVI3bQMSbNUgtm_c"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101952" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">1:1</span> Peter speaks of the allotment of “like” precious faith. The Greek word rendered “like” literally means of equal value or honor; hence, equally precious. It does not mean equal in measure, but equal in value and honor to all the receivers. All the portions of the precious faith are equal not in measure, quantity, but equal in quality. For example, the portion of the good land allotted to each of the twelve tribes differed in size. Judah received a larger portion than Benjamin did. But although the allotments were different in <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> size, they were equal in quality. The quality of the land was the same for each tribe. For this reason, each allotment was equally precious. The principle is the same with the like precious faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="SJb5jOJTyB0FPj-zRjoG0ZPRkkwv6omiVCOlphfo_IUTsigciWswzw5D5k9jHaNMF"> We have seen that our portion today includes all things which relate to life and godliness. This includes the divine nature, of which the believers partake through the like precious faith according to the precious and exceedingly great promises. All these elements put together make up our portion. Please remember that our allotment comprises all things relating to life and godliness, including the divine nature partaken of by us. All this is the inheritance given by God to those who believe in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUYlZSxqwvOg1WN5_8XutUiIERbDczHL5ri_BVwKVvGoVZ0GfVaeYrhAQMKj3NpSo"> What is our real inheritance? Our inheritance is all things relating to life inwardly and godliness outwardly. Our portion includes the divine nature, of which we partake through the common faith, which is equally precious. When we put together these different items—faith, divine nature, precious and exceedingly great promises, life, and godliness—we have the totality of our allotted inheritance. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGkZIB2jqZCDz00Fw7zsx78hSa-kgkrb9zCU0WVCu1_Jy0rc4BqntEZbuDBuZHp7Q"> Peter also says that the believers have been allotted like precious faith “with us.” The pronoun “us” refers to the apostle Peter and all the other believers in the Jewish land. All the believers in the Gentile world share the same precious faith to substantiate the blessing of life of the New Testament with all those in the Jewish land as their common portion allotted to them by God. </p>

We have been allotted like precious faith in the sphere of or by means of the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Our God and Savior are both Jesus Christ. This indicates Jesus Christ is God to be our Savior. He is the very God whom we worship becoming our Savior to save us. At Peter’s time this designated and separated the believers in Christ from the Jews, <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> who did not believe that Jesus Christ was God, and from the Romans, who believed that Caesar, not Jesus Christ, was their God. </p>

<p data-content-id="-D1W91dRkGmxx31hLnwwliWeN8r9yGMpQKM0WQecdsgILhmIulfwa1uSnOQZs52kR"> In the previous message we began to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101966" data-verses="2Peter 1:1-4">1:1-4</span>. We paid particular attention to the words “allotted” and “righteousness” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101967" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">1:1</span>. Let us now go on to consider the meaning of faith in this verse. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pbzcAZOJZmX5g-0V7cKdBsPY5CzerdkG54yyKcVRVv64Zedp4tFXiye3z4yWtG_83">FAITH—THE SUBSTANTIATION<br/>OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TRUTH</h2><p data-content-id="v3p8DLq14Wph12pXqfaaz3RjGXn1qwBpIxRdcsKm918aKrRdjHzDbL-Mi1N0trSba"> Faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101968" data-verses="Hebrews 11:1">Heb. 11:1</span>), which is the reality of the contents of God’s New Testament economy. The contents of God’s New Testament economy are composed of the “all things which relate to life and godliness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101969" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">2 Pet. 1:3</span>), that is, the Triune God dispensing Himself into us as life within and godliness without. The like precious faith, allotted to us by God through the word of God’s New Testament economy and the Spirit, responds to the reality of such contents and ushers us into the reality, making its substance the very element of our Christian life and experience. Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it. As such a portion from God, this faith is objective to us in the divine truth. But it brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all with itself (faith) subjective to us in our experience. It can be compared to the scenery (truth) and the seeing (faith) that are objective to the camera (us). But when the light (the Spirit) brings the <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> scenery to the film (our spirit) within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to it. </p>
<p data-content-id="WXKLqT5YkQUdGP2wlI2SlF4-7ZrZrlR7qT82NwjRTLRB676OsGnVwZcI6xb8E8xkM"> We have pointed out that faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth. Let us take as an illustration the substantiating of the existence of a wooden table by a blind man through his sense of touch. Although the wooden table is substantial, the blind man cannot see it. But by touching the table with his hand, he substantiates that table to himself. In this way the wooden table becomes real to him. Therefore, his touching is the substantiating, and this substantiating makes the substance of the table real to him. This may be used as an illustration of faith being the substantiation of the substance of the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="-D1W91dRkGmxx31hLnwwliWeN8r9yH4BQKM0WQecdsgILhmIulfwa1uSnOQZs52kR"> In God’s New Testament inheritance there are many riches, many blessings. However, our natural mentality is blind to all these riches and blessings. Therefore, God would say, “Exercise your faith. Let your faith substantiate the substance of all of My New Testament blessings.” The reality or substance of God’s New Testament blessings is the truth. Faith is actually the substantiation of the reality of the substance of the truth, and the truth itself is the content of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="pbzcAZOJZmX5g-0V7cKdBsPY5CzercAq54yyKcVRVv64Zedp4tFXiye3z4yWtG_83"> Many of us are familiar with the term “God’s economy.” The Greek word for economy, <em>oikonomia,</em> means household management, arrangement, hence, dispensation, plan. God’s economy, God’s plan, is to dispense Himself into us. Therefore, God’s New Testament economy is simply for God’s dispensing. This economy has a content, this content has a reality, and this reality is the truth revealed in the Bible. The Bible is not merely a book of doctrine; it is a revelation of the truth, which is the reality of the content of God’s dispensation. This reality has a substance. Only faith can substantiate this substance. Hence, we see once again that faith is the substantiation of the substance of the reality of the New Testament dispensation. </p>
<p data-content-id="v3p8DLq14Wph12pXqfaaz3RjGXn1qyVJIxRdcsKm918aKrRdjHzDbL-Mi1N0trSba"> The content of God’s New Testament economy is composed of the “all things which relate to life and godliness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="101970" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">1:3</span>). We have seen that this is actually the Triune God dispensing Himself into us as our life within and godliness <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> without. In the Life-study of 1 Timothy we pointed out that the faith is the content of the complete gospel according to God’s New Testament economy. Hence, the faith is objective, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101971" data-verses="1Timothy 1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101972" data-verses="1Timothy 2:7">2:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101973" data-verses="1Timothy 3:9">3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101974" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">4:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101975" data-verses="1Timothy 4:6">6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101976" data-verses="1Timothy 5:8">5:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101977" data-verses="1Timothy 6:10">6:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101978" data-verses="1Timothy 6:12">12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101979" data-verses="1Timothy 6:21">21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101980" data-verses="2Timothy 2:18">2 Timothy 2:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101981" data-verses="2Timothy 3:8">3:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101982" data-verses="2Timothy 4:7">4:7</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="101983" data-verses="Titus 1:13">Titus 1:13</span>.

The faith equals the content of God’s economy, of His dispensation. The truth is the content, the reality, of the faith according to God’s economy. Eternal life is the means and power to carry out the divine realities of the faith, and godliness is a living that expresses the divine reality, an expression of God in all His riches. Subjective faith is the response to the truth of the objective faith; it receives and participates in the divine realities. </p>
<p data-content-id="WXKLqT5YkQUdGP2wlI2SlF4-7ZrZrnVfqT82NwjRTLRB676OsGnVwZcI6xb8E8xkM"> The like precious faith, allotted to us by God through the word of God’s New Testament economy and the Spirit, responds to the reality of such a content and ushers us into this reality. It makes the substance of God’s economy the element of our Christian life and experience. Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion. This faith is objective to us in the divine truth, but it brings all the content of its substantiation into us. The substantiating is the faith, and this faith brings into us whatever it substantiates. In this way, faith causes everything substantiated by it to become subjective to us in our experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="2ATXmkfL5laxJR6j6xyXqi6KoN6DGTCAL8z_OCuKvdclrtZdoZ-mTi8Ela2c3nzDJ"> We may use a camera as an illustration. Suppose you want to photograph a particular scene. The scene corresponds to the truth, and our experience of seeing this scene corresponds to faith. Both the scene and the seeing are objective to the camera, for neither has come into the camera. But light makes it possible for the scene to be impressed on the film. The light corresponds to the Spirit, and the film corresponds to our spirit. In this way both the scene and the seeing enter into the camera and become <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> subjective to it. The camera “clicks,” the light gets in, and the scene is brought into the camera and impressed on the film. We are the “camera,” and our spirit is the film. Now the scene and the seeing are subjective to us. This is faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="uCbrKNYmn7m0VisF8AiZOy88yqTV8TBINOJ50KVeQX6Y_w25BjMNNwzntY8GL5g2h"> Faith implies all the items in the “scenery” of the New Testament inheritance according to the New Testament economy. In the New Testament we see a complete picture of this scenery. But this scenery is outside of us. How can it get into us? It comes in through our seeing and through the Spirit’s work. This was our experience when we were saved and regenerated. We heard the preaching of the gospel, there was a “click” of the shutter of the “camera,” and the light came into us. As a result, the divine scenery was impressed on our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="fMHOCK29Ogh-XMseExklBHZu8EQ9yOHL7I8uifJsmIaPsiY-obnK_dshKp-x2GEgR"> Sometimes we preach the gospel to others, and they do not experience this “click.” As we are preaching, some may say to themselves, “I don’t agree with what you are saying.” Others may tell us, “I don’t care about this.” Still others may respond, “This person is crazy. What is he talking about?” There is no positive response. But eventually, by the Lord’s mercy, the divine light with the divine scenery may enter into certain ones. The scenery is then impressed on the film and can never be erased. Even if we try to change our minds, we cannot remove the scene that has been impressed on the “film” of our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxL6EDWvYqeU8vIUvSfl5mQIYUUuq6idrr683mPJFZRq-3q8vOKk8Q8X539JjGUnD"> Many of us can testify that we came to believe in the Lord for no apparent reason. We heard the preaching of the gospel, and there was a “click” within us. Spontaneously we believed in the Lord. Formerly, we may have argued about God and Christ. We may have said, “Is there really a God? Perhaps there is a God, but how can Jesus of Nazareth be God in the flesh? I don’t believe that the man Jesus is God.” Nevertheless, when we experienced a “click,” we automatically began to believe that Jesus is the Son of God. Then we could confess, “I don’t know why, but now I believe that Jesus is God. Hallelujah, Jesus Christ is my God! Praise the Lord!” </p>
<p data-content-id="HDu76RHFlXfMwes4ewBiwRRuzWqO93t8I2ROJxSg4QM3UqwQP6OUwfkJT7uP-m6jL"> Many of us can testify that we have had this kind of experience. At a certain time there was a “click” within us. At <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> that very moment, God’s allotment of like precious faith came into us. From that time onward, we have had faith in the Lord. </p>

God’s economy is a matter of the Triune God dispensing all that He is into us. When we preach to others concerning the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God according to the New Testament, the Spirit will work in the hearts of the listeners, and there will be a certain kind of response. This response is produced through the hearing of the truth conveyed by our preaching. This response can be compared to the click made by the shutter of a camera in taking a photograph. As a result of this response, this click, faith is produced. Then faith substantiates the substance of the reality of the contents of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="JWlVPPGO-jvnHMic7TnnHgG9IFo5pZ3dVlKmalzLz7w_Bp7Oo3ozRLteNGDXUeh73"> We need to have a clear understanding of what faith is. It should become easy for us to say that faith is the substantiation of the substance of God’s economy, and God’s economy is to dispense Himself into our being as our life and life supply. We need to know this, experience it, enjoy it, and practice it continually. </p>

Faith has become our portion of the New Testament inheritance. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102053" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">1:1</span> why is it that Peter does not say that God has allotted us a portion of the inheritance, <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> but instead says that God has allotted faith to us? How can faith be allotted as a portion of the inheritance? In order to answer these questions we need to see that faith is not merely a means; it is also a portion. A means is an instrument through which we obtain something, but the portion is the very thing we obtain. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102054" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">1:1</span> faith is not a means; rather, it is the very thing, the object, we receive. Therefore, in this verse faith equals the inheritance. Faith is an allotted portion of the New Testament inheritance. Yes, according to the New Testament, faith in a certain sense is a means. In particular, faith is the means by which we receive salvation and eternal life. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102055" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">1:1</span> Peter does not consider faith as a means. He considers faith an allotment, a portion of the New Testament inheritance allotted to us by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="DGUy1EmW61uiJBQNnxyXCaEoFLSdcfxT9pRLHVcEyOBLSK0TzyVI3bQMSbNUgtm_c"> We still need to see how faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102056" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">1:1</span> is equal to the New Testament inheritance. Our portion is Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. Therefore, our portion is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. This Christ is revealed in the New Testament, and He is conveyed to us through the New Testament. The entire New Testament is a container of the Christ who embodies the Triune God. Eventually, this container also conveys Christ to us. By what way is Christ conveyed to us through the Word? Christ is conveyed mainly by the way of the preaching or teaching of the Word. The preaching and the teaching of the apostles always conveyed Christ to others. This means that Christ came to the listeners through what was preached and taught by the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="SJb5jOJTyB0FPj-zRjoG0ZPRkkwn6omCVCOlphfo_IUTsigciWswzw5D5k9jHaNMF"> The Triune God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is contained in the New Testament. Then this Christ is conveyed to us through the preaching and teaching of the Word. The New Testament contains Christ, and those who preach the New Testament bring this container to us. Through this means this container conveys Christ to us. Faith, then, comes from hearing, and hearing comes from the Word. The function of the Word is to convey Christ to us. Therefore, Christ comes to us through the preaching and teaching of the word of the New Testament. <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="gUYlZSxqwvOg1WN5_8XutUiIERbLcz3D5ri_BVwKVvGoVZ0GfVaeYrhAQMKj3NpSo"> Our all-inclusive Christ is not only the Word, but He is also the life-giving Spirit. While Christ is preached to us through the Word and conveyed to us by the Word, He simultaneously cooperates with the preachers of the Word to work as the Spirit. This means that as He is being conveyed into those who listen to the preaching of the Word, He works within them as the Spirit. Then He “clicks” within them, and faith is produced in them. The issue of the faith produced within us is that whatever Christ is according to the word of the New Testament is imparted to us. As a result, we have the reality of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="eGkZIB2jqZCDz00Fw7zsx78hSa-sgkbT9zCU0WVCu1_Jy0rc4BqntEZbuDBuZHp7Q"> Faith and Christ are one. The faith which is the response to the content of the Word is actually Christ. This means that the response is one with that to which it is responding. In other words, faith (our response) and Christ are one. When in our experience our response and the Christ conveyed to us through the preaching of the Word become one, faith is produced within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="5N2zMAiilYcY-YceMKo_mq3jX-KrBseBxtFFy7UJe-OMd7rUk-ZQZVm7wx9AL5gt8"> It is very difficult to define what this faith is. It is hard to analyze it or explain how much of it is Christ and how much is our own believing. Actually, our faith and the Christ who is the object of our faith are one. This is the portion of the New Testament inheritance God has allotted to us. </p>

But how can these promises be counted among the content of the allotment? Let us use the illustration of a will in answering this question. Suppose your father’s will says that you have a certain inheritance. Your inheritance is what is written in your father’s will. The will not only tells you about certain things; it tells you that these things are your portion. Furthermore, this will is a fulfilled promise. Therefore, the will, a fulfilled promise, includes all the items of your inheritance. In this sense, the will, the promise, and the inheritance are all one. In like manner, concerning the things related to life and godliness, including the divine nature, the promises actually are the will. The New <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> Testament is a testament, not merely a covenant. In today’s terms, it is a new will. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are a will telling us of the items of our rich inheritance. Hence, the will and the inheritance are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="hiql9-q-3Jo1RE1aJvucMvtgMfi0eiSoMdlsArS0Mj2bA3MwaJVuXJg8sIOwMj99H"> An inheritance without a will would be lacking something very important. If we did not have the New Testament, which is a new will, how would we know what God has promised us concerning our inheritance? The allotted faith, our portion, includes all things related to life and godliness. As we have seen, it also includes the divine nature and the promises. All this is included in the allotted faith, in the portion God has allotted to us. </p>

The relative pronoun “which” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102058" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">verse 4</span> refers to glory and virtue in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102059" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">verse 3</span>. Through and on the basis of the Lord’s glory and virtue, by and to which we have been called, God has given us His precious and exceedingly great promises. </p>
<p data-content-id="VWXGUgIbbi8v1lL6madFiG2VhkLu9bzp5GcYrPjiLr0H9wU2BM4Cbx5kx0ZTncKNu"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102060" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">verse 3</span>, the Lord has called us not only by His glory and virtue, but also to His glory and virtue. The disciples saw the Lord’s glory. During the time He was with them, they saw the virtue in His conduct and daily living. They also saw His glory on the mount of transfiguration. I believe that they also saw the Lord’s glory at other times, for example, when He fed the five thousand and when He called Lazarus out of the tomb. Having seen the Lord’s glory and virtue, the disciples were attracted. This means that they were called by the Lord’s glory and virtue. After the Lord’s resurrection, on the day of Pentecost, Peter was full of glory and virtue. The disciples were in a situation that was full of glory and full of virtue, the very glory and virtue to which they had been called. <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BwShFxuH9th1Ihg5yCP6mz5Gst1gN5AQMUclOk5QxIe0SafBKJE89OsbtCSNV3wsd">FAITH AND THE INHERITANCE</h2><p data-content-id="xgvOw8A8VeYc24IE7L-BvFVWF8x9CzrXPiuSvW1LSNUgFJyne0JEeKPuVCH1B95CR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102070" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">Verse 1</span> says, “Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.” In this long verse we all need a definite and clear understanding of two crucial points. The first concerns the allotment of the New Testament faith. This faith, which is the “like precious faith,” is the same as the New Testament inheritance. The New Testament inheritance is nothing less than the Triune God Himself, the One who has been processed and has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. Hence, the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit is the New Testament inheritance. Faith is actually the reflection of this inheritance. Therefore, faith is one with the New Testament inheritance. If we have faith, we also have this inheritance. Faith is the substantiation of the substance of the inheritance. Therefore, the New Testament faith and the New Testament inheritance are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="rxs3Mx68BpNbyte83JZ6x9tGe4GSxu8UkjIUpQOVTiSi7MKIyQmYa_2t5vyfs2pdz"> If what God had done was merely to allot a New Testament inheritance to us, we would have something that is too objective, something not only outside of us but also far beyond us. It would, of course, be something that is for us, but it would not be able to reach us, and we would not be able to reach it. For this reason, there is the need of substantiation, and this substantiation is a matter of faith. <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="HDu76RHFlXfMwes4ewBiwRRuzWqW93tcI2ROJxSg4QM3UqwQP6OUwfkJT7uP-m6jL"> Faith is not initiated by us, and it is not something that is out of us. On the contrary, faith is out of God, it is initiated by God, and it is allotted to us by God. In what way is faith allotted to us? Faith comes to us by the word in God’s revelation. When this word is preached to us, it conveys the reality of the New Testament inheritance. Furthermore, as this word is preached to us, simultaneously the Spirit works with it. Actually, according to the Bible, the word and the Spirit are one. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102071" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span> the Lord Jesus said, “The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.” The word and the Spirit are one. The word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102072" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17">Eph. 6:17</span>). Therefore, through the spoken word and by the working, the inspiring, of the Spirit, faith is produced within us. This is the way God allots to us the like precious faith. Through the spoken word and by the inspiring Spirit, God infuses faith into our being. Once this faith has been imparted into us, we have our portion of the New Testament inheritance. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XKhDGBz0EoEVcHWxsvc0n_cjOW0vpWy63kU6Ps_5BseYWhZy9pE1m_Nc15Zm1VqZK">THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF OUR GOD<br/>AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="kcM0mltC2LYHGLZULptQMIXH6daqKZmqtvVQbTQH4EG2s5gx1ngm768O3cNAJgMbp"> The second crucial point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102073" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">verse 1</span> is related to the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102074" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">1:1</span>, the precious faith has been allotted to us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ. The Greek preposition translated “in” here means in the sphere of or by means of. In what sphere, or by what means, has this wonderful faith been allotted to us? It has been allotted to us in the sphere of the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ. This righteousness implies the righteous deed, the righteous act, of the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102075" data-verses="Romans 5:18">Rom. 5:18</span>). The Lord’s righteous act was His death on the cross. The Lord’s death on the cross was in absolute obedience to God and fulfilled all the requirements of God’s righteousness. Therefore, His death is a righteous deed highly valued by God according to His own righteousness. Christ’s righteous deed of dying on the cross in obedience to God fulfilled God’s righteousness and gave Him, the righteous God, the legitimate position to justify all those who believe in this righteous deed of Christ. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> righteousness, the righteousness of God and our Savior, Jesus Christ, is the sphere in which and also the means by which God has the liberty and position to allot Himself to us as our portion. This is the reason Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102076" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">verse 1</span> that we have been allotted the like precious faith in the righteousness of our God and Savior. </p>

The first is related to grace and peace. Because a wonderful portion—the Triune God Himself—has been allotted to us, grace and peace have come to us. Grace is our enjoyment of our portion of the New Testament inheritance, which is actually the processed Triune God. In simple terms, grace is the enjoyment of the Triune God. What, then, is peace? Peace is the condition that results from, issues from, grace. To have grace and peace is to have the enjoyment of the Triune God and the issue of this enjoyment. When we enjoy the Triune God, the result is a tranquil condition or situation with both God and man. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102080" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">verse 1</span>, the allotment of the precious faith was given to us in the sphere of a twofold righteousness and by means of this righteousness, the righteousness of our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102081" data-verses="2Peter 1:2">verse 2</span> we see that grace and peace also come to us in a sphere and by a particular means—the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102082" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">verse 1</span> the sphere is a twofold righteousness, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102083" data-verses="2Peter 1:2">verse 2</span> the sphere is the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. The full knowledge of the Triune God is for our participation in and enjoyment of His divine life and divine nature. It is not a mere doctrinal knowledge; it is an experiential knowledge, a knowledge that is full. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe0k21lJt80OjfCspN3kH5MnAQNyWOHIbAEW5HR8NfDivrvBBLwOI8PmG9c0-rXJt"> The Greek word rendered “full knowledge” is composed of <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> the word <em>gnosis</em> plus the prefix <em>epi,</em> which means upon. This word indicates a thorough, experiential knowledge. This kind of knowledge is not superficial or general. Rather, it is a knowledge that is deep, thorough, and experiential. As we have pointed out, this is not simply a mental knowledge; it is experiential knowledge in our spiritual understanding and apprehension. The full knowledge of God and of Christ is a deep, practical, thorough, and experiential knowledge of God and our Lord. This full knowledge is both the sphere in which and the means by which the Triune God can be enjoyed by us in order that we may have a peaceful situation with Him and with all men. </p>

These things pertain to the divine life, to <em>zoe,</em> not to the life that is for our pleasure. All things have been given, imparted, infused, into us so that we may live the divine life and also live out this life. The life is inward, but godliness is outward, for it is God Himself expressed. </p>
<p data-content-id="cdtvXCbPGcaG2FTGJdHSkOUFNN0GqjTKT_XbKIpqhw9kSmOmIVLEqwmQffG2WHScn"> In all of our living we should express God. We should testify of God and speak about Him. When God becomes our expression, this is godliness. In our conversation we should express God. If we are expressing God, surely we could not engage in gossip. We should have God in our being and also in our living. Our mind should be filled with Him, and the very fiber of our being should be constituted of Him. Then we shall have godliness, the outward expression of the inward life. </p>

This full knowledge is a deep, thorough, experiential knowledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="VWXGUgIbbi8v1lL6madFiG2VhkL29bDh5GcYrPjiLr0H9wU2BM4Cbx5kx0ZTncKNu"> The preposition “through” used in relation to full knowledge indicates that we need to pass through a process. If we have the practice of gossiping, this practice is an indication that we have not yet passed through the process leading to the full knowledge of the One who has called us. I do not think that if we have the full knowledge of the One who has called us to His glory and virtue, we shall waste our time gossiping. </p>
<p data-content-id="i0nchTfUJzwOFbCeftcA4Qr1VQN1fWwVJpDfOEiVkxGOI1gfTxILM5lVJJuDOR4oY"> The divine power has infused us with all things pertaining to life and godliness. However, this infusion, this impartation, requires that we have the full knowledge of God. If we do not pass through the process to gain the full knowledge, it will seem that what the divine power has planted in us has been in vain. The divine power is operating, but there is the need for us to cooperate with this operation. </p>
<p data-content-id="16s1YET5hVRwamyqpEIlR5Tn3vCE-M1WAlbSchsnAY8XglEiCeR1XX71PdzX8Nz-9"> Many Christians do not know anything about what the divine power has imparted to us. Likewise, many do not know that it is necessary for us to pass through the process to gain the full knowledge. There is the need for us to be trained by the Lord so that we may pass through the process to gain the full knowledge of the One who has called us. My desire in these messages is to help you pass through this process. We may use the illustration of a train and say that we are all on a train that is going through the passage of the deep, thorough, and experiential knowledge of the One who has called us. </p>
<p data-content-id="9l6XhaFrnkhrSiTTOlQaRKLkDwBlSrAg_iPACWgyjO0BFgS33HJDupTdRPJjKgOmJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102114" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">verse 3</span> Peter does not speak of the knowledge of God nor of the knowledge of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Instead, he speaks of the full knowledge of the One who has called us to His glory and virtue. Here Peter does not say that God has called us to heaven, nor even that He has called us to redemption or sanctification. In this verse Peter says that God has called us to His own glory and virtue. We need to have the full knowledge of this. We must not be content to know it superficially. We can know the One who has called us to His own glory and virtue only by passing through a long process. <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> Regarding this, we should be like tourists taking a slow train ride through a beautiful countryside. Such tourists like to ride slowly in order to have a good view of the scenery. In like manner, we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102115" data-verses="2Peter 1:1-4">1:1-4</span> thoroughly and slowly. You may read through these verses quickly again and again and not see anything. Therefore, as we read these verses, we need to consider carefully everything included in them. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jDN0n25P3z26tMYUSOPoie5k1aiHqTvm31YhqWtmOAoa-5oNpV_vb8phI5M1dhYsq">OUR COOPERATION WITH GOD’S OPERATION</h2><p data-content-id="T1dUVhlZ0TKCgZSddZPRhyvnvyMAyNkEnMkrnsMp2hCUyPwbwFGxLtEMPoHZRf9RE"> We definitely need the full knowledge of the One who has called us for the purpose of bringing us into His glory and virtue. If we have such an experiential knowledge of Him, the divine power will operate in us effectively. Otherwise, the divine power will not be able to work in us. Even though this power is great, it will not be able to work in us if we do not fulfill the conditions for its operation. As we have seen, the condition we must fulfill is that of our cooperation with God’s operation. </p>
<p data-content-id="nXgREkkGYHTqAJBanIyl9rsHhSM-P9A4xqquEkM32HxJqMzBVQr2DfECl_YbaEl41"> Many Christians do not know that God has called them to His own glory and virtue. It seems that in their theology there is no room for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102116" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span>. Although the divine power is present and is working, it does not operate in those who do not render the proper cooperation. If we do not pass through the process to gain the full knowledge of the One who has called us, the divine power will not be able to operate in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="6XrRvg6kn6q4Q9oA993G_9FeBxWyfkQMGZOZTch1LLwPSkI2g1KVwZwBYAiaw4I6M"> I can testify that the divine power is working in me and that daily I cooperate with God. In the morning I open to Him and say, “Lord, I am here before You. Go on, Lord. I would not hinder You. Rather, I would give You a free way within me. Lord, whatever You speak to me I will proclaim.” I can testify that the more I cooperate with the divine power within me, the more I am brought into God’s glory, enjoy His virtue, and express this virtue as godliness. </p>

The relative pronoun “which” refers to the glory and virtue in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102118" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">verse 3</span>. Through and on the basis of the Lord’s glory and virtue, by and to which we have been called, God has given us His precious and exceedingly great promises. </p>
<p data-content-id="wJEWL7vsZmubOiErAQPqYb7GaTzGtOIH5298F8SJXcfbdw2cjXXpsP8l45U0HGBtv"> It is not easy to know the meaning of the words “through which” as they connect <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102119" data-verses="2Peter 1:3-4">verses 3 and 4</span>. In order to have the proper knowledge of this, we need experience and also spiritual understanding. Here Peter is saying that through the divine glory and virtue God has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises. This indicates that if God had not called us to His own glory and virtue, there would be no need for Him to give us promises. But God has called us to His own glory and virtue. This goal is great, vast, profound. Who is able to reach God’s own glory and virtue? None of us is able to arrive at this goal. Therefore, there is the need of God’s word of promise to assure us, encourage us, strengthen us, and speed us on our way toward this goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="LZdIVEmyBSooYx0AHLEToimGqF4J_gVYQNiTzzG4oxbAfpnMUMoRecYsdKmN01nZ9"> Suppose Peter had said that God has called us to heaven. If heaven were the goal of God’s calling, there would have been no need for God to give us promises. If heaven were the goal of God’s calling, we could simply be happy and rejoice, live according to our pleasure, and then wait for heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrnfVxDFc4b_zsJCWBqW2ZWY2aR4WYO3GWufYKmqYpi_UQh6bffDBxkSYBMtO5Ei5"> However, Peter does not say that God has called us to heaven. He says that God has called us to His own glory and virtue. When we hear about this, we may wonder how we can attain to such a goal. Knowing our need for assurance, encouragement, and strength, God has given us precious and exceedingly great promises. An example of these promises is the Lord’s word to Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102120" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:9">2 Corinthians 12:9</span>: “My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.” This promise was given to Paul to enable him to suffer the thorn in the flesh. In order to bear with a “thorn,” we need the Lord’s sufficient grace. This is an illustration of the fact that we need many promises to help us reach the goal of God’s glory and virtue. </p>

Besides, along with, the precious and exceedingly great promises given to us by God, we should bring in all diligence to cooperate with the enabling of the dynamic divine nature for the carrying out of God’s promises. </p>

To supply virtue in faith is to develop virtue in the exercise of faith. The same principle applies to all the other items. </p>
<p data-content-id="855L03yaCDRxjHGJYWLW840YTuhiAGX-y49_hcomCH2A740QbXOe7mZP_Tv2ImCVy"> The word “supply” here actually means develop. Peter is telling us to develop what we already have. We have faith, and now in our faith we need to develop virtue. </p>
<p data-content-id="0teQqbT6KUT9jO-kE_G4ShYG4x4Gd50msxA1xTIy3Oku-2PYzIpkU00M_A57BvDvt"> The faith Peter mentions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102139" data-verses="2Peter 1:5">1:5</span> is the like precious faith allotted to us by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102140" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">1:1</span>) as the common portion of the New Testament blessing of life for the initiation of the Christian life. This faith needs to be exercised that the virtue of the divine life may be developed in the following steps to reach its maturity. Faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102141" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">2 Peter 1</span> may be compared to a seed. On <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> other occasions I have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102142" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> of 1 Peter the seed is the word with Christ in it as life. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102143" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">2 Peter 1</span> this seed becomes our faith, which, no doubt, is the like precious faith. This precious faith is one with Christ as the seed. </p>
<p data-content-id="7oUz1nsbWH6LNVlRa3ASaV9VmDGSJcM6hP3y_cQyyCW3Muk1Gfq-7x4r1x_5tsO6i"> After a seed has been sown in the soil, it needs to be developed. The principle is the same with the development of the seed of faith. In our faith we need to develop virtue. Literally, the Greek word for virtue means excellency. It denotes the energy of the divine life issuing in vigorous action. If faith is regarded as the seed, virtue may be considered a root that comes out of this seed. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_0aUoQqHKaS_t7Ey8HzU5Z_HpoTlF19f6y99XAE2xzEiJwHD073quNRNAJJ_3GAUG">Knowledge</h2><p data-content-id="BwShFxuH9th1Ihg5yCP6mz5Gst1oN4ksMUclOk5QxIe0SafBKJE89OsbtCSNV3wsd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102144" data-verses="2Peter 1:5">1:5</span> Peter also tells us to supply “in virtue knowledge.” Virtue, the vigorous action, needs the bountiful supply of the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102145" data-verses="2Peter 1:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102146" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102147" data-verses="2Peter 1:8">8</span>) regarding the all things related to the divine life and godliness and the partaking of the divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102148" data-verses="2Peter 1:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>) for our enjoyment in the following development. The knowledge which we should develop in our virtue includes the knowledge of God and of our Savior, the knowledge of God’s economy, the knowledge of what faith is, and the knowledge of the divine power, glory, virtue, nature, and life. Actually, this is the knowledge of all things related to life and godliness. We must have this knowledge developed in our virtue. It is not adequate to have virtue without knowledge. I believe that knowledge also is a primary root that develops out of the seed of faith. With virtue and knowledge we have the growth of the seed. </p>

This needs to be supplied and developed in knowledge for the proper growth in life. </p>

For this reason, we need to develop in our <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> knowledge self-control. Self-control implies restriction. As a tree grows, the roots spread out, but the trunk grows upward in a rather restricted manner. This is an illustration of the fact that along with the development of virtue and knowledge, we need the restriction that comes with self-control. </p>

Self-control is to deal with ourselves; endurance is to bear with others and with circumstances. In order to live a proper Christian life, we need endurance toward those around us and also toward our environment and circumstances. </p>

Godliness is a living that is like God and expresses God. As we exercise control over the self and bear with others and with circumstances, godliness needs to be developed in our spiritual life so that we may be like God and express Him. If faith is the seed, virtue and knowledge the roots, self-control the trunk, then endurance and godliness are the branches. Here we see a rather full development: out of the seed come the roots, the trunk, and the branches. Eventually, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102151" data-verses="2Peter 1:7">verse 7</span> we see brotherly love and love as the blossom and the fruit. </p>

<p data-content-id="GXoC5fvxHmc4uQenKb_5fXkGt3kzqU_DzjslntsAUByGAPVIniV9JiNrmt2wwSGSl"> Peter’s thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102169" data-verses="1Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> of his first Epistle is that the full salvation of the Triune God issues in holiness and brotherly love. Holiness is related to godliness. Hence, the issue of God’s full salvation is the expression of God and the love for the brothers. According to some translations, the word love in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102170" data-verses="2Peter 1:7">2 Peter 1:7</span> indicates a love not only for Christian brothers but for all men. According to this understanding, first we love the brothers and then we go on to love all men. However, I do not believe that this understanding is accurate. </p>
<p data-content-id="cdtvXCbPGcaG2FTGJdHSkOUFNN0Kqhn-T_XbKIpqhw9kSmOmIVLEqwmQffG2WHScn"> We have pointed out that <em>agape</em> is nobler than <em>phileo.</em> In quality and perhaps also in quantity <em>agape</em> is greater than <em>phileo.</em> Sometimes we may love the brothers in a narrow, limited way with a certain amount of brotherly love. In our love we may have preferences and love certain brothers more than others. We may claim that we love all the saints, but our love for them is not the same. Because Peter was experienced and knew the situation among the saints, he did not stop with brotherly love but went on to speak of love, of <em>agape,</em> the deep and noble love with which God the Father loves all mankind, both believers and sinners. </p>
<p data-content-id="YAgXYCd3xICwcjcOMT_R1KpfUtaRC0_Q9MwGwTcBc0Rp5YjRWpXGlGve_IeOYufZS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102171" data-verses="Matthew 5:44-47">Matthew 5:44-47</span> the Lord Jesus said, “But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He makes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not also the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brothers <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> only, what are you doing extraordinary? Do not also the nations do the same?” As God sends rain upon both the just and the unjust, so we should love not only our brothers but also our enemies. It does not take much strength or energy for someone to love his own brother. But it does take a special strength and energy to love our enemies. We all need to have this noble love. </p>

The virtue in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102201" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">verses 3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102202" data-verses="2Peter 1:5">5</span> is the issue of the experience of the divine nature, the enjoyment of the divine nature, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102203" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">verse 4</span>. When we partake of the divine nature, the different aspects of the riches of what God is, these riches become our virtues. For example, God is love, light, holiness, righteousness, and kindness. All these are God’s attributes. Each divine attribute is also a virtue. When we enjoy what God is, we enjoy His holiness. Then this holiness becomes a virtue in us and with us. The principle is the same with the enjoyment of other divine attributes. </p>
<p data-content-id="6XrRvg6kn6q4Q9oA993G_9FeBxW6fmUAGZOZTch1LLwPSkI2g1KVwZwBYAiaw4I6M"> The essence or element of virtue is contained in faith as a seed. This seed is actually Christ Himself, and Christ is God in all that He is. Because all that God is, is in Christ, Christ is the embodiment of what God is. This Christ has become our inheritance. The response to, or reflection of, this embodiment within us is faith. Faith, then, is also our inheritance. Within faith as a seed are included all the divine attributes, <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> all the riches of what God is. Because we have this seed of faith with the divine nature, we must go on to develop this seed. The first thing that comes forth in this development is virtue. Therefore, virtue is the result of enjoying the divine nature, the result of enjoying what God is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nXgREkkGYHTqAJBanIyl9rsHhSM2P9AYxqquEkM32HxJqMzBVQr2DfECl_YbaEl41">THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROCESSED GOD</h2><p data-content-id="6XrRvg6kn6q4Q9oA993G_9FeBxW6fkQsGZOZTch1LLwPSkI2g1KVwZwBYAiaw4I6M"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102204" data-verses="2Peter 1:5">verse 5</span> Peter says that in our virtue we need to develop knowledge. Virtue requires the bountiful supply of the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102205" data-verses="2Peter 1:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102206" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102207" data-verses="2Peter 1:8">8</span>) regarding the things related to the divine life and godliness and to the partaking of the divine nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="RGCXnHgT_rEpVWXhBecEClbU60htOaSkH_mbzcFdz0zzLSdYPtiyBuccoMjwH8zcE"> We may have a great deal of knowledge, but our knowledge may be shallow and superficial. We may not know life or know what like precious faith is. Moreover, we may not know anything regarding the divine nature, and we may even oppose it when it is pointed out from the Bible that believers may become partakers of the divine nature. Those with a superficial knowledge also may not know that godliness is the expression of God, that Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. To lack the knowledge of such matters is to be short of the knowledge of the depths of the truth in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="sPZQZqcAzvuJSQXQ89xi_SILV1o-yQ4UrAR2Dx0Ak3HGwUH4bvmBqduKIVabe89xw"> Some believers have been hindered or even spoiled by superficial knowledge. They may be fundamental in their doctrine, but they may be fundamental in a superficial way. Superficial fundamentalism may actually be a kind of “drug” that can dull the spiritual senses. A good number of Christians have been “drugged” by the influence of a superficial fundamentalism. For this reason, it is very difficult to speak with them about having Christ as our food and enjoyment. If you tell them that we can eat Christ, digest Christ, and assimilate Him so that He becomes the constituent of our being, they would say that such a teaching is heretical. They may react and say, “Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is on the throne in heaven. How can we eat Him, and how can He become the constituent of our being?” They may even consider scriptural teachings such as these to be blasphemous. </p>
<p data-content-id="wJEWL7vsZmubOiErAQPqYb7GaTzOtO4f5298F8SJXcfbdw2cjXXpsP8l45U0HGBtv"> Some with superficial knowledge also oppose the matter <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> of mingling. The word “mingling” is used in the Old Testament. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102208" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1">Leviticus 2</span> speaks of the mingling of oil with fine flour to make the meal offering. The concept of mingling, therefore, is surely according to the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="LZdIVEmyBSooYx0AHLEToimGqF4B_glAQNiTzzG4oxbAfpnMUMoRecYsdKmN01nZ9"> Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102209" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> the Lord Jesus says that He is the bread, the living bread that came down from heaven to give life to the world, and that whoever eats Him will also live because of Him. Consider what happens to the food we eat. The food is digested, assimilated, and eventually mingled with our fibers and cells. Is it not true, then, that eating implies mingling? The digestion and assimilation of the food we eat definitely involves mingling. The food we eat is mingled with our very constitution. In the same principle, when we eat the Lord as the bread of life and digest and assimilate Him in our spiritual being, He is mingled with us and we with Him. However, certain Christians do not have this knowledge, which is a knowledge of the depths of biblical truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="mrnfVxDFc4b_zsJCWBqW2ZWY2aRwWY-_GWufYKmqYpi_UQh6bffDBxkSYBMtO5Ei5"> The knowledge spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102210" data-verses="2Peter 1:5">1:5</span> is the full knowledge of God and of our Lord. We need a full knowledge not of the unprocessed God, the “raw” God, but of the processed God. The expression “processed God” refers to the God who became a man through incarnation, who lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, who died on the cross and was buried, who was resurrected, and who has ascended to the heavens. Incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are all a part of a long process. Because Christ has passed through such a process, no longer is He merely God with the element of divinity; He is also man with the element of humanity. Our Lord is both God and man. He has both the divine nature and the human nature. Moreover, He also includes the elements of human living, His all-inclusive death, and His life-imparting resurrection. Such a word concerning the processed God may sound alien or strange to those who have only a superficial knowledge of the Word. But according to what Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102211" data-verses="2Peter 1:5">1:5</span>, we need to supply bountifully in our virtue the full knowledge of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZNpvd417T8xE_JU3UAVCxuGhW_SomDOlJvIbfvSMDLrU8EOM1kJpKnNUf2m4Ys8tu"> If believers do not have the proper knowledge, how can they have the development described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102212" data-verses="2Peter 1:5-7">1:5-7</span>? It is not possible to have this development apart from the full knowledge of <span class="pg" data-page-id="60" id="60">[60]</span> God. With some believers there is hardly any development. They may not even have a full realization concerning the like precious faith, not knowing that this faith is the all-inclusive seed within them. They have never heard this kind of teaching. Their knowledge is not on this line, but is related instead to a superficial religious understanding. </p>

In our knowledge we need to develop such a self-control. </p>
<p data-content-id="CarpO2lXOP5jbZ5ycQpE_gdipAcapo-YfjBC5goFLYuaeH4sRFhHKcOexmKR7nf_C"> In our self-control we need to develop endurance. Self-control is related to the self, but endurance is related to others and to our circumstances. As to ourselves, we must have self-control, and as to our circumstances, no matter what they may be, we need endurance. We need to have endurance with the members of our family, with our neighbors, and with various things that disturb us. For example, when you are bothered by something in your environment, you need endurance. We need to develop endurance in order to bear with others and with our circumstances. </p>
<p data-content-id="PvvdJmEQwjFyrk35Smo3_2QiTueLgiRAQnODqCzlifSnXQ9HW7lN3u9v2PsuqbI3d"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102214" data-verses="2Peter 1:6">verse 6</span> Peter also says that in our endurance we need to develop godliness. Godliness means God-likeness, that is, being like God and expressing God. The Christian life should be a life that expresses God and bears God’s likeness in all things. As we exercise control over the self and bear with others and with circumstances, we also need to develop godliness so that we may be like God and express Him. </p>

We have also seen that the Greek word for “love” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102216" data-verses="2Peter 1:7">verse 7</span> is <em>agape,</em> the word used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102217" data-verses="1John 4:8">1 John 4:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102218" data-verses="1John 4:16">16</span>). This kind of love is nobler than <span class="pg" data-page-id="61" id="61">[61]</span> brotherly love, and it is stronger in ability and greater in capacity than human love. </p>

The divine provision includes two matters: the impartation of the divine power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102228" data-verses="2Peter 1:3-11">1:3-11</span>) and the shining of the divine truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102229" data-verses="2Peter 1:12-21">1:12-21</span>). Regarding the impartation of the divine power, we have two main points: all things related to life and godliness with the divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102230" data-verses="2Peter 1:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>) and the development by the growth in life unto the rich entrance into the eternal kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102231" data-verses="2Peter 1:5-11">vv. 5-11</span>). Regarding the shining of the divine truth, there are also two main points: the glory of the apostles’ witnessing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102232" data-verses="2Peter 1:12-18">vv. 12-18</span>) and the light of the prophetic word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102233" data-verses="2Peter 1:19-21">vv. 19-21</span>).

Peter was always ready to remind the saints concerning these things, even though they had come to know them and had been established in the present truth, the truth which they already possessed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="PvvdJmEQwjFyrk35Smo3_2QiTue3gglsQnODqCzlifSnXQ9HW7lN3u9v2PsuqbI3d"> By “the present truth” Peter means the truth which is present with the believers and which they have already received and now possess. In the first section of this chapter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102235" data-verses="2Peter 1:1-11">vv. 1-11</span>), Peter uses the provision of the divine life for the proper Christian life to inoculate against apostasy. In the second section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102236" data-verses="2Peter 1:12-21">vv. 12-21</span>), he uses the revelation of the divine truth, as the second antidote, to inoculate against the heresy in the apostasy, a heresy similar to today’s Modernism. </p>
<p data-content-id="dDnTWCLsTstRGi0Qa6x_y1_ZshH9LxbcJ-qyAsv_wuUbdl_xbnIfrih2wFF2LFyqE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102237" data-verses="2Peter 1:13-14">verses 13 and 14</span> Peter says, “And I count it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by a reminder, knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is imminent, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.” The word “tabernacle” refers to the temporal body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102238" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:1">2 Cor. 5:1</span>). To put off the tabernacle is to put off the body, to be unclothed of the body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102239" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:4">2 Cor. 5:4</span>), to leave the body, to die physically. Peter, like Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102240" data-verses="2Timothy 4:6">2 Tim. 4:6</span>), knew that he would leave the world by martyrdom, and he was ready for this. He remembered the Lord’s word to him concerning his death, when He charged him to feed His sheep (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102241" data-verses="John 21:15-19">John 21:15-19</span>). </p>

Once again, “these things” refer to what Peter has covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102244" data-verses="2Peter 1:1-11">1:1-11</span>. </p>

The apostles preached and taught concerning the power and coming (Gk. <em>parousia,</em> presence) of the Lord Jesus Christ. To unbelievers, the preaching concerning the Lord’s coming sounded very much like a myth or superstitious tale. But here Peter says that the apostles did not follow cleverly devised myths when <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> they made known the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

Peter considers the Lord’s transfiguration as a figure of His second coming, even as the Lord did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102246" data-verses="Luke 9:26-36">Luke 9:26-36</span>. The Lord’s transfiguration in glory was a fact, and Peter was in it. The Lord’s coming back in glory will also be a fact as real as His transfiguration, and Peter will also be in it.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102251" data-verses="Luke 9:26-36">Luke 9:26-36</span> the Lord Jesus also indicated that His transfiguration was a figure of His glory in His coming back. </p>

And this voice we heard being borne out of heaven, being together with Him in the holy <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> mountain.” Honor is a matter of position, and glory is a matter of state.

Peter, James, and John saw the cloud, and that cloud was the glory. Likewise, in ancient times, after the tabernacle had been erected, it was filled with the glory of God, for the cloud of God’s glory overshadowed the tabernacle. It would have been difficult to discern the cloud from the glory, because the cloud was with the glory. </p>

This apostasy was the background of this book. Peter’s burden was to inoculate the believers against the poison of apostasy. Apostasy is a deviation from fundamental truth or belief. Approximately thirty years after the church had been established, apostasy began to creep in. There was a deviation from the track of fundamental belief. Certain ones were teaching heresy. One of these heresies was that the preaching concerning the coming back of the Lord Jesus in glory is a myth, a tale that is not believable or trustworthy. As we shall see when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102257" data-verses="2Peter 3:1">chapter three</span>, certain mockers said, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102258" data-verses="2Peter 3:4">3:4</span>). These heretics and apostates regarded the teaching that the Lord would come back in glory to judge the earth as a superstitious tale. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUYlZSxqwvOg1WN5_8XutUiIERbnczHb5ri_BVwKVvGoVZ0GfVaeYrhAQMKj3NpSo"> The heretics at the time this Epistle was written can be compared to today’s Modernists. The Modernists are a class of teachers who claim that the Bible is not inspired by <span class="pg" data-page-id="69" id="69">[69]</span> God and that the miracles recorded in the Bible are merely superstitious stories. For example, Modernists do not believe that the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea in a miraculous way. Instead, some Modernists think that the children of Israel walked through shallow water, water that was made shallow by the blowing of a strong wind. In like manner, Modernists do not believe that the Lord Jesus fed the multitude with five loaves and two fishes. They explain this by saying that those in the crowd brought food with them and simply ate whatever they had brought. Even more serious, Modernists teach that Jesus was not born of a virgin and that He was not God. They claim that He died on the cross not for our redemption, but as a sacrifice for the kind of ism in which He believed. Furthermore, they do not believe in the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus. In many respects, the Modernists of today and the heretics of the first century are similar. </p>

This warning is a close parallel to that given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102292" data-verses="Jude 1:4-19">Jude 4-19</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="AhgAVjErJ62Td8bYNycPFppjCcFsT0mbTE86UKWzdyuI041FcbEbl_7K70aA-chvi"> In the Old Testament there were not only genuine prophets speaking God’s word, which is like a lamp shining upon us, but there were also false prophets among the people.

<p data-content-id="FlcF-IWefliG9H1NIZ1ze45-Wk5RzwsZFvae06f6oGfvwinv5MeDf-xi-KsulRMJi"> The Greek words rendered “secretly bring in” may also be translated “bring in by smuggling.” Literally, the Greek means to bring in alongside, to bring in sideways, to introduce a new subject for which the hearers are not prepared. Here it denotes the false teachers bringing in and introducing their false teachings alongside the true ones. These false teachings are called destructive heresies, or, literally, heresies of destruction. </p>
<p data-content-id="CarpO2lXOP5jbZ5ycQpE_gdipAcipoOQfjBC5goFLYuaeH4sRFhHKcOexmKR7nf_C"> “Heresy” is an anglicized Greek word, <em>hairesis,</em> which means choices of opinion of doctrine different from that usually accepted, “self-chosen doctrines alien from the truth” (Alford), thus causing division and producing sects.

<p data-content-id="PvvdJmEQwjFyrk35Smo3_2QiTuezgihIQnODqCzlifSnXQ9HW7lN3u9v2PsuqbI3d"> Heresy involves three matters: opinion, the causing of divisions, and the producing of sects. Therefore, opinion, divisions, and sects are the three constituents of heresy. Heresy, of course, is not constructive. Instead of building up the church, heresy destroys the church. For this reason, Peter speaks of destructive heresies, or heresies of destruction. </p>

The word “Master” implies the Lord’s Person and His redemptive work. The false teachers at Peter’s time, like today’s Modernists in their apostasy, denied both the Lord’s Person as the Master and His redemption, by which He purchased the believers. </p>

Buchman put out a book entitled <em>For Sinners Only.</em> When we were in China, we criticized this book and opposed it because it did not say anything concerning the blood of Jesus. When Buchman became elderly, he was the leader of a movement called Moral Rearmament. Buchman may be regarded as a false teacher, one who denied the Master and His redemption. </p>

In God’s governmental dealing, they will be especially kept under punishment for the day of judgment because they go after the flesh, indulging in defiling lust and corrupting luxury for pleasure, and despise the Lord’s government, rebelling against His authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102410" data-verses="2Peter 2:10">vv. 10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102411" data-verses="2Peter 2:13-14">13-14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102412" data-verses="2Peter 2:18">18</span>).

<p data-content-id="cdtvXCbPGcaG2FTGJdHSkOUFNNkSqhXmT_XbKIpqhw9kSmOmIVLEqwmQffG2WHScn"> Peter also says that the false teachers are self-willed and do not tremble while reviling dignities. They are self-willed in that they are self-pleasing, seeking pleasure for self. The Greek word rendered “dignities” literally means glories. It probably refers both to angels and men in power and authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102421" data-verses="2Peter 2:11">v. 11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102422" data-verses="Jude 1:9">Jude 9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102423" data-verses="Titus 3:1-2">Titus 3:1-2</span>). </p>

But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102426" data-verses="Jude 1:9">Jude 9</span> regarding the same case, the archangel Michael and the Devil are singled out. Because Michael realized that in the angelic order the Devil was higher than he, he did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him. The words a “reviling judgment” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102427" data-verses="2Peter 2:11">2:11</span> actually mean a condemnation. To refrain from bringing a reviling judgment against them before the Lord is to keep the order of authority in God’s government. </p>

The King James Version adopts the rendering “natural brute beasts.” </p>
<p data-content-id="SJb5jOJTyB0FPj-zRjoG0ZPRkkgr6omSVCOlphfo_IUTsigciWswzw5D5k9jHaNMF"> “Without reason,” or “irrational” here means having no sense of moral issues. The highest sense within man is his spirit with the conscience as its leading part. Conscience governs man under God’s government since man’s fall. Some have “ceased from feeling” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102429" data-verses="Ephesians 4:19">Eph. 4:19</span>) by giving up the consciousness of their conscience through their denial of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102430" data-verses="Romans 1:23-32">Rom. 1:23-32</span>). The first century heretics, like the Sadducees in ancient Judaism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102431" data-verses="Acts 23:8">Acts 23:8</span>) and the Modernists of today, are in this category. They have denied the Lord to the uttermost so that their conscience is seared and has lost its consciousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102432" data-verses="1Timothy 4:2">1 Tim. 4:2</span>), as if they do not even have a spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102433" data-verses="Jude 1:10">Jude 10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102434" data-verses="Jude 1:19">19</span>).

<p data-content-id="gUYlZSxqwvOg1WN5_8XutUiIERLHcz3T5ri_BVwKVvGoVZ0GfVaeYrhAQMKj3NpSo"> Peter says that those who become as animals without reason have been born for capture and corruption.

But by the supply of life through the divine provision (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102436" data-verses="2Peter 1:3-4">1:3-4</span>) we are able to escape this corruption that brings in destruction. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102481" data-verses="2Peter 3:1-9">3:1-9</span> we see God’s judgment on the heretical mockers. In this Epistle we have not only false teachers but also mockers. These mockers may be the false teachers themselves or those who are influenced by the teachings of the false ones. Both the false teachers and the heretical mockers will be judged by God. Let us now consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102482" data-verses="2Peter 3:1-9">3:1-9</span> verse by verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="lVUhSU0-Kd673xyMYj6jakx3XLQ-H-kU4c2UEwnrCSxtrCDNeNp50p77NyYsCl7Wx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102483" data-verses="2Peter 3:1">verse 1</span> Peter says, “This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you, in both of which I stir up your pure mind by a reminder.” Here we see that Peter’s aim was to stir up the pure mind of the saints. In order to understand God’s governmental dealings, we need a pure mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="OtJdQofpqbOnICfMhqbwnHZn2KqhiiXc3n30mdILDdGCxPHftPcK4Hnez2fu8tkLh"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102484" data-verses="2Peter 3:2">verse 2</span> Peter continues, “To remember the words spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Savior by your apostles.” The words spoken by the prophets are the contents of the Old Testament, the Scriptures (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102485" data-verses="2Peter 3:16">v. 16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102486" data-verses="2Peter 1:20">1:20</span>), and the commandments by the apostles are the contents of the New Testament, the apostles’ teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102487" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>). Peter uses both to confirm and strengthen his writings as an inoculation against the heretical teachings in the apostasy. In his first Epistle, concerning the full salvation of God, he refers to both the prophets and the apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102488" data-verses="1Peter 1:9-12">1 Pet. 1:9-12</span>). Then in the second Epistle, concerning the shining of the divine truth, he refers again to both (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102489" data-verses="2Peter 1:12-21">1:12-21</span>). Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102490" data-verses="2Peter 3:2">verse 2</span> Peter does this for the third time. Therefore, Peter’s teaching is based upon the prophets of the Old Testament and the apostles of the New Testament, the two sections of the Holy Word. This indicates that what Peter says here actually <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> refers to the entire Bible. His reminder is based upon both the prophecies of the Old Testament and the teachings of the New Testament. </p>

This period began from the end of the so-called apostolic age, in the latter part of the first century, and will last until Christ’s second appearing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102494" data-verses="2Peter 3:3">verse 3</span> Peter tells us that in the last days mockers will come. These mockers may be the false teachers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102495" data-verses="2Peter 2:1">2:1</span>. Their mocking is part of the apostasy and is according to their lusts. </p>
<p data-content-id="uCbrKNYmn7m0VisF8AiZOy88yqDZ8TBYNOJ50KVeQX6Y_w25BjMNNwzntY8GL5g2h"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102496" data-verses="2Peter 3:4">verse 4</span>, these mockers say, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.” The promise of the Lord’s coming was given to the fathers by the holy prophets in the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102497" data-verses="Psalms 72:6-17">Psa. 72:6-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102498" data-verses="Psalms 110:1-3">110:1-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102499" data-verses="Psalms 118:26">118:26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102500" data-verses="Daniel 7:13-14">Dan. 7:13-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102501" data-verses="Zechariah 14:3-9">Zech. 14:3-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102502" data-verses="Malachi 4:1-3">Mal. 4:1-3</span>). But the mockers said, with a mocking tone, “Where is the promise of His coming?” It is possible that they used the pronoun “His” in a contemptuous manner. The mockers said that everything has continued unchanged from the beginning of creation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fMHOCK29Ogh-XMseExklBHZu8EAxyOHb7I8uifJsmIaPsiY-obnK_dshKp-x2GEgR">WILLFULLY IGNORANT OF THE WORD OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="IxL6EDWvYqeU8vIUvSfl5mQIYUEiq6iNrr683mPJFZRq-3q8vOKk8Q8X539JjGUnD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102503" data-verses="2Peter 3:5-6">verses 5 and 6</span> Peter fights back: “For this is hidden from them by their own willfulness, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth, subsisting out of water and through water, through which the world then, being flooded by the water, perished.” Here Peter points out that the mockers willingly ignore the record in the Old Testament concerning God’s judgment by the flood. That flood was a serious judgment. Nevertheless, the mockers willingly ignored the record in the Bible about it. Literally, the Greek words rendered “this is hidden from them by their own willfulness” mean “this escapes them by their own willfulness”; that is, they are willfully ignorant of this. Hence, it escapes their notice. The heretical mockers ignore willfully and deny <span class="pg" data-page-id="95" id="95">[95]</span> purposely the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures. Therefore, Peter reminds the believers to remember the holy words spoken by both the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102504" data-verses="2Peter 3:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="HDu76RHFlXfMwes4ewBiwRRuzW6C93tMI2ROJxSg4QM3UqwQP6OUwfkJT7uP-m6jL"> The promise concerning the Lord’s coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102505" data-verses="2Peter 3:4">v. 4</span>) is the word of God. The mockers should not ignore that it was by the word of God that the heavens and the earth came into existence (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102506" data-verses="Hebrews 11:3">Heb. 11:3</span>), and it is by the same word that the heavens and the earth are being kept (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102507" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Heb. 1:3</span>) for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102508" data-verses="2Peter 3:7">2 Pet. 3:7</span>). Therefore, the mockers should be assured that by the word of God all the material universe, including them, will be judged by the coming of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="XKhDGBz0EoEVcHWxsvc0n_cjOWk7pWyq3kU6Ps_5BseYWhZy9pE1m_Nc15Zm1VqZK"> Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102509" data-verses="2Peter 3:5">verse 5</span> that by the word of God the heavens were of old. The words “were of old” mean existed from ancient times. In the beginning, that is, of old, the heavens and the earth were created by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102510" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Gen. 1:1</span>). By the word of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102511" data-verses="Psalms 33:6">Psa. 33:6</span>) the heavens came into existence first, and then the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102512" data-verses="Job 38:4-7">Job 38:4-7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="kcM0mltC2LYHGLZULptQMIXH6dK-KZm6tvVQbTQH4EG2s5gx1ngm768O3cNAJgMbp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102513" data-verses="2Peter 3:5">verse 5</span> Peter speaks of the earth “subsisting out of water and through water.” As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102514" data-verses="Colossians 1:17">Colossians 1:17</span>, the Greek word rendered “subsisting” literally means standing together, standing with (in juxtaposition, side by side). First the earth came into existence in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102515" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>, and then from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102516" data-verses="Genesis 1:9">Genesis 1:9</span>, also by the word (the speaking) of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102517" data-verses="Psalms 33:9">Psa. 33:9</span>), the earth began to subsist out of water and through water, that is, to stand together with water in juxtaposition, partly emerging out of water and partly submerged under water. This is the way the earth came into existence. </p>
<p data-content-id="JWlVPPGO-jvnHMic7TnnHgG9IF4xpYTpVlKmalzLz7w_Bp7Oo3ozRLteNGDXUeh73"> The relative pronoun “which” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102518" data-verses="2Peter 3:6">verse 6</span> refers to water in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102519" data-verses="2Peter 3:5">verse 5</span>. The earth subsisted out of water and through water in an orderly condition. But through the same water it was judged and destroyed by the flood at Noah’s time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102520" data-verses="Genesis 7:17-24">Gen. 7:17-24</span>). This indicates that all things have not remained as they were from the beginning of creation. </p>

The earth in the preceding <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> verse became the world in this verse, not merely the earth, but the earth with its inhabitants in a system. This refers to the world in Noah’s age, which was judged by God with the flood due to the sinfulness and ungodliness of that age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102521" data-verses="Genesis 6:5-7">Gen. 6:5-7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102522" data-verses="Genesis 6:11-13">11-13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102523" data-verses="Genesis 6:17">17</span>). This book is concerned mainly with the divine government and all its judgments. The first judgment on the world was the one executed by the flood in Noah’s day, which cleared up that ungodly world. This thought must have been in Peter while he was writing this verse. It implies that this age of apostasy will also be judged on the day of the Lord’s appearing, as it was judged in the day of Noah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102524" data-verses="Matthew 24:37-39">Matt. 24:37-39</span>). The word “then” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102525" data-verses="2Peter 3:6">verse 6</span> refers to the age of Noah. </p>
<p data-content-id="bEAN7GZ6dmELBzNwu2nCYCA2UJ8uYHl2nKn36T96GBduC73m2F90CIwbGHqVAJVNp"> The word “flooded” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102526" data-verses="2Peter 3:6">verse 6</span> refers to the flood of Noah’s time, the flood that caused the earth to be destroyed. The word “perish” means destroyed, demolished, laid waste (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102527" data-verses="Genesis 6:13">Gen. 6:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102528" data-verses="Genesis 6:17">17</span>). The earth, therefore, did not remain the same, but had a change, a cataclysm, by being flooded with water, and was destroyed. Here we see Peter’s strong argument against the heretical mockers. They said that “all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.” But actually a cataclysm came upon the earth because of the ungodliness of its inhabitants. This implies that the present world will not remain as it is, but will also have a cataclysm by the Lord’s coming with His judgment upon the rebellious, including the false teachers and the heretical mockers in the apostasy. </p>
<p data-content-id="qe0k21lJt80OjfCspN3kH5MnAQdmWO3QbAEW5HR8NfDivrvBBLwOI8PmG9c0-rXJt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102529" data-verses="2Peter 3:7">verse 7</span> Peter goes on to say, “But the heavens and the earth now, by the same word, have been reserved for fire, being kept unto the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.” In this verse the word “now” is in contrast with “then” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102530" data-verses="2Peter 3:6">verse 6</span>. It refers to the present heavens and earth, which remain by the word of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102531" data-verses="Genesis 8:22">Gen. 8:22</span>), not to be destroyed again by water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102532" data-verses="Genesis 9:11">Gen. 9:11</span>), but to be burned by fire on the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. </p>

Hence, the antidote administered by Peter’s inoculation against the poison of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="97" id="97">[97]</span> apostate teachings is the holy word with the divine revelation, which he emphasizes repeatedly. </p>

It is nearly the same as the last week of the seventy weeks spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102583" data-verses="Daniel 9:24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</span>. The first sixty-nine weeks, a period of four hundred eighty-three years, ended when the Lord Jesus was crucified, when He, the Messiah, was “cut off.” There is now a gap between the sixty-ninth week and the beginning of the seventieth week. We are not told in the Bible how long this interval will be. But we do know that after this interval, there will be a period of seven years, which will be the seventieth week, before the millennium. The coming of the Lord will take place during these years. </p>

According to the New Testament, the Lord’s <em>parousia,</em> His coming, will not last merely an hour or a day. Rather, it will last for a period of time. Through detailed study of the Scriptures we have come to see that the Lord’s <em>parousia</em> will probably begin at the middle of the seventieth week, that is, in the middle of the last seven years before the millennium. Furthermore, it will probably begin from the time the Lord leaves the throne of God in the third heaven and descends to the air wrapped in a cloud (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102585" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">Rev. 10</span>). This means that the Lord’s parousia will take place during the last three and a half years of this age. </p>

The rapture of the man-child will be to the throne of God, and it will be before the one thousand two hundred sixty days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102588" data-verses="Revelation 12:6">v. 6</span>), which will be the time of the great tribulation of three and a half years (forty-two months, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102589" data-verses="Revelation 12:14">Rev. 12:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102590" data-verses="Revelation 13:5">13:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102591" data-verses="Revelation 11:2">11:2</span>). After the rapture of the man-child, there will be a period of three and a half years, or forty-two months. We need to notice the fact that the man-child will be raptured not to the air, but to the throne of God, where the Lord Jesus <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> is today. Therefore, for the man-child to be raptured to the throne of God means that the man-child will be in the presence of the Lord, in the <em>parousia</em> of the Lord. This proves that, in the midst of the seventieth week, the Lord Jesus will still be at the throne of God in the third heaven. </p>

This indicates that everything will be altogether under God’s government. Nothing will be wrong; nothing will be unjust or unrighteous. Thus, there will be no need for any further governmental judgment of God. </p>

The main thing we see in John’s writings is God’s love expressed in His life; in Paul’s writings, God’s grace distributed in His dispensation; and in Peter’s writings, God’s righteousness maintained in His government. God’s life, dispensation, and government are the basic structures of the ministry of these three apostles. Life is of love, dispensation is by grace, and government is based upon righteousness. This righteousness will dwell in the new heavens and earth and it will saturate God’s new universe prevailingly to maintain it absolutely under God’s righteous order, so that there will be no need ever of any further judgment. </p>

Peace is the fruit of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102702" data-verses="Hebrews 12:11">Heb. 12:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102703" data-verses="Isaiah 32:17">Isa. 32:17</span>). Because this book emphasizes righteousness for God’s governmental dealing, it charges the believers who are walking in the way of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102704" data-verses="2Peter 2:21">2:21</span>) to pursue peace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102705" data-verses="Hebrews 12:14">Heb. 12:14</span>), so that they may be prepared for the Lord’s coming with judgment. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102706" data-verses="2Peter 3:14">3:14</span> Peter exhorts us to be found by the Lord in peace “without spot and without blemish.” The heretics, who forsake the straight way and follow the way of unrighteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102707" data-verses="2Peter 2:15">2:15</span>), are spots and blemishes among the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102708" data-verses="2Peter 2:13">2:13</span>). But the believers, who are pursuing peace as the fruit of righteousness in God’s government, should be without spot and without blemish, like the Lord, who is the Lamb without blemish and without spot (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102709" data-verses="1Peter 1:19">1 Pet. 1:19</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="115" id="115">[115]</span> </p>

Concerning this, Peter says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102710" data-verses="2Peter 3:15-16">3:15 and 16</span>: “And count the longsuffering of our Lord to be salvation, even as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you, as also in all his letters, speaking in them concerning these things, in which some things are hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.” The mockers count, or consider, the Lord’s longsuffering toward the believers as delay, tardiness, or slackness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102711" data-verses="2Peter 3:9">v. 9</span>). This is their twisting of the Lord’s word spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures and the apostles in their teachings. Hence, Peter charges the believers to count the Lord’s longsuffering as salvation instead of delay, not twisting the prophets’ prophecies nor the apostles’ teachings, including Peter’s and also Paul’s, that they may not be judged unto destruction, as the heretics will at the Lord’s coming. It is by doing this and by being diligent to be found by the Lord in peace that the believers prepare themselves for the Lord’s coming with judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="0teQqbT6KUT9jO-kE_G4ShYG4xoSd502sxA1xTIy3Oku-2PYzIpkU00M_A57BvDvt"> The Lord’s longsuffering in the delay regarding His promise should be counted as prolonged opportunity for the believers to repent unto salvation. Salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102712" data-verses="2Peter 3:15">3:15</span> is not salvation in its initial stage, but salvation in its completing stage. The Lord has delayed His coming with the intention that many of His elect may not miss the topmost portion of His full salvation. </p>

Peter was not the only apostle to teach that the Lord’s longsuffering should be counted salvation instead of delay, with the confirmation of the prophets’ prophecy. Paul as another of the apostles also teaches the same thing in his writings, which are based upon the prophetic word of the Old Testament. Peter refers to this fact to strengthen his writing. </p>

In his writing, which is also a part of the apostles’ teachings and the constituents of the New Testament, Peter has repeatedly in both his Epistles referred to the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102715" data-verses="1Peter 1:9-12">1 Pet. 1:9-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102716" data-verses="2Peter 1:12-21">2 Pet. 1:12-21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102717" data-verses="2Peter 3:2">3:2</span>). Now he refers to the apostle Paul in the strongest way, saying that Paul in all his writings speaks some things which are hard to understand, concerning the things of which Peter speaks in his writing, and that to twist Paul’s writings is equivalent to twisting the Scriptures as the heretics do, resulting in destruction, that is, in being judged by the Lord at His coming back. </p>
