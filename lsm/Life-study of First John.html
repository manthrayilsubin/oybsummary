<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-MXP56kd770epxQOG8uB-5t5Wll5HVyQEHhcY6kDg35U9ZDcHDykCX8Bp5fp-Ex7h">A REVELATION OF DIVINE THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="pd6Bbt3NPyVE9mcFi0N4Il_LTmq6LobGra2nOdxWav2F9cnrhpnmtJcsShBkzJmAh"> This message is an introductory word concerning the writings of John. John’s writings include his Gospel, his three Epistles, and his Revelation. These writings occupy a particular and striking place in the full revelation of God in the Bible. In his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation John writes of things that are mysterious. These things are mysterious because they are divine. Therefore, we need to see that John’s writings are altogether a revelation of divine things. Here I would emphasize two words: revelation and divine. </p>
<p data-content-id="vF4IIQh977Z6yLZuPC15Dkohs3Q_VjgMHtejaN1SMO3KhZ94GKxBavDe-dZ1qnZvi"> The entire Bible, of course, is the holy revelation of God. The Bible was not written according to man’s mind or according to human thought. Rather, the whole Bible is the divine revelation written in human language. Nevertheless, it is important for us to realize that this is especially true of John’s writings, writings that are concerned with divine things. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="aJigmhkHMCsaQv4-H_CrsJOEU6CaOXMHKH2uXmTRIedacoVBVBjciQiomTqjw4x7m">Our Need for Revelation</h2><p data-content-id="b9TQLQbBeCKIIpeWWcGDe_AsRb4crs9FHrW7NBfExSSKvxh_3cu8CPv3MICdSv85q"> Because John writes about divine things, it is necessary that these things be revealed to us. It is not possible for the natural human mentality to guess or infer what John’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> writings unveil to us. Whatever is revealed in the writings of John is far beyond our human comprehension. Hence, there is no room here for guessing or inference. Our mentality cannot grasp, lay hold of, the divine things revealed in John’s writings. The Gospel of John, the three Epistles of John, and the book of Revelation reveal matters that are beyond our ability to imagine. We cannot even conceive of these things, much less make inferences regarding them. Because John’s writings are of what is divine, we cannot with our natural mentality imagine what they contain. Only through divine revelation can the divine things in John’s writings be revealed to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFcHJ5u15ZxAiYHSZvY58HSDe5NMrPM1VUsm4k6TsFJaq-O4SNDd4YeiVXmP28L7D"> As we read the writings of John, it is not adequate merely to exercise our mentality. We need much prayer. We also need to believe that today the divine Spirit is within us, in our spirit. We should trust in this indwelling Spirit to give us the revelation of the things contained in John’s writings, and also the wisdom to grasp, lay hold of, the things we see in our spirit as a result of this revelation. Like the apostle Paul, we need to pray for a spirit of wisdom and revelation: “That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102848" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17">Eph. 1:17</span>). It is not sufficient simply to read John’s writings or meditate on them. Neither is it sufficient only to exercise our natural understanding. When we come to the writings of John, we should not trust in our reading, meditating, or understanding. On the contrary, we should pray, “Lord, I depend on You to grant me a revelation of what is contained in these writings. Lord, I do not trust my natural ability to understand Your word.” </p>
<p data-content-id="yKKB9eDIFrgaTLK1MK46XTTLY3oUY9RUpYq8CgQ0-IcLwk2G0bP3UGZmH5RVKsBFj"> The entire book of Revelation is a revelation. This is why it opens with the words, “The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102849" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Rev. 1:1</span>). The word “revelation” denotes the opening of a veil. Revelation is a matter of opening a veil to show us something mysterious hidden behind the veil. We all need such an unveiling. Many marvelous divine things have been concealed, but we may experience an unveiling and have these things revealed to us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="84n3RYDKDx94xFCgfM9dlb2KpZ5P3g4YURpxxsRaVR92YZ1bUpSXSRwFYRnjKzTph">Our Need for Understanding</h2><p data-content-id="0VQVWgS1ukzdV03AKaCp4HusRlAi_kHBNfhQyBRelJH5iijKgOT9M3ceK9_iYN0up"> Along with revelation, we also need understanding. We may see certain things, but we may not understand what we see. For example, suppose you visit a large factory and look at various kinds of machines. You see the machines, but you may not understand anything about them. Although the machines have been revealed to you, you still need understanding. The principle is the same with divine things. In addition to revelation, we also need wisdom for understanding. For this reason, Paul prayed for a spirit of wisdom and revelation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="7VBIDypFbsrB3seo-P0TEAuzHdeqby7iaa4y5jfzjzXbzw_FYoAOknClttOS5sAlQ">Turning to the Mingled Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="_7zRmizQLI750LSdci3WMRJzl0jfucvDE5ihipp8Dk5Zb1N-aTLrAC0-BZmbbCZWn"> The thought in John’s writings is absolutely divine. These writings do not contain ethical teachings or philosophical concepts. On the contrary, these writings are filled with divine matters. The word “divine” denotes something that concerns God or that belongs to God. The things concerning God and belonging to God Himself are divine, and anything divine is mysterious. We are not able to grasp, to lay hold of, these mysterious things. God is real and infinite. How can we, mere human beings, comprehend Him? This is impossible. We do not have the capacity to comprehend God. But we thank Him that He created us with a spirit, and in His salvation He has regenerated our deadened spirit and has imparted His divine life into our spirit. He has even given us Himself as the life-giving Spirit to dwell within our spirit. Only in our regenerated spirit are we qualified to see a revelation of the mysterious things in the writings of John. Our human mentality is not qualified for this. There is no possibility of seeing such things with our natural mind. Thank the Lord that we have a regenerated spirit, even a mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit. Therefore, we should turn to this mingled spirit and pray, “Lord, we trust in Your unveiling and in Your wisdom. We believe, Lord, that You want to show us something in John’s writings. Lord, as You opened the veil to the apostle John, open it again to us. Lord, we need the reopening <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> of the veil. Have mercy on us, and unveil the mysteries again. Grant us the wisdom to understand and lay hold of what You want to show us in the Epistles of John.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="B2_T8YLhauK6u6VpNIfepJFBmrLaO8nmEKoh3_bnjebpEuWtQKKBduV2zG6x7fpJd">DIGESTING THE INFINITE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="xmPKprsOh6TbK1SQkcaQRS0CXdEnvfObuTtFPjUunAX7RJ4fk17RRsdIbNYAdu7wg"> We have pointed out that the word divine denotes things that concern God and belong to God. Actually, this word denotes God Himself. Hence, to say that the writings of John reveal divine things means that they reveal God Himself. As we come to the Epistles of John, it is not our goal merely to learn things about God. We come to these Epistles in order to see the things of God. We want to grasp, receive, and even digest the things of God. How great this is! Be impressed that it is not our aim in these messages to have a Bible study. We are not endeavoring to learn something related to religion or to study matters that will help us to improve our behavior or uplift the standard of our living. In these messages on the Epistles of John our purpose is to see God, grasp God, receive God, and digest God. When some hear about digesting God, they may be bothered and ask how it is possible for God to be digested by us. I can testify that I am very happy with this expression “digest God.” Daily I receive God and digest Him. If I did not digest God, I would not be able to bear the heavy burden that is upon me. Praise Him that through digesting Him I can bear a heavy burden! Through the digesting of the infinite God, I am what I am, and you are what you are. The revelation of the divine things in John’s writings is given so that we may receive God and digest Him. </p>

In the previous message we saw that John’s writings are a revelation of divine things and that these writings are supplementary to the revelations of the other holy writings and complementary to the entire divine revelation. As we go on, we shall see that John’s writings are mysterious to human understanding and all-inclusive concerning the Person of Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="ztWqoed01v1IAPVjcjzQHIv8ipILxAC9ZdsgqX-h9OsWPZeIXDKZl3JMjwTALCxAg"> We Christians are mysterious because we have the mysterious divine life with the mysterious divine nature.

<p data-content-id="TXTkCeA2a63VJU5EK-sNUTPCKfHTKHZANajwIXiKfd8zJfayv7SIlKB5DUtukuoDo"> Toward the end of the first century, when the apostle John was writing his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation, there were already heresies concerning the Person of Christ. One heretical teaching was that Christ was God but not man, and another heresy was that Christ was man but not God. Other heretics denied that Jesus was the Christ. Because of such a situation, John was burdened to write concerning the Person of Christ in an all-inclusive way. </p>
<p data-content-id="nsBxI8oZiy5oRVOys1ZGV_Qe8LIXnPjEcJQwLCC2pi2_onfHHXIyajlsrPJXAapXZ"> In John’s writings we see that Jesus is the Christ and that the Lord Jesus Christ is both God and man. As we shall see, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102877" data-verses="1John 2:1">chapter two</span> of 1 John, the apostle John deals with the heresy of the Cerinthians, those who separate Christ from Jesus and thus deny that Jesus is the Christ. When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102878" data-verses="1John 4:1">chapter four</span>, we shall see that John deals with the heresy of the Docetists, those who deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. The writings of John reveal that Christ is all-inclusive, that Jesus is the Christ, and that He is both God and man. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="68x0xdAqK8SHqJRHmz2-kZHAgfMT_vlkO-YxoHqGFpmEKjiEWhgTHDREG81eA1e6R">Polemical against Heresies</h2><p data-content-id="RJ4qWwScdHvnvOxhcbMPymuuQ6bwpuHPIt6kuHLqwlGiCqeFgq_umGin8gWNM8gvM"> In his writings the apostle John was polemical, not against the law, circumcision, or Judaism, but against the heresies of the Gnostics, Cerinthians, and Docetists. The word “polemical” or “polemic” refers to the fighting for the truth by debating or disputing. A person who is polemical will debate strongly and sharply on behalf of the truth. He will fight for the truth and wage war for it. We need to follow John to be polemical against heresy. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjvsbLXC95jIofUewvvl31x_jdu2vXeOu5KohfFvOD1aP_kOrsv_S-UDyFM05oP1A"> We have pointed out that John was polemical against the heresies of the Gnostics, Cerinthians, and the Docetists. One source of these heresies was Greek philosophy. As Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> was polemical in his writings against such matters as the law, circumcision, and Judaism, John was polemical against philosophical concepts that led to heresy. </p>

Such writings were needed not only for the first century but have also been needed throughout all the centuries. Even today in the twentieth century, we still need them. In the coming days they will still be a great help in keeping the truth concerning the Person of Christ and in preserving His believers in all the divine realities. We hope that these Life-studies may serve the same purpose. </p>

Hence, He is also the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102922" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>) to abide coexistingly and coinheringly with the Son and the Father in the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102923" data-verses="John 14:17">John 14:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102924" data-verses="John 14:23">23</span>) to be the Triune God who is Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102925" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span>) mingled with the believers as one spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102926" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>) in their spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102927" data-verses="Romans 8:16">Rom. 8:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102928" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>).

<p data-content-id="-MXP56kd770epxQOG8uB-5t5VllsIVyQEHhcY6kDg35U9ZDcHDykCX8Bp5fp-Ex7h"> I believe that many of these points will be puzzling to those who hold to traditional systematic theology. For example, how can the seven Spirits, who are the Spirit of God, be the seven eyes of the Son, the Second of the Godhead? If the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are regarded as separate persons, how can the Third of the Godhead be the eyes of the Second? <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="pd6Bbt3NPyVE9mcFi0N4Il_LQmqTHobGra2nOdxWav2F9cnrhpnmtJcsShBkzJmAh"> Furthermore, in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus said that He came in the Father’s name. This is the reason that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102932" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>, His name is called the Father. When the Lord Jesus came, He also came with the Father. Have you ever thought that when the Lord Jesus came down from the heavens, He came with the Father? Some Christians may have the concept that when He came, He left the Father. But when the Lord Jesus came, the Father came also. </p>

The fact that he does not use personal pronouns here in reference to the Lord implies that what he intends to unfold is mysterious. </p>
<p data-content-id="xmPKprsOh6TbK1SQkcaQRS0CVdEGsfObuTtFPjUunAX7RJ4fk17RRsdIbNYAdu7wg"> Paul’s ministry is to complete the divine revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102981" data-verses="Colossians 1:25-27">Col. 1:25-27</span>) of God’s New Testament economy, that is, the Triune God in Christ as the life-giving Spirit producing the members of Christ and building up the Body of Christ so that the Triune God may have a full expression—the fullness of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102982" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">Eph. 1:23</span>)—in the universe. Paul’s writings were completed <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> around A.D. 66. His completing ministry was damaged by the apostasy preceding and following his death. Then after a quarter of a century, around A.D. 90, John’s writings came forth. His ministry was not only to mend the ministry of Paul that had been broken, but also to consummate the entire divine revelation of both the Old Testament and New Testament, of both the Gospels and the Epistles. In such a ministry, the focus is the mysteries of the divine life. In his Gospel, as the consummation of the Gospels, the mysteries of the Person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ are unveiled. In his Epistles (especially the first), as the consummation of the Epistles, the mystery of the fellowship of the divine life, which is the fellowship of God’s children with God the Father and with one another, is unfolded. Then in his Revelation, as the consummation of the New Testament and the Old Testament, the mystery of Christ being the life supply to God’s children for His expression, and the center of the universal administration of the Triune God is revealed. </p>

In the beginning traces back to eternity past before creation; from the beginning proceeds forward from the creation. This indicates that John’s Epistle is a continuation of his Gospel concerning the believers’ experience of the divine life. In his Gospel he shows the way for sinners to receive eternal life—by believing in the Son of God. In his Epistle he points out the way for the believers who have received the divine life to enjoy it in its fellowship—by abiding in the Son of God. And in his Revelation he unveils the consummation of the eternal life as the believers’ full enjoyment in eternity. </p>

When you come to a feast, it is not your purpose to study the different courses of food. Study at such a time would frustrate you from the enjoyment of eating. In like manner, we should come to John’s writings—to his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation—regarding them as courses of a spiritual feast. When some hear this, they may wonder how we can say that John’s writings are a feast. The answer is that no other writings in the Bible emphasize the matter of eating as much as John’s writings do. Of course, Paul speaks about spiritual eating, but he does not speak about this as much as John does. One chapter in the Gospel of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102996" data-verses="John 6:1">John, chapter six</span>, is almost entirely devoted to eating. There the Lord Jesus says, “I am the bread of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102997" data-verses="John 6:35">vv. 35</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="102998" data-verses="John 6:48">48</span>). Then He goes on to say that He is the living bread and that if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="102999" data-verses="John 6:51">v. 51</span>); that unless we eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood, we have no life in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103000" data-verses="John 6:53">v. 53</span>); that he who eats His flesh and drinks His blood has eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103001" data-verses="John 6:54">v. 54</span>) and abides in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103002" data-verses="John 6:56">v. 56</span>); and that the one who eats Him will also live because of Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103003" data-verses="John 6:57">v. 57</span>), for he who “eats this bread shall live forever” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103004" data-verses="John 6:58">v. 58</span>). To be sure, eating is strongly emphasized in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103005" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> of John’s Gospel. To eat of the Lord as the bread of life is to feast on Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="QXYDaOWJRqFN-OMexzzkkKKQuM2yi63I9JQNIAZfmtTqzxZboroT0AfiWGha8DsoE"> John also has much to say concerning eating in the book of Revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103006" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Revelation 2:7</span> the Lord Jesus says, “To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.” To eat of the tree of life is to enjoy Christ as our life supply. It was God’s original intention that man should eat of the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103007" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103008" data-verses="Genesis 2:16">16</span>). But due to the fall of man the tree of life was closed to him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103009" data-verses="Genesis 3:22-24">Gen. 3:22-24</span>). Through the redemption of Christ, the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103010" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19-20">Heb. 10:19-20</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="KAnj8tJPZRQJM4YpnOV1M0JzzG9pLHqIkHqU1wFtdkcPaABiJe8EzKj3ASCfLj5sp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103011" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">Revelation 2:17</span> the Lord Jesus says, “To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna.” Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food enabling God’s people to go His way. The children of Israel ate of manna during their years in the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103012" data-verses="Exodus 16:14-16">Exo. 16:14-16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103013" data-verses="Exodus 16:31">31</span>). To partake of the hidden manna certainly is to enjoy Christ by eating Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="la3oDDXAaVb3iB8-kG6CtRv8G9K7D1AISkoO1SuI43Xjp5yw-h0UIgr1QgYrdyXkT"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103014" data-verses="Revelation 3:20">Revelation 3:20</span> says, “Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me.” In this verse “dine” means to take the principal meal of the day at evening. Here the Lord promises to dine with the one who opens the door to Him. To dine is not merely to eat certain foods, but it is to enjoy the riches of a meal. This dining may refer to the eating of the rich produce of the good land of Canaan by the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103015" data-verses="Joshua 5:10-12">Josh. 5:10-12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Oq5yNluxOcFZ42LxIZQlgbnr6FHaLzmZVFp5SEX7nUut1FCw3vLXkTJ1zg_T79f2J"> These verses from the book of Revelation indicate that the Lord desires to recover the eating by God’s people of the proper food as ordained by God and typified by the tree of life the manna, and the produce of the good land, all of which are types of the various aspects of Christ as food to us. In his writings John definitely emphasizes the rich enjoyment of Christ by feasting on Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="40zTT6CnkXFE1ethYd3Z1sUNxYngh0t02z2WS_Ixj97w5y9s3Im7mWIGyNgcYDBuM"> John also speaks of eating in the last chapter of Revelation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103016" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Revelation 22:1 and 2a</span> say, “And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life....” The tree of life is for God’s people to receive and enjoy. For eternity all God’s redeemed ones will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion. According to these verses, the tree of life is the life supply available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ is found. </p>

Both life and the Word of life denote the divine Person of Christ, who was with the Father in eternity and was manifested in time through incarnation, and whom the apostles have seen and testify and report to the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="3cAlbijZNhlV_hAvtYdsNrAiNbkts7grYqDWh68tmkbEmI6H_32LcZWCR0bDu1IHg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103103" data-verses="1John 1:2">1:2</span> John says that the life was manifested. This manifestation of the eternal life was through Christ’s incarnation, which John stressed strongly in his Gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103104" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>) as an antidote to inoculate the believers against the heresy which said that Christ did not come in the flesh. Such a manifestation, corresponding to the Word of life being touchable (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103105" data-verses="1John 1:1">1:1</span>), indicates again the substantial nature of the Lord’s humanity, which is the manifestation of the divine life in the New Testament economy. </p>

The word “eternal” denotes not only the duration of time, which is <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> everlasting, without end, but also the quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect. Such an expression emphasizes the eternal nature of the divine life, the life of the eternal God. The apostles saw this eternal life and testified and reported it to people. Their experience was not of any doctrine, but of Christ the Son of God as the eternal life, and their testimony and preaching were not of theology or biblical knowledge, but of such a solid life. </p>
<p data-content-id="mn3fBEi3V-LxlHDwMqePt9A4IFoqjeifDcXA1kAfROvDK6_k4jtBDoj0aPMeQweBZ"> We have pointed out that the eternal life is eternal not only with respect to time but also with respect to quality. This life is also eternal with respect to its sphere. Therefore, the word eternal denotes three things: time, space, and quality. As to the element of time, this life will last forever. As to space, to sphere, this life is vast, unlimited. As to quality, eternal life is perfect and complete, without defect or shortage. The sphere or field of eternal life encompasses the whole universe. Eternal life is so vast that it covers the entire field of life. Whatever is in the field of life is encompassed by this eternal life. Our human life, however, is very different. Our life is not only temporary, but it is also limited. But eternal life is neither temporary nor limited; rather, it is everlasting with respect to time and unlimited with respect to space. Furthermore, our life has many defects and shortages. However, the divine life, the eternal life, has no defects and no shortages. </p>

Satan and his followers thought that they had terminated this life by crucifying it. The religious leaders had a similar concept. However, crucifixion gave this life the best opportunity to be multiplied, to be propagated.

The Greek word rendered “with” is <em>pros</em> (used with the Greek accusative case). It is a preposition of motion, implying living, acting, in union and communion with. The eternal life which is the Son was not only with the Father, but was living and acting in union and communion with the Father in eternity. This word corresponds to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103114" data-verses="John 1:1-2">John 1:1-2</span>. </p>

<p data-content-id="2xUvRB6bOMVLj3gOpKGd3TJtgHObuYKjJNLyxtwdkTsdeMpDSrbsygsl4I0z0J47y"> Instead of trying to analyze these aspects of eternal life, we should enjoy them as “courses” of a spiritual meal. Eternal life is the life of God, it is the Son of God, and it was with the Father in eternity. Here we have at least four courses for our enjoyment: God, the Son of God, the Father, and eternity. </p>

According to my experience, the best way to enjoy them is to pray-read the Word. For example, pray-read the words “the life of God” found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103115" data-verses="Ephesians 4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span>. As you pray-read, you may say, “Oh, the life of God! Amen! Right now, I enjoy God, and I enjoy Him as my life. Hallelujah for <span class="pg" data-page-id="36" id="36">[36]</span> God!

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103120" data-verses="Titus 1:2">Titus 1:2</span> Paul speaks of “the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal.” This promise of eternal life must be the promise made by the Father to the Son in eternity.

Now we come to the second basic matter, and this is the fellowship of the divine life. Actually, the fellowship of the divine life is the topic of the entire Epistle of 1 John. In the Gospel of John Jesus Christ is revealed as the divine life for us to receive. When we believe in Him, He comes into us, and we have Him as life within. As the continuation of the Gospel of John, this Epistle shows us that after receiving the divine life, we may have the fellowship of life as the issue of the divine life. The fellowship of the divine life is the real enjoyment of the divine life. In other words, if we would experience the divine life, we need to pay close attention to the fellowship of this life. </p>
<p data-content-id="esfeiNy8Uz9z4fV2253GbYiWlOcNFrt10fnFjXQ4cXutCvU9X9mLb6ExfVEmS9hEo"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103136" data-verses="1John 1:3">1:3</span> John says, “That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103137" data-verses="1John 1:1">Verse 1</span> speaks of “have heard” and then “have seen.” Here it is vice versa. In receiving revelation, hearing is the basic thing. But in preaching, in reporting, seeing should be the base. What we preach should be what we have laid hold of and experienced of the things we have heard. </p>
<p data-content-id="5oJ7E4NV8cg2Yd2SYmBplM53JmYh3Fv57O7xQnk2dJuK29gNm3Iwqy1BnGZGG7QkU"> The apostles have heard and seen the eternal life.

It is the issue of the eternal life, and is actually the flow of the eternal life within all the believers, who have received and possess the divine life. It is illustrated by the flow of the water of life in the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103138" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Rev. 22:1</span>). Hence, all genuine believers are in this fellowship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103139" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>). It is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Hence, it is called “the fellowship of the Holy Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103140" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>) and “fellowship of [our] spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103141" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">Phil. 2:1</span>). It is in this fellowship of the eternal life that we the believers participate in all the Father and the Son are and have done for us; that is, we enjoy the love of the Father and the grace of the Son by virtue of the fellowship of the Spirit. Such a fellowship was first the apostles’ portion in enjoying the Father and the Son through the Spirit. Hence, it is called “the fellowship of the apostles” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103142" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>) and “the fellowship which is ours [the apostles’]” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103143" data-verses="1John 1:3">1 John 1:3</span>, a fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.

Therefore, to have fellowship is to have a corporate participation in something. The fellowship of the divine life is the issue and flow of the divine life. Because the divine life is organic, rich, moving, and active, it has a particular issue, a certain kind of outcome. The issue, the outcome, of the divine life is the fellowship of life. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103145" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> we have God, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103146" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22:1</span> we have God with the Lamb. In Genesis we have the creating God, but in Revelation we have the redeeming God. Out of this redeeming God as the source flows the river of water of life. The flow of the river of water of life is the fellowship of life. This means <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> that fellowship is the outflow of the divine life from within the redeeming God. </p>
<p data-content-id="3cAlbijZNhlV_hAvtYdsNrAiMbkIk7grYqDWh68tmkbEmI6H_32LcZWCR0bDu1IHg"> According to the picture in Revelation, the river in the New Jerusalem flows downward in a spiral until it reaches the twelve gates of the city. By this we can see that the entire city of the New Jerusalem is supplied by the flow of this living water; that is, it is supplied by the fellowship of life. The fellowship of the divine life flows out of God and through His people in order to reach every part of the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. </p>

It is this flow that brings the grace of Christ and the love of God to us for our enjoyment. Therefore, the fellowship of the divine life is called the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. </p>

This means that there is a joint enjoyment of the Triune God among the believers and the apostles. The believers and the apostles need to have contact with one another. When there is the proper contact, there will be a two-way traffic, and this traffic is fellowship, a common participation. When we have this two-way traffic, we enjoy the divine life that is within us. This means that when we have fellowship, we have the enjoyment of the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="DQtKlqfyuaSTzil_hM3_dwXID1WiwazYYTXATQgw7W9SDVQS0sPurlamq5vSPMQxU"> The more of this two-way traffic we have, the better it will be. The more we contact the apostles, the more we shall enjoy the divine life. However, some may point out that the apostles are no longer with us. This is true, but we still have <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> the writings of the apostles. Whenever we come to the apostles’ writings, we may have the sense of being brought into fellowship with the apostles and enjoying the two-way traffic between us and them. Then in this traffic we enjoy the divine life together with them. </p>

John says that first the believers have fellowship with the apostles through the divine life. Then he says that the apostles have fellowship with the Father and the Son. By this we see that fellowship joins the believers to the apostles and to the Father and the Son. Therefore, in this fellowship there is the full oneness of the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="esfeiNy8Uz9z4fV2253GbYiWlOccPrt10fnFjXQ4cXutCvU9X9mLb6ExfVEmS9hEo"> The flowing of electricity is a good illustration of the fellowship of the divine life. Electricity flows from the power plant into a building. The electrical current connects the power plant to the building. Furthermore, in a lighted ceiling of a particular room in the building, the individual lights are connected to each other by the flow of the electrical current. Apart from the flow of the current, the lights in the ceiling are separate. But through the flow of electricity, the lights are brought into a “fellowship” with one another, for they are all in the one flow of electricity. This is an illustration of the fact that the apostles and the believers enjoy fellowship together in the divine life. </p>

Although we have not covered these matters thoroughly, I believe that they have been somewhat opened to us and that we have at least received hints concerning how to delve into them further. In this message we shall begin to consider the conditions of the divine fellowship, that is, the terms that must be fulfilled in order to enjoy this fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="j0SOOFIflP3ERSaDjOND_xFLRkcWFq8j2iJ-DvwwdoXXEhkU0nic63EalVdhoz9en"> If we would be in the divine fellowship, we need to fulfill certain conditions, terms, or obligations. Only then can we enjoy the divine fellowship. This matter of the conditions of the divine fellowship is revealed in the second half of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103177" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> and in the first half of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103178" data-verses="1John 2:1">chapter two</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103179" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5—2:11</span>). Only two verses speak of the divine life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103180" data-verses="1John 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>) and another two verses of the divine fellowship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103181" data-verses="1John 1:3-4">1:3-4</span>), whereas seventeen verses are related to the conditions of the divine fellowship. This indicates that, as far as we are concerned, the conditions of the fellowship are a very important matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="TXTkCeA2a63VJU5EK-sNUTPCOfH2CHZANajwIXiKfd8zJfayv7SIlKB5DUtukuoDo"> The divine life and the divine fellowship are both on God’s side. However, the conditions, the terms, the obligations, by which we can enjoy the divine fellowship are on our side. It is simple to receive the divine life and to be brought into the fellowship of the divine life. But it is not a simple matter to maintain this fellowship and remain in it. For this reason, the apostle John does not pass over the conditions that must be fulfilled if we are to remain in the divine <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> fellowship. As we shall see, there are two main conditions covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103182" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5—2:11</span>: the confessing of sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103183" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5—2:2</span>) and the loving of God and the brothers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103184" data-verses="1John 2:3-11">2:3-11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="nsBxI8oZiy5oRVOys1ZGV_Qe4LI2uPjEcJQwLCC2pi2_onfHHXIyajlsrPJXAapXZ"> The first condition of the divine fellowship involves both sin and sins. Sin and sins are a serious problem concerning our enjoyment of the divine fellowship, for they cause our fellowship with the Triune God to be frustrated and broken. Therefore, the apostle John devotes a number of verses to confessing our sins. Before we consider these verses, I would like to bring to our attention some matters that will help us to understand John’s writing concerning sin and sins. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pd6Bbt3NPyVE9mcFi0N4Il_LUmqfBobGra2nOdxWav2F9cnrhpnmtJcsShBkzJmAh">INDWELLING SIN</h2><p data-content-id="vF4IIQh977Z6yLZuPC15Dkohr3QeejgMHtejaN1SMO3KhZ94GKxBavDe-dZ1qnZvi"> According to the Bible, sin dwells within us, in our flesh. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103185" data-verses="Romans 7:20">Romans 7:20</span> says, “But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.” The word “dwell” here indicates that sin is something living. Anything that is not living, such as a chair, cannot dwell anywhere. For example, you would not say that a chair dwells in your home. In order for a certain thing to dwell in a particular place, that thing must be living and organic. Hence, the fact that sin dwells within us indicates that sin is a living entity. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBUhCROQnVG_-YKH2BunBB4VEqFch7zK22B6maOtNpMDJBJVQOGaPDnWeE_-Dfp3f"> The sin described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103186" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> is personified. The activities of sin are those of a person. Sin takes occasion through the commandment and works coveting in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103187" data-verses="Romans 7:8">v. 8</span>). Furthermore, sin may deceive us and kill us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103188" data-verses="Romans 7:11">v. 11</span>). According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103189" data-verses="Romans 7:17">verse 17</span>, sin dwells in us and does certain things in us: “So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.” Moreover, Paul says that sin enters (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103190" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Rom. 5:12</span>), reigns (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103191" data-verses="Romans 5:21">Rom. 5:21</span>), lords it over people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103192" data-verses="Romans 6:14">Rom. 6:14</span>), works death in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103193" data-verses="Romans 7:13">Rom. 7:13</span>), and is something that is quite alive (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103194" data-verses="Romans 7:9">Rom. 7:9</span>). Therefore, sin is not a lifeless element or substance. On the contrary, sin is a living thing that can dwell in us and do things against our will. This was the reason Paul could say that it was not he who did certain things, but sin that dwelt in him. </p>
<p data-content-id="2xUvRB6bOMVLj3gOpKGd3TJtiHOXsYKjJNLyxtwdkTsdeMpDSrbsygsl4I0z0J47y"> Some oppose us for teaching that sin dwells in our flesh and that this sin dwelling in us is something personified. <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> However, this teaching concerning indwelling sin and its activities is altogether according to the Scriptures. We cannot deny what Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103195" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> regarding sin. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="u1sqLDoEOByMLopgbu_aCqIWeZwxJW5k74G9JvNqSDBMoewTPOGPF3BlexAbSZMFU">SINS, THE FRUIT OF SIN</h2><p data-content-id="fX0psknrQuL7J7uZCPBLmWtlFYY6uQ0hHDzsYlbALepmSVHxblGdG69ounyizwRB2"> Of course, the Bible speaks both of sin and sins. Sins refer to trespasses, transgressions, and wrongdoings. For example, lying and stealing are sins. These sins are different from the sin that dwells in our flesh. Sins are deeds and activities, but sin is an evil element that dwells in our flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="IAEglTO5-PveUJvF1lWxKJmrrYoxl2nNfpgL8X4B-R4Wo2ONs8YiCa3cVul_enZ8w"> The New Testament deals with the problem of sin by using both the word sin in the singular and the word sins in the plural. “Sin” refers to the indwelling sin, which came through Adam into mankind from Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103196" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Rom. 5:12</span>). Sin is dealt with in the second section of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103197" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans, 5:12</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103198" data-verses="Romans 8:13">8:13</span> (with the exception of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103199" data-verses="Romans 7:5">7:5</span>, where “sins” are mentioned). “Sins” refer to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103200" data-verses="Romans 1:18">Romans, 1:18</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103201" data-verses="Romans 5:11">5:11</span>. However, the singular sin in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103202" data-verses="1John 1:7">1 John 1:7</span> with the adjective “all” does not denote the indwelling sin, but denotes every single sin we have committed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103203" data-verses="1John 1:10">v. 10</span>), after we have been regenerated. Such sin defiles our purged conscience and needs to be cleansed away by the blood of the Lord in our fellowship with God. </p>

<p data-content-id="kwpmPGODR_HqrtquI-1xXx5NAUWSH1h50QIifl8NGXNdS36pTzY-bvFX82iimNHp_"> The Bible reveals that when the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was made sin for us. Regarding this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103217" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span> says, “Him who did not know sin He made sin on our <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> behalf, that we might become God’s righteousness in Him.” Because the Lord was made sin for us, He condemned sin through His death on the cross. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103218" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> says, “God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.” Here we see that through the crucifixion of Christ, sin was condemned. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103219" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> speaks of Him as the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103220" data-verses="Hebrews 9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span> says that Christ “has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice.” This means that Christ offered Himself for sin. As we consider these four verses, we realize that the Lord Jesus died on the cross to deal with sin, the very sin that dwells within us. He became sin, He condemned sin, He took away sin, and He was an offering for sin. Christ as the offering for sin is typified by the sin offering in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103221" data-verses="Leviticus 4:1">chapter four</span> of Leviticus. </p>
<p data-content-id="JK1tOOo6YAEZffeFYvDJ0DQO5ONKb85WqGku6EADZi_KVs6rkRSoTbBOm2k-7ZLI8"> As we have pointed out, we have not only the problem of sin in our flesh, but also the problem of the many sins we have committed. We have done many wrong things. For example, instead of honoring our parents, we may have despised them. This is sinful. We all have committed many trespasses, transgressions, offenses, and wrongdoings. All these are sins. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross to deal with our sin, He also bore our sins. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103222" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">First Peter 2:24</span> says, “Who Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree.” This verse clearly indicates that Christ bore our sins. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103223" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span> Paul declares, “Christ died for our sins.” Moreover, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103224" data-verses="Hebrews 9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span> we are told that Christ was “once offered to bear the sins of many.” By these verses we see that when the Lord was on the cross, He not only dealt with our sin, but also bore our sins. Therefore, He is both the sin offering and the trespass offering. </p>

<p data-content-id="ZBXnfJ6UP-Fda9whE9Gct_rAio2HblpegKFSHc9jieeNRg-6ivGO1dX-Dj71CxbLl"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that the believers’ relationship in life with God is unbreakable, but their fellowship with Him can be broken. The former is unconditional and has been settled once for all; however, the latter is conditional and may fluctuate. Let us now go on in this message to consider the first condition that must be fulfilled if we are to maintain the divine fellowship: the confessing of sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103241" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5—2:2</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ABJfl-uaPAyBgWk9Nfoh4r7d17DNlBULqJ-COVeQYUnu0KigDNsnClbv9bdMJdfbR">ABIDING IN GOD AS LIGHT</h2><p data-content-id="Fjf9eLUxZuRzIgkrskf4ENZSH62bbr3gu3epFJ226l_2GQqT0RXB5avmTF1oGxSDX"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103242" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5</span> John says, “And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.” This verse speaks of God. In order to maintain fellowship with God, we need to abide in God. We have seen that in this Epistle there are seven mysteries: the divine life, the fellowship of the divine life, the anointing of the Triune God, abiding in the Lord, the divine birth, the divine seed, and the water, the blood, and the Spirit. Here we are concerned with the mystery of abiding. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus said, “Abide in Me, and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103243" data-verses="John 15:4">15:4</span>). Because He is the vine and we are the branches, we need to abide in Him. This revelation concerning abiding is a great matter and a crucial one. We all need to abide in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="C5iZHjQEESBTbUVTrqRwpnlzreYQg2NAir21H0caRx3O1t-5AgiFhkPSjvArHBZnX"> What does it mean to abide in God? Many years ago, I thought that to abide is merely to stay or remain. The Chinese version of the Bible uses the word “dwell.” More <span class="pg" data-page-id="60" id="60">[60]</span> than three hundred years ago, when the King James Version was translated, in English the word “abide” did have the connotation of dwell. However, this connotation has largely been lost, and today the word abide primarily means to stay or remain. Actually, “dwell” is a more accurate rendering of the Greek. To abide in God, therefore, is to dwell in Him. Not only should we stay in God—we should dwell in Him. We should live, act, move, and have our being in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="SU2ZTjy5OGYluzV9gZc6I5uiU2_GmeN-7xCAqf5pl981Y-SstP2uc3Ykx4Zp396M1"> This thought corresponds to that conveyed by the word “walk” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103244" data-verses="1John 1:7">verse 7</span>, where we are told to walk in the light. The Greek word translated “walk” means to move, act, and have our being. As we remain in God, we should dwell in Him and have our being in Him. God is our true dwelling place, our home. Hence, wherever God goes, we should go with Him and in Him. Because God is our dwelling place, we need to dwell in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPZwIBWVLNzIUHN7kStCQ654l3Ptvl4Kl8HEES34jsiFdri3coL8reMmqLT40dAx6"> We need to know not only who God is but also what God is. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103245" data-verses="1John 1:5">First John 1:5</span> tells us that God is light and that in Him is no darkness at all. The very God in whom we dwell is light. The first aspect of the first condition of maintaining our fellowship with God is to dwell in God as light. When the house in which we dwell is full of light, we also are in light, not in darkness. In a similar way, when we dwell in God, we dwell in light, for God is light. </p>
<p data-content-id="esfeiNy8Uz9z4fV2253GbYiWnOcQNrt10fnFjXQ4cXutCvU9X9mLb6ExfVEmS9hEo"> If we do not dwell in God, our fellowship with Him will immediately be broken. Whenever we do not dwell in God, we are out of the divine fellowship. However, our life relationship with God is not broken. For example, whether a child’s behavior is good or bad, he still has a relationship in life with his father. Whether a child stays at home or tries to run away, the relationship in life with his father remains unbroken. However, the child may not remain in fellowship with his father. There may be times when he does not want to be in the same room with his father or talk with him face to face. This is because the fellowship has been broken, although the life relationship remains. Our life relationship with God cannot be broken. But our fellowship with Him will be broken if we do not abide in Him as the divine light. <span class="pg" data-page-id="61" id="61">[61]</span> </p>

But when we do not have the divine light but are rather in darkness, we have the sense that everything is vanity and emptiness. I would ask you to consider your experience. When you are in the divine light, you can see the truth, the reality. For example, when you are in the light, God is a reality to you, and the divine life is also a reality. Furthermore, God’s holiness, love, and grace are all realities to you. When we walk in the light, we see one reality after another. However, when we are in darkness, nothing is real to us. On the contrary, everything is empty, vain. When we are in darkness, we do not have any reality because we do not see anything.

<p data-content-id="u1sqLDoEOByMLopgbu_aCqIWQZwsHW5k74G9JvNqSDBMoewTPOGPF3BlexAbSZMFU"> We have seen that the believers’ relationship in life with God is unbreakable, but their fellowship with Him can be broken. This means that our life relationship with God is unconditional, whereas our fellowship with God is conditional. The first condition of the divine fellowship is that of confessing sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103274" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5—2:22</span>). Related to this first condition are the matters of abiding in God as light, walking in the divine light, and practicing the divine truth. In this message we shall go on to consider the cleansing of the blood of Jesus, the Son of God. </p>

When we walk in the light, which is God Himself, we have the co-enjoyment of the Triune God and the co-participation in His purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="HwMO3cvZ0bsnsA0tpNdFIfurZ59J4M4Pm-yVbCByoE_QqtH4WFIgrRpe3y2WqGcVm"> When we live in the divine life, we are under its enlightenment, and it exposes, according to God’s divine nature and through His nature in us, all our sin, trespasses, failures, and defects, which contradict His pure light, perfect love, absolute holiness, and excelling righteousness. At such a time we sense in our enlightened conscience the need of the cleansing of the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> it cleanses us in our conscience from all sins so that our fellowship with God and with one another may be maintained. Our relationship with God is unbreakable, yet our fellowship with Him may be broken. The former is of life, whereas the latter is based upon our living, though it is also of life. One is unconditional; the other is conditional. This conditional one, our fellowship with God, needs to be maintained by the constant cleansing of the Lord’s blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="XkwcSjgfEhTzaME596SB0SU30aKtJIUgzYa0NsdWxLYhUHNpANkftayVDpm4bNwhp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103276" data-verses="1John 1:7">verse 7</span> John says that the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin. The tense of the verb “cleanses” in Greek is present and continuous. This indicates that the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanses us all the time, continuously and constantly. Cleansing here refers to the instant cleansing of the Lord’s blood in our conscience. Before God, the redeeming blood of the Lord has cleansed us once for all eternally (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103277" data-verses="Hebrews 9:12">Heb. 9:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103278" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">14</span>), and the efficacy of that cleansing lasts forever before God, needing no repetition. However, in our conscience we need the instant application of the constant cleansing of the Lord’s blood again and again whenever our conscience is enlightened by the divine light in our fellowship with God. This instant cleansing is typified by the purification of the ashes of the heifer for a water of separation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103279" data-verses="Numbers 19:2-10">Num. 19:2-10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="kwpmPGODR_HqrtquI-1xXx5NOUWSP1h50QIifl8NGXNdS36pTzY-bvFX82iimNHp_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103280" data-verses="1John 1:7">verse 7</span> John specifically says that the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin. The New Testament speaks of sin and also of sins. “Sin” usually refers to indwelling sin, which is dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103281" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103282" data-verses="Romans 8:13">8:13</span>. “Sins” refer to sinful deeds, the fruits of indwelling sin, which are dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103283" data-verses="Romans 1:18">Romans 1:18</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103284" data-verses="Romans 5:11">5:11</span>. However, the singular sin in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103285" data-verses="1John 1:7">1:7</span> with the adjective “all” does not denote indwelling sin; rather, it denotes every single sin we have committed since we have been regenerated. The sins we commit after regeneration defile our purged conscience and need to be cleansed away by the blood of Jesus in our fellowship with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="JK1tOOo6YAEZffeFYvDJ0DQO3ONGZ85WqGku6EADZi_KVs6rkRSoTbBOm2k-7ZLI8"> When we are in the divine fellowship, we are in the light, and when we are in the light, we are exposed by the light. The divine light is much stronger than an x-ray. This light exposes whatever is wrong in our being. As we walk in <span class="pg" data-page-id="69" id="69">[69]</span> the light and practice the reality in the light, the light shines within us, upon us, and through us. Exposed by this shining, we realize that we are wrong in many matters. We may see that we are wrong in our thoughts, emotions, motives, and intentions. We may also see that we are wrong with certain brothers and sisters. Because we are exposed in this way, our conscience is condemned. In order to deal with this condemnation in our conscience, we need the cleansing of the Lord’s blood. It is when we are in the fellowship and under the light that we see our failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, impure motives, and evil intentions. But at this very juncture, the blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses us from every sin. As we have pointed out, the tense of the Greek verb rendered “cleanses” indicates that, when we walk in the light and are in fellowship with God and with one another, the blood of Jesus cleanses us constantly, unceasingly. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ztWqoed01v1IAPVjcjzQHIv8opIq4AC9ZdsgqX-h9OsWPZeIXDKZl3JMjwTALCxAg">JESUS HIS SON</h2><p data-content-id="aJigmhkHMCsaQv4-H_CrsJOEd6CaKXMHKH2uXmTRIedacoVBVBjciQiomTqjw4x7m"> It is significant that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103286" data-verses="1John 1:7">1:7</span> the apostle John speaks of “the blood of Jesus His Son.” The name Jesus denotes the Lord’s humanity, which is needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title “His Son” denotes the Lord’s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, the blood of Jesus His Son indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man for redeeming God’s fallen creatures with divine surety for its eternal efficacy, an efficacy which is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time. </p>
<p data-content-id="b9TQLQbBeCKIIpeWWcGDe_AsYb4cvs9FHrW7NBfExSSKvxh_3cu8CPv3MICdSv85q"> The title “Jesus His Son” is also used by John as an inoculation against the heresies concerning the Lord’s Person. One of the heresies insisted on the divinity of the Lord by denying His humanity. The title Jesus as the name of a man inoculates against this heresy. Another heresy insisted on the humanity of the Lord by denying His divinity. The title “His Son” as a name of the Deity is an antidote to this heresy. <span class="pg" data-page-id="70" id="70">[70]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="qFcHJ5u15ZxAiYHSZvY58HSDX5NMvPM1VUsm4k6TsFJaq-O4SNDd4YeiVXmP28L7D"> No other verse in the New Testament uses the expression “Jesus His Son.” We have just pointed out that the name Jesus refers to the Lord’s humanity and that the title “His Son” denotes His divinity. Jesus was a true man, a genuine human being, and the blood of Jesus was the blood of a real man. Because we are human beings, we need to be redeemed by human blood. In the Old Testament the blood for atonement was of animals, and was a type of the blood of Christ. However, animal blood could not actually redeem us, because we are human beings, not animals. As human beings, we need the efficacious blood of Jesus, the blood of a genuine man. </p>
<p data-content-id="yKKB9eDIFrgaTLK1MK46XTTLR3oUc9RUpYq8CgQ0-IcLwk2G0bP3UGZmH5RVKsBFj"> The Lord’s divinity indicated by the words “His Son” is a guarantee, a surety, that the efficacy of the blood of Jesus will remain forever. The Lord’s humanity qualifies Him to have the blood to shed for our redemption. His divinity insures the efficacy of the power of this redeeming blood. The efficacy of the cleansing blood of Jesus is insured forever by His divinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="84n3RYDKDx94xFCgfM9dlb2KgZ5P7g4YURpxxsRaVR92YZ1bUpSXSRwFYRnjKzTph"> We have seen that when John wrote this Epistle, there were heresies concerning the Person of Christ. One kind of heretical teaching said that Jesus was divine but not human. A different kind of heretical teaching claimed that Jesus was human but not divine. With one short expression—“the blood of Jesus His Son”—John inoculates us against both kinds of heresies. The words “the blood of Jesus” indicate that Jesus was a genuine man, and the words “His Son” indicate that He is divine. The blood by which we are cleansed is the blood of a wonderful Person who has both humanity and divinity. </p>

The more we have of eternal life, the more of its fellowship it brings to us. The more fellowship of the divine life we enjoy, the more divine light we receive. The more divine light we receive, the more we participate in the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. Such a cycle brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach its maturity. </p>

<p data-content-id="9TeA3RIQ_QniyeGixI-6-NnwDWVlmOjoCl3RZox4PoN4pPv5KJU_UKGO2cQv0NkoL"> Suppose the parents of a certain young person in the Lord’s recovery are opposing him. That brother should not be offended by his parents, and he should not argue with them. Instead, with a good spirit and a pleasant attitude, he should present the truth to his parents. Perhaps during a visit with them he may say, “Dad and Mom, let me tell you that light is the essence of God’s expression and that truth is the issue of this light. Aren’t you glad to hear about this? This light shines in the divine life, and the divine life is in Jesus Christ. Christ is even the life. The Lord Jesus says, ‘I am the life.’ When we are in this life, we have the shining of the divine light. Then as we are under this shining, we have the truth.” Perhaps this brother’s parents will accept his word, or they may reject it. But whatever the case may be, when he leaves them, he may want to say, “Dad and Mom, I need to go now. But I leave with you three ‘diamonds’—life, light, and truth.” </p>
<p data-content-id="j0SOOFIflP3ERSaDjOND_xFLekcPKq8j2iJ-DvwwdoXXEhkU0nic63EalVdhoz9en"> Many Christians are familiar with biblical terms, but they may not know the meaning of these terms. If you ask them concerning the meaning of light, truth, and life, they <span class="pg" data-page-id="77" id="77">[77]</span> may answer that they do not know the meaning of these things. Therefore, we need to be able to present the precious truths regarding these matters to others. The need in the Lord’s recovery today is that we all learn the truth, experience the truth, and develop the skill to present the truth to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="TXTkCeA2a63VJU5EK-sNUTPCBfHTOHZANajwIXiKfd8zJfayv7SIlKB5DUtukuoDo"> The Lord’s recovery spreads by means of the truth. Many of us can testify that we were not attracted to the Lord’s recovery by a powerful and charming speaker. Rather, we were attracted by the truth. We were drawn this way by the presentation of biblical truth. For example, I know of one brother who was attracted by the presentation of how the first two chapters of the Bible, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103304" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span>, and the last two chapters of the Bible, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103305" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span>, reflect each other. Eventually, this brother was gained for the Lord’s recovery by this truth. My goal in all the conferences and the trainings is simply to present the truths of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="nsBxI8oZiy5oRVOys1ZGV_Qe3LIXjPjEcJQwLCC2pi2_onfHHXIyajlsrPJXAapXZ"> I am glad to see that many of the young ones among us are eager to know the truth of the Word. After a period of time, these young people will be useful in the Lord’s recovery. Those who are teen-agers at present will eventually be useful in spreading the biblical truths. Praise the Lord for the opportunity He has given us to be trained in the truths of the Bible! </p>

Now we must go on to see that the divine light is embodied in Jesus as God incarnate. Because He is the embodiment of the divine light, the Lord Jesus said, “I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103306" data-verses="John 8:12">John 8:12</span>). He spoke a similar word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103307" data-verses="John 9:5">John 9:5</span>: “While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” The divine light that issues in truth and shines in life is embodied in the Person of the Lord Jesus, who is God incarnate. This matter is deep and profound. I would encourage you to pray-read <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> these verses in order to touch the reality of these matters concerning the divine light. </p>

It is difficult to define truth. We may think that truth in such a verse as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103309" data-verses="1John 1:6">1:6</span> refers to sound or correct doctrine. The word for truth in the Chinese language means genuine doctrine. Many have a similar understanding of the English word “truth” and consider that, at least insofar as it is found in the Bible, it means correct doctrine. </p>

<p data-content-id="ABJfl-uaPAyBgWk9Nfoh4r7d77DYqBULqJ-COVeQYUnu0KigDNsnClbv9bdMJdfbR"> The Greek word for truth is <em>aletheia.</em> In studying this word, I consulted a number of lexicons and concordances. I was especially helped by the article on truth in Kittel’s <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament.</em> Furthermore, I also considered all the verses in the New Testament that use either the word <em>aletheia</em> or a related word. After studying these verses in context and after consulting the lexicons and concordances, I came to certain conclusions regarding the meaning of truth in the New Testament, and these conclusions are summarized in the lengthy <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103310" data-verses="1John 1:6">note</span> on truth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103311" data-verses="1John 1:6">1:6</span> printed in the Recovery Version of the Epistles of John.

God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.” Some hold the concept that the word truth in these verses denotes the sincerity of God’s worshippers. According to this concept, we should worship God not only in our spirit and with our spirit, but also worship Him in sincerity. This understanding is mistaken. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103376" data-verses="John 4:23-24">John 4:23 and 24</span> truth refers to the result, the issue, of God being reality to us.

When we enjoy the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—as our reality, that is, when the Divine Trinity becomes a reality to us for our enjoyment, this enjoyment issues in a certain kind of virtue.

When they went to Jerusalem to worship God, they could not be empty-handed. They were required to go to Jerusalem with offerings for the worship of God. All those offerings were types of Christ. Therefore, the children of Israel worshipped God in the place designated by God and with the offerings required by God. In typology the place chosen by God typifies the human spirit, where God’s habitation is today (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103377" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Eph. 2:22</span>), and the offerings typify Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Oq5yNluxOcFZ42LxIZQlgbnv5FHWNzmZVFp5SEX7nUut1FCw3vLXkTJ1zg_T79f2J"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103378" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span> of John the Samaritan woman said to the Lord Jesus, “Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103379" data-verses="John 4:20">v. 20</span>). The Lord Jesus answered, “Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103380" data-verses="John 4:21">v. 21</span>). The Lord’s answer indicates that the dispensation was changing. In Old Testament times God commanded His people to worship Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> in Jerusalem with the offerings. But the hour has changed, and now is the hour of the Spirit. Therefore, the Lord went on to say that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit, not in a certain place. This means that in the fulfillment of the typology, the human spirit replaces Jerusalem as the designated place. The Lord also told the Samaritan woman that the true worshippers must worship the Father not only in spirit, but also in reality. Reality here is the Christ whom we experience as the reality of all the offerings. Hence, Christ as the offerings is the fulfillment of the type of the sacrifices used in the worship of God. Today we need to worship God in our spirit and with the Christ whom we have experienced as the burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="40zTT6CnkXFE1ethYd3Z1sUJyYnsr0t02z2WS_Ixj97w5y9s3Im7mWIGyNgcYDBuM"> We need to worship the Father with the Christ who is the fulfillment of the offerings that the children of Israel offered in their worship to God. This Christ is not the objective Christ; rather, He is the subjective Christ, the Christ whom we have experienced. The experience of Christ as the fulfillment of the offerings results in reality. This is the reality in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103381" data-verses="John 4:23-24">John 4:23 and 24</span>, the divine reality experienced by us and resulting in our virtue. This virtue also is reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="obx1QC4qWRaRyglw7DiaTeVTPZbxesvzx7mNj8ptpL1L6KbH0JCWnp6xslWl3O42-"> Suppose two Israelites, one from the tribe of Judah and the other from the tribe of Dan, came to worship God. They both had to worship in Jerusalem, in particular, on Mount Zion, which was in the center of Jerusalem. They also had to worship God with certain offerings; they were not allowed to appear before Him empty-handed. For the proper worship of God they had to come to the place designated by God, and they had to bring their offerings. If they fulfilled these requirements, their worship of God would be proper. </p>
<p data-content-id="3cAlbijZNhlV_hAvtYdsNrAmJbkEi7grYqDWh68tmkbEmI6H_32LcZWCR0bDu1IHg"> According to the Old Testament, proper worship is not a matter of one’s physical posture before God; that is, it is not a matter of standing, kneeling, or prostrating oneself. Proper worship in the Old Testament is a matter of coming to the right place—Mount Zion in Jerusalem—and with the right things—the offerings. After the offerings were presented to <span class="pg" data-page-id="85" id="85">[85]</span> God, those who offered them could also enjoy them with God by eating a portion of them. Therefore, proper worship includes coming to the right place, presenting the offerings to God, and eating the offerings in the presence of God. This indicates that singing, praising, and praying are not the prerequisites for the proper worship of God. The prerequisites are the place God designates and the offerings God requires. After the offerings were offered to God at the place designated by God, they were enjoyed by the offerers in the presence of God and with God. According to typology, this is proper worship. </p>

In addition to these seven aspects of the truth, we need to see that truth in the New Testament denotes things that are true or real, the true or real state of affairs (facts), reality, veracity, as the opposite of falsehood, deception, dissimulation, hypocrisy, and error (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103386" data-verses="Mark 5:33">Mark 5:33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103387" data-verses="Mark 12:32">12:32</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103388" data-verses="Luke 4:25">Luke 4:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103389" data-verses="John 16:7">John 16:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103390" data-verses="Acts 4:27">Acts 4:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103391" data-verses="Acts 10:34">10:34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103392" data-verses="Acts 26:25">26:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103393" data-verses="Romans 1:25">Rom. 1:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103394" data-verses="Romans 9:1">9:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103395" data-verses="2Corinthians 6:7">2 Cor. 6:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103396" data-verses="2Corinthians 7:14">7:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103397" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:6">12:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103398" data-verses="Colossians 1:6">Col. 1:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103399" data-verses="1Timothy 2:7">1 Tim. 2:7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="gPZwIBWVLNzIUHN7kStCQ658j3PMkl4Kl8HEES34jsiFdri3coL8reMmqLT40dAx6"> Nearly all these eight aspects of the truth refer to the Triune God. The Triune God, who is the reality of everything, is revealed in the Word and conveyed to us by the Word. What is revealed in and conveyed by the Word is the content of our Christian belief and also the content of the New Testament. This content implies the real situation concerning God, man, the universe, man’s relationship to God and to others, and our obligation to God. All these different realities are related to the unique reality, which is the Triune God Himself. Then through our experience of Christ this reality becomes our human reality, that is, it becomes <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> our human virtue with which we worship God. Finally, truth refers to things which are true and real. </p>
<p data-content-id="68x0xdAqK8SHqJRHmz2-kZHEjfMT7vlkO-YxoHqGFpmEKjiEWhgTHDREG81eA1e6R"> All the different realities revealed in the New Testament are related either directly or indirectly to the unique reality—the Triune God. Therefore, for us Christians the knowledge of what is true or real must come through our experience of the Triune God. </p>

God, Christ, and the Spirit—the Divine Trinity—are essentially one. Hence, these Three, being the basic elements of the substance of the divine reality, are actually one reality. This one divine reality is the substance of the Word of God as the divine revelation. Hence, it becomes the revealed divine reality in the divine Word and makes the divine Word the reality. The divine Word conveys this one divine reality as the contents of the faith, and the contents of the faith are the substance of the gospel revealed in the entire New Testament as its reality, which is just the divine reality of the Divine Trinity. When this divine reality is partaken of and enjoyed by us, it becomes our genuineness, sincerity, honesty, and trustworthiness as an excellent virtue in our behavior to express God, the God of reality, by whom we live; and we become persons living a life of truth, without any falsehood or hypocrisy, a life which corresponds to the truth revealed through creation and the Scripture. </p>
<p data-content-id="wdPoXce5OP5p8XuT7-mS2kx2NUmrCX_iTvR-wsSKM3NrgmMOCGW2l-v1Di4D08766"> The word <em>aletheia</em> is used in the New Testament more than one hundred times. Its denotation in each occurrence is determined by its context. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103400" data-verses="John 3:21">John 3:21</span>, according to the context, it denotes uprightness (opposite to evil—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103401" data-verses="John 3:19-20">vv. 19-20</span>), which is the reality manifested in a man who lives in God according to what He is and which corresponds to the divine light, which is God, as the source of the truth, manifested in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103402" data-verses="John 4:23-24">John 4:23-24</span>, according to the context of this chapter and also to the divine revelation of John’s Gospel, it denotes the divine reality becoming <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> man’s genuineness and sincerity (opposite to the hypocrisy of the immoral Samaritan worshipper—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103403" data-verses="John 4:16-18">vv. 16-18</span>) for the true worship of God. The divine reality is Christ who is the truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103404" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>) as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament for God’s worship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103405" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103406" data-verses="John 3:14">3:14</span>) and as the fountain of living water, the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103407" data-verses="John 4:7-15">John 4:7-15</span>), partaken of and drunk by His believers to be the reality within them, which eventually becomes their genuineness and sincerity in which they worship God with the worship He seeks. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103408" data-verses="John 5:33">John 5:33</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103409" data-verses="John 18:37">18:37</span>, according to the entire revelation of the Gospel of John, truth denotes the divine reality embodied, revealed, and expressed in Christ as the Son of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103410" data-verses="John 8:32">John 8:32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103411" data-verses="John 8:40">40</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103412" data-verses="John 8:44-46">44-46</span>, according to the context of the chapter, it denotes the reality of God revealed in His word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103413" data-verses="John 8:47">v. 47</span>) and embodied in Christ the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103414" data-verses="John 8:36">v. 36</span>), which sets us free from the bondage of sin. </p>

It is the issue and realization of the divine light in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103416" data-verses="1John 1:5">verse 5</span>. The divine light is the source in God. Truth is its issue and realization in us. When we abide in the divine light, which we enjoy in the fellowship of the divine life, we practice the truth—what we have realized in the divine light. When we abide in the source, its issue becomes our practice. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZBXnfJ6UP-Fda9whE9Gct_rEko2aXlpegKFSHc9jieeNRg-6ivGO1dX-Dj71CxbLl"> I believe that after a period of time, perhaps another ten years, the truth in the Lord’s recovery will be very prevailing. We do not care for numbers. But if several thousand saints can be trained with the truth, the prevailing truth will accomplish much for the Lord’s purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ABJfl-uaPAyBgWk9Nfoh4r7Zz7DUoBULqJ-COVeQYUnu0KigDNsnClbv9bdMJdfbR">GOD REVEALED THROUGH CREATION</h2><p data-content-id="Fjf9eLUxZuRzIgkrskf4ENZWB62-Zr3gu3epFJ226l_2GQqT0RXB5avmTF1oGxSDX"> Let us now consider certain verses in the Epistles where the word truth is used. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103417" data-verses="Romans 1:18">Romans 1:18</span> Paul says, “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness.” What is the truth in this verse? In order <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> to answer this question, we need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103418" data-verses="Romans 1:19">verses 19</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103419" data-verses="Romans 1:20">20</span>: “Because that which may be known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them. For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen, both His eternal power and divinity, for them to be without excuse.” According to these verses, the truth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103420" data-verses="Romans 1:18">verse 18</span> means all that God is and all the things concerning God and His existence and the knowledge of them. Therefore, with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103421" data-verses="Romans 1:18-20">Romans 1:18-20</span> as the basis, we may say that truth denotes the reality concerning God, the universe, and man. Because this truth has been manifested, man is without excuse. </p>
<p data-content-id="C5iZHjQEESBTbUVTrqRwpnl3teYxj2NAir21H0caRx3O1t-5AgiFhkPSjvArHBZnX"> Paul goes on to speak further concerning the truth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103422" data-verses="Romans 2:1">chapter two</span> of Romans: “But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103423" data-verses="Romans 2:2">v. 2</span>). What is the truth in this verse? Truth here means the actual situation and condition of man. No doubt, it also refers to the truth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103424" data-verses="Romans 1:18-20">Romans 1:18-20</span>, the truth concerning God’s reality being manifested. Those who hold down this truth will one day be judged by God according to it. </p>
<p data-content-id="PmZRbkNCA7IaF_Qs_g8BlUtM6qyVk0Dl_DWLNar7v36_bO8qvVFjenmaihcWtDNSp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103425" data-verses="Romans 1:18">Romans 1:18</span> truth refers to what God is. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103426" data-verses="Romans 1:19-20">Romans 1:19 and 20</span>, this truth, this reality, can be known through God’s creation. We need to hold to this truth. One day, God will judge according to this truth all those who hold it down. </p>
<p data-content-id="-MXP56kd770epxQOG8uB-5t9WllsMVyQEHhcY6kDg35U9ZDcHDykCX8Bp5fp-Ex7h"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103427" data-verses="Romans 2:20">Romans 2:20</span> Paul goes on to say, “An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.” The law here refers to the Mosaic law. In the Mosaic law there is a certain amount of the divine truth. All human beings should act according to this truth. Otherwise, God will judge them according to it. </p>
<p data-content-id="pd6Bbt3NPyVE9mcFi0N4Il_PTmqTDobGra2nOdxWav2F9cnrhpnmtJcsShBkzJmAh"> I use these verses from the book of Romans to illustrate the fact that in the New Testament the word truth signifies different things. The point concerning the truth we have considered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103428" data-verses="Romans 1:1-2">Romans 1 and 2</span> is very different from the meaning of truth in the Gospel of John. According to the Gospel of John, God is incarnated to be the truth, Christ is <span class="pg" data-page-id="95" id="95">[95]</span> the truth of the divine life, and the Spirit is the truth, the reality, of Christ. All these matters, of course, concern the Trinity. But the truth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103429" data-verses="Romans 1:1-2">Romans 1 and 2</span> does not concern the Trinity. Rather, the truth in these chapters is related to what God is, as revealed through creation. Whatever is revealed concerning God through creation is a truth, a reality, and we need to hold on to this truth. Furthermore, truth in these verses from Romans denotes the reality concerning God, the universe, man, man’s relationship with God and with others, and man’s obligation to God, as revealed through creation and through the Scripture. </p>

This is what the Gnostic heresy teaches. The apostle is inoculating the believers against this false teaching. This section, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103454" data-verses="1John 1:7">1:7—2:2</span>, deals with the believers’ sinning after regeneration, which interrupts their fellowship with God. If after regeneration the believers do not have sin in their nature, how could they sin in their conduct? Even though they sin only occasionally, not habitually, their sinning is an adequate proof that they still have sin working within them. Otherwise, there would be no interruption to their fellowship with God. The apostle’s teaching here also condemns today’s teaching of perfectionism, that a state of freedom from sin is attainable or has been attained in the earthly life, and it annuls today’s wrong teaching of the eradication of the sinful nature, which, by misinterpreting the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103455" data-verses="1John 3:9">3:9</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103456" data-verses="1John 5:18">5:18</span>, says that regenerated persons cannot sin because their sinful nature has been totally eradicated. </p>

If we confess our sins, He, according to His word and based upon the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us, because He must be faithful in His word and righteous in the blood of Jesus. Otherwise, He would be unfaithful and unrighteous. Our confession is needed for His forgiveness.

We still sin outwardly in our conduct because we still have sin inwardly in our nature. Both verses confirm our sinful condition after regeneration. In speaking of such a condition, the apostle uses the pronoun “we.” This indicates that he does not exclude himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="cYRJL3FyGiMJce37YiEtczjC_kpGv0fwB9b9ww7NXYMyyjzFozblW026JUBxBIAeZ"> The “word” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103479" data-verses="1John 1:10">verse 10</span> is the word of God’s revelation, which is the word of reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103480" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13">Eph. 1:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103481" data-verses="John 17:17">John 17:17</span>) and which conveys the contents of God’s New Testament economy. It is synonymous with truth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103482" data-verses="1John 1:8">verse 8</span>. In this word God exposes our true sinful condition both before and after regeneration. If we say that we have not sinned after regeneration, we make Him a liar and deny the word of His revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="YYSW9aJ5jeMhH9dbudB3sTU9B9sG5ZsU8TfqZNCeO65vJEtxGOnXREYNg7XyrhmAY"> We have pointed out that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103483" data-verses="1John 1:8">verse 8</span> refers to indwelling sin and that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103484" data-verses="1John 1:10">verse 10</span> refers to the act of sinning. Indwelling sin is the sin we inherited through our natural birth. This sin came into mankind through Adam, and now it dwells in our nature. Even after we have been saved and regenerated, sin remains in our fallen flesh. This is the reason our body needs to be redeemed at the time of the Lord’s coming back. When the Lord Jesus comes back, our <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> body will be redeemed, transfigured, by the Lord’s power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103485" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Phil. 3:21</span>). This means that the Lord’s power will change our body into a glorious body. Then indwelling sin will no longer be a part of us, for there will be no sin in our transfigured body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103486" data-verses="1John 1:8">verse 8</span> John says that if we say that, after we have been regenerated, we no longer have indwelling sin, we are deceived. </p>

The reason we make God a liar if we say that we have not sinned is that in His word of revelation, the Bible, He tells us clearly that we can still sin after we have been regenerated. But if we say that we have not sinned after we have been regenerated, we make God a liar. This means that the word of His revelation is not in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="DQtKlqfyuaSTzil_hM3_dwXME1Wu2azYYTXATQgw7W9SDVQS0sPurlamq5vSPMQxU"> These verses indicate clearly that after regeneration we still have indwelling sin, and it is still possible for us to sin. We need to admit these facts. First, we must admit that, even though we have been regenerated, we still have sin dwelling in our flesh. If we neglect this fact, we shall be deceived and misled. As a result, we may indulge in sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="SU2ZTjy5OGYluzV9gZc6I5umR2_KkeN-7xCAqf5pl981Y-SstP2uc3Ykx4Zp396M1"> In the past I heard of certain Christians who claimed that after they received the baptism in the Spirit and spoke in tongues, they no longer had sin within them. Yet in their experience they became involved in very sinful situations. They were deceived in thinking that because they had experienced the baptism of the Spirit they no longer had sin dwelling within them. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPZwIBWVLNzIUHN7kStCQ658g3Phtl4Kl8HEES34jsiFdri3coL8reMmqLT40dAx6"> Even if you experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit and speak in tongues, the sinful nature is still within you. We should never believe that this nature has been eradicated. The sinful nature will remain in our flesh until the Lord Jesus comes back and by His divine power transfigures our fallen body. </p>
<p data-content-id="esfeiNy8Uz9z4fV2253GbYiSiOccLrt10fnFjXQ4cXutCvU9X9mLb6ExfVEmS9hEo"> We all need to admit that we have a sinful nature. I can testify that, as one who has been a Christian for more than fifty years, I have the deep conviction, the deep inner sense, that my sinful nature still remains. No matter how <span class="pg" data-page-id="103" id="103">[103]</span> spiritual a believer may be, he still has indwelling sin in the flesh. We all need to realize this and admit it.

I would not say that this teaching is heretical; however, this teaching is surely mistaken. Some who teach perfectionism use the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103488" data-verses="Matthew 5:48">Matthew 5:48</span> about being perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect.

And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.” By using the expression “my little children” John was addressing all the believers regardless of age. The Greek word rendered “children” is <em>teknia,</em> plural of <em>teknion,</em> little child, diminutive of <em>teknon,</em> child, a word often used in addresses from elder to younger persons. “It is a term of parental affection.

The aged apostle considered all the recipients of his Epistle his dear little children in the Lord. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103513" data-verses="1John 2:13-27">verses 13-27</span> he classified them into three groups: young children, young men, and fathers.

These are the things mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103518" data-verses="1John 1:5-10">1:5-10</span> regarding the committing of sin by the children of God, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> regenerated believers, who have the divine life and participate in its fellowship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103519" data-verses="1John 1:1-4">1:1-4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="C5iZHjQEESBTbUVTrqRwpnl3veYxr2NAir21H0caRx3O1t-5AgiFhkPSjvArHBZnX"> John tells the recipients of this Epistle that he writes to them that they “may not sin.” These words and the words “if anyone sins” in the following sentence indicate that the regenerated believers may still sin. Though they possess the divine life, it is still possible for them to sin if they do not live by the divine life and abide in its fellowship. In Greek the word “sins” here is an aorist subjunctive and denotes a single act, not habitual action. </p>
<p data-content-id="PmZRbkNCA7IaF_Qs_g8BlUtM4qyZm0Dl_DWLNar7v36_bO8qvVFjenmaihcWtDNSp"> In the words “that you may not sin” we see John’s intention in what he writes concerning sin, the confessing of sins, and the receiving of God’s forgiveness and cleansing. John’s intention, his purpose, was that we would not sin. As he indicates in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103520" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span>, if we sin, our fellowship with the Father will be broken. If we would maintain this fellowship, we need to keep ourselves from sinning. This is the main purpose of what John writes in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103521" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> of this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="-MXP56kd770epxQOG8uB-5t9UllgOVyQEHhcY6kDg35U9ZDcHDykCX8Bp5fp-Ex7h"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103522" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> John shows us that we have received the divine life and that this life has brought us into the divine fellowship. In the divine fellowship we receive light, and now we should walk in the light as God is in the light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103523" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103524" data-verses="1John 1:7">7</span>). However, we need to realize that we still have the problem of indwelling sin, and regarding this sin we need to be on the alert. Even after our regeneration, the sin that came into the human race through Adam remains in our flesh. Although our spirit has been regenerated, God’s life has been imparted into our spirit, and God’s Spirit dwells in our spirit, nevertheless sin continues to dwell in our flesh. We need to admit the fact that we have dwelling in our flesh the sin that came into mankind through Adam. We also need to be on guard lest we commit sins. If we are not on the alert, we shall sin, and our sins will interrupt our fellowship with God. As a result of the breaking of our fellowship with Him, we shall lose the enjoyment of the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="pd6Bbt3NPyVE9mcFi0N4Il_PRmqfFobGra2nOdxWav2F9cnrhpnmtJcsShBkzJmAh"> We may say that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103525" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> we have a warning, a reminder, and a charge concerning our need to be on the alert. Yes, we have received the divine life, and the divine life <span class="pg" data-page-id="111" id="111">[111]</span> is now our enjoyment, issuing in the fellowship with the Triune God. This is wonderful! But we need to realize that there is still the problem of indwelling sin. Because sin dwells in our flesh, there is always the possibility that our enjoyment of the divine life may be interrupted through the committing of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="vF4IIQh977Z6yLZuPC15Dkolu3QeajgMHtejaN1SMO3KhZ94GKxBavDe-dZ1qnZvi"> If we do not realize that sin still dwells in our flesh but instead are deceived regarding this matter, we shall certainly sin. Then we shall lose the enjoyment of the divine life. Therefore, if we would remain in the enjoyment of the divine life and in the fellowship of the divine life, we need to realize that we have sin in our flesh and that sin is crouching, waiting for the opportunity to damage us, break our fellowship with the Triune God, and keep us from the enjoyment of the divine life received through regeneration. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBUhCROQnVG_-YKH2BunBB4RBqFcl7zK22B6maOtNpMDJBJVQOGaPDnWeE_-Dfp3f"> Now we can see John’s purpose in writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103526" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span>. Because he did not want the believers to lose the enjoyment of the divine life, he told them in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103527" data-verses="1John 2:1">2:1</span>, “I write to you that you may not sin.” This was John’s intention and also his expectation. Moreover, this word is also a warning and a reminder concerning the committing of sin. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2xUvRB6bOMVLj3gOpKGd3TJpnHOXoYKjJNLyxtwdkTsdeMpDSrbsygsl4I0z0J47y">AN ADVOCATE WITH THE FATHER</h2><p data-content-id="u1sqLDoEOByMLopgbu_aCqISbZwxFW5k74G9JvNqSDBMoewTPOGPF3BlexAbSZMFU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103528" data-verses="1John 2:1">2:1</span> John says, “If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.” John did not have the confidence that the believers would always be able to keep themselves from sinning. He knew that even though we may be alert concerning the sin that dwells in our flesh, we may still sin. Therefore, he tells us that if we sin, we have an Advocate with the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="fX0psknrQuL7J7uZCPBLmWthAYY6iQ0hHDzsYlbALepmSVHxblGdG69ounyizwRB2"> The Greek word rendered Advocate is <em>parakletos,</em> and it denotes one who is called to another’s side to aid him, hence, a helper; one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else, hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor. The word denotes consoling and consolation, hence, a consoler, a comforter. Paraclete is its anglicized form. This word is used in the Gospel of John (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103529" data-verses="John 14:16">14:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103530" data-verses="John 14:26">26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103531" data-verses="John 15:26">15:26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103532" data-verses="John 16:7">16:7</span>) for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, caring for <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> our cause or affairs. It is used here for the Lord Jesus as our Advocate with the Father, the One who cares for our case, intercedes on our behalf (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103533" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Rom. 8:34</span>), and pleads for us if we sin. This interceding and pleading is based upon His propitiation. </p>
<p data-content-id="IAEglTO5-PveUJvF1lWxKJmvuYo9j2nNfpgL8X4B-R4Wo2ONs8YiCa3cVul_enZ8w"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103534" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> John speaks concerning the redeeming blood of Christ that constantly cleanses us as we walk in the light. But in this verse John goes further to show us a Person, who is our Advocate with the Father. Hence, in the divine provision we have the blood of Christ and also the Person of Christ as our Advocate. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="HwMO3cvZ0bsnsA0tpNdFIfuvS59kzM4Pm-yVbCByoE_QqtH4WFIgrRpe3y2WqGcVm">The Comforter in the Heavens<br/>and the Comforter in Our Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="XkwcSjgfEhTzaME596SB0SUz_aKhLIUgzYa0NsdWxLYhUHNpANkftayVDpm4bNwhp"> As we have seen, “Advocate” is a translation of the Greek word <em>parakletos.</em> This word is formed of two words: the preposition <em>para</em> (used here as a prefix) and the word <em>kletos.</em> Put together, these words denote someone called to our side. The Greek word <em>parakletos</em> is used in the New Testament only by John. In his Gospel John says, “And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103535" data-verses="John 14:16">14:16</span>). This indicates that while the Lord was with the disciples, one <em>parakletos,</em> one Comforter, was there with them. But this <em>parakletos</em> was about to leave. Thus, there was the need for another <em>parakletos,</em> another Comforter, to come. Actually, the first <em>parakletos</em> and the other <em>parakletos</em> are one. The One who is called “another Comforter” is now in us as the life-giving Spirit, and the One who was the first Comforter, the Lord Jesus Christ, is now in the heavens at the right hand of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="kwpmPGODR_HqrtquI-1xXx5JFUWeN1h50QIifl8NGXNdS36pTzY-bvFX82iimNHp_"> We may use electricity as an illustration of these two Comforters. On the one hand, electricity is in the power plant. On the other hand, electricity has been installed into our homes. We may say, therefore, that with electricity there are two ends: one end in the power plant and the other end in our homes. As the electricity flows from the power plant, where it is stored, to our homes, where it is applied, these two ends are connected. We may compare the electricity in <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> the power plant to the Comforter, the Lord Jesus, in the heavens, and the electricity in our homes to the other Comforter, the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. In the heavens we have the Lord Jesus Christ as our Comforter, and in our spirit we have the Spirit as another Comforter. However, these two are one. For this reason, the Greek word <em>parakletos</em> is used for both the Comforter in the heavens and the Comforter in our spirit. </p>

His vicarious death satisfied God and appeased Him. Hence, He is the propitiation between God and us. As the propitiation concerning man’s sins, the Lord Jesus is for the sins of the whole world. However, this propitiation is conditional upon our receiving it by believing in the Lord. </p>

When I first read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103576" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> years ago, I was very happy. However, I did not understand why John added <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103577" data-verses="1John 2:1-2">2:1-2</span>. It seemed to me that the problem of sin had been fully solved <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103578" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span>, and I thought that these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103579" data-verses="1John 2:1">chapter two</span> were not necessary.

<p data-content-id="YYSW9aJ5jeMhH9dbudB3sTU9H9sGxZsU8TfqZNCeO65vJEtxGOnXREYNg7XyrhmAY"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103580" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> of this Epistle, we have received the divine life, and we are enjoying it in the fellowship of life. In this fellowship we receive the divine light, and in this light we practice the truth. But we still need the warning concerning the sin that dwells in our flesh. We need to be careful and on the alert regarding indwelling sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="EF7a3sguOhC86raGZx1V-FMtOQqDVL7SdtJQgMW9ou8oSN-oxN_jfavqUaejoueIH"> Whenever we sin, we need to confess our sin to God. If we confess our sins, God is faithful in His word to forgive us our sins, and He is righteous in His redemption to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. This is wonderful. Nevertheless, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103581" data-verses="1John 2:1-2">2:1-2</span> indicates, we still need a Person, an Advocate with the Father, to take care of our case.

Not only has God provided the blood of Jesus Christ, which was shed for us so that we may be forgiven and cleansed; God has also prepared Christ as our Advocate. First, the Lord Jesus shed His blood as the price of our redemption. Then after shedding His blood, He becomes our Advocate, our heavenly attorney, taking care of our case. How marvelous that our Advocate pays our debt and takes care of our case! </p>
<p data-content-id="SU2ZTjy5OGYluzV9gZc6I5umX2_GieN-7xCAqf5pl981Y-SstP2uc3Ykx4Zp396M1"> The fact that Christ is our Advocate with the Father, and not simply with God, indicates that our case which the Lord undertakes for us is a family affair, a case between us as the Father’s children and the Father. Actually, our Advocate is our elder Brother, the Son of the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPZwIBWVLNzIUHN7kStCQ658m3Ptrl4Kl8HEES34jsiFdri3coL8reMmqLT40dAx6"> The divine family is full of love, but it is also full of righteousness. Hence, there are regulations and also the Father’s discipline. We should never think that in the Father’s house we can be unruly. Our Father is orderly, and His house should be much more orderly than a human court of law. However, as children in the Father’s house, we are often naughty. We make mistakes, break the family <span class="pg" data-page-id="121" id="121">[121]</span> regulations, and offend the Father. For this reason, we need the Lord, our elder Brother, to be our Advocate with the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="esfeiNy8Uz9z4fV2253GbYiSkOcQJrt10fnFjXQ4cXutCvU9X9mLb6ExfVEmS9hEo"> As the One who shed His blood for us, the Lord Jesus is the righteous One. He is right not only with the Father, but also right with us. The Lord is our Paraclete (the anglicized form of <em>parakletos,</em> the Greek word rendered Advocate). He comes alongside to help us, He serves us, He takes care of us, and He provides whatever we need. We were in need of the cleansing blood; therefore, He provided us with His own blood for redemption and cleansing. We also need someone to take care of our case. Therefore, He is now our Advocate, our <em>parakletos.</em> </p>

As human beings, through birth we have our natural life, our human life, as our basic inheritance. Any particular thing we inherit depends on our human life. When a person dies and thereby loses his human life, that is the termination of everything. He no longer has an inheritance. In the same principle, the divine life we have received through regeneration is our basic inheritance in God’s salvation. Life, therefore, is crucial. The basic element of our spiritual inheritance is the divine life. </p>

The moving of the divine life within us issues in fellowship. Hence, fellowship <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> is the issue of the marvelous divine life we have received. In this fellowship we enjoy God, we enjoy the apostles, we enjoy the believers, and we enjoy the church and even the churches. All this enjoyment depends on the fellowship of the divine life, and this fellowship issues out of the divine life itself. </p>
<p data-content-id="Macv1r_Zlb7xB4WAvXY0AXO4CwPcq3SGhukFHUTAtli4bCL-SkoqeKAnfuib3gJ20"> Although we have received the divine life and enjoy God, the apostles, the believers, and the church life in the fellowship of the divine life, we still need to be watchful concerning sin. Sin is not merely something on the surface that can be washed away. On the contrary, sin dwells in our flesh. According to Paul’s word in the book of Romans, sin may deceive us, conquer us, and kill us. In particular, indwelling sin damages our fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="V9xS8M6rjjN-0lZsHbq91AHb6KAU36Y9a5uiZMINou19YlFe7mjWMSjjqQ7FY9LXk"> If our fellowship is damaged through sin, we lose the enjoyment of God. We also lose the enjoyment of the apostles, the enjoyment of the believers, and the enjoyment of the church life. In other words, once we lose the fellowship, we lose the enjoyment of our entire spiritual inheritance. As a result, in a practical way we become the same as unbelievers. Unbelievers do not have God, and they have nothing to do with the enjoyment of the apostles, the believers, and the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="i9c2fxnXKS3NxrFOde82Trn0Sb0HIMr0jSlnc5vC2fXDq9INndpC7JClfqMfIFHf2"> When we enjoy the fellowship of the divine life, we enjoy God, we enjoy the apostles, we enjoy the believers, and we enjoy the churches. What a wonderful enjoyment this is! But as soon as sin works within us and we commit sin, our fellowship is broken. Whenever our fellowship is broken, we lose the enjoyment of God, the apostles, the believers, and the church life. It is very important that we see this and have a proper realization concerning it. </p>

Whenever we are under the divine light in fellowship and sense that we are wrong in certain matters or with certain persons, we must immediately confess our sins to our righteous Father. Our Father is ready to forgive us. Just as a human father, who has been offended by the behavior of his child, is ready to forgive the repentant child, so our divine Father is ready to forgive us. Once we confess our sins, our Father will be the faithful and righteous God to us. He is waiting to forgive us our sins and to wash away the stains of our offenses. </p>

<p data-content-id="JK1tOOo6YAEZffeFYvDJ0DQK6ONbR85WqGku6EADZi_KVs6rkRSoTbBOm2k-7ZLI8"> Before we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103591" data-verses="1John 2:3-6">2:3-6</span>, I would like to say a further word concerning propitiation. John says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103592" data-verses="1John 2:2">2:2</span>, “He is a propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world.” According to its biblical meaning, propitiation leads to enjoyment, for it ushers in fellowship between God and us. According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103593" data-verses="Romans 3:25">Romans 3:25</span>, God has set forth Christ a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood. This indicates that Christ is not only the One who propitiates, but also that He is the place of propitiation. Christ as the propitiation place is the place where God and His redeemed people may converse, have fellowship, and enjoy one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="ztWqoed01v1IAPVjcjzQHIv4lpIzxAC9ZdsgqX-h9OsWPZeIXDKZl3JMjwTALCxAg"> In his first Epistle, John indicates that God’s provision not only includes the blood of Jesus and God’s righteousness and faithfulness, but also includes the Advocate who pleads our case with the Father and who Himself is our propitiation, our peacemaker. Christ Himself is actually the peace between God and us. This peace is the ground on which we and God may converse, have fellowship, and enjoy one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJigmhkHMCsaQv4-H_CrsJOAQ6C_EXMHKH2uXmTRIedacoVBVBjciQiomTqjw4x7m"> In the first section on the conditions of the divine fellowship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103594" data-verses="1John 1:5-10">1:5-10</span>), the problem that affects our fellowship is sin. If we sin, we need to confess. If we confess our sins, the blood of Jesus will cleanse us from our sins. Then in His faithfulness and righteousness, the Father will forgive us our sins <span class="pg" data-page-id="128" id="128">[128]</span> and cleanse us from unrighteousness. Furthermore, our Lord Jesus Christ will be the Advocate with the Father to handle our case. Eventually, this precious One will be our propitiation and thus the base, the ground, where we enjoy God and have fellowship with Him and He with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="b9TQLQbBeCKIIpeWWcGDe_AoVb49gs9FHrW7NBfExSSKvxh_3cu8CPv3MICdSv85q"> We may use an example from family life as an illustration of how Christ as our propitiation restores pleasant fellowship between us and the Father. Suppose the children in a family offend their father by disobeying him. As a result, their fellowship with the father is broken. However, the children repent and confess to the father, and he forgives them. Nevertheless, the situation is still not altogether pleasant. Then the mother may come in as the peacemaker, as the one who helps all the parties to be peaceful and happy. She may even prepare something for the family to eat so that they may have an enjoyable time together. This is an illustration of what Christ does as our propitiation. After we confess our sins and are cleansed by the blood and forgiven by the Father, the Lord handles our case with the Father and then becomes the very enjoyment that appeases the Father. This is Christ as our propitiation. </p>
<p data-content-id="u1sqLDoEOByMLopgbu_aCqISdZwxNW5k74G9JvNqSDBMoewTPOGPF3BlexAbSZMFU"> As we consider this matter, we shall realize that this is not merely a doctrine but is something very experiential. From experience we know that when we confess our sins, we have the sense that the blood has cleansed us and that the Father has forgiven us. Immediately, there is also a sense of enjoyment. That enjoyment is Christ as our propitiation. It is by this enjoyment, by Christ as our propitiation, that we may converse with God and He with us, and that together we may enjoy Christ and have fellowship around Christ. Therefore, Christ is the enjoyment that is the propitiation with God for us. Eventually, He becomes the very ground of our fellowship with the Father. It is in this way that our fellowship, which is broken through sin, may be recovered. Praise the Lord that by the five provisions—the blood, God’s faithfulness and righteousness, the Advocate, and the propitiation—we are restored to full fellowship with God! <span class="pg" data-page-id="129" id="129">[129]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="HwMO3cvZ0bsnsA0tpNdFIfuvU59oxM4Pm-yVbCByoE_QqtH4WFIgrRpe3y2WqGcVm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103598" data-verses="1John 2:3">verse 3</span> John says, “And in this we know that we have known Him, if we keep His commandments.” It is significant that this verse begins with the conjunction “and.” This conjunction used at the beginning of the sentence indicates that John is about to speak concerning another condition for maintaining our fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="XkwcSjgfEhTzaME596SB0SUz5aKtNIUgzYa0NsdWxLYhUHNpANkftayVDpm4bNwhp"> We have seen that the first condition of the divine fellowship is dealing with sin. If we do not deal with sin, sin will damage our fellowship. Therefore, in order to maintain our fellowship with the Father, we need to confess our sins. Not only is this true doctrinally, but it is also true according to our spiritual experience. From experience we know that in order to maintain our enjoyment of the divine life in fellowship, the first thing we must do is to deal with sin. Hence, dealing with sin is the first condition, the first requirement, of keeping ourselves in the fellowship of the divine life. Now that John is going on to consider the second condition, he begins <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103599" data-verses="1John 2:3">verse 3</span> with the conjunction “and.” This word points to another condition, another requirement, of maintaining the divine fellowship. </p>

If we say that we have known the Lord, yet we are not keeping His commandments, the truth (reality) is not in us, and we become a liar. </p>
<p data-content-id="yKKB9eDIFrgaTLK1MK46XTTPc3oYa9RUpYq8CgQ0-IcLwk2G0bP3UGZmH5RVKsBFj"> When I was young, I was bothered by the word “commandments” in these verses. I thought that this term always referred to the Ten Commandments of the Mosaic law, and I wondered why John here mentioned this law, telling us that we must keep the Ten Commandments. Actually, the commandments in this verse are commandments in the New Testament, not the commandments of the Mosaic law. These New Testament commandments are the commandments of the Lord Jesus given directly by Him, or the commandments given through the apostles. In the Gospel of John the Lord gave us the definite commandment to love one another: “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103602" data-verses="John 13:34">John 13:34</span>). This commandment to love one another was given by the Lord Jesus Himself. Hence, it is not a commandment of the Old Testament, but a commandment of the New Testament. Other New Testament commandments <span class="pg" data-page-id="131" id="131">[131]</span> were given by the Lord Jesus indirectly through His apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="84n3RYDKDx94xFCgfM9dlb2OtZ5Dxg4YURpxxsRaVR92YZ1bUpSXSRwFYRnjKzTph"> If we say that we know the Lord experientially in the New Testament way, then we should keep the New Testament commandments. But if we do not keep these commandments, this is a sign that actually we do not know Him, even though we say that we do. According to John’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103603" data-verses="1John 2:4">verse 4</span>, if we say that we have known Him, yet do not keep His commandments, we are a liar, and the truth is not in us. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xmPKprsOh6TbK1SQkcaQRS0GQdE-sfObuTtFPjUunAX7RJ4fk17RRsdIbNYAdu7wg">A SIGN INDICATING THAT WE ARE IN THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="rw-m1vPiM_MEq1TdjOdqC1uzE2CZ4e3Gzo90RaDvxZHKD3KSYrMuwWuc4j1U7D-ed"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103625" data-verses="1John 2:5">2:5</span> John says, “But whoever keeps His word, truly in this one the love of God has been perfected. In this we know that we are in Him.” The words “in this” in the last sentence refer to the matter of keeping the Lord’s word and having the love of God perfected in us. The phrase “in Him” refers to our being in the Lord Jesus Christ. This is a strong expression, for it emphasizes the fact that we are one with the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="d452zdxZZNHiBlSLKwhT0BBe2YxdclabvT60AIwXGQSbbnrz5Mn_Np7P8NqqS47tU"> If we read the context of these verses, we shall realize that it is an important matter to have a sign indicating that we are in the Lord. How can we prove that we are in the Triune God? What is the evidence that we are truly in Him? The first sign that we are in Him is that we know God experientially in our daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nbi_A5eQg6SlJktY-vN2BcSvioicNqksuYnlCEy9tjYn6kA_SaakUiNPjLTZQtyW6"> When John speaks of knowing God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103626" data-verses="1John 2:3">v. 3</span>), he speaks of knowing Him not doctrinally but experientially, by keeping His commandments. We should not merely know in a doctrinal way that God is almighty and that He created the <span class="pg" data-page-id="136" id="136">[136]</span> heavens and the earth. We need to know God experientially in a way that affects our daily living. Others may wonder why you do not participate in certain forms of worldly entertainment. The reason that you do not participate should be that you know God, that you know Him in His holy nature. Because God’s holy nature does not allow you to participate in that form of entertainment, you refrain from doing so. Likewise, if we know God in His nature, this will affect the way we do our shopping. Knowing God in this way will also cause us to be sincere in relation to others. Because we know the Lord in His nature of sincerity, we would not be political. Therefore, the reason we behave ourselves and have our being in a particular way should not be merely that we follow the outward teachings of the Bible, but even the more that we know God’s nature and character and live according to what God is. </p>
<p data-content-id="tDWlQSHUBHZ5qBD93IBcPfrCcaUqW26HA_scGJKr-ItE3c3VnQo-6LLTQLhXhN2yD"> Sometimes others may try to convince you that there is no need for you to be so strict in your living. They may tell you, for example, that there is nothing wrong with spending some time engaging in a certain kind of amusement. You may wish to answer them by saying, “I do not view this as a matter of right or wrong. My testimony is that I know my God. I have a living God dwelling within me, and I am in Him and one with Him organically. This means that His nature becomes mine and what He is becomes my constituent. As a result, I know Him subjectively and experientially. This is the reason I cannot conduct myself in the same way others do. Unbelievers do not have Him, and, of course, they do not know Him or experience Him. Do you know why I behave in the way I do? It is because I have Him, know Him, and enjoy Him. The Lord is not only my life—He is everything to me. I do not live according to certain regulations or requirements. This is a matter of the divine life within me. The Lord dwells in me, and I know Him experientially.” </p>

It is not to be one with Him merely in a doctrinal <span class="pg" data-page-id="137" id="137">[137]</span> way. When we are organically one with the Lord, He is our life and even becomes our nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="Macv1r_Zlb7xB4WAvXY0AXO4AwPQs3SGhukFHUTAtli4bCL-SkoqeKAnfuib3gJ20"> Every kind of life has its particular nature. With the nature of the divine life there is a certain taste. Because we have the Lord as our life and because we enjoy His nature, we also have the taste that comes with the divine nature. However, anyone who does not have the divine nature cannot have the divine taste. But because we have the taste of the divine nature, we simply cannot do certain things. </p>
<p data-content-id="V9xS8M6rjjN-0lZsHbq91AHb4KAYx6Y9a5uiZMINou19YlFe7mjWMSjjqQ7FY9LXk"> As an illustration of what we mean by the taste of the divine nature, we may consider what happens when something with a bitter taste is placed in the mouth of a baby. There is no need to teach the young one not to eat something bitter. As soon as a bitter-tasting substance is placed in a baby’s mouth, he will spit it out. The child does not behave according to regulations learned from his mother. There is no need for a mother to teach her baby not to eat things that are bitter. In the life of her child there is a nature that rejects things that taste bitter. In a similar way, there is in the divine nature a particular taste that causes us to reject those things that are contrary to the nature of the One who lives within us. </p>

It is in this way that the Jews know God. They know God objectively, apart from any subjective experience of Him. This means that they do not have any inner experience of the subjective God. But as those who have been born of God and who possess God’s life, we know Him not merely objectively, but in particular we know Him subjectively and experientially. </p>
<p data-content-id="9TeA3RIQ_QniyeGixI-6-Nn0MWVlqOjoCl3RZox4PoN4pPv5KJU_UKGO2cQv0NkoL"> Because we know our God in this way, we cannot speak certain things, do certain things, or go certain places. Others may even defame us and falsely accuse us. However, because we know God subjectively, often we shall not have any desire to vindicate ourselves or argue in our own defense. No matter what others may say, we know that we have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="138" id="138">[138]</span> divine life. We have God within us as our life and nature. Eventually this indwelling One will be expressed in our character and conduct. It is in this way that we know God experientially, and this knowing is a strong sign that we are in Him and one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="j0SOOFIflP3ERSaDjOND_xFPRkcPGq8j2iJ-DvwwdoXXEhkU0nic63EalVdhoz9en"> In our behavior and way of speaking, we should bear a sign that we are in God. We should not talk with others the same way that unbelievers do. If your husband or wife, your children, your neighbors, and your classmates or co-workers cannot see a sign that you behave yourself according to the experience of God, then there is a question whether you are truly in God or not. We thank the Lord that those in the Lord’s recovery do have the testimony in their daily life that they are in God. We bear a sign that we are in God, even though at some times we are weak and fail Him. We thank the Lord that we have some evidence, some sign, in our daily walk that we are in God. This sign is an indication that we know the Lord experientially. Because we know Him experientially, spontaneously we keep His commandments. </p>

John was not writing a new commandment to the believers; he was writing an old commandment, which they had from the beginning, that is, from the time the Lord Jesus was on earth and gave them the commandment to love one another. That old commandment is the word which they heard. <span class="pg" data-page-id="144" id="144">[144]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="aJigmhkHMCsaQv4-H_CrsJOAS6CaOXMHKH2uXmTRIedacoVBVBjciQiomTqjw4x7m"> The commandment of the Lord is His word.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103651" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span> the Lord Jesus said, “The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.” Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103652" data-verses="1John 2:7">2:7</span> “the word” indicates the life supply. Whatever the Lord speaks is a word supplying us with life and spirit. What the Lord says may also be an injunction demanding that we do a certain thing. Nevertheless, as long as that injunction is something uttered by the Lord, something that proceeds out of His mouth, it is a word that supplies us with life. Therefore, whenever we take the Lord’s word and keep it, we receive the life supply. </p>

<p data-content-id="yKKB9eDIFrgaTLK1MK46XTTPe3oUY9RUpYq8CgQ0-IcLwk2G0bP3UGZmH5RVKsBFj"> The relative pronoun “which” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103654" data-verses="1John 2:8">verse 8</span> is in neuter gender. It does not refer to “commandment,” which is in feminine gender. It should refer to the fact that the old commandment of brotherly love is new in the believers’ Christian walk. This is true in the Lord, since He not only gave it to His believers, but also renews it in their daily walk all the time. This is true also in the believers, since they have not only received it once for all, but also are enlightened and refreshed by it repeatedly. </p>
<p data-content-id="84n3RYDKDx94xFCgfM9dlb2OvZ5P3g4YURpxxsRaVR92YZ1bUpSXSRwFYRnjKzTph"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103655" data-verses="1John 2:8">verse 8</span> John tells us that the darkness is passing away and that the true light already shines. The passing away of the darkness is its vanishing in the shining of the true light. The true light is the light of the Lord’s commandment. Because this light shines, the commandment of brotherly <span class="pg" data-page-id="145" id="145">[145]</span> love dawns in the darkness and makes the old commandment new and fresh throughout the entire Christian life. </p>
<p data-content-id="0VQVWgS1ukzdV03AKaCp4HuoXlAi_kHBNfhQyBRelJH5iijKgOT9M3ceK9_iYN0up"> Many who read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103656" data-verses="1John 2:7-8">verses 7 and 8</span> are bothered by what John says concerning an old commandment and a new commandment. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103657" data-verses="1John 2:7">verse 7</span> he says that he is not writing a new commandment but an old commandment. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103658" data-verses="1John 2:8">verse 8</span> he says that he is writing a new commandment. How can an old commandment be a new commandment? Is the new commandment a commandment other than the old commandment, or is it the old commandment becoming new? If we read these verses carefully in context, we shall see that actually the old commandment and the new commandment are one. The reason for this is that the commandment is the word of the Lord, and the word of the Lord dawns as a new day dawns when the sun rises in the morning. When the sun rises, the shining of the sun swallows up the darkness. The darkness of night always vanishes with the shining of the morning sun. Here John indicates that the Lord’s commandment, as His living word, shines as the dawning sun, and this shining swallows up darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="7VBIDypFbsrB3seo-P0TEAu3Bdeqby7iaa4y5jfzjzXbzw_FYoAOknClttOS5sAlQ"> After any kind of human commandment has been given, it gradually becomes old. Human commandments are not living. Because these commandments are not living, they never dawn and they never shine. But the commandment given by the Lord is His living word. Because His commandment is His living word, this word shines. When this living word dawns in the darkness, it dawns with heavenly light. The shining of heavenly light makes old things new. In particular, it makes the old commandment new, fresh, and full of light. </p>
<p data-content-id="_7zRmizQLI750LSdci3WMRJ3j0jfucvDE5ihipp8Dk5Zb1N-aTLrAC0-BZmbbCZWn"> Perhaps you are familiar with the principle that the shining of light indicates newness. Suppose you shut off the light in a room for a period of time. When you turn on the light again, you will spontaneously have the sense of newness. The shining of light brings us this sense of newness. Every time light shines it brings in a new situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="B2_T8YLhauK6u6VpNIfepJFFgrLaO8nmEKoh3_bnjebpEuWtQKKBduV2zG6x7fpJd"> Because human words are dead, they cannot shine and therefore cannot give us a new beginning. But the Lord’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> commandment, as His living word, always gives us a new beginning because His word shines anew and afresh again and again. </p>
<p data-content-id="xmPKprsOh6TbK1SQkcaQRS0GRdEnvfObuTtFPjUunAX7RJ4fk17RRsdIbNYAdu7wg"> Many of us can testify that we have experienced the shining of the Lord’s word in this way. For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103659" data-verses="John 13:34">John 13:34</span> the Lord Jesus commands us to love one another. We can testify that many times this commandment has become new and fresh in our Christian life. Throughout the years we have been Christians, often this old injunction has become a fresh word to us. Whenever we contact the Lord and His old commandment dawns in our darkness, light shines. With this light there is newness. This is how the old commandment can be a new commandment. The old commandment becomes new because it is a word that is living and shining. This shining makes the old commandment new and fresh. </p>
<p data-content-id="rw-m1vPiM_MEq1TdjOdqC1uzF2Cwye3Gzo90RaDvxZHKD3KSYrMuwWuc4j1U7D-ed"> Now we can understand why the apostle John says, “I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment....Again, I am writing a new commandment to you.” In these verses John seems to be saying, “I believe that what I am writing to you is shining upon you and swallowing the darkness. The darkness is now vanishing, passing away, in the shining of this new light.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d452zdxZZNHiBlSLKwhT0BBe3YxwXlabvT60AIwXGQSbbnrz5Mn_Np7P8NqqS47tU">TRUE IN HIM AND IN US</h2><p data-content-id="QXYDaOWJRqFN-OMexzzkkKKUqM2-k63I9JQNIAZfmtTqzxZboroT0AfiWGha8DsoE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103660" data-verses="1John 2:8">verse 8</span> John says that the fact of the old commandment of brotherly love being new in the believers’ Christian walk is true both in the Lord and in us. This is true in the Lord because He gave the commandment and because He renews and refreshes this commandment. This is true also in us because we not only have received the old commandment, but also have a new and fresh enlightening of this commandment. Under this enlightenment, we have the consciousness that this word is new and refreshing to us. This word even makes us new. Therefore, this is true in us because the darkness is vanishing and the true light is already shining. <span class="pg" data-page-id="147" id="147">[147]</span> </p>

The divine love is related to the divine light. The divine love is versus the satanic hatred, which is related to the satanic darkness. Hating a brother in the Lord is a sign of being in darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103662" data-verses="1John 2:11">v. 11</span>). Likewise, loving a brother is a sign of abiding in the light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103663" data-verses="1John 2:10">v. 10</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="Nbi_A5eQg6SlJktY-vN2BcSvsoiBHqksuYnlCEy9tjYn6kA_SaakUiNPjLTZQtyW6"> In these messages on the conditions of the divine fellowship, we have seen that there are two conditions or requirements for maintaining this fellowship. The first requirement, described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103675" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5—2:2</span>, is the confessing of sins. The second requirement, described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103676" data-verses="1John 2:3-11">2:3-11</span>, is the loving of God and the brothers. Therefore, if we want to maintain our fellowship with God, we need to deal with sin, and we need to love God and love the brothers. </p>
<p data-content-id="tDWlQSHUBHZ5qBD93IBcPfrCSaUzd26HA_scGJKr-ItE3c3VnQo-6LLTQLhXhN2yD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103677" data-verses="1John 2:9">verses 9</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103678" data-verses="1John 2:11">11</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103679" data-verses="1John 2:1">chapter two</span> John says that the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103680" data-verses="1John 2:10">verse 10</span> he says, “He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him.” In these verses John emphasizes loving the brothers. My burden in this message is to consider why John indicates that the last requirement for maintaining the divine fellowship is that of loving the brothers. </p>

What is the goal of the divine fellowship? In this fellowship we enjoy the riches of the divine life, but for what purpose do we enjoy these riches in this fellowship? The enjoyment of the riches of the divine life in the divine <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> fellowship is for the church life. It is of crucial importance for us to see that the goal of the divine fellowship is the church life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9TeA3RIQ_QniyeGixI-6-Nn0CWVliOjoCl3RZox4PoN4pPv5KJU_UKGO2cQv0NkoL">The Fellowship of the Apostles</h2><p data-content-id="j0SOOFIflP3ERSaDjOND_xFPfkcPOq8j2iJ-DvwwdoXXEhkU0nic63EalVdhoz9en"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103681" data-verses="1John 1:3">1:3</span> John says, “That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.” In this verse the pronouns “we” and “us” refer to the apostles. The apostles have seen and heard the eternal life. They report this to the believers so that the believers may have fellowship with the apostles. Because the fellowship described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103682" data-verses="1John 1:3">1:3</span> was first the portion of the apostles in enjoying the Father and the Son through the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103683" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>), it is called the fellowship of the apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103684" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>) and “the fellowship which is ours” (the apostles’). The apostles are the representatives of the church. Hence, whenever the New Testament speaks of the apostles, the church is implied, for the apostles represent the church. This principle will still be in effect in the New Jerusalem. Concerning the New Jerusalem, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103685" data-verses="Revelation 21:14">Revelation 21:14</span> says, “And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” The apostles represent all the saints in the church. Because the apostles represent the church and because the fellowship of the divine life is called the fellowship of the apostles, we may say that this fellowship is for the church life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="TXTkCeA2a63VJU5EK-sNUTPGAfHTKHZANajwIXiKfd8zJfayv7SIlKB5DUtukuoDo">The Fellowship of the Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="nsBxI8oZiy5oRVOys1ZGV_Qa2LIXnPjEcJQwLCC2pi2_onfHHXIyajlsrPJXAapXZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103686" data-verses="1John 1:3">1:3</span> John says that the fellowship which the apostles have is the fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. Therefore, this fellowship involves the apostles and also the Father and the Son. Only the Father and the Son are mentioned here, not the Spirit, because the Spirit is implied in the fellowship. However, elsewhere we are clearly told that this fellowship is “the fellowship of the Holy Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103687" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>). The divine fellowship is a fellowship of <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> the apostles, the representatives of the church, and also a fellowship between these apostles as the representatives of the church and the Father and the Son. The fact that the divine fellowship is also a fellowship of the Spirit means that this fellowship is carried out by the Spirit. This fellowship is not merely <em>with</em> the Spirit; it is also <em>of</em> the Spirit. This means that it is the Spirit’s fellowship and that this fellowship is carried out by the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="68x0xdAqK8SHqJRHmz2-kZHEqfMT_vlkO-YxoHqGFpmEKjiEWhgTHDREG81eA1e6R"> We have just pointed out what it means to say that the divine fellowship is the fellowship of the Spirit. Actually, the Spirit Himself is the fellowship. This means that the fellowship is not only carried out by the Spirit, but also that the Spirit is the fellowship that is carried out. </p>
<p data-content-id="RJ4qWwScdHvnvOxhcbMPymuqa6bwpuHPIt6kuHLqwlGiCqeFgq_umGin8gWNM8gvM"> Once again we may use electricity as an illustration of the divine fellowship. Electricity flows from the power plant into the church meeting hall. As a result, when the switch is on, all the lights in the ceiling have “fellowship” in the current, the flow, of electricity. It is the current of electricity that carries out this fellowship. However, it is more accurate to say that actually the current itself is the fellowship. If there were no electrical current, there would not be any fellowship. The current of electricity is the fellowship of electricity, and this fellowship includes the power plant, the meeting hall, and the lights. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjvsbLXC95jIofUewvvl31x7pdu2vXeOu5KohfFvOD1aP_kOrsv_S-UDyFM05oP1A"> Today the divine fellowship is the apostles’ fellowship. This means that it is the fellowship of the church. This fellowship is also the fellowship of the believers with the apostles. Furthermore, it is the fellowship of the apostles and the believers with the Father and the Son. Because this fellowship is carried out by the Spirit, it is called the fellowship of the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wdPoXce5OP5p8XuT7-mS2kx2EUmrGX_iTvR-wsSKM3NrgmMOCGW2l-v1Di4D08766">Fellowship for the Church Life</h2><p data-content-id="LG2u71jWVm95oHNrICgNLIgIAPfDyiCmgycxjYJfhWmHs_agx5hPYMKXxHT0-0XcN"> We all need to realize that this divine fellowship is altogether for the church life.

Ultimately, this fellowship is for the church life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> </p>

For the maintaining of the fellowship, to confess our sins is not adequate. In order to maintain the divine fellowship, we need to love the brothers. The reason for this is that the church life is a corporate life, a life that involves the brothers. If we lose our brotherly love and if we no longer love one another, what will become of the church life? The answer is that the church life will disappear. Where there is no brotherly love, the church life is finished. Actually, brotherly love is the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="ABJfl-uaPAyBgWk9Nfoh4r7Z67DYuBULqJ-COVeQYUnu0KigDNsnClbv9bdMJdfbR"> In the past we have viewed the church life from different angles and have presented various definitions of the church life from these different angles. Now we need a definition of the church life that is in line with the angle of brotherly love. We all need to learn a new term to describe the church life—a life of brotherly love. Do you know what the church life is? The church life is a life of brotherly love. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fjf9eLUxZuRzIgkrskf4ENZWI62yTr3gu3epFJ226l_2GQqT0RXB5avmTF1oGxSDX"> I can testify that in the church life in the Lord’s recovery we surely experience brotherly love. In particular, I can testify that we enjoy brotherly love during the semiannual trainings. During the days of the training, brotherly love is especially evident and prevailing, and saints from many different countries enjoy this brotherly love together. It seems that the more international we are, the more brotherly love we experience and enjoy. </p>
<p data-content-id="C5iZHjQEESBTbUVTrqRwpnl3keY9p2NAir21H0caRx3O1t-5AgiFhkPSjvArHBZnX"> Recently we had a conference in Stuttgart, Germany. At that time we all were in an international atmosphere. The saints who attended that conference spoke different languages, and the hymns were sung in all the languages. Whenever I heard a hymn sung in these different languages, I was beside myself with joy in the Lord. The brotherly love was so prevailing that it seemed that in a sense, there was no need for translation. The atmosphere of brotherly love was marvelous. This brotherly love is the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="PmZRbkNCA7IaF_Qs_g8BlUtMzqyVg0Dl_DWLNar7v36_bO8qvVFjenmaihcWtDNSp"> The church life involves saints of different races, countries, languages, and nationalities. All colors are represented in <span class="pg" data-page-id="155" id="155">[155]</span> the church life: black, white, yellow, brown, and red. We praise the Lord that together we enjoy true brotherly love! </p>
<p data-content-id="-MXP56kd770epxQOG8uB-5t9fllsIVyQEHhcY6kDg35U9ZDcHDykCX8Bp5fp-Ex7h"> I wish to emphasize the fact that the divine fellowship is for the church life. This fellowship must be maintained by brotherly love. On the one hand, brotherly love is the result, the issue, of the divine fellowship; on the other hand, brotherly love is a condition, a term, of the divine fellowship. Therefore, brotherly love is both a condition for this fellowship and its result. </p>

<p data-content-id="TXTkCeA2a63VJU5EK-sNUTPGBfHOCHZANajwIXiKfd8zJfayv7SIlKB5DUtukuoDo"> The Epistle of 1 John is composed of three main sections: the fellowship of the divine life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103696" data-verses="1John 1:1">1:1—2:11</span>), the teaching of the divine anointing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103697" data-verses="1John 2:12-27">2:12-27</span>), and the virtues of the divine birth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103698" data-verses="1John 2:28">2:28—5:21</span>). In the foregoing messages we have covered the first section of this Epistle and the first basic matter revealed in this book—the fellowship of the divine life. In this message we come to the second section and to the second basic matter—the teaching of the divine anointing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nsBxI8oZiy5oRVOys1ZGV_Qa3LIOuPjEcJQwLCC2pi2_onfHHXIyajlsrPJXAapXZ">THE DEFINITION OF THE ANOINTING</h2><p data-content-id="68x0xdAqK8SHqJRHmz2-kZHErfM2xvlkO-YxoHqGFpmEKjiEWhgTHDREG81eA1e6R"> The fellowship of the divine life is divine and mysterious. However, the divine anointing is even more mysterious. It is very difficult to give an adequate definition of the divine anointing. The anointing is the function of the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, who is the processed Triune God. In this definition we can see the different elements, or ingredients, of the anointing. The anointing is the function, the moving, of the compound ointment. </p>
<p data-content-id="RJ4qWwScdHvnvOxhcbMPymuqb6bRmuHPIt6kuHLqwlGiCqeFgq_umGin8gWNM8gvM"> The first mention of the anointing in the Bible is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103699" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. In that chapter we have a revelation of the compound ointment that was used to anoint the tabernacle and the priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="B2_T8YLhauK6u6VpNIfepJFFurLaG8nmEKoh3_bnjebpEuWtQKKBduV2zG6x7fpJd"> In principle, John’s writings are based on what is written in the Old Testament. For example, in his Gospel John uses the word “tabernacled” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103700" data-verses="John 1:14">1:14</span> and the phrase “Lamb of God” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103701" data-verses="John 1:29">1:29</span>. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103702" data-verses="John 1:51">John 1:51</span> refers to Jacob’s dream about the heavenly ladder at Bethel. Moreover, many of the signs <span class="pg" data-page-id="160" id="160">[160]</span> in the book of Revelation can be found in the Old Testament. In the same principle, John’s first Epistle is based on the Old Testament. In keeping with this principle, the word “anointing” used by John in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103703" data-verses="1John 2:1">chapter two</span> refers to the ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103704" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. In the Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157-163, we considered the basic elements of the compound ointment and the measure of these elements. The ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103705" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> is a full type of the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, who is the processed Triune God. The anointing is actually the function, the moving, of such a Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="xmPKprsOh6TbK1SQkcaQRS0GfdEnnfObuTtFPjUunAX7RJ4fk17RRsdIbNYAdu7wg"> The anointing is very mysterious, but it is also real and experiential. Instead of using the noun “ointment,” John uses the verbal noun “anointing.” This word refers to the moving of the all-inclusive Spirit within us. If we carefully read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103706" data-verses="1John 2:12-27">2:12-27</span>, we shall realize that the anointing is actually the personification of the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, who is the processed Triune God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rw-m1vPiM_MEq1TdjOdqC1uzL2C8we3Gzo90RaDvxZHKD3KSYrMuwWuc4j1U7D-ed">THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2><p data-content-id="d452zdxZZNHiBlSLKwhT0BBe5Yx8VlabvT60AIwXGQSbbnrz5Mn_Np7P8NqqS47tU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103707" data-verses="1John 2:12-27">First John 2:12-27</span> is a section concerning the Divine Trinity according to the believers’ growth in life. In these verses the Trinity is covered in a very positive and meaningful way. But if we do not have a spiritual and heavenly view of these verses, we shall not see that the Trinity is covered here. The teaching of the divine anointing concerns the Divine Trinity, but this teaching is according to our growth in life. This means that the more we grow in life, the more we shall be concerned with the Trinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="QXYDaOWJRqFN-OMexzzkkKKUkM2yi63I9JQNIAZfmtTqzxZboroT0AfiWGha8DsoE"> The entire New Testament is structured with the Trinity. In Ephesians, for example, every chapter is structured with the Trinity. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103708" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">Second Corinthians 13:14</span> says, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” This verse at the very end of 2 Corinthians indicates that the whole book of 2 Corinthians is concerned with the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. We also see the Trinity in the book of Revelation: “Grace to you and peace from Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="161" id="161">[161]</span> Who is, and Who was, and Who is coming, and from the seven Spirits Who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103709" data-verses="Revelation 1:4-5">1:4b-5a</span>). Here we see that the mysterious book of Revelation opens with the Trinity, for in this book also the Trinity is the basic structure. </p>
<p data-content-id="KAnj8tJPZRQJM4YpnOV1M0J35G9pLHqIkHqU1wFtdkcPaABiJe8EzKj3ASCfLj5sp"> I wish to emphasize the fact that the Divine Trinity is the basic structure of the entire revelation in the Bible. If the Divine Trinity were removed from the Scriptures, there would not be any reality of the divine revelation in the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="la3oDDXAaVb3iB8-kG6CtRv4M9K7D1AISkoO1SuI43Xjp5yw-h0UIgr1QgYrdyXkT"> In 1 John only sixteen verses are devoted to the mysterious, all-inclusive, compound anointing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103710" data-verses="1John 2:12-27">2:12-27</span>). If we study these verses carefully and get into the depths of them, we shall see that the Divine Trinity is here, and that the Trinity is covered according to the growth in life of the believers. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Oq5yNluxOcFZ42LxIZQlgbnvwFHaLzmZVFp5SEX7nUut1FCw3vLXkTJ1zg_T79f2J">A POLEMICAL SECTION</h2><p data-content-id="40zTT6CnkXFE1ethYd3Z1sUJ7Yngh0t02z2WS_Ixj97w5y9s3Im7mWIGyNgcYDBuM"> These sixteen verses are also very polemical. These verses are the most polemical section of this Epistle. We have already mentioned that John’s writings are polemical, for he was fighting against heresies, including Gnosticism, Cerinthianism, and Docetism. These heresies were related to the Person of Christ, and they caused damage and confusion to the church life. Therefore, it was necessary for the apostle John to be polemical and to fight against these heresies, inoculating the saints against the poison of the heresies concerning the Person of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="obx1QC4qWRaRyglw7DiaTeVTGZb9Usvzx7mNj8ptpL1L6KbH0JCWnp6xslWl3O42-"> In these sixteen verses John gives a word regarding the deep truth of the Trinity. But John’s way of writing is based on the growth in life of the believers. For this reason, John classified the believers into three groups: children, young men, and fathers. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3cAlbijZNhlV_hAvtYdsNrAmAbkEm7grYqDWh68tmkbEmI6H_32LcZWCR0bDu1IHg">LITTLE CHILDREN</h2><p data-content-id="G_9-Q9Kx7jTyJPf5bMBmFMZAL1QxSxOsS6IZxG_iG9FH354LXn99uUrfdzvYAgX5S"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103711" data-verses="1John 2:12">verse 12</span> John refers to the recipients of this Epistle as “little children.” This is a general address and does not refer to any specific class of believers. As we have already <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> mentioned, according to verse 1 of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103712" data-verses="1John 2:1">chapter two</span>, the aged apostle considered all the recipients of his Epistle his dear little children in the Lord. We shall see that later in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103713" data-verses="1John 2:13-27">verses 13 through 27</span> John writes to the young children, young men, and fathers. But here he addresses all the believers as little children, no matter what their spiritual age may be. On the one hand, all the believers are God’s children. On the other hand, in the church life God’s children were also John’s children. </p>
<p data-content-id="cYRJL3FyGiMJce37YiEtczjC0kpKl0fwB9b9ww7NXYMyyjzFozblW026JUBxBIAeZ"> John considered the believers his children, not his students or his followers. To be a student is a matter of knowledge, and to be a follower is a matter of participating in a certain activity. But the word “children” indicates life. In this Epistle John refers to the believers in a way that indicates life. John did not even say “my dear children.” Instead, he used the more intimate expression “little children.” </p>
<p data-content-id="YYSW9aJ5jeMhH9dbudB3sTU9K9sKzZsU8TfqZNCeO65vJEtxGOnXREYNg7XyrhmAY"> Sometimes an elderly parent will refer to his mature son as his child. For example, a man may be in his eighties and his son, in his sixties. Nevertheless, the father may still refer to his son as his child. This is a sign of a tender, intimate relationship. In this Epistle, John, an elderly father, addresses all the believers as little children. Writing in an intimate manner, he says, “I write to you, little children....” This term of address also indicates that in writing these verses John is concerned with the believers’ growth in life. </p>

They have believed in this precious name and have received the forgiveness of sins. The forgiveness of sins <span class="pg" data-page-id="163" id="163">[163]</span> is the first basic element in the gospel. If we believe in the name of the Lord and call on His name, the first blessing we receive is the forgiveness of sins. Through forgiveness, we have been justified and have become the children of God. Regeneration, therefore, is based on the forgiveness of sins. This is the reason the apostle John regards forgiveness of sins as the basic factor in addressing the recipients of this Epistle as little children. </p>

In the second section of this Epistle we see two other negative things: the world and antichrist. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103747" data-verses="1John 2:13-14">verses 13 and 14</span> John also mentions the evil one. However, this evil one, Satan, the Devil, does not appear directly here. Instead, he wears the masks of the world and of antichrist. No one would love the Devil if he were to appear directly. But everyone loves the world. The world is Satan’s mask that he uses to deceive us and cheat us. In this section of 1 John, the problem is not with the Devil; it is with the world as the Devil’s mask. </p>

The young men need to confront the mask of the world. For this reason, the word concerning the world is written to the young men. What is the main problem faced by the young children, the youngest ones in the church life? This problem is the problem of heresy, the mask of antichrist. The antichrists do not consider themselves antichrists, but claim that they are for Christ. This claim, however, is a pretense, a falsehood, a deceit. Therefore, John points out that such ones are antichrist; they are not for Christ. Although they bear the name of Christ, this is a pretense. Whereas the young men in the divine life should overcome the world, the young children need to beware of antichrist. These two negative things—the world and antichrist—are found in the second section of this Epistle. </p>

God created man to live on the earth for the fulfillment of His purpose. But His enemy Satan, in order to usurp the God-created man, has formed an anti-God world system on this earth by systematizing men with religion, culture, <span class="pg" data-page-id="171" id="171">[171]</span> education, industry, commerce, and entertainment through men’s fallen nature in their lusts, pleasures, pursuits, and even in their indulgence in living necessities, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The whole of such a satanic system lies in the evil one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103761" data-verses="1John 5:19">1 John 5:19</span>). Not loving such a world is the ground for overcoming the evil one. Loving it just a little gives the evil one the ground to defeat us and occupy us. </p>

<p data-content-id="Fjf9eLUxZuRzIgkrskf4ENZaA62-Vr3gu3epFJ226l_2GQqT0RXB5avmTF1oGxSDX"> It is important for us to understand the different meanings of the word <em>kosmos</em> in the New Testament. We have pointed out that this word is used to denote the material universe, the fallen human race corrupted and usurped by Satan, and the anti-God world system set up by Satan in order to usurp the man created by God for the fulfillment of His purpose. It is the last mentioned denotation of <em>kosmos</em> that applies to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103763" data-verses="1John 2:15">2:15</span>. In this verse the world refers to the anti-God world system formed by Satan. Every thing, every one, and every matter have been systematized by the evil one, the adversary of God, and made a part of his world system. </p>
<p data-content-id="C5iZHjQEESBTbUVTrqRwpnl7seYxv2NAir21H0caRx3O1t-5AgiFhkPSjvArHBZnX"> In such a situation, where shall we go? The answer is that we need to go to the Triune God. Only the Triune God has not been systematized by Satan. Along with going to the Triune God, we also need to go to the Word of God. Therefore, since every thing, every one, and every matter have been systematized by Satan, we need to flee to the Triune God and His Word. God’s Word is our refuge, our protection. </p>

Not only has this evil one systematized everything, but the entire system lies in him. We may use a patient in surgery as an illustration of the world lying in the evil one. In surgery, a patient is anesthetized and lies on the operating table. The surgeon is then able to operate on the patient, and the patient has no consciousness of what is happening. This is a picture of the whole world lying under the hand of Satan. Those in the world are unconscious of the fact that they are lying on the “surgery table” of the evil one and that he is “operating” on them. </p>

Because the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil has entered into the human race, our body became fallen and corrupted. Adam and Eve, our first parents, partook of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As a result, an evil element came into the human race, and now this element is in our physical body. From experience we know that an evil, satanic element dwells in man’s nature. </p>

For years, I have been giving messages on the teaching of the anointing. In those messages I emphasized the fact that the anointing teaches us concerning all things, that is, concerning everything in our daily Christian life. In this message I would like to consider the teaching of the anointing in the more restricted sense of the anointing teaching us all things concerning the Trinity. In other words, in this message I am concerned not with the broader application of the principle, but with the proper interpretation of the teaching of the anointing according to the context of these verses.

This Spirit is the fulfillment of the type of the compound ointment revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103791" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. In this compound ointment there are a number of different elements which are the ingredients of the ointment. Just as paint may have a number of different elements, so the anointing Spirit also has different elements. These elements include the processed Triune God and His activities. The Triune God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. These are the steps in His activity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="179" id="179">[179]</span> All these steps have become elements of the compound, life-giving Spirit. Therefore, the anointing Spirit is actually a compound of the Triune God and His activities. The anointing Spirit includes divinity and humanity, the divine nature and the human nature. Such a compound Spirit includes incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All these are elements of the compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103792" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_9-Q9Kx7jTyJPf5bMBmFMZMD1Q9QxOsS6IZxG_iG9FH354LXn99uUrfdzvYAgX5S"> The anointing is actually the moving of the ointment, and the ointment is a compound. Oil, however, is not a compound, for it contains a single element. The compound ointment, on the contrary, contains a number of different elements. In the compound Spirit we have the Father, the Son, the Spirit, divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, the effectiveness of Christ’s death, the power of His resurrection, and His ascension. The anointing is the moving of this compound Spirit with all His elements. Only this anointing, only the moving of this compound Spirit, can teach us the Triune God. </p>

What is the best way to know the elements of a particular paint? The best way is to buy a can of that paint and apply some paint to a piece of furniture. By applying the paint, you will be taught concerning the elements of the paint. This means that only the paint itself can teach you what the paint is. Apart from the paint there is no way for you to learn about the elements of the paint. In a similar way, it is by applying Himself to us as the “paint” that the compound Spirit teaches us concerning the Triune God and His activities. We also may say that the elements of the compound Spirit teach us the various matters concerning the Triune God and His activities. The anointing Spirit is the composition of the Triune God with all His activities, and now this compound Spirit teaches us concerning the things of the Trinity. </p>

<p data-content-id="DQtKlqfyuaSTzil_hM3_dwXAH1WiwazYYTXATQgw7W9SDVQS0sPurlamq5vSPMQxU"> The Triune God has been compounded not only with the elements of His Person—divinity, the Father, the Son, and Spirit—but also with the elements of His activities—incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All these elements have been compounded to become the compound Spirit whose anointing teaches us concerning the things of the Trinity. </p>

For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103793" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, “Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” In his <em>Word Studies in the New Testament</em> M. R. Vincent says that the name in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103794" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> is equivalent to the Person. Hence, to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit means to baptize them into the Person of the Triune God. Just as a human name denotes a human person, the divine name denotes the divine Person. To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to put them into the Person of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="esfeiNy8Uz9z4fV2253GbYiehOccPrt10fnFjXQ4cXutCvU9X9mLb6ExfVEmS9hEo"> Vincent says also, “Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with him.” The preposition “into” implies an organic union between us and the Triune God. To be baptized into the Person of the Triune God means to be placed into an organic union with Him. As those who have been baptized into the Person of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> Triune God, we are now organically one with the Triune God, and He is organically one with us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5oJ7E4NV8cg2Yd2SYmBplM5_NmY08Fv57O7xQnk2dJuK29gNm3Iwqy1BnGZGG7QkU">THE TRIUNE GOD TEACHING US CONCERNING HIMSELF</h2><p data-content-id="Nbi_A5eQg6SlJktY-vN2BcSjloiQPqksuYnlCEy9tjYn6kA_SaakUiNPjLTZQtyW6"> The Triune God, who is now organically one with us, is teaching us concerning Himself. This teaching is subjective and experiential. Day by day, as we are in the organic union with the Triune God, we enjoy Him, we experience Him, and we live in Him, with Him, and by Him. This living is a constant teaching of the things concerning the Triune God. We can testify that we certainly enjoy the Triune God in our daily life. </p>

The word “anointing” denotes something experiential that is taking place within us. The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit. This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit from the Holy One entered into us at the time of our regeneration and abides in us forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103808" data-verses="1John 2:27">v. 27</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="0VQVWgS1ukzdV03AKaCp4HukSlA7wkHBNfhQyBRelJH5iijKgOT9M3ceK9_iYN0up"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103809" data-verses="1John 2:20">Verse 20</span> says at the end, “you all know.” Some manuscripts read, “you know all things.” I believe that the proper rendering should be “you know all,” not “you all know.” </p>
<p data-content-id="7VBIDypFbsrB3seo-P0TEAu7EdePXy7iaa4y5jfzjzXbzw_FYoAOknClttOS5sAlQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103810" data-verses="1John 2:21">verse 21</span> John says, “I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.” In this verse the word “truth” is used twice. If we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103811" data-verses="1John 2:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> together, we shall realize that the anointing surely must have something to do with the truth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103812" data-verses="1John 2:20">Verse 20</span> says that we have an anointing, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103813" data-verses="1John 2:21">verse 21</span> says that we know the truth. In this verse the truth is closely related to the anointing. Actually the anointing is the moving and working of the truth, which is the reality of the Divine Trinity, especially of the Person of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103814" data-verses="1John 2:22-25">vv. 22-25</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_7zRmizQLI750LSdci3WMRJ7m0j-jcvDE5ihipp8Dk5Zb1N-aTLrAC0-BZmbbCZWn"> The knowing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103815" data-verses="1John 2:21">verse 21</span> is the knowing by the anointing of the indwelling and life-giving Spirit. This is a knowledge in the divine life under the divine light, an inner knowledge initiated from our regenerated spirit indwelt by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="186" id="186">[186]</span> compound Spirit, not mental knowledge exercised by stimulation from without. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pd6Bbt3NPyVE9mcFi0N4Il_DQmqfBobGra2nOdxWav2F9cnrhpnmtJcsShBkzJmAh">DENYING THE FATHER AND THE SON</h2><p data-content-id="vF4IIQh977Z6yLZuPC15Dkopv3QeejgMHtejaN1SMO3KhZ94GKxBavDe-dZ1qnZvi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103816" data-verses="1John 2:22">verse 22</span> John goes on to say, “Who is the liar if not he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, who is denying the Father and the Son.” The statement that Jesus is the Christ is related to the truth, and the truth is related to the anointing. These three matters are all related to one another. First we have the anointing, then the truth related to the anointing, and then the statement that Jesus is the Christ related to the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBUhCROQnVG_-YKH2BunBB4dAqFch7zK22B6maOtNpMDJBJVQOGaPDnWeE_-Dfp3f"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103817" data-verses="1John 2:22">Verse 22</span> indicates that the antichrist is the one who denies the Father and the Son. After speaking of Jesus being the Christ, John speaks concerning the Father and the Son. This indicates that the Father and the Son are related to Jesus being the Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="2xUvRB6bOMVLj3gOpKGd3TJlmHOXsYKjJNLyxtwdkTsdeMpDSrbsygsl4I0z0J47y"> In these three verses we have four crucial matters: the anointing, the truth, Jesus being the Christ, and the Father and the Son. The anointing teaches us the truth, the truth is that Jesus is the Christ, and Jesus being the Christ is a matter that includes the Father and the Son. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103818" data-verses="1John 2:22">verse 22</span>, to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son. If we deny that Jesus is the Christ, this means that we deny the Father and the Son. This indicates strongly that Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son are one. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="u1sqLDoEOByMLopgbu_aCqIeaZwxJW5k74G9JvNqSDBMoewTPOGPF3BlexAbSZMFU">ENJOYING CHRIST AND GROWING IN LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="fX0psknrQuL7J7uZCPBLmWttBYY6uQ0hHDzsYlbALepmSVHxblGdG69ounyizwRB2"> Here I would like to point out that when we speak of these matters, we are not fighting for doctrines. However, we are fighting for the genuine experience of Christ so that Christians may enjoy Christ in order to grow in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="IAEglTO5-PveUJvF1lWxKJmjvYoxl2nNfpgL8X4B-R4Wo2ONs8YiCa3cVul_enZ8w"> Not many today teach concerning Christian growth in the proper way. What is emphasized among Christians is growth in knowledge. But the New Testament teaches us that we need to grow in life. As newborn babes, we should desire to drink the milk of the Word so that we may grow in life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103819" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">1 Pet. 2:2</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="187" id="187">[187]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="HwMO3cvZ0bsnsA0tpNdFIfujT59o1M4Pm-yVbCByoE_QqtH4WFIgrRpe3y2WqGcVm"> From experience we know that to grow in life is to grow by the ingredients of what the Lord is as our nourishment. We need to take this nourishment into our being as food and then assimilate it. The Lord Jesus told us definitely that He is our food. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103820" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span> He said, “I am the bread of life.” For the Lord to be bread to us means that He is our food. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103821" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span> the Lord Jesus said that he who eats Him will live because of Him. The food by which we live is also the food by which we grow. If we do not grow by the food we eat, how can we live by it? Children grow by what they eat. Then they live by it. Hence, when the Lord Jesus said that he who eats Him will also live by Him, this implies both living by Him and growing by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="XkwcSjgfEhTzaME596SB0SU_-aKtBIUgzYa0NsdWxLYhUHNpANkftayVDpm4bNwhp"> In the Lord’s recovery we are wholly for the experience of the growth in life. This growth in life depends on our enjoyment of the Lord Jesus in a subjective way. If the Lord were not the Spirit, He could not be subjective to us, and He could not be our life. If the Lord could not be our life, then He could not be our nourishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="kwpmPGODR_HqrtquI-1xXx5FEUWSH1h50QIifl8NGXNdS36pTzY-bvFX82iimNHp_"> Many Christians today emphasize objective teachings concerning the improvement of character and behavior. These teachings are ethical and are comparable to the teachings of Confucius. The teachings in the New Testament, however, are different. The New Testament teaches that after being processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God becomes the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in order to enter into our being to be our life and also our life supply so that we may live and grow by Him. This is the central line of the New Testament revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="JK1tOOo6YAEZffeFYvDJ0DQG9ONKb85WqGku6EADZi_KVs6rkRSoTbBOm2k-7ZLI8"> The Lord Jesus declared that He is life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103822" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span> He said, “I am...the life.” If He were only on the throne in the heavens, how could He be our life? This would be impossible. In order for Christ to be our life, He must be the Spirit living within us. It is crucial that Christians experience Christ as their subjective life. We are fighting not for doctrines, but for the Christian experience of Christ as life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ztWqoed01v1IAPVjcjzQHIv0ipIm6AC9ZdsgqX-h9OsWPZeIXDKZl3JMjwTALCxAg">THE HERESY OF CERINTHUS</h2><p data-content-id="aJigmhkHMCsaQv4-H_CrsJOMX6CWMXMHKH2uXmTRIedacoVBVBjciQiomTqjw4x7m"> We have pointed out that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103823" data-verses="1John 2:21-22">verses 21 and 22</span>, the truth is that Jesus is the Christ. However, this truth was denied by certain heretics who said that Jesus was not the Christ. Denying that Jesus is the Christ is the heresy of Cerinthus, a first century Syrian heresiarch of Jewish descent, educated at Alexandria. His heresy was a mixture of Judaism, Gnosticism, and Christianity. He distinguished the maker (creator) of the world from God, and represented that maker as a subordinate power. He taught adoptionist Christology (Adoptionism), saying that Jesus became Son of God by exaltation to a status that was not His by birth, thus denying the conception of Jesus by the Holy Spirit. In his heresy he separated the earthly man Jesus, regarded as the son of Joseph and Mary, from the heavenly Christ, and taught that after Jesus was baptized, Christ as a dove descended upon Him. Then He announced the unknown Father and did miracles, but at the end of His ministry Christ departed from Jesus, and Jesus suffered death on the cross and rose from the dead, while Christ remained separated as a spiritual being, and will rejoin the man Jesus at the coming of the Messianic kingdom of glory. This heresy denied that Jesus is the Christ. According to John’s word, anyone who denies that Jesus is the Christ is the antichrist. Cerinthus was an antichrist, and his followers also were antichrists. </p>
<p data-content-id="b9TQLQbBeCKIIpeWWcGDe_AkSb4Qps9FHrW7NBfExSSKvxh_3cu8CPv3MICdSv85q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103824" data-verses="1John 2:22">verse 22</span> John says that the antichrist denies the Father and the Son. To confess that Jesus is the Christ is to confess that He is the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103825" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">Matt. 16:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103826" data-verses="John 20:31">John 20:31</span>). Hence, to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son. Whoever so denies the divine Person of Christ is an antichrist. </p>

It is absolutely correct to say that the Son is not separate from the Father, nor the Father from the Son. However, there is still a distinction between the Three of the Godhead, a distinction between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Oq5yNluxOcFZ42LxIZQlgbnj6FHDGzmZVFp5SEX7nUut1FCw3vLXkTJ1zg_T79f2J">JESUS AND CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="40zTT6CnkXFE1ethYd3Z1sUFxYnFj0t02z2WS_Ixj97w5y9s3Im7mWIGyNgcYDBuM"> The Lord is both Jesus and Christ. Although there is no separation between Jesus and Christ, there is a distinction between these two titles Jesus and Christ. The name Jesus means Jehovah our Savior or Jehovah our salvation. The title Christ means the anointed One. The name Jesus mostly denotes the Lord in His humanity, in His incarnation, human living, and crucifixion. The title Christ denotes the Lord as God’s anointed One and especially what He is in resurrection and ascension. Jesus and Christ both refer to the same Person. Although this Person is inseparable, there is nevertheless a distinction between the two titles Jesus and Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="obx1QC4qWRaRyglw7DiaTeVfMZbcXsvzx7mNj8ptpL1L6KbH0JCWnp6xslWl3O42-">THE FATHER AND THE SON</h2><p data-content-id="SU2ZTjy5OGYluzV9gZc6I5uqQ2_GmeN-7xCAqf5pl981Y-SstP2uc3Ykx4Zp396M1"> Although the Son and the Father are one, we should not say that there is no distinction between the Father and the Son. There is a distinction between the Father and the Son, but there is no separation. When the Father is present, the Son is present also. Likewise, where the Son is, there the <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> Father is also. The Father and the Son cannot be separated. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103862" data-verses="1John 2:23">verse 23</span> John says that whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either, and that he who confesses the Son has the Father also. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPZwIBWVLNzIUHN7kStCQ65wh3Ptvl4Kl8HEES34jsiFdri3coL8reMmqLT40dAx6"> Whenever we speak about the Trinity, we need to be sober and careful with our definitions and illustrations. We have seen from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103863" data-verses="1John 2:20-27">2:20-27</span> that Jesus, Christ, the Father, the Son, the Word of life, and eternal life all are one. However, there is still a distinction between them. We have already pointed out that Jesus and Christ refer to the same Person. Nevertheless, there is a distinction between the name Jesus and the title Christ. We should not say that they denote the same thing, for the denotations are quite different. Because our Lord is rich and all-inclusive, He needs different names and titles to describe Him. Therefore, He is Jesus and He is also Christ. As Jesus He is Jehovah our Savior, and as Christ, He is God’s anointed One. </p>
<p data-content-id="esfeiNy8Uz9z4fV2253GbYiejOcQNrt10fnFjXQ4cXutCvU9X9mLb6ExfVEmS9hEo"> There should not be any doubt in us that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are truly one and are one God. Although we believe in the Trinity, we definitely do not believe in three Gods. Tritheism, the belief in three Gods, is heresy, and we must condemn it. Although God is one, there is a clear distinction between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in the Godhead. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5oJ7E4NV8cg2Yd2SYmBplM5_PmY4-Fv57O7xQnk2dJuK29gNm3Iwqy1BnGZGG7QkU">THE TWOFOLDNESS OF THE TRUTH<br/>CONCERNING THE TRINITY</h2><p data-content-id="Nbi_A5eQg6SlJktY-vN2BcSjnoicJqksuYnlCEy9tjYn6kA_SaakUiNPjLTZQtyW6"> The truth of the Triune God is twofold; that is, it has two sides or two aspects, the aspect of one and the aspect of three. The twofoldness of the truth concerning the Trinity is embodied in the word triune. This adjective is actually a Latin word composed of two parts: tri-, meaning three, and -une, meaning one. The word “triune,” therefore, means three-one. On the one hand, our God is uniquely one; on the other hand, He is three. In the aspect of God’s being one, there is no separation between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. But in the aspect of God’s being three, there is a distinction between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="197" id="197">[197]</span> Lord Jesus said, “I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103864" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span>). Because the Father and the Son are mutually in each other, They cannot be separated. But there is still a distinction between the Father and the Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="tDWlQSHUBHZ5qBD93IBcPfrOZaUqS26HA_scGJKr-ItE3c3VnQo-6LLTQLhXhN2yD"> Concerning the Trinity we should not drift to either of two extremes, to the extreme of emphasizing the three or the extreme of emphasizing the one. Some Christians have gone to the extreme of emphasizing the three to the neglect of the one. Others drift to the extreme of the one and neglect the three. We need to be balanced. In order to be balanced we need to emphasize both aspects of the Trinity—the aspect of the three and the aspect of the one. Because in the foregoing message we pointed out that the Father and the Son are one, in this message I would like to say a balancing word that although the Father and the Son are one, there is still a definite distinction between them. In the sense of distinction, the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit. Although there is a distinction between the Three of the Godhead, the Three nonetheless are still one. </p>
<p data-content-id="hwNB5H1_KK9Ks6g0ACxK6_jNSi871f3etOZrhIrnwoZm3HPKYIheMIJchivbQyuv_"> In <em>The Principles of Theology</em> W. H. Griffith Thomas says the following: </p>
<p class="quoteindent" data-content-id="U9rXToUa2KRqaPsc9SEiBr8fHKyNL87wInxLKr_QDrvEc9ggHlOE4lgHHPstsNJX4">The term “Person” is also sometimes objected to. Like all human language, it is liable to be accused of inadequacy and even positive error. It certainly must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to Tritheism. While we use the term to denote distinctions in the Godhead, we do not imply distinctions which amount to separateness, but distinctions which are associated with essential mutual co-inherence or inclusiveness.... </p>
<p class="quoteindent" data-content-id="Macv1r_Zlb7xB4WAvXY0AXO0FwPQg3SGhukFHUTAtli4bCL-SkoqeKAnfuib3gJ20">While, therefore, we are compelled to use terms like “substance” and “Person,” we are not to think of them as identical with what we understand as human substance or personality.

<p data-content-id="V9xS8M6rjjN-0lZsHbq91AHX9KAY96Y9a5uiZMINou19YlFe7mjWMSjjqQ7FY9LXk"> I especially appreciate Griffith Thomas’ word that the term “Person” must not be pressed too far “or it will lead to Tritheism,” the belief in three Gods. In the same principle, when we say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all one, we should not press this too far, or we will fall into another kind of error. Some have used sunlight as an illustration: the sun is the Father, the ray is the Son, and the shining is the Spirit. Another illustration is that of ice, water, and vapor, with these three respectively representing the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Such illustrations may be used for temporary help; they should not be pressed too far or they will lead to error. </p>

We have seen that the teaching of the anointing concerning the Divine Trinity is according to the believers’ growth in life. We have also seen that the teaching of the divine anointing is for our abiding in the Triune God. </p>

This means that maintaining the fellowship of the divine life depends on abiding in the Lord and in the light. To abide in the Lord and in the light is equal to abiding in the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="esfeiNy8Uz9z4fV2253GbYiekOc1Frt10fnFjXQ4cXutCvU9X9mLb6ExfVEmS9hEo"> The Triune God reaches us as the Spirit. If God were only the Father and the Son, He would not be able to enter into us. It is only as the Spirit that the Triune God can enter into our spirit. The word “anointing” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103893" data-verses="1John 2:20">2:20</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103894" data-verses="1John 2:27">27</span> refers mainly to the Spirit, not primarily to the Father or the Son. Actually, the ointment is the Spirit, and the anointing is the moving of this ointment. When we speak of the anointing, we mean the Triune God reaching us as the Spirit. When the Triune God comes into our spirit, He is the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit, who dwells in our spirit, is now moving and working within us. This moving is the anointing. </p>
<p data-content-id="5oJ7E4NV8cg2Yd2SYmBplM5_ImYZ3Fv57O7xQnk2dJuK29gNm3Iwqy1BnGZGG7QkU"> The anointing has much to do with our abiding in the Lord. We enjoy the fellowship of the divine life so that we <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> may abide in the Lord. This abiding is altogether a matter of the Lord as the Spirit dwelling in our spirit. This is the reason that immediately after the first section, which is concerned with the fellowship of the divine life, John goes on in the second section of this Epistle to speak of the teaching of the divine anointing. Apart from the anointing, we cannot abide in the Lord. If we do not abide in the Lord, we cannot maintain the fellowship. Furthermore, if we do not maintain the fellowship, we cannot enjoy the riches of the divine life. We may also say that to enjoy the riches of the divine life, we need to maintain the fellowship; to maintain the fellowship, we need to abide in the Lord; and in order to abide in the Lord, we need to take care of the inner anointing, which is the moving of the indwelling Spirit in our spirit. </p>

A false Christ is one who pretends to be the Christ in a deceiving way, whereas an antichrist is one who denies Christ’s deity, denying that Jesus is the Christ, that is, denying the Father and the Son by denying that Jesus is the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103898" data-verses="1John 2:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>), not confessing that He has come in the flesh through the divine conception of the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103899" data-verses="1John 4:2-3">4:2-3</span>). At the time of the apostle John, many heretics, like the Gnostics, Cerinthians, and Docetists, taught heresies concerning the Person of Christ, that is, concerning His divinity and humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="JK1tOOo6YAEZffeFYvDJ0DQG7ONGZ85WqGku6EADZi_KVs6rkRSoTbBOm2k-7ZLI8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103900" data-verses="1John 2:19">verse 19</span> John goes on to say, “They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out that they might be manifested that they all are not of us.” These antichrists were not born of God and were not in the fellowship of the apostles with the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103901" data-verses="1John 1:3">1:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103902" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>).

However, due to the problem of language, we may not realize that Christ is related to the anointing. The Greek word for Christ is <em>Christos,</em> which means the anointed one, and the Greek word for anointing is <em>chrisma.</em> Both words are derived from the same root. Now we must go on to see that Christ as the anointed One becomes the anointing. Because He is the anointed One, He has an abundance of ointment with which to anoint us. Eventually, the anointed One becomes the anointing One. In fact, He even becomes the anointing. To deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny that Jesus is the anointed One. Moreover, to deny the anointed One means to deny the anointing. Therefore, to deny the <em>Christos</em> is to deny the <em>chrisma.</em> Whenever someone denies that Jesus is the <em>Christos,</em> that one denies that Jesus is the anointed One. This is equal to denying the anointing, for after the anointed One enters into us, He becomes the anointing. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFcHJ5u15ZxAiYHSZvY58HSLb5NMvPM1VUsm4k6TsFJaq-O4SNDd4YeiVXmP28L7D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103906" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21">2 Corinthians 1:21</span> Paul says, “But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.” Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God. Christ has been anointed with the divine ointment, and the ointment that is upon Him now flows to us. This is pictured in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103907" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span>, which says that the anointing oil flows from the head of Aaron to his beard and even to the skirts of <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> his priestly robe. This indicates that Christ has an abundance of the anointing oil. God has poured the ointment upon Him. Through that anointing Christ has received the ointment, and eventually He, the anointed One, became the anointing One. When He entered into us as the anointed One, He became the anointing One in us. Actually, the anointing that dwells in us is the anointed One becoming the anointing One and also the anointing. To reject this anointed One is to reject the anointing. Whenever someone denies that Jesus is the anointed One and thereby denies that He is the anointing One, this person also denies the anointing. Now we need to see that to deny the anointing is to be anti-anointing, the accurate meaning of the title antichrist. Antichrist, therefore, means anti the anointing. </p>
<p data-content-id="yKKB9eDIFrgaTLK1MK46XTTDd3oUc9RUpYq8CgQ0-IcLwk2G0bP3UGZmH5RVKsBFj"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103908" data-verses="1John 2:22">verse 22</span>, the antichrist is the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ. To deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny that He is the anointing One. This is also to deny the anointing and thereby to be anti-anointing. What is the antichrist? The antichrist is someone who is anti-anointing. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103909" data-verses="1John 2:22">verse 22</span>, to be an antichrist, to be anti-anointing, is to deny the Father and the Son. We may not be anti the anointing in this way, yet we have to admit that often we disobey this inner anointing. </p>
<p data-content-id="84n3RYDKDx94xFCgfM9dlb2CsZ5P7g4YURpxxsRaVR92YZ1bUpSXSRwFYRnjKzTph"> God’s intention is to work Himself into us as our life and our everything to make us His counterpart for the expression of Himself. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary for God to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. When He entered into resurrection, He became the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is actually <em>Christos,</em> the anointed One, becoming the life-giving One. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him into us. The One we received is the anointed One, who through death and resurrection has become the anointing One. Furthermore, this anointing One is the all-inclusive indwelling Spirit. As soon as we believed in Him, He as the Spirit entered our spirit. Now He is within our spirit to anoint us, to “paint” us, with the element of the Triune God. The more this “painting” goes on, the more the <span class="pg" data-page-id="207" id="207">[207]</span> element of the Triune God is transfused into our being. This is the anointing, which is the reality of the entire New Testament. </p>

In this message we come to the third section: the virtues of the divine birth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103917" data-verses="1John 2:28">2:28—5:21</span>). The sequence here is very significant. First, John shows us that in the divine life there is the enjoyment of fellowship, and in this fellowship we enjoy the teaching of the anointing. Following this, John writes concerning the virtues of the divine birth. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103918" data-verses="1John 2:28">2:28—3:10a</span>, the virtues of the divine birth are for the practice of the divine righteousness. </p>

This means that “Him” actually refers to the Triune God. Hence, to abide in Him is to abide in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="j0SOOFIflP3ERSaDjOND_xFDSkcuFq8j2iJ-DvwwdoXXEhkU0nic63EalVdhoz9en"> The pronoun “He” in the phrase “He is manifested,” according to the context, must refer to the Son.

This indicates strongly that the Son and the Father are one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103921" data-verses="John 10:30">John 10:30</span>). The pronoun “He” refers both to the Son who is coming and to the Father who has begotten us. It is the Father, not the Son, who has begotten us, but it is the Son, not the Father, who is coming. </p>
<p data-content-id="V9xS8M6rjjN-0lZsHbq91AHX7KAY16Y9a5uiZMINou19YlFe7mjWMSjjqQ7FY9LXk"> In this verse “He” as a pronoun serves two purposes, referring both to Him (the Son) who is coming and also to Him (the Father) who has begotten us. Are the Father and the Son one or two? The best answer to this question is to say that They are two-one. He is both the One who will come and the One who has begotten.

In this section, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="103929" data-verses="1John 2:28">2:28 through 3:24</span>, the apostle continues to describe the life that abides in the Lord.

Now we are partaking of and enjoying this divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103984" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>) for us to grow in the divine life. This is the basis for the practice of the divine righteousness, the divine love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103985" data-verses="1John 3:10">3:10b</span>—5:3), and the overcoming of all negative things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103986" data-verses="1John 5:4-21">5:4-21</span>). </p>

This charge begins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103995" data-verses="1John 2:28">2:28</span>), continues (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103996" data-verses="1John 3:6">3:6</span>), and ends (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="103997" data-verses="1John 3:24">3:24</span>) with “abide in Him.” If we abide in Him, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming, at His <em>parousia.</em> This means that at His coming back we shall not be put to shame from His glory.

We need to know in such a way that God is righteous. If we perceive this, then we shall know that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="40zTT6CnkXFE1ethYd3Z1sUF0Ynsr0t02z2WS_Ixj97w5y9s3Im7mWIGyNgcYDBuM"> Practicing righteousness is a matter that is habitual and unintentional as a common daily life. Hence, to practice the divine righteousness is to do righteousness habitually and unintentionally as our daily living. However, if we do righteousness intentionally with a purpose, that is not a matter of our common daily life. Rather, it is to behave in a political way. Someone may do righteousness with a purpose of gaining a position or a name for himself. That is to behave in a <span class="pg" data-page-id="224" id="224">[224]</span> political way. But we Christians, as children of God, should be saturated with the righteous God so that spontaneously we live a life that practices righteousness habitually and unintentionally. Instead of doing a particular act of righteousness for a certain purpose, we practice righteousness as our common daily life. This is an issue of the fellowship of the divine life and the anointing of the Divine Trinity. Furthermore, this is an expression of the righteous God. Through abiding in the righteous God, we are infused and saturated with Him. Then our living becomes an expression of the righteous God with whom we have been infused and saturated. This righteous God then becomes our righteous living, our daily righteousness. This practice of righteousness is not merely outward behavior, but the manifestation of the inward life. As we have pointed out, this is not an act done for a purpose; it is the flow of life from within the divine nature of which we partake. </p>

Of the Triune God implied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104002" data-verses="1John 2:29">2:29</span>, the Father is particularly mentioned. He is the source of the divine life, the One of whom we have been born with this life. The love of God is manifested by sending His Son to die for us so that we may have His life and thus become His children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104003" data-verses="1John 4:9">4:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104004" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104005" data-verses="John 1:12-13">1:12-13</span>).

For the reason that we are the children of God by a mysterious birth with the divine life, the world does not know us. The world is ignorant of our regeneration by God; it does not know us, because it did not know God Himself. It was ignorant of God, so it is also ignorant of our divine birth. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2xUvRB6bOMVLj3gOpKGd3TJljHOOlYKjJNLyxtwdkTsdeMpDSrbsygsl4I0z0J47y">BY THE DIVINE LIFE (AS THE DIVINE SEED)<br/>AND THE DIVINE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="u1sqLDoEOByMLopgbu_aCqIefZwUHW5k74G9JvNqSDBMoewTPOGPF3BlexAbSZMFU"> In order to practice the divine love as a virtue of the divine life, we need the divine life and the divine Spirit. The divine life is the divine seed that we all have within our regenerated spirit. In addition to the divine life that has been sown as the divine seed into our being, we also have the divine Spirit within our spirit. The divine life and the divine Spirit are the “capital” within us that enables us to practice the divine love. The divine life is the source, and the divine Spirit is the One who actually carries out the matter of loving others. The divine love is our daily living as the expression of the divine life carried out by the divine Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="fX0psknrQuL7J7uZCPBLmWttEYYbhQ0hHDzsYlbALepmSVHxblGdG69ounyizwRB2"> The divine life and the divine Spirit are basic factors for <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> the practice of the divine love. With the divine life and by the divine Spirit, we can have a love that is divine and not merely human. This divine love in the daily living of the children of God is an evidence that we have both the divine life and the divine Spirit. </p>

What God is, is love; what God does is righteousness. Love is inward; righteousness is outward. Hence, love is a stronger manifestation that we are the children of God than righteousness. Therefore, the apostle, from this verse through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104057" data-verses="1John 3:24">verse 24</span>, proceeds further, from righteousness to love, in the manifestation of the children of God, as a further condition of the life that abides in the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjvsbLXC95jIofUewvvl31x3mdu2rXeOu5KohfFvOD1aP_kOrsv_S-UDyFM05oP1A"> It is a serious thing for John to say that everyone who does not love his brother is not out of God. As children of God, we certainly are of God and even out of God. Because we are out of God, we surely have God’s life and God’s Spirit in us. Spontaneously, we live a life of loving the brothers. However, if someone does not have such a love, this is an evidence that he has neither the divine life nor the divine Spirit. Hence, there is a serious question concerning whether such a one is a child of God, born of Him. Loving the brothers is a strong evidence that we are out of God, having God’s life and enjoying God’s Spirit. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104060" data-verses="1John 3:11">verse 11</span> the phrase “from the beginning” is used in the relative sense. The love spoken of here is a higher condition of the life that abides in the Lord. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mn3fBEi3V-LxlHDwMqePt9AwLFoqneifDcXA1kAfROvDK6_k4jtBDoj0aPMeQweBZ">Not as Cain</h2><p data-content-id="ZBXnfJ6UP-Fda9whE9Gct_rIio2aXlpegKFSHc9jieeNRg-6ivGO1dX-Dj71CxbLl"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104061" data-verses="1John 3:12">verse 12</span> John continues, “Not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his works were evil, and those of his brother righteous.” “Of the evil one” equals a child of the Devil. Cain’s brother Abel was of God, a child of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104062" data-verses="1John 3:10">v. 10</span>). The Greek word rendered “evil one” here is <em>poneros,</em> which means pernicious, harmfully evil, affecting and influencing others to be evil and vicious. Such an evil one is Satan the Devil. </p>
<p data-content-id="ABJfl-uaPAyBgWk9Nfoh4r7V17DUoBULqJ-COVeQYUnu0KigDNsnClbv9bdMJdfbR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104063" data-verses="1John 3:12">verse 12</span> John uses two flesh brothers, Cain and Abel, as an illustration. Although these brothers were of the same parents, one of them became a child of God, and the other was a child of the Devil. We may find this difficult to believe. We may wonder how two brothers born of the same parents and living in the same environment could be so different, with one being the Devil’s child and the other becoming God’s child. Nevertheless, this was the fact. Here this fact is used as an illustration of what kind of person is a child of the Devil and what kind is a child of God. In order to know this, we should consider the case of Cain and Abel. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fjf9eLUxZuRzIgkrskf4ENZaH62-Zr3gu3epFJ226l_2GQqT0RXB5avmTF1oGxSDX"> The fact that Cain was a child of the Devil is proved by his hating his brother and slaying him. This indicates that Cain did not have either the life of God or the Spirit of God. Why did Cain hate his brother? He hated him because he had the hating life of Satan in him. Why did Cain kill Abel? He killed him because he had in him the evil nature of Satan. What Cain had in him was the Devil’s life, the Devil’s nature, and an evil spirit. Abel, however, was altogether different. Today also those born of the same parents and raised in the same environment may become absolutely different. One may become a child of God and the other be a child of the Devil. <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> </p>

The people of the world, like Cain, are the children of the Devil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104065" data-verses="1John 3:10">v. 10</span>) and the components of Satan’s cosmic system, the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104066" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>). If the people of the world, which lies in the evil one, the Devil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104067" data-verses="1John 5:19">5:19</span>), hate the believers (the children of God), it is natural for them to do so. The situation among flesh brothers today may be the same as that between Cain and Abel. Suppose one brother is a child of Satan and the other is a child of God. Automatically, the one who is a child of the Devil will hate the one who is a child of God. Regarding this, we do not need to marvel. </p>
<p data-content-id="-MXP56kd770epxQOG8uB-5txQllsMVyQEHhcY6kDg35U9ZDcHDykCX8Bp5fp-Ex7h"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104068" data-verses="1John 3:13">Verse 13</span> indicates strongly that all the worldly people are children of the Devil. Only a comparatively small number, the regenerated believers, are God’s children. If we live by God’s life and by God’s Spirit, the world will hate us. Because we and they are in two different categories, they will not be happy with us. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="pd6Bbt3NPyVE9mcFi0N4Il_DVmqTDobGra2nOdxWav2F9cnrhpnmtJcsShBkzJmAh">Knowing That We Have<br/>Passed out of Death into Life</h2><p data-content-id="vF4IIQh977Z6yLZuPC15Dkopq3QScjgMHtejaN1SMO3KhZ94GKxBavDe-dZ1qnZvi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104069" data-verses="1John 3:14">3:14</span> John says, “We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love abides in death.” Death is of the Devil, God’s enemy Satan, signified by the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which brings death. Life is of God, the source of life, signified by the tree of life, which issues in life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104070" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104071" data-verses="Genesis 2:16-17">16-17</span>). Death and life are not only of these two sources, Satan and God; they are also two essences, two elements, and two spheres. To pass out of death is to pass out of the source, the essence, the element, and the sphere of death into the source, the essence, the element, and the sphere of life. This took place in us at our regeneration. We know (<em>oida</em>) this, we have the inner consciousness of this, because we love the brothers. Love (<em>agape</em>—the love of God) toward the brothers is a strong evidence of this. Faith in the Lord is the way for us to pass out of death into life; love toward the brothers is <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> the evidence that we have passed out of death into life. To have faith is to receive the eternal life; to love is to live by the eternal life and express it. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBUhCROQnVG_-YKH2BunBB4dFqFQn7zK22B6maOtNpMDJBJVQOGaPDnWeE_-Dfp3f"> Not loving the brothers is evidence of not living by the essence and element of the divine life and not remaining in its sphere. It is living in the essence and element of the satanic death and abiding in its sphere. </p>

Not only are death and life of these two sources, Satan and God; they are also two essences, two elements, and two spheres. To pass out of death into life is to pass out of the source, essence, element, and sphere of death into the source, essence, element, and sphere of life. This took place when we were regenerated, born of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFcHJ5u15ZxAiYHSZvY58HSLX5NpjPM1VUsm4k6TsFJaq-O4SNDd4YeiVXmP28L7D"> We need to consider further the source, essence, element, and sphere both of death and of life. What is the difference between the essence of life and the element of life, and what is the difference between the element of life and the sphere of life? It is important for us to understand the difference between these things. </p>
<p data-content-id="yKKB9eDIFrgaTLK1MK46XTTDR3o1R9RUpYq8CgQ0-IcLwk2G0bP3UGZmH5RVKsBFj"> Perhaps the best way to point out the difference between source, essence, element, and sphere as applied to both life and death is to use the following illustration. Suppose a particular drink is composed of three elements: milk, tea, and sugar. Each element has its own essence. This means that with tea there is the essence, the substance, of tea. In like manner, milk and sugar each have different essences or substances. We would not say that this drink is made up of <span class="pg" data-page-id="244" id="244">[244]</span> three substances. Rather, we would say that the drink is composed of three elements and that within these elements are three different essences or substances. </p>
<p data-content-id="QXYDaOWJRqFN-OMexzzkkKKYlM2ym63I9JQNIAZfmtTqzxZboroT0AfiWGha8DsoE"> When we were saved, we received more than one element from God. We received life, and we also received righteousness. Both life and righteousness are mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104085" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span>. What elements did we have before we were saved? Before we were saved we were one with Satan, and we had the elements of sin and death. But when we were saved, we received righteousness, which is versus sin, and life, which is versus death. </p>
<p data-content-id="KAnj8tJPZRQJM4YpnOV1M0J74G9pPHqIkHqU1wFtdkcPaABiJe8EzKj3ASCfLj5sp"> On both the negative side and the positive side, we have two elements. On the negative side, we have sin and death; on the positive side, we have righteousness and life. In each of these four elements there is a certain kind of essence. The essence of life and the essence of righteousness are of one kind, and the essence of sin and the essence of death are a different kind. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="la3oDDXAaVb3iB8-kG6CtRv0N9K7H1AISkoO1SuI43Xjp5yw-h0UIgr1QgYrdyXkT">Righteousness and Life</h2><p data-content-id="Oq5yNluxOcFZ42LxIZQlgbnjxFHaPzmZVFp5SEX7nUut1FCw3vLXkTJ1zg_T79f2J"> Let us now apply these matters to our experience. When we were in the element of death, we experienced the essence, the substance, of death. Again, we may use tea as an illustration. When we drink tea, what we drink is not the element of tea; we drink the essence of tea. When we received the Lord Jesus at the time we were saved and regenerated, we received two elements. However, we should not say that we received two essences. At regeneration we received the elements of life and righteousness, and now we are living in these elements. But it would not be correct to say that we received two essences and that we are now living in these essences. Having received the elements of life and righteousness, we are now enjoying and experiencing the essences of these elements. We have received the element of righteousness, and now we are enjoying the essence of this element. Likewise, we have received the element of life, and now we are experiencing the essence of this element. Before we were regenerated, we were in the elements <span class="pg" data-page-id="245" id="245">[245]</span> of sin and death, and we were suffering from the working of the essence of sin and the essence of death within us. This brief word may help us to know how to apply the essence and element of righteousness and life. </p>
<p data-content-id="40zTT6CnkXFE1ethYd3Z1sUF6Yngt0t02z2WS_Ixj97w5y9s3Im7mWIGyNgcYDBuM"> As children of God, we have two divine elements—righteousness and life.

Please notice the sequence: source, essence, element, and sphere. The essence follows the source, the element follows the essence, and the sphere follows the element. First we have the source. Then out of the source comes the essence. The essence forms an element, and eventually this element becomes a sphere. Therefore, regarding life, we first have the source of life. Out of this source of life comes the essence of life. The essence forms the element of life, and this element of life then becomes the sphere of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_9-Q9Kx7jTyJPf5bMBmFMZMK1Q9UxOsS6IZxG_iG9FH354LXn99uUrfdzvYAgX5S"> We may use a fountain to illustrate the difference between the source of life, the essence of life, the element of life, and the sphere of life. Water flows out of a fountain and becomes a river. The fountain is the source. We may say that H<sub>2</sub>O is the essence of what comes out of the fountain. This essence then takes the form of water, and the flowing water becomes a river. Here we have the fountain as the source, the H<sub>2</sub>O as the essence, the water as the element, and the river as the sphere. Therefore, in the sphere of the river we have the water as the element, and the essence of this element is H<sub>2</sub>O. The source of it all is the fountain. </p>
<p data-content-id="cYRJL3FyGiMJce37YiEtczjO1kpGv0fwB9b9ww7NXYMyyjzFozblW026JUBxBIAeZ"> As children of God, we have received the divine life from God. God is the source, the fountain, of the divine life. The essence of the divine life is the very being of God. Hence, God’s being, His essence, is the essence of the spiritual water <span class="pg" data-page-id="246" id="246">[246]</span> we have received as the divine life. This life also is an element by which and in which we can live. When we live in the element of the divine life, the divine life becomes the sphere of our living. Now we are living in the sphere of the divine life, possessing the element of the divine life, and enjoying the essence of the divine life. Furthermore, as we enjoy the essence of the divine life, we are organically joined to God as the source of this life. This is the reason we say that with the divine life we have the source, the essence, the element, and the sphere. </p>
<p data-content-id="YYSW9aJ5jeMhH9dbudB3sTUxL9sG5ZsU8TfqZNCeO65vJEtxGOnXREYNg7XyrhmAY"> The principle is the same with death. Before we were saved and regenerated, we were in the source, essence, element, and sphere of death. We were living in the sphere of death, possessing the element of death, and suffering the essence of death. Moreover, we were joined to Satan, the source of death. Therefore, before regeneration, we were experiencing and suffering the source, essence, element, and sphere of death. </p>

For Christ to lay down His soul for us means that He laid down His human life on our behalf. Now we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers. This means that, if necessary, we should die for them. We have within us such a loving life that longs to die for others and is able to die for them.

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KAnj8tJPZRQJM4YpnOV1M0J75G9IEHqIkHqU1wFtdkcPaABiJe8EzKj3ASCfLj5sp">PERSUADING OUR HEART BEFORE HIM</h2><p data-content-id="Fjf9eLUxZuRzIgkrskf4ENZaJ62-Rr3gu3epFJ226l_2GQqT0RXB5avmTF1oGxSDX"> According to John’s word, if we love in truth, we shall also be able to “persuade our heart before Him.” The Greek word rendered “persuade” also means conciliate, convince, assure, tranquilize. To persuade our heart before God is to have a good conscience, void of offense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104100" data-verses="1Timothy 1:5">1 Tim. 1:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104101" data-verses="1Timothy 1:19">19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104102" data-verses="Acts 24:16">Acts 24:16</span>), that our heart may be conciliated, convinced, assured, and tranquilized before the Lord. This is also a condition of the life that abides in the Lord. To abide in the Lord requires a tranquil heart with a conscience void of offense. <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> This is also vital to our fellowship with God, which is covered in the first section of this Epistle. A heart disturbed by a conscience with offense frustrates our abiding in the Lord and breaks our fellowship with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="C5iZHjQEESBTbUVTrqRwpnl7leYxr2NAir21H0caRx3O1t-5AgiFhkPSjvArHBZnX"> We know from experience that if we do not love by the divine love, our heart will not be at peace. Furthermore, we shall not have peace if we are not right even with a small matter in our environment. Suppose a brother becomes upset and knocks over a chair. Certainly he does not have peace in his heart. But if instead he lives by the divine life and loves others by the divine love, he will be able to conciliate his heart, to persuade his heart before God. </p>
<p data-content-id="PmZRbkNCA7IaF_Qs_g8BlUtAyqyZm0Dl_DWLNar7v36_bO8qvVFjenmaihcWtDNSp"> When we have the assurance that we are in the divine truth, we shall be able to convince, persuade, and assure our heart and cause it to be tranquil. Otherwise, there will be turmoil within, for our heart will protest that we do not love according to the divine love. Our heart may say, “You are a child of God, but you are not living by the divine life. Why do you knock over a chair?” If we want our heart to be tranquil, we need to live by the divine life in relation to everyone and everything. Suppose, for example, that I carelessly throw something aside. I know from experience that if I do this, I will not have peace in my heart. In order for my heart to be tranquil, I need to be right with everything. Only when we live a life that is the expression of the divine reality can we cause our heart to be tranquil. </p>
<p data-content-id="-MXP56kd770epxQOG8uB-5txellgOVyQEHhcY6kDg35U9ZDcHDykCX8Bp5fp-Ex7h"> Many times we, the children of God, are not happy. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104103" data-verses="Nehemiah 8:10">Nehemiah 8:10</span> says, “The joy of the Lord is your strength,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104104" data-verses="Proverbs 17:22">Proverbs 17:22</span> says, “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine.” Why is it that often we do not have joy within? The reason we do not have joy is that our heart is not at peace. Instead of peace, there is turmoil. The reason our heart is not tranquil is that we are not living in the divine life. But when we live in the divine life, we are in the truth, the reality. Then we can persuade, conciliate, convince, our heart and cause it to be tranquil. As a result, we shall be happy. </p>
<p data-content-id="pd6Bbt3NPyVE9mcFi0N4Il_DbmqfFobGra2nOdxWav2F9cnrhpnmtJcsShBkzJmAh"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104105" data-verses="1John 3:19">verse 19</span> John inserts the phrase “before Him.” This tells us that the Lord is living with us and in us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="253" id="253">[253]</span> If we do not live by the divine reality, our heart will protest. Then we shall not have a calm heart before Him. We need to remember that the Lord is living in us and that we are living before Him. Only when we live by the divine life can we persuade our heart before Him. The phrase “before Him” points to a crucial matter—that our living as children of God, and also our heart, are before Him. Therefore, we must take care to always have a tranquil heart before Him. </p>

The conscience in our heart is the representative of God’s ruling within us. If our conscience condemns us, surely God, who is greater than His representative and knows all things, will condemn us. The consciousness of such condemnation in our conscience alerts us to the danger of breaking our fellowship with God. If we attend to this, it will be a help to our fellowship with God and will keep us abiding in the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="2xUvRB6bOMVLj3gOpKGd3TJltHOXoYKjJNLyxtwdkTsdeMpDSrbsygsl4I0z0J47y"> By reading the context, we can see that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104107" data-verses="1John 3:20">verse 20</span> the heart actually refers to the conscience. The conscience is one of the four parts of the heart, which is composed of the mind, the emotion, the will (the three parts of the soul), and the conscience, which is part of our spirit. Our heart is influenced, directed, and controlled to a great extent by our conscience. </p>
<p data-content-id="u1sqLDoEOByMLopgbu_aCqIeRZwxFW5k74G9JvNqSDBMoewTPOGPF3BlexAbSZMFU"> When our heart blames us, this means that our conscience condemns us. If we do not live by the divine reality, our conscience will check, blame, and condemn us. As a result, our heart will protest. </p>
<p data-content-id="fX0psknrQuL7J7uZCPBLmWttKYY6iQ0hHDzsYlbALepmSVHxblGdG69ounyizwRB2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104108" data-verses="1John 3:20">verse 20</span> John says that God is greater than our heart; that is, God is greater than our conscience. God has a government, and this government has a local administration within us. This local administration of God’s government is <span class="pg" data-page-id="254" id="254">[254]</span> our conscience. Our conscience, therefore, is the local government of God within us. In a sense, our conscience is both a “law court” and “police station.” Often our conscience “arrests” us. The police station of our conscience, which knows the law very well, may issue an order for our “arrest.” Then the police station knows when to turn us over to the law court. We know from experience that many times we are arrested and taken to the law court, where we are judged and condemned. When this happens, we need the cleansing of the precious blood of Jesus, the Son of God. This indicates that the condemnation of the conscience spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104109" data-verses="1John 3:1">chapter three</span> will take us back to the cleansing mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104110" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="IAEglTO5-PveUJvF1lWxKJmjkYo9j2nNfpgL8X4B-R4Wo2ONs8YiCa3cVul_enZ8w"> If our conscience blames us, arresting us and condemning us, certainly God will also condemn us, for He is greater than our conscience and knows all things. </p>
<p data-content-id="HwMO3cvZ0bsnsA0tpNdFIfujY59kzM4Pm-yVbCByoE_QqtH4WFIgrRpe3y2WqGcVm"> The Epistle of 1 John is not only on the divine fellowship, but is also on the details of this fellowship. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104111" data-verses="1John 3:20">3:20</span> we have one of the details related to the divine fellowship. John’s writing regarding this matter is profound, mysterious, divine, and detailed. In no other portion of the holy Word do we have as many details about the divine fellowship as we have in these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104112" data-verses="1John 3:1">chapter three</span> of 1 John. These verses are crucial to our fellowship with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="XkwcSjgfEhTzaME596SB0SU_1aKhLIUgzYa0NsdWxLYhUHNpANkftayVDpm4bNwhp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104113" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> much is unveiled regarding the fellowship of the divine life. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104114" data-verses="1John 3:1">chapter three</span> this fellowship is viewed from another angle. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104115" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> the angle is that of the divine light shining within us. As a result of this shining, we are exposed and realize that we have sinned. But here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104116" data-verses="1John 3:1">chapter three</span> we have the angle of living by the divine reality. If we do not live by the divine reality, our conscience will protest and condemn us. That condemnation is a sign of God’s condemnation. Therefore, we must do something to conciliate the situation, to calm the turmoil in our heart, to cause our conscience to be at peace with God. In order for our heart to be quiet and calm in this way, we need to live, behave, and act in the divine reality. <span class="pg" data-page-id="255" id="255">[255]</span> </p>

These verses stand as a particular section. Apparently this section has nothing to do with either the preceding section or the following section. As we have seen, the preceding section is concerned with loving the brothers. The following section returns to the matter of loving the brothers. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104150" data-verses="1John 4:1-6">4:1-6</span> stands between two sections concerned with loving the brothers. We may wonder, then, how <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104151" data-verses="1John 4:1-6">4:1-6</span> is related to these sections. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YYSW9aJ5jeMhH9dbudB3sTU1D9sf6ZsU8TfqZNCeO65vJEtxGOnXREYNg7XyrhmAY">THE NEED TO PROVE THE SPIRITS</h2><p data-content-id="EF7a3sguOhC86raGZx1V-FMlKQqmdL7SdtJQgMW9ou8oSN-oxN_jfavqUaejoueIH"> I believe <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104152" data-verses="1John 4:1-6">4:1-6</span> is inserted for at least two reasons. The first reason is related to our need to discern the spirits. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104153" data-verses="1John 3:24">3:24</span> John speaks of the “Spirit whom He gave to us.” Because the Spirit is mentioned here, John goes on to the matter of discerning, proving, trying, the spirits. There is more than one kind of spirit in the universe. Hence, we need John’s warning to prove the spirits. </p>
<p data-content-id="DQtKlqfyuaSTzil_hM3_dwXEG1WD9azYYTXATQgw7W9SDVQS0sPurlamq5vSPMQxU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104154" data-verses="1John 4:1-6">First John 4:1-6</span> is a parenthetical section warning the believers to discern the spirits that they may recognize the false prophets. This warning is related to the mention of the Spirit in the preceding verse, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104155" data-verses="1John 3:24">3:24</span>, the Spirit whereby we know that the Lord abides in us. A similar warning was given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104156" data-verses="1John 2:18-23">2:18-23</span>. The expressions “every spirit” and “the spirits” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104157" data-verses="1John 4:1">4:1</span> refer either to the spirits of the prophets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104158" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:32">1 Cor. 14:32</span>) motivated by the Spirit of truth, or to the spirit of the false prophets actuated by the spirit of deception. Hence, there is the need to discern the spirits by proving <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> them to see whether they have their source out of God. This is the reason John says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104159" data-verses="1John 4:1">verse 1</span>, “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are out of God.” To prove the spirits is to discern them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104160" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:10">1 Cor. 12:10</span>) by putting them on trial. </p>

We should love all men, including our enemies. However, we cannot receive a false prophet or an antichrist. </p>
<p data-content-id="EF7a3sguOhC86raGZx1V-FMlKQqDVL7SdtJQgMW9ou8oSN-oxN_jfavqUaejoueIH"> In the early years of my ministry, we found it necessary to inoculate the saints against modernism. A number of professors and others in the universities had been influenced by modernistic teachings concerning Christ and the Bible. The modernists taught that Christ is not God, that He was an illegitimate son of Mary with Joseph, that He was a great philosopher, and that He died on the cross not for redemption but as a martyr. Furthermore, the modernists did not believe in the Bible. In particular, they did not believe in the miracles recorded in the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="DQtKlqfyuaSTzil_hM3_dwXEG1Wi0azYYTXATQgw7W9SDVQS0sPurlamq5vSPMQxU"> When we stood up to oppose modernism, some friends said to us, “Shouldn’t we love them? Shouldn’t we receive them?” We, however, practiced John’s word in his second Epistle: “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104162" data-verses="2John 1:10">v. 10</span>). To love a person is one thing, but to receive one who is a false prophet or an antichrist is an altogether different thing. </p>
<p data-content-id="SU2ZTjy5OGYluzV9gZc6I5uuT2_GieN-7xCAqf5pl981Y-SstP2uc3Ykx4Zp396M1"> John realized that it was necessary for him, when speaking about loving the brothers, to say a word regarding false prophets and antichrists. We must prove the spirits and stay away from the false prophets.

But here the false prophets are the antichrists (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104165" data-verses="1John 4:3">v. 3</span>), those who teach heretically concerning the Person of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104166" data-verses="1John 2:18">2:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104167" data-verses="1John 2:22-23">22-23</span>). The “world” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104168" data-verses="1John 4:1">4:1</span> does not refer to the universe or to the earth; rather, it refers to the people, to human society on earth, who are the components of the satanic world system. </p>

Every such spirit surely has its source in God; it is out of God. In this we know the Spirit of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nbi_A5eQg6SlJktY-vN2BcSnkoicFqksuYnlCEy9tjYn6kA_SaakUiNPjLTZQtyW6"> Jesus was conceived of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104170" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matt. 1:18</span>).

In this Epistle, to be led astray is to be led away from the reality of the Person of Christ, from the reality that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104175" data-verses="Matthew 24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>, a false Christ is one who pretends to be Christ in order to lead people astray. <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> </p>

For false Christs and false prophets shall arise and shall show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.” These verses indicate that it is possible for even the chosen people of God to be deceived and led astray. Due to the Lord’s word concerning false Christs and false prophets, there was the teaching among the believers in the early days that false Christs and false prophets would rise up. </p>
<p data-content-id="V9xS8M6rjjN-0lZsHbq91AHT-KAU36Y9a5uiZMINou19YlFe7mjWMSjjqQ7FY9LXk"> In 1 John there are three verses concerning the antichrist. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104177" data-verses="1John 2:18">2:18</span> John says, “Young children, it is the last hour, and even as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come; whereby we know that it is the last hour.” Notice that in this verse the definite article is not used before “antichrist.” John simply says that the believers heard that antichrist is coming and then goes on to say that many antichrists have come. </p>

This is the antichrist, who is denying the Father and the Son.” The word “liar” indicates a false prophet. The liar, the false prophet, who denies that Jesus is the Christ, is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104217" data-verses="1John 2:18">2:18</span> he says that many antichrists have come; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104218" data-verses="1John 2:22">2:22</span>, that the antichrist, the liar, is one who denies the Father and the Son; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104219" data-verses="1John 4:3">4:3</span>, that the spirit of the antichrist does not confess Jesus; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104220" data-verses="2John 1:7">2 John 7</span>, that the deceivers who have gone out into the world are antichrists. In these four verses we can see that there is a principle of antichrist. </p>
<p data-content-id="hwNB5H1_KK9Ks6g0ACxK6_jJQi8m5f3etOZrhIrnwoZm3HPKYIheMIJchivbQyuv_"> What is an antichrist in principle? In order to answer this question, let us consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104221" data-verses="1John 2:18">2:18</span>, “Young children, it is the last hour, and even as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come; whereby we know that it is the last hour.” This verse implies a principle. Anyone who practices this principle is in the category of antichrist. </p>
<p data-content-id="U9rXToUa2KRqaPsc9SEiBr8bFKyUG87wInxLKr_QDrvEc9ggHlOE4lgHHPstsNJX4"> During the time of the apostles, there was much talk about the coming antichrist. John refers to this when he tells those who received this Epistle that they “heard that antichrist is coming.” Then he immediately goes on to say that many antichrists have come. The fact that there have been many antichrists implies a principle, the principle of antichrist. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Macv1r_Zlb7xB4WAvXY0AXOwHwP1i3SGhukFHUTAtli4bCL-SkoqeKAnfuib3gJ20">DENYING WHAT CHRIST IS</h2><p data-content-id="V9xS8M6rjjN-0lZsHbq91AHT_KA5-6Y9a5uiZMINou19YlFe7mjWMSjjqQ7FY9LXk"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104222" data-verses="1John 2:22">2:22</span> we can see more clearly what the principle of antichrist is: “Who is the liar if not he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, who is denying the Father and the Son.” I would call your attention to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="272" id="272">[272]</span> word “denying” used twice in this verse. This verse speaks of denying that Jesus is the Christ and also of denying the Father and the Son. Here we have the principle of antichrist. The principle of antichrist is to deny what Christ is. What principle must one follow in order to be an antichrist? He must follow the principle of denying what Christ is. Jesus is the Christ, Christ is the Son of God, and the Son of God is the embodiment of the Father. To deny any aspect of this truth is to deny something of what Christ is and thereby to follow the principle of antichrist. </p>
<p data-content-id="u1sqLDoEOByMLopgbu_aCqIaZZwxNW5k74G9JvNqSDBMoewTPOGPF3BlexAbSZMFU"> The principle of antichrist is to deny something of Christ’s Person. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104223" data-verses="1John 2:22">2:22</span>, the antichrist denies that Jesus is the Christ. As we have seen, this was the heresy of Cerinthus, who separated the earthly man Jesus from the heavenly Christ. (He considered Jesus the son of Joseph and Mary.) Cerinthus also taught that after Jesus was baptized, Christ as a dove descended upon Him, but left Jesus at the end of His ministry so that Jesus suffered on the cross and rose from the dead, while Christ remained separated as a spiritual being. Cerinthus, therefore, denied that Jesus is the Christ. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104224" data-verses="1John 2:22">verse 22</span> indicates, this is also to deny the Father and the Son. When the two sentences in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104225" data-verses="1John 2:22">verse 22</span> are put together, we can see clearly that to deny Christ is to deny the Father and the Son. Because Cerinthus denied that Jesus is the Christ and thereby denied the Father and the Son, he was an antichrist. This is an illustration of the principle of antichrist. What makes a person an antichrist, at least in principle, is that he denies some aspect of what Christ is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fX0psknrQuL7J7uZCPBLmWtpCYY6qQ0hHDzsYlbALepmSVHxblGdG69ounyizwRB2">AGAINST CHRIST AND REPLACING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="IAEglTO5-PveUJvF1lWxKJmnsYoxh2nNfpgL8X4B-R4Wo2ONs8YiCa3cVul_enZ8w"> The Greek prefix <em>anti</em> has two main meanings. First, it means against; second, it means in place of, or instead of. This indicates that an antichrist is against Christ and also replaces Christ with something else. To be an antichrist is, on the one hand, to be against Christ; on the other hand, it is also to have something instead of Christ, something that replaces Christ. By this we see that the principle of <span class="pg" data-page-id="273" id="273">[273]</span> antichrist involves denying what Christ is. This is to be anti-Christ, against Christ. Of course, whenever someone denies what Christ is, automatically that person will replace Christ with something else. Hence, an antichrist is both against Christ and is one who replaces Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="HwMO3cvZ0bsnsA0tpNdFIfunQ59oxM4Pm-yVbCByoE_QqtH4WFIgrRpe3y2WqGcVm"> We may use the modernists as an illustration of denying Christ and replacing Christ. Modernists deny that Christ is the Redeemer. They do not believe that Christ died on the cross for our sins. Instead, they claim that Christ was persecuted for His teachings and was put to death because of His teachings and died on the cross as a martyr. It is clear that modernists deny that Christ is the Redeemer who died on the cross for our sins. First, they deny this aspect of Christ’s Person. Then they go on to replace the Redeemer with a martyr. In this way, they have a martyr in place of the Redeemer. This is to have something instead of Christ as the result of denying what Christ is. </p>
<p data-content-id="XkwcSjgfEhTzaME596SB0SU79aKtNIUgzYa0NsdWxLYhUHNpANkftayVDpm4bNwhp"> We must be careful never to deny anything of what Christ is. We should never deny any part, any aspect, or any item of Christ’s Person. To deny any aspect of Christ’s Person is to practice the principle of antichrist. Some who hear this may say, “I certainly am not an antichrist, for I am not against Christ.” One may not be against Christ or deny Christ consciously. But unconsciously we may deny some aspect of Christ’s Person and then replace this aspect with something else. </p>

Here we see that the Son is called the <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> eternal Father. These verses reveal that Christ is the Spirit and also the eternal Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="ztWqoed01v1IAPVjcjzQHIvwhpIq8AC9ZdsgqX-h9OsWPZeIXDKZl3JMjwTALCxAg"> Several years ago some opposing ones held a meeting to discuss how to deal with our so-called heretical teaching concerning the Triune God. In that meeting the following remarks were made: “<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104229" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>: For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. There Jesus is called the Father. Right? So He’s the Father. That’s what it says. That’s <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104230" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>. Now we don’t normally say this because tradition is involved here.” These critics admitted that, because of their tradition, they normally do not say that Christ is the Father. I am glad that in the midst of the opposers’ criticism there was an honest word admitting that according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104231" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>, Jesus is the Father, even though they do not normally say this because it involves the matter of tradition. By this we can see that regarding this matter they care more for tradition than for what the divine revelation actually says. However, we follow the pure Word of God. According to the Scriptures, the Son is called the eternal Father, and Christ the Lord is the Spirit who gives life. </p>
<p data-content-id="aJigmhkHMCsaQv4-H_CrsJOIU6CaGXMHKH2uXmTRIedacoVBVBjciQiomTqjw4x7m"> It was in 1933 that I first began to realize that Christ is the Spirit. For more than seven years I had been under the teaching of the Brethren. They taught that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three separate Persons. This teaching that I inherited from the Brethren no doubt corresponds to common traditional teaching. I came into the church life in 1932, and I went to Shanghai to be with Brother Nee in 1933. One day the church in Shanghai invited an itinerant Chinese preacher, who was working with the China Inland Mission, to speak in one of the meetings. In his message he strongly emphasized the point that we should not think that the Lord Jesus is separate from the Spirit. Instead, Christ and the Spirit are one. To this, Brother Nee, who was sitting at the back of the meeting hall, said a loud “Amen.” Brother Nee’s response surprised me. <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> After the meeting Brother Nee and I talked about the message. In that conversation Brother Nee said to me, “Witness, we all must know that Christ is the Spirit, and this must be our message.” Then I began to study this matter carefully. The more I studied the Word, the more convinced I became that today Christ and the Spirit are one. </p>

Concerning this, we stand on the shoulders of the great teachers of the Bible who have gone before us. We have learned much from the experiences of others. We have studied church history, biographies, and the most important writings of the great teachers from the early centuries until the present. All this has been very helpful to us. Of course, we have also studied the Bible for ourselves. Therefore, we surely know where we are, and we have the assurance regarding the accuracy of whatever the Lord has led us to say in the ministry. </p>

This is God’s intention. In order for God to accomplish this intention, it is necessary for Him to be triune. Apart from being triune, that is, without being the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, God would not have a way to work Himself into us. In order to work Himself into us, God must first impart Himself to us, dispense Himself into us. If He could not do this, He could not work Himself into us to be our life. It would be impossible for the Triune God to be our life if He remained merely as the One outside of us in whom we believe, whom we worship, and for whom we work. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="280" id="280">[280]</span> order for God to be our life, He must dispense Himself into us, and in order for this dispensing to be carried out, God must be the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sjvsbLXC95jIofUewvvl31xzjduTjXeOu5KohfFvOD1aP_kOrsv_S-UDyFM05oP1A">THE SON COMING IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER<br/>AND WITH THE FATHER</h2><p data-content-id="wdPoXce5OP5p8XuT7-mS2kx-OUmKLX_iTvR-wsSKM3NrgmMOCGW2l-v1Di4D08766"> God created man in His own image for the purpose of dispensing Himself into man so that man may become His expression. God’s purpose in creating man was that man would be His container enjoying Him as life in order to express Him. Man, however, became fallen. After man fell, God Himself became a man. It was God the Son, not God the Father or God the Spirit, who became a man. Nevertheless, the Son came in the name of the Father and with the Father. Many Christians emphasize only that the Son came and neglect the fact that the Son came in the name of the Father and with the Father. Some theologians have even said that when the Son of God came, the Father was left in the heavens. In contrast to this natural, human concept, the New Testament reveals that when the Son came, He never left the Father. The Lord Jesus said clearly that He was not alone, for the Father was with Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104241" data-verses="John 8:29">John 8:29</span> He said, “He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104242" data-verses="John 16:32">John 16:32</span> the Lord said, “Behold, an hour is coming and has come, when you shall be scattered each to his own, and shall leave Me alone; and I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.” During His life on earth, the Father was with Him. Hence, when the Son came to be a man, He lived as a man in the name of the Father and with the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nbi_A5eQg6SlJktY-vN2BcSnmoicNqksuYnlCEy9tjYn6kA_SaakUiNPjLTZQtyW6"> The Lord Jesus even said that, while He was on earth as a man, He was in the Father and the Father was in Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104243" data-verses="John 10:38">John 10:38</span> He said, “Though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me and I in the Father.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104244" data-verses="John 14:10-11">John 14:10 and 11</span> He said, in response to Philip’s request that He show them the Father, “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, <span class="pg" data-page-id="281" id="281">[281]</span> He does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.” This is a matter not only of the coexistence of the Father and the Son, but also of the coinherence of the Father and the Son. This means that the Father and the Son exist in each other. Therefore, the Father and the Son coexist in the way of coinherence. Because the Son came with the Father and in the name of the Father and because He coexists in the way of co-inherence with the Father, He is called the eternal Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104245" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isa. 9:6</span>). We cannot analyze this or systematize it. Instead of trying to analyze or systematize the Triune God, we should simply accept the facts as revealed in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="tDWlQSHUBHZ5qBD93IBcPfrKYaUqW26HA_scGJKr-ItE3c3VnQo-6LLTQLhXhN2yD"> Have you ever heard that when the Son came, He came in the name of the Father and with the Father? As we have said already, some Christians have the impression that when the Son of God came, He came by Himself, leaving the Father on the throne. These Christians have not been taught according to the Scriptures that when the Son of God came as a man, He came with the Father. The Father was in Him, and He was in the Father. This was the reason He could say that He was never alone, for the Father was with Him, even at the time of His persecution. As we have pointed out from the Gospel of John, the Father was with the Son in the way of coinherence. </p>
<p data-content-id="hwNB5H1_KK9Ks6g0ACxK6_jJTi87xf3etOZrhIrnwoZm3HPKYIheMIJchivbQyuv_"> Those under the influence of traditional theology may still think that when the Son of God came, He left the Father on the throne. According to this concept, while the Son was living in Nazareth and while He was carrying out His ministry, the Father was on the throne in the heavens watching Him. What is revealed concerning the Father and the Son in the Gospel of John is very different. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104246" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” By this we see not only that Christ, the Word, was with God, but that He is God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104247" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, the Word became flesh; that is, Christ became a man, God incarnate. In His teaching and preaching the Lord affirmed that He came in the name of the Father and with the Father. He also told both the Jewish religionists and His <span class="pg" data-page-id="282" id="282">[282]</span> disciples that He was not alone, for the Father was always with Him. Furthermore, He revealed to His disciples that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him. Therefore, it is altogether inaccurate to say that when the Son came, He left the Father on the throne. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="U9rXToUa2KRqaPsc9SEiBr8bGKyNP87wInxLKr_QDrvEc9ggHlOE4lgHHPstsNJX4">A REVELATION OF THE SON WITH THE FATHER</h2><p data-content-id="Macv1r_Zlb7xB4WAvXY0AXOwEwPQs3SGhukFHUTAtli4bCL-SkoqeKAnfuib3gJ20"> When the Son was on earth, He lived in the Father, and the Father lived in Him. The Son never spoke His own word; He spoke the Father’s word. The Son never did His own work; He did the Father’s work. The Son never sought His own glory; He sought the Father’s glory. What we have in the Gospel of John, therefore, is a revelation of the Son with the Father. Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104248" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> says that the Son given to us is called the eternal Father. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104249" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. Yes, God gave His Son to us; yet the name of His Son is called the eternal Father! Some have tried to explain <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104250" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> by saying that the Son is only called the Father but actually is not the Father. How ridiculous! The Son came with the Father and in the name of the Father; He also lived in the Father, and the Father lived in Him. Here we have both the Son and the Father, for we have the Son with the Father. Of course, there is still a distinction between the Son and the Father. But although there is a distinction between the Son and the Father, the Gospel of John clearly reveals that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son. This is the reason the Son could say, “I and the Father are one” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104251" data-verses="John 10:30">John 10:30</span>). </p>

Every prophet, whether a real prophet or a false one, has his own spirit. When a real prophet speaks, with his spirit there is the motivating of the Spirit of God. But when a false prophet speaks, his spirit is activated by another spirit, by a spirit of deception.

With every kind of speaking, every kind of teaching, the spirit of the speaker either is motivated by the Spirit of God or is actuated by a spirit of deception.

Because the spirit of a genuine prophet is motivated by the Holy Spirit of truth, this spirit will confess the divine conception of Jesus and affirm that He was born as the Son of God. Every such spirit is surely out of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFcHJ5u15ZxAiYHSZvY58HSPc5NMrPM1VUsm4k6TsFJaq-O4SNDd4YeiVXmP28L7D"> The word “flesh” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104276" data-verses="1John 4:2">4:2</span> is very important. As human beings, we were all born of flesh to be flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104277" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6a</span>). Thus every human being is flesh. To confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104278" data-verses="Luke 1:31-35">Luke 1:31-35</span>). This is marvelous! Christ is God incarnate to become a man through holy conception. He did not have a human father, for He was conceived of the Holy Spirit. His conception is holy because it was carried out by the Holy Spirit. Although He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, this conception took place in the womb of a virgin. Therefore, He, the very God, became a man in the flesh. Contrary to the false teaching of the Docetists, His body was not a phantasm. Rather, He had a real body, a physical body that was solid in its substance. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit; He became flesh and was born of the virgin Mary. Because He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception. </p>
<p data-content-id="yKKB9eDIFrgaTLK1MK46XTTHa3oUY9RUpYq8CgQ0-IcLwk2G0bP3UGZmH5RVKsBFj"> Anyone who denies that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh denies that He was conceived of the Holy Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="291" id="291">[291]</span> Furthermore, anyone who rejects Jesus Christ coming in the flesh rejects His humanity and His human living. Such a one also rejects Christ’s redemption. If Christ had not become a genuine man, He could not have had human blood to shed for the redemption of human beings. If He had not become flesh through the conception of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin Mary, He never could have been our Substitute to be crucified to bear our judgment before God. Therefore, to deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is to deny His holy conception, His incarnation, His birth, His humanity, His human living, and also His redemption. The New Testament makes it emphatically clear that Christ’s redemption was accomplished in His human body and by the shedding of His blood. </p>

<p data-content-id="0VQVWgS1ukzdV03AKaCp4HugTlAi_kHBNfhQyBRelJH5iijKgOT9M3ceK9_iYN0up"> Denying that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is a great heresy. This heretical teaching makes it impossible to have the enjoyment of the Trinity. According to the revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament, the Son came in the flesh with the Father and in the name of the Father. The Son was crucified, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we have the Spirit as the reality of the Son with the Father. This includes incarnation, human living, redemption by the shedding of human blood, death in a human body, burial, and resurrection. All these are components, constituents, of our enjoyment of the Triune God. If anyone denies Christ’s incarnation, that one denies Christ’s holy birth, humanity, human living, redemption through crucifixion, and resurrection. This utterly annuls the enjoyment of the genuine Trinity. Knowing the seriousness of this matter, John included <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104279" data-verses="1John 4:1-6">4:1-6</span> in his Epistle as a warning to the believers concerning the need to prove the spirits. </p>

This Epistle first says that God is light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104330" data-verses="1John 1:5">1:5</span>), and then that God is love. Love as the nature of God’s essence is the source of grace, and light as the nature of God’s expression is the source of truth. When the divine love appears to us it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines upon us <span class="pg" data-page-id="301" id="301">[301]</span> it becomes truth. Both of these were manifested in this way in John’s Gospel. We received both grace and truth there through the manifestation of the Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104331" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104332" data-verses="John 1:16-17">16-17</span>). Now in his Epistle we come in the Son to the Father and touch the sources of both grace and truth. These sources, love and light, are God the Father Himself for our deeper and finer enjoyment in the fellowship of the divine life with the Father in the Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104333" data-verses="1John 1:3-7">1:3-7</span>) by our abiding in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104334" data-verses="1John 2:5">2:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104335" data-verses="1John 2:27-28">27-28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104336" data-verses="1John 3:6">3:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104337" data-verses="1John 3:24">24</span>). </p>

In His nature God is Spirit, love, and light. Spirit denotes the nature of God’s Person; love, the nature of God’s essence; and light, the nature of God’s expression. Both love and light are related to God as life, which life is of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104340" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>). God, Spirit, and life are actually one. God is Spirit, and Spirit is life. Within this life are love and light. We have seen that when the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth. The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord Jesus has brought grace and truth to us so that we may have the divine life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104341" data-verses="John 3:14-16">John 3:14-16</span>). The Epistle of 1 John reveals that the fellowship of the divine life brings us to the sources of grace and truth, which are the divine love and the divine light. In John’s Gospel it was God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth that we may become His children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104342" data-verses="John 1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span>); in his Epistle it is we the children, in the fellowship of the Father’s life, coming to the Father to participate in His love and light. This is further and deeper in the experience of the divine life. After receiving the divine life in John’s Gospel by believing in the Son, we should go on to enjoy this life in his Epistle through the fellowship of this life. </p>

<p data-content-id="C5iZHjQEESBTbUVTrqRwpnl_oeY9p2NAir21H0caRx3O1t-5AgiFhkPSjvArHBZnX"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104349" data-verses="1John 4:9">verse 9</span> John tells us that God sent His Son into the world that we might live through Him. We, the fallen people, are not only sinful in nature and conduct (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104350" data-verses="Romans 7:17-18">Rom. 7:17-18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104351" data-verses="Romans 1:28-32">1:28-32</span>), but also dead in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104352" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Eph. 2:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104353" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5">5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104354" data-verses="Colossians 2:13">Col. 2:13</span>).

In the love of God, the Son of God saves us not only from our sins by His blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104356" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">Eph. 1:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104357" data-verses="Revelation 1:5">Rev. 1:5</span>), but also from our death by His life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104358" data-verses="1John 3:14-15">1 John 3:14-15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104359" data-verses="John 5:24">John 5:24</span>). He is not only the Lamb of God who takes away our sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104360" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>); He is also the Son of God who gives us eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104361" data-verses="John 3:36">John 3:36</span>). He died for our sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104362" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:3">1 Cor. 15:3</span>) that we might have eternal life in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104363" data-verses="John 3:14-16">John 3:14-16</span>) and live through Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104364" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104365" data-verses="John 14:19">14:19</span>).

God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.” Here John says that we have known and believed the love which God has in us. This love is God’s love in sending the Son to be our Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104406" data-verses="1John 4:14">4:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="xmPKprsOh6TbK1SQkcaQRS0OTdEGsfObuTtFPjUunAX7RJ4fk17RRsdIbNYAdu7wg"> It is significant that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104407" data-verses="1John 4:16">4:16</span> John puts the word “known” before “believed.” As we pointed out in the foregoing message, this knowing involves experience and enjoyment. The fact that according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104408" data-verses="1John 4:16">4:16</span> we know and then believe indicates that first we experience and enjoy, and then we believe. However, our concept may be that first we believe, and then experience. However, if we do not have much experience and enjoyment of God’s love, we shall not be able to believe this love very much. But after we enjoy it and experience it, we surely believe the love which God has in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="B2_T8YLhauK6u6VpNIfepJFNirLaG8nmEKoh3_bnjebpEuWtQKKBduV2zG6x7fpJd"> The words “in us” mean in our case, or in regard to us. Therefore, we have known and believed the love which God has in regard to us. </p>

To abide in love is to live a life that loves others habitually with the love which is God Himself so that He may be expressed in us. To abide in God is to live a life which is God Himself as our inward content and outward expression so that we may be absolutely one with Him. God abides in us to be our life inwardly and our living outwardly. Thus, He may be one with us in a practical way. </p>
<p data-content-id="QXYDaOWJRqFN-OMexzzkkKKcoM2yi63I9JQNIAZfmtTqzxZboroT0AfiWGha8DsoE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104413" data-verses="1John 4:16">4:16</span> we see that there is an organic union between us and God. This organic union is indicated by the word “in.” It is interesting that John does not say that God is love and that he who abides in God abides in love. Instead, he says that he who abides in love abides in God. To us, the former may seem more logical. But the latter is more practical and real. To say that we abide in God when we abide in love means that the very love in which we abide is God Himself. This indicates that the love that we have toward others should be God Himself. If we abide in the love which is God Himself, we then abide in God, and God abides in us. </p>

<p data-content-id="Oq5yNluxOcFZ42LxIZQlgbnn8FHaLzmZVFp5SEX7nUut1FCw3vLXkTJ1zg_T79f2J"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104417" data-verses="1John 4:17">verse 17</span> John speaks of the love of God being perfected with us. The word “perfected” is a translation of the Greek word <em>teleioo,</em> to complete, to accomplish, to finish. The love of God itself is perfect and complete in Himself, but it still needs to be perfected in us. In order for God’s love to be perfected in us, we need to experience this love. In our experience the love of God is perfected. </p>
<p data-content-id="40zTT6CnkXFE1ethYd3Z1sUB3Yngh0t02z2WS_Ixj97w5y9s3Im7mWIGyNgcYDBuM"> John says that if the love of God is perfected in us, we may have boldness in the day of judgment. The Greek word <span class="pg" data-page-id="311" id="311">[311]</span> for “boldness” is <em>parresia,</em> meaning boldness of speech, confidence. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104418" data-verses="1John 3:21">3:21</span> boldness is for us to contact God in fellowship with Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104419" data-verses="1John 4:17">4:17</span> the boldness is for us to face the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104420" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:10">2 Cor. 5:10</span>) at His coming back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104421" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:13">1 Cor. 3:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104422" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:5">4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104423" data-verses="2Timothy 4:8">2 Tim. 4:8</span>). The judgment at the judgment seat of Christ will not be for eternal perdition or eternal salvation, but rather will be for reward or punishment. If we love the brothers with God as love, we shall have boldness in the day when Christ judges His believers at His judgment seat. </p>
<p data-content-id="obx1QC4qWRaRyglw7DiaTeVbKZb9Usvzx7mNj8ptpL1L6KbH0JCWnp6xslWl3O42-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104424" data-verses="1John 4:17">4:17</span> John indicates that “as that One is, so also are we in this world.” As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104425" data-verses="1John 3:3">3:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104426" data-verses="1John 3:7">7</span>, “that One” refers to Christ. He lived in this world a life of God as love, and now He is our life so that we may live the same life of love in this world and be the same as He is now. </p>
<p data-content-id="3cAlbijZNhlV_hAvtYdsNrAuMbkEm7grYqDWh68tmkbEmI6H_32LcZWCR0bDu1IHg"> As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104427" data-verses="1John 4:1">4:1</span>, “world” does not refer to the universe or the earth, but to human society on the earth, to the people, who are the components of the satanic world system. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="G_9-Q9Kx7jTyJPf5bMBmFMZIH1QxSxOsS6IZxG_iG9FH354LXn99uUrfdzvYAgX5S">NO FEAR IN LOVE</h2><p data-content-id="cYRJL3FyGiMJce37YiEtczjK4kpKl0fwB9b9ww7NXYMyyjzFozblW026JUBxBIAeZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104428" data-verses="1John 4:18">verse 18</span> John goes on to say, “There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment, and he who fears has not been perfected in love.” A literal translation of the first part of this verse would be, “Fear is not in the love.” “Fear” does not refer to the fear of offending God and being judged by Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104429" data-verses="1Peter 1:17">1 Pet. 1:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104430" data-verses="Hebrews 12:28">Heb. 12:28</span>), but to the fear that we <em>have</em> offended God and will be judged by Him. “Love” refers to the perfected love mentioned in the preceding verse, the love of God with which we love others. Perfect love is the love that has been perfected in us by our loving others with the love of God. Such love casts out fear and causes us to have no fear of being punished by the Lord at His coming back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104431" data-verses="Luke 12:46-47">Luke 12:46-47</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="YYSW9aJ5jeMhH9dbudB3sTU1G9sKzZsU8TfqZNCeO65vJEtxGOnXREYNg7XyrhmAY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104432" data-verses="1John 4:18">4:18</span> John tells us that he who fears has not been perfected in love. This means that the one who fears has not lived in the love of God so that it could be perfectly manifested in him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="312" id="312">[312]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="EF7a3sguOhC86raGZx1V-FMlPQqPTL7SdtJQgMW9ou8oSN-oxN_jfavqUaejoueIH"> First, John says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104433" data-verses="1John 4:12">4:12</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104434" data-verses="1John 4:17">17</span> that God’s love needs to be perfected in us. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104435" data-verses="1John 4:18">4:18</span> he speaks of being perfected in love. This indicates that we and the divine love are mingled. When love is perfected in us, we are perfected in love, for we become the love, and the love becomes us. </p>

When we abide in the Lord, we abide both in the divine love and in the divine light. We do not hate the brothers but love them habitually, living the divine life in the divine light and the divine love. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPZwIBWVLNzIUHN7kStCQ650n3Phpl4Kl8HEES34jsiFdri3coL8reMmqLT40dAx6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104440" data-verses="1John 4:21">4:21</span> John says, “And this commandment we have from Him, that he who loves God love his brother also.” The commandment here is the commandment of brotherly love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104441" data-verses="1John 2:7-11">2:7-11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104442" data-verses="John 13:34">John 13:34</span>). It is possible to summarize John’s writing here in a simple way: God is love, and if we abide in Him, we shall love the brothers with Him as our love. This is John’s basic thought in these verses. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="esfeiNy8Uz9z4fV2253GbYialOccHrt10fnFjXQ4cXutCvU9X9mLb6ExfVEmS9hEo">A TRIANGULAR LOVE</h2><p data-content-id="5oJ7E4NV8cg2Yd2SYmBplM57JmY00Fv57O7xQnk2dJuK29gNm3Iwqy1BnGZGG7QkU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104443" data-verses="1John 5:1">5:1</span> John goes on to say, “Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God, and everyone who loves Him who begets, loves him who has been begotten of Him.” The Gnostics and Cerinthians did not believe in the identity of Jesus and the Christ. Hence, they were not the children of God, begotten of God. But whoever believes that the Man Jesus is the Christ, God incarnate, (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104444" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104445" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104446" data-verses="John 20:31">20:31</span>), has been begotten of God and has become a child of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104447" data-verses="John 1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span>). Such a one loves God the Father who has begotten him and also loves the brother who has been <span class="pg" data-page-id="313" id="313">[313]</span> begotten of the same Father. This explains, confirms, and strengthens the word in the preceding verses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104448" data-verses="1John 4:20-21">1 John 4:20-21</span>). </p>

This means that the divine life has been imparted or infused into our spirit. However, our body has not been regenerated, and our soul still remains without the life of God. For this reason, once we have been regenerated in our spirit, we should dwell in the divine life so that it may have free course to spread into our soul. The spreading of the divine life from our regenerated spirit into our soul produces a metabolic change in our being, a change which is called transformation in the New Testament. By this we see that after regeneration in our spirit, we need the divine life to saturate our soul in order to cause the transformation of our inner being, the metabolic change of our soul. Eventually, the time will come when our body will be transfigured by the power of the divine life into a glorious body. </p>

In God’s salvation there are three steps: regeneration, transformation, and transfiguration. Regeneration took place in our spirit when we believed in the Lord Jesus. Now if we abide in the fellowship of the divine life, this will open the way for the divine life to spread into our soul and to transform the parts of our inward being. When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will transfigure our bodies. Then we shall be fully in the divine life and in the divine glory. </p>

All believers have experienced regeneration, the initial step of God’s salvation. Through regeneration, the divine birth, we received the divine life, the eternal life, which is in the Son.

We have seen that “everything” points to the human spirit. Therefore, it is the regenerated human spirit that overcomes the world. Regarding overcoming the world, we should not trust in our own ability or effort. From experience I can testify that we need to trust our spirit. Our spirit is well able to overcome Satan and the world, the evil system. But in ourselves we cannot overcome the world. When we exercise our spirit, stay in our spirit, and walk by our spirit, we shall see that our spirit has the life ability to overcome all negative things. This is why we need to exercise our spirit to have fellowship with the Lord and pray concerning the enjoyment of the Lord. We also need to exercise our spirit to call on the Lord’s name and to pray-read the Word. This exercise stirs up the ability in our spirit to overcome the world. </p>

Our faith brings us into an organic union, and it is this organic union, not the faith directly, that overcomes the world. We may use switching on electrical current as an illustration. The act of switching on is not the power itself. It is the means by which appliances are brought into union with electricity. In a similar way, we may say that faith is the means for us to “switch on” to the Triune God. By believing in the Lord Jesus, we are brought into organic union with the Triune God; we “switch on” to Him. This union, produced by faith, then overcomes the world. </p>

The first seven verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104570" data-verses="1John 1:1">chapter one</span> indicate that we have received eternal life, and out of this eternal life we have fellowship with the apostles and also with the Father and the Son.

Based upon the fact that we have received eternal life through the divine birth by believing in the Son of God, we can pray, in the fellowship of eternal life, by contacting God, in the boldness of a conscience void of offense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104583" data-verses="Acts 24:16">Acts 24:16</span>), according to His will, with the assurance that He will hear us. </p>

But how can we know that the thing we are asking is according to His will? A person who asks according to God’s will is one who has been regenerated, who has the divine life, and who is in the fellowship of the divine life. As we saw in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104584" data-verses="1John 3:1">chapter three</span>, such a person will have a conscience void of offense. This means that his heart does not blame him, for while he is in the fellowship of the divine life, he has a conscience without offense. As long as we abide in the fellowship of the divine life, our conscience will surely be without offense. Then we shall be able to pray, to ask, according to God’s will. By this we see that a person who prays in the fellowship of the divine life is truly one with the Lord. It is in this way that we know God’s will: by being one with Him, by abiding in Him, and by remaining in the fellowship of the divine life. </p>

There is sin unto death; I do not say that he should make request concerning that.” Literally, the Greek word rendered “unto” in this verse means toward. Here John is saying that if anyone sees his brother, someone close to him in the Lord, sinning a sin not unto death, he should ask concerning that one. The word “ask” here must refer to a prayer made when we are abiding in fellowship with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="hwNB5H1_KK9Ks6g0ACxK6_jJWi833f3etOZrhIrnwoZm3HPKYIheMIJchivbQyuv_"> No doubt, “he shall ask” refers to the one who sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death. But to whom does “he will give life” refer? There is a problem with the second “he” in this verse. Some translations capitalize the second “he” and thereby make it refer to the Lord. Actually, in both cases “he” refers to the same person, that is, to the one who sees his brother sinning and who asks concerning him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="331" id="331">[331]</span> </p>

There is sin unto death; I do not say that he should make request concerning that. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death.” These verses indicate that if we see a brother sinning a sin not unto death, we should ask concerning that one and give life to him. But how can we know if a particular sin is unto death? Suppose a brother has sinned and also has become ill. If we do not know whether or not this sin is unto death, how shall we be able to make request concerning the situation? </p>

In the fellowship of the divine life there is the governmental dealing of God according to the spiritual condition of each of His children. In God’s governmental dealing, some of His children may be destined to physical death in this age due to a certain sin, and others may be destined to physical death due to other sins. Whether a sin is unto death or not depends on God’s judgment according to each one’s position and condition in the house of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="336" id="336">[336]</span> </p>

In order to have this kind of discernment, we need to be a person who is absolutely one with the Lord. Actually, only the Lord Himself knows whether a certain sin is unto death. Therefore, if we are not one with the Lord, we cannot know whether or not a brother has sinned unto death. However, if we are deeply one with the Lord, if we abide in the Lord, and if we are one spirit with Him, spontaneously we shall know whether or not a particular sin is unto death. There will be no need for us to try to know this matter. </p>

Consider the case of Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104615" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span>. Moses was provoked, and as a result he did something that was not according to God’s will: he struck the rock a second time. Striking the rock twice was against God’s basic principle. The rock typifies Christ, and God had no intention for Christ to be smitten twice. The first time Moses struck the rock according to God’s word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104616" data-verses="Exodus 17:1-6">Exo. 17:1-6</span>). But the second time that Moses struck the rock was not according to God’s word. God told Moses to speak to the rock. But, being provoked, Moses struck it a second time. Due to that mistake, Moses, although he was so close to God, was not allowed to enter into the good land: “And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104617" data-verses="Numbers 20:12">Num. 20:12</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104618" data-verses="Deuteronomy 32:48-52">Deuteronomy 32:48-52</span>, the Lord told Moses to go up to the mountain and die because he and Aaron had trespassed against the Lord “among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104619" data-verses="Deuteronomy 32:51">v. 51</span>). We may think that Moses made only a small mistake. But according to God’s governmental dealing, <span class="pg" data-page-id="337" id="337">[337]</span> it was a sin unto death. The case of Moses illustrates the fact that in ourselves we are not qualified or able to discern what kind of sin is unto death. We can have such discernment only when we are absolutely one with the Lord. </p>

In this verse the one who asks is also the one who gives life to the sinning brother. This indicates that the one who asks will give life to the one concerning whom he asks. The asker, who is abiding in the Lord, who is one with the Lord, and who is asking in one spirit with the Lord, becomes the means through which God’s life-giving Spirit can give life to the one for whom he asks.

If you have a brother close to you in this way and do not know whether this brother will die <span class="pg" data-page-id="338" id="338">[338]</span> because of his sin, then you are not deep in the Lord. If you are truly deep in the Lord and are one with Him, as you consider the brother’s situation, you will enter into the Lord’s heart and know His will. You will know whether this brother, who is so intimate to you, will die because of his sin. Then you will know how to pray for him. You will know whether or not to pray for him to be forgiven and healed. If this brother’s sin is unto death, you will realize that you should not pray to impart life into him.

On the one hand, we can enjoy this eternal life within us. On the other hand, we can pass on this eternal life to others. We can be a channel for eternal life to flow out from us, or through us, to others. However, the experience of being a channel for eternal life to flow out to others is a deep matter. This cannot be done in a superficial way. If we would be a channel for eternal life to flow out to others, we must be deep in the Lord, and we must know the Lord’s heart by being in His heart. If we have entered into the Lord to such a degree, spontaneously we shall know the Lord’s will concerning a brother close to us who has sinned.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104639" data-verses="1John 5:14-17">5:14-17</span> there is the indication not only that we have eternal life and enjoy it, but also that we can minister this life to others. This means that we can give eternal life to others. Regarding this matter, John’s thought is deep. Although the thought here is deep, the matter is very practical in our Christian life. If we enjoy eternal life and experience it, surely we shall be able to channel this life to others. We shall be able to minister eternal life to other members of the Body. </p>

We have pointed out that under God’s governmental dealing a certain sin may be unto death. But this matter of sin unto death should not distract us from the basic thought in these verses of ministering eternal life to others. This section implies that we can channel eternal life out from within ourselves into others. You should not try to know whether or not someone will be healed or whether or not a particular sin is unto death.

In this conclusion John once again emphasizes the divine birth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104643" data-verses="John 18:1">v. 18</span>). As we have pointed out, this book is structured with the divine birth, divine life, divine fellowship, the divine anointing, and all the virtues that come out of the divine birth. I hope that we all shall have a deep impression concerning the divine birth, concerning the fact that we have been begotten of God. We also need to be deeply impressed concerning the divine life, which has been sown as the divine seed into our being; the divine fellowship, for us to enjoy the riches of the divine life; the divine anointing, by which we abide in the Lord and have fellowship with Him; and all the virtues that proceed from the divine birth. Concerning these matters, we should not have mere knowledge; we need to touch the depth of the reality of these things in this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPZwIBWVLNzIUHN7kStCQ650r3Ptvl4Kl8HEES34jsiFdri3coL8reMmqLT40dAx6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104644" data-verses="1John 5:18">5:18</span> John says, “We know that everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin, but he who is begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him.” In order to avoid sinning, which not only interrupts the fellowship of the divine life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104645" data-verses="1John 1:6-10">1:6-10</span>), but also may even bring in physical death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104646" data-verses="1John 5:16-17">5:16-17</span>), the apostle stresses here again, with the assurance of the capability of the divine life, our divine birth, which is the basis of the victorious life. This basic fact does not allow us, the regenerated ones, to practice sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104647" data-verses="1John 3:9">3:9</span>), that is, to live in sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104648" data-verses="Romans 6:2">Rom. 6:2</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="345" id="345">[345]</span> </p>

Here we have a thought that has not previously been introduced—the thought that regenerated persons can keep themselves from sinning. </p>
<p data-content-id="Nbi_A5eQg6SlJktY-vN2BcSntoicJqksuYnlCEy9tjYn6kA_SaakUiNPjLTZQtyW6"> Some teachers say that “he” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104650" data-verses="1John 5:18">5:18</span> refers to Christ, who was begotten of God and keeps the regenerated one, based upon <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104651" data-verses="John 17:15">John 17:15</span>. But the phrase “begotten of God” in this clause, as a repetition of that in the preceding clause, should be the logical and determining factor that “he” refers still to the regenerated believer. A regenerated believer (especially his regenerated spirit, which is born of the Spirit of God—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104652" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>), keeps himself from living in sin, and the evil one does not touch him, especially his regenerated spirit.

<p data-content-id="tDWlQSHUBHZ5qBD93IBcPfrKTaUqS26HA_scGJKr-ItE3c3VnQo-6LLTQLhXhN2yD"> This understanding of the pronoun “he” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104653" data-verses="1John 5:18">5:18</span> is supported by John’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104654" data-verses="1John 5:4">5:4</span>: “Because everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.” Strictly speaking, this verse refers to our regenerated spirit.

<p data-content-id="hwNB5H1_KK9Ks6g0ACxK6_jJYi871f3etOZrhIrnwoZm3HPKYIheMIJchivbQyuv_"> As we have indicated, some translators say that “he” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104655" data-verses="1John 5:18">5:18</span> refers to the Lord Jesus and should be rendered “He.” According to this understanding, Christ has been begotten of God, and He keeps us. But as the result of much study and according to our experience, we have come to understand that the pronoun “he” refers to the person who has been begotten of God. This is indicated by the fact that “begotten of God” is used twice in this verse. First, we are told that everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin, and then that he who is begotten of God keeps himself. It is not logical to say that in the first case “begotten of God” refers to a regenerated believer and that in the second case this phrase refers to Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104656" data-verses="1John 5:18">5:18</span> “he” refers to a regenerated <span class="pg" data-page-id="346" id="346">[346]</span> person, a person who has been begotten of God and who thereby keeps himself from sinning. The word “keeps” means to guard by watchful care. </p>

Here “touch” means to grasp, to lay hold of, for doing harm and fulfilling evil purposes. The Greek word rendered “evil one” is <em>poneros.</em> This word differs from <em>kakos,</em> which refers to an essentially worthless and wicked character, and also differs from <em>sapros</em> which indicates worthlessness and corruption, degeneracy from original virtue. The Greek word <em>poneros</em> means pernicious, harmfully evil, affecting and influencing others to be evil and vicious. Such an evil one is Satan the Devil, in whom the whole world lies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104658" data-verses="1John 5:19">v. 19</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="V9xS8M6rjjN-0lZsHbq91AHT3KAY96Y9a5uiZMINou19YlFe7mjWMSjjqQ7FY9LXk"> At least one version says, “The evil one cannot touch him,” instead of, “The evil one does not touch him.” To say that the evil one cannot touch you is different from saying that the evil one does not touch you. The correct translation is, “The evil one does not touch him.” The thought here is not that the evil one is not able to touch us; the thought is that the evil one does not touch us. Here John is saying that as long as we abide in our regenerated spirit, this spirit will keep us from sinning, and the evil one does not touch us. He knows that if he tries to touch us when we are abiding in our regenerated spirit, he will be wasting his time. Hence, the thought here is not that the evil one cannot touch us, but that he does not touch us when we are in spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="i9c2fxnXKS3NxrFOde82Trn8fb0HMMr0jSlnc5vC2fXDq9INndpC7JClfqMfIFHf2"> We know from experience that when we are in the flesh, forgetting our regenerated spirit, we become prey to the evil one, even a “delicious dish” for him to eat. At such a time, the evil one may say, “Oh, here is something good for me to eat.” The evil one will not only touch us—he will swallow us. But when we are in our regenerated spirit, he will not waste his time with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="1ZdEquAptuZyC4Hy3ZuumHh7aprebUrXzBfisqQqLjyFxI_FnxFhdG7CjNwwHgSzb"> The thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104659" data-verses="1John 5:18">5:18</span> is that we have been born of God and have the divine life. This divine birth took place in our <span class="pg" data-page-id="347" id="347">[347]</span> regenerated spirit, and now the divine life is in our regenerated spirit. Therefore, we should simply stay in our regenerated spirit. Regeneration with the divine birth and the divine life keeps us from sin, failure, and defilement. When we stay in our regenerated spirit, Satan knows that there is no way for him to touch us, and he will not try to touch us. </p>

<p data-content-id="u1sqLDoEOByMLopgbu_aCqIGYZwsHW5k74G9JvNqSDBMoewTPOGPF3BlexAbSZMFU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104674" data-verses="1John 5:20">5:20</span> John says, “And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.” The Son of God, who has come to us in incarnation and through death and resurrection, has given us the understanding, the ability, to know the true God. This understanding, this knowing ability, includes our enlightened mind, our enlivened spirit, and the Spirit of reality. Now we have the ability to know God. As we have pointed out, to know God is to experience Him, enjoy Him, and possess Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fX0psknrQuL7J7uZCPBLmWt1DYYjhQ0hHDzsYlbALepmSVHxblGdG69ounyizwRB2">THE TRUE ONE</h2><p data-content-id="IAEglTO5-PveUJvF1lWxKJm7tYoUp2nNfpgL8X4B-R4Wo2ONs8YiCa3cVul_enZ8w"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104675" data-verses="1John 5:20">5:20</span> John twice speaks of “Him who is true.” A better translation would be “the true One.” To speak of God simply as God may be to speak in a rather objective way. However, the term “the true One” is subjective; it refers to God becoming subjective to us. In this verse, the God who is objective becomes the true One in our life and experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="HwMO3cvZ0bsnsA0tpNdFIfu7R59J4M4Pm-yVbCByoE_QqtH4WFIgrRpe3y2WqGcVm"> What is the meaning of the expression “the true One”? In particular, what does the word “true” mean? Here the Greek word translated “true” is <em>alethinos,</em> genuine, real (an adjective akin to <em>aletheia,</em> truth, verity, reality—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104676" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104677" data-verses="John 14:6">14:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104678" data-verses="John 14:17">17</span>), opposite of false and counterfeit. Actually, the true One is the reality. The Son of God has given us an understanding <span class="pg" data-page-id="352" id="352">[352]</span> so that we may know—that is, experience, enjoy, and possess—this divine reality. Therefore, to know the true One means to know the reality by experiencing, enjoying, and possessing this reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="XkwcSjgfEhTzaME596SB0SUn8aKtJIUgzYa0NsdWxLYhUHNpANkftayVDpm4bNwhp"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104679" data-verses="1John 5:20">First John 5:20</span> indicates that God has become our reality in our experience. The Son of God has come through incarnation and through death and resurrection and has given us an understanding so that we may experience, enjoy, and possess the reality, which is God Himself. Now the God who once was objective to us has become our subjective reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="kwpmPGODR_HqrtquI-1xXx5dGUWSP1h50QIifl8NGXNdS36pTzY-bvFX82iimNHp_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104680" data-verses="1John 5:20">5:20</span> John says that we are in the true One. We not only know the true God; we are also in Him. We not only have the knowledge of Him; we are in an organic union with Him. We are one with Him organically. </p>
<p data-content-id="JK1tOOo6YAEZffeFYvDJ0DQe_ONGZ85WqGku6EADZi_KVs6rkRSoTbBOm2k-7ZLI8"> When John says that we are in the true One, He is making a crucial point. Not only do we know the true One, and not only do we experience, enjoy, and possess Him as the reality, but we are in this reality. We are in the true One. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ztWqoed01v1IAPVjcjzQHIvsgpIq4AC9ZdsgqX-h9OsWPZeIXDKZl3JMjwTALCxAg">IN THE TRUE ONE, IN HIS SON JESUS CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="aJigmhkHMCsaQv4-H_CrsJOUV6CaKXMHKH2uXmTRIedacoVBVBjciQiomTqjw4x7m"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104681" data-verses="1John 5:20">5:20</span> John says, “We are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ.” To be in the true God is to be in His Son Jesus Christ. Since Jesus Christ as the Son of God is the very embodiment of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="104682" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>), to be in Him is to be in the true God. This indicates that Jesus Christ the Son of God is the true God. </p>
<p data-content-id="b9TQLQbBeCKIIpeWWcGDe_A8Qb4cvs9FHrW7NBfExSSKvxh_3cu8CPv3MICdSv85q"> Let us consider in more detail John’s word “we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ.” Notice that there is a comma after the word “true.” In the original Greek text there is no punctuation at all. Hence, translators differ concerning whether or not a comma should be placed after “true.” </p>
<p data-content-id="qFcHJ5u15ZxAiYHSZvY58HSTf5NMvPM1VUsm4k6TsFJaq-O4SNDd4YeiVXmP28L7D"> Moreover, there is a question whether the phrase “in His Son Jesus Christ” is in apposition to “in Him who is true,” or is an adverbial phrase. Some interpreters say that this phrase is in apposition; others say that it functions like an adverb. If this phrase is in apposition to “in Him who is true,” the meaning would be that to be in the true One is <span class="pg" data-page-id="353" id="353">[353]</span> equal to being in His Son Jesus Christ. If “in His Son Jesus Christ” is an adverb, then this phrase indicates that we are in the true One by being in His Son Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="yKKB9eDIFrgaTLK1MK46XTTbZ3oUc9RUpYq8CgQ0-IcLwk2G0bP3UGZmH5RVKsBFj"> Grammatically speaking, it may be preferable to say that “in His Son Jesus Christ” is not in apposition to the foregoing phrase, but is a modifier describing how we are in the true One. In this case, the meaning is that we are in the true One because we are in His Son Jesus Christ. In other words, we are in the true One by being in Jesus Christ. The reason we need to consider this matter is that it is vital to our spiritual experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="84n3RYDKDx94xFCgfM9dlb2aoZ5P7g4YURpxxsRaVR92YZ1bUpSXSRwFYRnjKzTph"> After much study, I have come to the conclusion that either way we understand the function of the phrase “in His Son Jesus Christ,” the outcome is the same. Whether this phrase is in apposition to the foregoing phrase or is a modifier, the result is the same. If the latter phrase is in apposition to the former, the meaning is that to be in the true One is equal to being in His Son Jesus Christ. This would also indicate that the true One and Jesus Christ are one in the way of coinherence. Therefore, to be in the Son is spontaneously to be in the true One. If “in His Son Jesus Christ” is a modifier, the meaning is that we are in the true One by being in His Son Jesus Christ. How are we in the true One? We are in Him by being in His Son Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0VQVWgS1ukzdV03AKaCp4Hu8QlAizkHBNfhQyBRelJH5iijKgOT9M3ceK9_iYN0up"> If we consider this matter carefully, we shall see that in both ways of understanding these phrases, the meaning is actually the same. Whether we say that to be in the true One is to be in His Son Jesus Christ, or we are in the true One by virtue of being in Jesus Christ, the outcome is the same. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7VBIDypFbsrB3seo-P0TEAujGdemdy7iaa4y5jfzjzXbzw_FYoAOknClttOS5sAlQ">THE TRUE GOD AND ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="_7zRmizQLI750LSdci3WMRJjk0jTocvDE5ihipp8Dk5Zb1N-aTLrAC0-BZmbbCZWn"> Let us now go on to consider the last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104683" data-verses="1John 5:20">verse 20</span>: “This is the true God and eternal life.” “This” refers to the God who has come through incarnation and has given us the ability to know Him as the genuine God and be one with Him organically in His Son Jesus Christ. All this is the genuine and real God and eternal life to us. This genuine and <span class="pg" data-page-id="354" id="354">[354]</span> real God is eternal life to us so that we may partake of Him as everything for our regenerated being. </p>
<p data-content-id="B2_T8YLhauK6u6VpNIfepJFRnrLWE8nmEKoh3_bnjebpEuWtQKKBduV2zG6x7fpJd"> We need to pay special attention to the word “this.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="104684" data-verses="1John 5:20">5:20</span> John does not say “He is”; he says “This is.” This is the correct translation of the Greek. Furthermore, John uses the word “this” to refer both to the true God and to eternal life. By this we see that the true God and eternal life are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="xmPKprsOh6TbK1SQkcaQRS0SWdErlfObuTtFPjUunAX7RJ4fk17RRsdIbNYAdu7wg"> We have seen that we are in the true One and in His Son Jesus Christ. Doctrinally, the true One and His Son Jesus Christ may be considered two. But when we are in the true One and in Jesus Christ experientially, They are one. For this reason John uses “this” to refer both to the true One and to His Son Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="rw-m1vPiM_MEq1TdjOdqC1unC2Cw2e3Gzo90RaDvxZHKD3KSYrMuwWuc4j1U7D-ed"> For someone who is not in the true One and Jesus Christ, They are two. But when we are in Them experientially, They are one. We have seen that to be in the true One is to be in His Son Jesus Christ. This means that in our experience of being in Them, They are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="d452zdxZZNHiBlSLKwhT0BBKwYxwTlabvT60AIwXGQSbbnrz5Mn_Np7P8NqqS47tU"> Moreover, when we are in the true One and Jesus Christ, They are our true God and also our eternal life. First, John speaks of the true One and His Son Jesus Christ, and then he speaks of the true God. Here there may be some distinction between the true One and the true God. When we are in the true One and His Son Jesus Christ, the true One is called the true God, and His Son Jesus Christ is called eternal life. This means that first They are the true One and His Son Jesus Christ. But when we are in Them, They become the true God and eternal life. </p>
