<p data-content-id="ELgAnKoxymVCxEU085F09PAAKOFC5e79Kcjqa9KKz-o0iNiU7mWYl8DgLsSy_YySF"> The books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians form a cluster of Epistles which make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament. Therefore, these books are very important. Ephesians covers the church as the Body of Christ, whereas Colossians deals with Christ as the Head of the Body. Galatians is concerned with Christ, and Philippians, with the experience of Christ. In Colossians and Ephesians we receive a clear view of the Head and the Body. In Galatians and Philippians we see Christ and the experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="DEb9lLplhJh_b-ToTExfg9uMZDfzVqBAmO_hOEwnHQvhFVJvBhvWxecGMMAdTQUXF"> Just as there are four seasons in the year, so there are seasons in our Christian experience. This means that in our experience with the Lord we pass through winter as well as summer. The winter experiences are helpful, for they prepare us for a new beginning, which comes in the spring. During the winter season the various kinds of life are reduced. Through the reduction that takes place in winter, life is prepared to grow again. Because in our spiritual experience there is the need for us to be reduced, we must be ready for winter at the appointed time. We may say that Galatians is a winter book, a book that reduces us and eliminates everything that should not be permanent. However, this reduction serves a very positive purpose: it prepares us for further growth in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sg88U9K0yJlgyYkOTTYYeg-zhE87oC0LNRDbxGhs9u9M3IxMpYooF2YKtp-9frUCd"> We all need to be reduced. We need to be reduced not only in things that are natural or worldly, but even in the various aspects of our spiritual experience. For the sake of further growth in the Lord, we need to be reduced. Certain <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> things in our Christian life may be very good, scriptural, and spiritual. But as long as these things are not Christ Himself directly, they should not be given a place with us very long. Only Christ Himself should have a permanent place in our Christian life. All other things, even the most spiritual experiences, must be reduced. In order for this reduction to take place, God ordains winter. We should never expect to have an endless summer in the Christian life. On the contrary, we should expect the recurring cycle of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Whenever we come to a winter in our experience with the Lord, we should be encouraged that spring and summer will follow in due time. Therefore, we should be encouraged to be reduced in order to have another new beginning. It is my hope that these messages on Galatians will serve this purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESWHgWW4cLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS">I. THE BACKGROUND</h2><p data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrDYeIYOWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-"> In order to study the book of Galatians properly, it is important to know the background and the subject of this book. All the books in the New Testament have a particular background. We thank the Lord for these backgrounds, even though, for the most part, they were not very positive. The Lord uses the negative background as a basis for the release of the divine revelation. The more negative a certain background is, the greater is the opportunity for the Lord to release His revelation. The worse the background, the greater is the need for God’s revelation. If we see this, we shall thank the Lord for all the negative backgrounds that made it necessary for the books in the New Testament to be written. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGJw21xvx_4iyiGpDEqnpkGv7X3DfqUVmjkRTasq1cTT8ENWrMNtao5xjcOTyhFf0"> The Gospel of John is a good example of a New Testament book written against a negative background. This Gospel was written during the last decade of the first century. At that time there was a tendency, even among Christians, to deny the deity of Christ. Some were doubting Christ’s deity, and others were even denying this truth. With such a trend as the background, this Gospel was written by the Apostle John. Without this Gospel, we could not <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> have an adequate understanding of Christ’s deity and His eternal existence. Neither could we realize how Christ could become our life. But through the Gospel of John we clearly see that Christ’s deity is eternal and absolute. In this Gospel we also have the clear view of eternal life and of how Christ can be life to us. If there had not been such a dark background at the end of the first century, this wonderful Gospel probably would not have been written. </p>
<p data-content-id="WA9v3u5-3Lwi17H2ixIskGrIPSqrsrXkuEq15-Op_KCV9NmwKiBW9UQjWZtKTZiSu"> The Epistles of Paul were also written according to certain backgrounds. First Corinthians, for example, was written because of the confusion and divisiveness in the church at Corinth. If we did not have the book of 1 Corinthians, we would not know how Christ could be our enjoyment in all kinds of situations. This book describes the enjoyment of Christ in a way not found elsewhere in the New Testament. We should thank the Lord for the confusion in Corinth that gave rise to this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="2a2q7x6_ya-MrF4vWREnskCnkQyqmLNKn4UAmFZ6n1uV18kympe4IfkgeG_OZh2ep"> The book of Colossians was also written according to a particular background, the background of the culture that had invaded the church at Colosse. With this cultural invasion as the background, the marvelous book of Colossians was written. Without that background, we would not have this book today. </p>
<p data-content-id="uc7kzXp0thJHgKfcmJ22Wl02--H7VCa-RsBkJeSW3J8W-fJ2HPsWWLCVwvllAti1T"> In the same principle, the recovery of justification by faith at the time of the Reformation came forth out of a negative situation and a dark background. Apart from such a situation and background, the truth of justification by faith would not be as clear as it is today. This truth can no longer be blurred because the dark background causes it to stand out so definitely. </p>
<p data-content-id="foiLIlvcS80gCzQLJEjLx1z1ClA7seKfvi_9m0_XuzDf4uNd_MonuQ67A3GsUpFID"> Now we come to the background of the book of Galatians. Written before A.D. 60, Galatians is earlier than either Ephesians or Colossians. Galatians was written in the earlier part of Paul’s ministry, before he was imprisoned. </p>
<p data-content-id="IEVFDlaYVRjSRK71dHxvanxPQiFisXn-0yai8TnmSQ0mIPD3pnj0_KMZCVI_UK25d"> In order to have the proper experience of the church as the Body of Christ, we need the book of Galatians. We need both an adequate experience and understanding of all that is conveyed to us in this Epistle. If we intend to practice the <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> church life today, we need to know the Christ revealed in Galatians. </p>
<p data-content-id="Hlq_gUShg2G7IhotoZBaNpfjB5fhtJVlHrXNP3YQSM19wOBoXfa9nS1og1JwPplH9"> Galatians reveals that Christ is versus religion with its law. The law given by God through Moses was the foundation of the Jewish religion. Judaism was built on the law. The book of Galatians reveals that the very Christ whom we need for the church life is versus law and religion. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="X2KpgkkTGpuer9ChrLtbTP3VIQwetpPE30oZb2NYjLrZPMqVCuoyr2w9p0BOI3Rme">A. The Churches in Galatia<br/>Bewitched by the Judaizers</h2><p data-content-id="kWWIR_PfYdTAivJZe4CjaMmh3eJRAXYMQN8Lfl4WOobFn7DmNjazJgeo2POKKCOfK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85803" data-verses="Galatians 1:2">verse 2</span> Paul speaks of “the churches of Galatia,” a province of the ancient Roman Empire. Through Paul’s preaching ministry, churches were established in a number of cities in that province. Hence, “churches,” not “church,” is used when the apostle refers to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="JXqZnZhBWTHYr5N7Yht-3oFtqtZnljmP3ypdcLgaJCkerNiqlRD_Yss6rPYP8xAja"> The churches in Galatia had been bewitched by the Judaizers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85804" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">3:1</span>). They had been distracted from Christ to Judaism. A good number of the New Testament believers in the churches of Galatia had turned back to the old Jewish religion and were endeavoring to keep the law with the ordinance of circumcision. This was the background that gave Paul the opportunity to write this wonderful book. </p>
<p data-content-id="zoSuUTRAjb71fws33A2Ij_qOnAhD6DZHkvk4LihK5YZEcnjH-Rw-Qvjra-Rp4-Cu9"> In writing to the Galatians, Paul was very frank and straightforward; he was not in the least political. For example, he called those Judaizers who were troubling the Galatians “false brothers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85805" data-verses="Galatians 2:4">2:4</span>). The Galatian believers had been bewitched by these false brothers. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="aary53Wx3h7_PLJIcdmPvYGSP_gup3BQkZf5Js31NuzMk7UHLOZ9EuU39xv2VI18i">B. The Churches in Galatia Distracted<br/>from Christ to Law</h2><p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uT430DdAz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85806" data-verses="Galatians 1:6-7">1:6 and 7</span> Paul says, “I marvel that you are so quickly removing from Him Who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel, which is not another; only there are some who trouble you and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ.” Here Paul comes to his subject. Because the churches in Galatia were deserting the grace of Christ and backsliding to the observance of the law, Paul was burdened to write this Epistle. The “different gospel” mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85807" data-verses="Galatians 1:6">verse 6</span> denotes <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> the Judaistic observance of the law. The grace of Christ is versus the law of Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85808" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>). The Judaizers troubled the churches by perverting the gospel of Christ, or distorting it, thus misleading the believers, taking them back to the law of Moses. However, the observance of the law could never be a gospel that sets free the sinners under its bondage and brings them into the enjoyment of God. It could only keep them as slaves under its bondage. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="hwMadJIZ14zUSl3gCcShY89tbJQ6BmfydHXU1tIkWKzKdKgtXF3CB5KwOuJngqEmP">THE APOSTLE’S GOSPEL</h1><p class="scripture" data-content-id="U0hKzeGUKiJ9Ln5z4YNTcfeVabLAZWosB97DAfeztAm8eOk3lOS0ACBjVbUPD323A">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85840" data-verses="Galatians 1:6-12">Gal. 1:6-12</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="MW1PrIO1NZkL7m7Ua0gn0XKBELZM4yxZO7paon9rt0Llao3pVSvH-BXWTu0cTco71"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85841" data-verses="Galatians 1:6-12">1:6-12</span>. The main item revealed in these verses is the gospel preached by the Apostle Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="VJs2_qQSmWRN5nwRMAwzi45kisxj4h5WHZfAUFc9qWR3k9ARa10q6C3SazdmHHl0y"> Many Christians think that the gospel has only one aspect. According to this concept, the message of the gospel is that we were sinners and that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was incarnated and died on the cross for our sins so that we might be forgiven and saved. Although this is not wrong, it by no means includes all the aspects of the gospel found in the New Testament. In Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, we have different aspects of the gospel. In the Acts we do not see one particular aspect. Instead, there are verses that refer to the aspects of the gospel presented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. However, in all the Epistles written by Paul, Romans through Hebrews, we see a particular aspect of the gospel. We may call these Epistles the gospel according to Paul, or the fifth gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="iIHmCvd9sgkOSusZIiEhvMwR4T31xJ4zuIWsbFnSjjf0sUscYCF5zbaUImx-kg4jH"> Let us now consider the various aspects of the five gospels in the New Testament. Matthew reveals that Christ, the Son of David, came as the King to establish the kingdom of the heavens on earth. Hence, in Matthew the term, “the gospel of the kingdom,” is used. Therefore, the aspect of the gospel emphasized in Matthew is that of the kingdom. The goal of this aspect of the gospel is to bring people into the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="1d2f_9YogZuGF0F3RaAqS-33YBiO25hkqULOa_lPpNjzrwTnOsnp1GD0BnfWBbdhG"> The Gospel of John emphasizes eternal life. In this Gospel we see that from eternity Christ is the very Word of God, even God Himself. One day, the Word was incarnated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85842" data-verses="John 1:14">1:14</span>). Furthermore, He died on the cross not only to redeem us from sin but also to release the divine life so that He may <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> impart Himself into us as eternal life. In this Gospel John brings us to a full realization of the divine life. For this reason, the Gospel of John may be called the gospel of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="9EjNkeFQzuB7lPrvBx2r4mQ1BSexj3MjL5KX4WKv8J4ijozWWaX1GBnucISX6mYPk"> The aspect of the gospel emphasized in Luke is that of the forgiveness of sins. Here we find a record of how Christ came as a man to be our Savior, how He died on the cross to accomplish redemption and to solve the problem of sin so that we may be forgiven. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85843" data-verses="Luke 24:47">Luke 24:47</span>, repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in the name of Christ among all nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESWEgWzycLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS"> We have pointed out that Matthew is the gospel of the kingdom, that John is the gospel of life, and that Luke is the gospel of forgiveness. But what aspect of the gospel is emphasized in Mark? Mark is the gospel of service. According to this Gospel, Christ came as a slave to serve God by caring for God’s people. Christ came, not to be ministered unto, but to minister, to serve (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85844" data-verses="Mark 10:45">10:45</span>). He came not only as the King to establish the kingdom, as the eternal One to impart life, and as the Savior to forgive the sins of those who believe in Him; He also came as a slave to serve God by ministering to His redeemed people. Thus, Mark emphasizes service. </p>
<p data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrDbeI5FWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-"> Paul’s gospel includes all the aspects of the first four Gospels. In his writings Paul speaks of the kingdom, life, forgiveness, and service. However, in his Epistles he covers much more. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85845" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Colossians 1:25</span> Paul says that he became a minister according to the stewardship of God to complete the word of God. Hence, Paul’s gospel is the gospel of completion. Without Paul’s gospel, the revelation of the gospel in the New Testament would not be complete. </p>
<p data-content-id="5euwGBFk7L_E9dzcXZ8PUzynd3r0hMSqW8T1Z9BMt24AQwhyvAVjySQuKVWJUZej3"> Many important aspects of the gospel are found only in the writings of Paul. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85846" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</span> Paul says that Christ in us is the hope of glory. Such a word cannot be found in the four Gospels, nor in the Epistles written by Peter or John. Mark may be regarded as Peter’s spiritual son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85847" data-verses="1Peter 5:13">1 Pet. 5:13</span>), and he drew upon Peter as the source for much of the material in his Gospel. However, Mark says nothing about the indwelling Christ as our hope of glory. From Paul’s gospel we learn that the Spirit of <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> Christ is a seal and a pledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85848" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13-14">Eph. 1:13-14</span>). Although John speaks of the Spirit, he does not use the same terms Paul does. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85849" data-verses="Galatians 1:15-16">Galatians 1:15 and 16</span> Paul tells us that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him. Such a word is not to be found in Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John. Paul also speaks of Christ living in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85850" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span>), of Christ being formed in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85851" data-verses="Galatians 4:19">4:19</span>), and of Christ making His home in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85852" data-verses="Ephesians 3:17">Eph. 3:17</span>). Statements like these are not found in the four Gospels. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85853" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span> Paul speaks of being filled unto all the fullness of God. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John have nothing to say about this. </p>
<p data-content-id="N78TKjbEXVwSfszdd30oED09rvQxQQ--ofRmWsRF1_iiqC8arZJbwvJC5VunnOdmn"> In his Epistles Paul also tells us that we are members of the Body of Christ. He speaks of Christ as the Head and of the church as the Body. Such terms cannot be found in the writings of Peter or John. If we could tell Peter that the church is the Body of Christ, he might reply, “Where did you hear this? I was close to the Lord Jesus for three and a half years, but I never heard such a word. I heard about the cross and about feeding the Lord’s lambs. In my first Epistle I even charged the elders to shepherd the flock of God. But I have never heard about the Body of Christ.” We must admit that concerning the matter of the Head and the Body, Paul’s vision was higher than Peter’s. Although John tells us that Christ is the vine and that we are the branches, he does not say that Christ is the Head and that we are the Body. This is a further indication that without Paul’s gospel the revelation in the New Testament would not be complete. </p>
<p data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAMp0xIHj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1"> When Christianity went to China hundreds of years ago, all that was made available to the Chinese was a rather poor translation of the four Gospels. The unfortunate Chinese could hear only those aspects of the gospel found in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Although they may have gained some understanding of the forgiveness of sins, I doubt that they had a proper understanding of the kingdom of heaven in Matthew or of eternal life in John. Certainly they had no opportunity to hear the gospel which declares that the believers have Christ in them as their hope of glory and that they are members of the Body of Christ. They could not know <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> that Christ is the Head of the Body of which we are members. What a loss it would be not to have the gospel of Paul! </p>
<p data-content-id="hwMadJIZ14zUSl3gCcShY89tbJQzOmfydHXU1tIkWKzKdKgtXF3CB5KwOuJngqEmP"> It is crucial for us to see that Paul’s ministry was a completing ministry, a ministry of completing the divine revelation. Paul’s gospel is the gospel of completion. Therefore, if we did not have Paul’s writings, we would lack a vital part of God’s revelation. Paul’s Epistles not only complete the divine revelation; they form the very heart of God’s revelation in the New Testament. Thus, Paul’s gospel is not only the gospel of completion; it is also the center of the New Testament revelation. For this reason, Paul’s gospel is the basic gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="U0hKzeGUKiJ9Ln5z4YNTcfeVabLVVWosB97DAfeztAm8eOk3lOS0ACBjVbUPD323A"> We in the Lord’s recovery need to have a clear view of the gospel according to Paul. The focal point of Paul’s gospel is that the Son of God, God’s anointed One, has entered into our being to be our life today and our glory in the future so that we may be the members of His Body. This Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, is the new man, the household of God, the household of faith, and the true Israel of God. In Paul’s gospel there are many mysterious matters that are not covered by Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John. In the four Gospels we are not told that Christ is the mystery of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85854" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Col. 2:2</span>) or that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85855" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). In fact, the four Gospels do not even give us a clear word concerning justification by faith. It is in Romans and Galatians that justification by faith is covered in a clear way. </p>

In his religious zeal, he persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it. </p>

He called himself “a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85891" data-verses="Acts 23:6">Acts 23:6</span>). The Jewish religion was composed not only of the God-given law and its rituals, but also of man-made traditions. Because Paul was so zealous for the traditions of his fathers, he became a leading religionist and advanced beyond many of his contemporaries. </p>

God could bear with Saul’s zeal for the traditions of his fathers, for this produced a dark background against which to reveal Christ. At a time which was pleasing to Him, God revealed His Son in Saul of Tarsus. God was pleased to reveal to him the living Person of the Son of God. To reveal His Son in us is also a pleasure to God. It is Christ, the Son of God, not the law, in whom God the Father is always pleased (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85893" data-verses="Matthew 3:17">Matt. 3:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85894" data-verses="Matthew 12:18">12:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85895" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">17:5</span>). </p>

As the Son of the living God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85906" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">Matt. 16:16</span>), Christ is far superior to Judaism and its traditions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85907" data-verses="Galatians 1:13-14">Gal. 1:13-14</span>). The Judaizers bewitched the Galatians so that they considered the ordinances of the law above the Son of the living God. Hence, the apostle in the opening of this Epistle testified that he had been deeply involved in that realm and far advanced in it. God, however, had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God’s eyes, by revealing His Son in him. In his experience, Paul realized that there is no comparison between the Son of the living God and Judaism with its dead traditions from his fathers. </p>

This indicates that God’s revealing of His Son to us is in us, not outwardly but inwardly; not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing. This is not an objective revelation; it is a subjective one. </p>
<p data-content-id="JXqZnZhBWTHYr5N7Yht-3oFtotZntjmP3ypdcLgaJCkerNiqlRD_Yss6rPYP8xAja"> God made the Apostle Paul a minister of Christ by setting him apart, calling him, and revealing His Son in him. Therefore, what Paul preached was not the law, but Christ the Son of God.

This was true at the time of Saul of Tarsus, it has been true throughout the centuries, and it is true today. Instead of focusing his attention on this living Person, man has a natural tendency to direct his attention to religion with its tradition. But from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85909" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85910" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span> the Bible reveals a living Person. God cares only for this living Person, not for anything else. </p>
<p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uT410DRGz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> The record of the experience of the disciples with the Lord Jesus on the mount of transfiguration illustrates this (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85911" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-8">Matt. 17:1-8</span>). After bringing Peter, James, and John up into a high mountain apart, the Lord Jesus “was transfigured before them, and His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85912" data-verses="Matthew 17:2">Matt. 17:2</span>). Along with the other two disciples, Peter saw the Lord’s glory. He also saw Moses and Elijah speaking with Him. Although it is doubtful that Moses and Elijah were in glory, they nonetheless were speaking with the glorified Jesus. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85913" data-verses="Matthew 17:4">Matthew 17:4</span>, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” In making this suggestion, Peter was elevating Moses and Elijah to the same level as that of the Lord Jesus. He was heir of the centuries-old tradition concerning Moses, who represented the law, and Elijah, who represented the prophets. To the Jews, Moses and Elijah were the representatives of the entire Old Testament. Hence, even on the mount of transfiguration, Peter was zealous for the traditions regarding Moses and Elijah. But while Peter was still speaking, “behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight; hear Him!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85914" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">Matt. 17:5</span>). Moses and Elijah then disappeared from the scene. When the disciples lifted up their eyes, “they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.” This indicates that in the eyes of God there is no place for <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> religion or tradition—only the living Person of His Son has a place. </p>

How people treasure their traditions! For example, the Seventh-Day Adventists treasure the Sabbath day. They fondly cling to the tradition of the seventh-day Sabbath. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85915" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">Colossians 2:16</span>, the Sabbath is a shadow of which the reality, the body, is Christ. Now that Christ has come, we should turn from the shadow to the reality. Nevertheless, like the Jews of old, today’s Seventh-Day Adventists treasure the shadow and neglect Christ. Christ is our day. He is not only our real Sabbath, but the reality of every day. How foolish to treasure the seventh-day Sabbath when we can enjoy Christ as our real Sabbath and as the reality of every day! </p>
<p data-content-id="8QMBpb5u2uHUGqYhAKQo7aPggYy7Luq03b-0CqpSXjxqjeY42vbmKdMawdZNSBkiv"> Some Christians treasure certain things that are far more ridiculous than this. Have you heard that some preachers are occupied with the lengthening of legs? Where is Christ in such a practice? Those who specialize in the lengthening of legs should call themselves “leg-lengtheners,” not ministers of Christ. To associate the lengthening of legs with the name of Christ is to use His name in vain. </p>
<p data-content-id="0BpDaFkHtIhH2qZitqny5KzHzdR58t6aFanb0dnnLD-DF8DEA-y-PlCDROzpEYzWE"> Today millions of Christians are occupied with miracles, healing, prophecy, speaking in tongues, the so-called manifestation of gifts, and head covering, but few are occupied with Christ. What a pitiful situation! </p>
<p data-content-id="7EjiJiKSogg44JUcqVx5SCLVrPkf-zVQuzRHXmWHEsrf9X58XGzqK5yeH8wP2vo49"> For seven and a half years, I was with a very strict Brethren assembly. During my time with them, I heard a good number of messages on the books of Daniel and Revelation. In these messages a great deal was said about beasts, horns, toes, and certain periods of days. As a young man zealous for knowledge, I was somewhat satisfied by that kind of teaching. But although I heard many messages about different aspects of prophecy, I did not hear very much concerning Christ. Actually the book of Revelation <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> is not focused on beasts, toes, and horns; it is focused on Christ. This book is a revelation of the Person of Christ. Even the book of Daniel reveals Christ. Nevertheless, the messages given in that Brethren assembly were by no means centered on Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="_Fv0JBBWQcCEA6UxPCM9K1DlTARXIRb8K6GGkuofFK8ArsuS12Lmc3gY7CCOW-tTq"> If you attend the so-called Sunday morning services in today’s Christianity or go to Bible studies held by Christian teachers, you will hear about many things. But rarely will you hear a message in which Christ is unveiled and ministered to the Lord’s people. This indicates that today, as it has been for centuries, religious people are zealous for religious things and for traditions, but not for Christ. A great many Christians care for religion and traditions, but they do not care for the living Person of Christ. </p>

Apart from God’s revelation of His Son in us, no human being would be able to see this living Person. Due to the shortage of revelation, millions of people have not realized anything of this Person, even though He is living, real, active, and aggressive. Hence, the problem today is the lack of revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGJw21xvx_4iyiGpDEqnpkGv-X3eVqUVmjkRTasq1cTT8ENWrMNtao5xjcOTyhFf0"> Christians may read the Bible and study it carefully, but see very little of Christ. This also may be our situation even in the Lord’s recovery. From the beginning of the Bible to the end, especially in the New Testament, Christ occupies the central place. God’s revelation throughout the Scriptures is altogether focused on Christ. Nevertheless, as we review our past experience, we shall have to admit that in our reading of the Bible we did not see much of Christ. </p>

When the Jews read the Old Testament, they read it with their understanding veiled. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85944" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:15">2 Corinthians 3:15</span> Paul says, “But <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.” Do you know what this veil is? It is the religion of Judaism. If you contact orthodox Jews today and speak to them about Christ, you will realize that they are covered with a thick, strong veil. The same is true of Moslems and even of many Christians. For example, many of those in the Catholic Church who truly believe in Christ are covered with a veil of many layers, perhaps dozens of layers. One of these veils concerns the superstition that Mary is the mother of God. These believers persist in saying that they must continue to pray to Mary, the so-called mother of God, because they think their experience proves that prayers to the so-called holy mother are heard and answered. What a veil this is! </p>

<p data-content-id="1d2f_9YogZuGF0F3RaAqS-33eBir-5hkqULOa_lPpNjzrwTnOsnp1GD0BnfWBbdhG"> Although Christ is spiritual and mysterious, God has created within us an organ by which we can know Christ. This organ is the human spirit. In his subtlety, Satan has blinded people to the fact that they have a spirit, or has otherwise kept them from using their spirit. Instead, he entices them to use their fallen mentality, which is blinded, darkened, and hardened. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85945" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:14">2 Corinthians 3:14</span> Paul says that the Jewish religionists are hardened in their thoughts (Gk.). To be hardened in this way is also to be blind and in darkness. Many Christians also are blinded, hardened, and darkened because they are covered with so many veils. These veils not only frustrate them from knowing Christ, but often keep them from recognizing the church people as genuine Christians. Some persist in considering us as a cult. </p>
<p data-content-id="9EjNkeFQzuB7lPrvBx2r4mQ1HSeQq3MjL5KX4WKv8J4ijozWWaX1GBnucISX6mYPk"> Furthermore, the veils that cover today’s Christians make them very touchy. If they are touched even slightly, they are offended. The reason for this touchiness is that <span class="pg" data-page-id="35" id="35">[35]</span> Satan, the subtle one, the touchy one, is crouching in their minds. Satan is lurking in the mentality of today’s veiled Christians. What a pitiful situation that so many genuine believers in Christ are still veiled! </p>
<p data-content-id="jNHNoHhxt7cbszaVs2RjRHRHH_wBax3ISFPf8Kuf5Jq3AWG9Juh2vq7g1OiSkI5wf"> We need to apply this word about veils to ourselves. It is crucial that we be on the alert, for it is possible for anything that is not Christ Himself to be used as a veil by the subtle one. Satan may use even the Scriptures or the law given by God as veils. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85946" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> Paul says that the law is good, holy, and spiritual. But even such a good, holy, and spiritual thing in the hands of Satan can become a veil. This indicates that Satan can use even the highest spiritual gift to veil our understanding. Thus, it is possible for anything that is not Christ Himself to be a veil. </p>

The god of this age is Satan. Those who are blinded or veiled think that they do not worship anything. Actually, their god is Satan. Atheists worship Satan without knowing what they are doing. All people today, whether primitive or highly cultured, have been blinded by the god of this age. Consider all those you see on the street or in the supermarkets. How few of them know God! This is true even among a vast number of those who go to today’s chapels, cathedrals, and denominational buildings. There is little revelation of the Son of God, and there is veil upon veil to keep people from knowing Christ. In their blindness, many condemn those who have seen the vision of the living Person of the Son of God. </p>

Every concept, whether spiritual or carnal, is a veil. I have spent many years groping in my <span class="pg" data-page-id="36" id="36">[36]</span> search to learn how to have revelation. Eventually I discovered that to have revelation we need to drop our concepts. </p>
<p data-content-id="suGsx2yrlu_xHF1tfjn8zJMhgepgV_FkeXicCvRkOc4iVF8ZQC36eleSovBwPlpZv"> God today is shining everywhere. This age of grace is an age of light. God is shining, and the Bible is shining also. The Bible is full of light, and it has been printed in hundreds of languages. Moreover, the all-inclusive Spirit moving on earth is full of grace. But although the Bible is shining and the Spirit is moving, many still do not receive revelation. The reason is that they hold to certain concepts and are veiled by these concepts. As you contact people from various nationalities, you will find that all of them are strong in their concepts. This is also true among us in the Lord’s recovery. On the one hand, I worship the Lord for all the growth and improvement among us. On the other hand, I realize that many veils still remain. These veils are the concepts that blind us. </p>
<p data-content-id="wQgrOGxTAR-3cCZQG4vA7yp-qJDUPxy-1YMzeB2bGSRwqkuXSpsZRAhutjKQMg_WA"> With respect to receiving revelation, there is no problem on God’s side. On His side everything is ready. The problem is altogether on our side. We need to drop the veils, that is, to drop our concepts. It is important for us to pray, “Lord, help me to drop everything that is a veil.” If you hold on to your concepts while reading the Bible, you will be like the ancient Jews who had a veil on their mind whenever the Scriptures were read. But if you drop your concepts as you read the Word, you will read it with an unveiled face. Then the light will shine into you subjectively. </p>

However, I was not saved until I was nineteen years old. I knew about Jesus, and I was in favor of Christianity. But I was not saved until the Son of God was revealed in me. One day, when I was nineteen, God shined into me, and I received a revelation of the Lord Jesus. At that time I began to have direct personal contact with Him and to know Him as a living Person. I touched Him, and I was touched by Him. Between Him and me there was a living transaction, a living contact. We all need a direct, personal, living contact with the living Person of the Son of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="37" id="37">[37]</span> </p>

The apostles are examples of what all believers should be. Paul was not an extraordinary person, and he did not reach a state that no one else can attain. The concept that the apostles are unique is a Roman Catholic tradition. This tradition is related to the concept that Peter was the unique successor of Christ and therefore the first pope. What a devilish concept! Far from being unique, Peter is an example of one who followed the Lord. In particular, he is an example to Jewish believers in Christ. Paul is a pattern especially for Gentile believers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85955" data-verses="1Timothy 1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span> he says, “Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.” Since Paul is our pattern, none of us should say that we cannot be like him. </p>
<p data-content-id="aary53Wx3h7_PLJIcdmPvYGSL_g7i3BQkZf5Js31NuzMk7UHLOZ9EuU39xv2VI18i"> Although the brothers may believe that they can be today’s apostles, the sisters may find it very difficult to believe that this also applies to them. As a help to the sisters, we need to point out that in God’s household there are no daughters. God has only sons, not daughters. Christ, the firstborn Son of God, has brothers, but He does not have <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> sisters. This indicates that, according to life, all the believers, including the sisters, are sons of God and brothers of Christ. For this reason, in his Epistles Paul addresses the brothers, but not the brothers and sisters. The sisters, of course, are included in the term brothers. </p>
<p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uT4z0D0Iz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> According to life, all the believers are males. However, according to love, we all are females. Christ is our Bridegroom, and we are His Bride. The relationship between the Bride and the Bridegroom is a matter of love, not a matter of life. Love is the unique requirement of married life. Therefore, we are living sons of the living God, whereas we are the loving Bride of our dear Bridegroom. How, then, would you answer this question: Are we, the believers in Christ, males or females? The proper way to answer is to reply that according to life we are males, but according to love we are females. </p>
<p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZz9NoS-MB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> Paul was made an apostle not according to love, but according to life. It was as a matter of life that he was made a pattern for all the believers, the brothers and the sisters as well. This indicates that by taking Paul as our pattern, we all, brothers and sisters, can be God’s sent ones today. Paul’s status was that of an apostle, and ours should be the same. Hence, as we study the formation of Paul’s apostleship, we are also studying the formation of our own apostleship. </p>
<p data-content-id="0BpDaFkHtIhH2qZitqny5KzH1dR50t6aFanb0dnnLD-DF8DEA-y-PlCDROzpEYzWE"> All of us in the Lord’s recovery need to be sent ones. At the least, a young sister can be sent by the Lord to her parents to testify to them about the Lord Jesus. Are you ready to be sent by the Lord? We all should be prepared to be sent forth by Him. Concerning this matter of apostleship, our minds need to be renewed. Therefore, as we consider the various points in this message, we need to see how we can follow Paul’s pattern and be formed into apostles. All the points we shall cover are prerequisites for the formation of our apostleship. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7EjiJiKSogg44JUcqVx5SCLVtPkf2zVQuzRHXmWHEsrf9X58XGzqK5yeH8wP2vo49">I. SET APART BY GOD FROM HIS MOTHER’S WOMB</h2><p data-content-id="_Fv0JBBWQcCEA6UxPCM9K1DlVARbKRb8K6GGkuofFK8ArsuS12Lmc3gY7CCOW-tTq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85956" data-verses="Galatians 1:15">1:15</span> Paul says that God set him apart from his mother’s womb. The Greek indicates being designated or distinguished <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> for a specific purpose. This setting apart took place before Paul was born. </p>
<p data-content-id="BgIbIp-MeDbB3RxdRZnnJtwrJlgrYdAdTbG5ey5q42AyqhNIGlvz2jYlJOf2dgoh7"> When we read about Paul being set apart from his mother’s womb, we may have the concept that this was true of him, but not of us. This was my point of view when I read these verses years ago. According to my concept, Paul had been set apart, but I had not. This concept, however, is wrong. We were chosen, selected, before the foundation of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="85957" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">Eph. 1:4</span>). Surely to be chosen from before the foundation of the world is more crucial than to be set apart from our mother’s womb. Since you have been chosen from before the foundation of the world, do you not believe that you were also set apart from your mother’s womb? Certainly you were. As we shall see, this refers to the carrying out in time of God’s eternal selection. </p>
<p data-content-id="xjqmn9R1X5blwipEnjasYmA8tAFHM4qU2NWwLyw0snQQ-qgOjt6rZiX-2SZwAnQMv"> Some teachers of the Bible have different opinions concerning the time that Paul was separated from his mother’s womb. According to one school of thought, he was set apart from the time he was conceived. But according to another school, he was set apart at the time of birth. There is no need for us to split hairs concerning this. The main point here is that according to His selection we were chosen by God in eternity, before the foundation of the world. This means that we were chosen before the beginning of time, in eternity. However, there was the need for us, at a definite time, to be separated from our mother’s womb. To be set apart from our mother’s womb is related to the accomplishment in time of the selection God made in eternity. It was necessary for us to be born at a certain time. We thank the Lord that Saul of Tarsus was not born a hundred years before the Lord Jesus, nor six hundred years afterward. He was born at just the right time and in the right place, in the city of Tarsus. It was sovereign of the Lord that Paul was not born in Galilee, where Peter was born. Both Peter and Paul were chosen before the foundation of the world, and both were set apart at precisely the right time. According to God’s timing, He caused these two of His selected ones to be conceived in their mother’s womb. The same is <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> true of us today. We were selected from before the foundation of the world. Then God waited until the time was right for us to be born. Hence, regarding our birth God had His timing. We all were selected in eternity when Paul was selected; however, we were set apart from our mother’s womb at different times. Therefore, to be set apart from our mother’s womb is to have God’s selection carried out in a practical way. </p>
<p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CfFoIIDjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> Do not think that Paul was set apart from his mother’s womb, but that you were not. Because Paul was made a pattern, what happened to him should happen to us also. Whenever I recall my past, I worship the Lord. As I consider my youth, I sometimes weep before Him. How I thank Him that He caused me to be born at just the right time and in just the right place, more than seventy-four years ago in a small village in China. We all can say, “Lord, thank You for setting me apart from my mother’s womb.” I hope that we all shall have a full realization of this. We need to realize that God set us apart in order to carry out His eternal selection. This was true of Paul, and it is just as true of us today. </p>

<p data-content-id="BgIbIp-MeDbB3RxdRZnnJtwrKlg6RdAdTbG5ey5q42AyqhNIGlvz2jYlJOf2dgoh7"> In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that Paul was a pattern for the believers, especially for Gentile believers. In particular, the formation of Paul’s apostleship is a pattern for the formation of our apostleship today. In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85971" data-verses="Galatians 2:1-14">2:1-14</span>. In these verses not only do we have a record of how Paul kept the truth; we have a pattern by which we may learn of Paul how we also may keep the truth. Let us firstly consider Paul’s faithfulness to the truth of the gospel. Then we shall consider Peter’s unfaithfulness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xjqmn9R1X5blwipEnjasYmA8uAFaC4qU2NWwLyw0snQQ-qgOjt6rZiX-2SZwAnQMv">I. PAUL’S FAITHFULNESS</h2><p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CfGoIRMjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> In Galatians we see that Paul was faithful, honest, frank, and bold. At the same time, he also displayed a spirit of meekness. He refers to such a spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85972" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">6:1</span>, where he says that those who are spiritual should restore the one overtaken in an offense in a spirit of meekness. In writing this Epistle, Paul was endeavoring to restore the Galatian believers who had been overtaken by their weakness. No doubt, in their subtlety the Judaizers had taken advantage of the weakness of the Galatian believers. Therefore, Paul exercised a spirit of meekness in order to restore the ones who had been overtaken. On the one hand, he was bold; on the other hand, he was meek in spirit. Regarding this, we all need to learn of Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="dAK1QX3DACkGkV630vG0aHR7mNqeS02rmCc8eQITY-KFTzu6Ham8ErljFItEgmczR"> Throughout the years, both in the Far East and in the West, I have learned that much that passes for meekness is actually the playing of politics. Paul certainly was not meek in <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> this way. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85973" data-verses="Galatians 2:4">2:4</span> he speaks of “false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom.” In making such a statement, Paul surely was not political. In his choice of terms he was bold and frank. </p>
<p data-content-id="QX_dhXyrTEKgglFbpCHnW_bwiSjj0SmsScRzM7vcR1V4yTQVrfjL1P8cefckdiwb8"> Those who take the lead in the churches must learn to be honest, faithful, frank, and bold, yet all of this with meekness. We should never play politics. However, if we are short of grace and lack the wisdom to handle a particular situation, we may need to be silent. But we must never be political. </p>
<p data-content-id="RWVsQ_5NusVXYDHGxpbs0M_ZQUWROPEcjaGDW74RHmUjtOizB-mcAbBc3CjOpxqzi"> In dealing with the problem in Galatia, Paul faced a situation which was serious and very touchy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85974" data-verses="Galatians 4:20">4:20</span> he said that he was perplexed about the Galatians. He was puzzled, not knowing how to deal with these distracted believers. But even though Paul was puzzled, he did not play politics. On the contrary, he was still frank, honest, and bold. </p>
<p data-content-id="suGsx2yrlu_xHF1tfjn8zJMhiepgd_FkeXicCvRkOc4iVF8ZQC36eleSovBwPlpZv"> Playing politics is a form of lying. In the eyes of God, politics is more evil than an outright lie. This is the reason that the international political situation is so evil, so deplorable, in God’s sight. Many diplomats and ambassadors are experts at lying in a subtle way. Some have even been trained to behave in such a manner. The church is altogether another realm, another kingdom. In this realm, the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, there should not be any lying; neither should there be any playing of politics. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85975" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span> the Lord Jesus said that the Devil, Satan, is the father of lies. Since playing politics is even worse than lying, it must also issue from the devilish father of lies. Because the playing of politics is so evil and devilish, negotiations can never bring peace among the nations. How can there be peace among nations when the representatives of those nations lie and play politics? In the church, the earthly embassy of the heavenly kingdom, there should be no playing of politics. </p>
<p data-content-id="wQgrOGxTAR-3cCZQG4vA7yp-oJDYNxy-1YMzeB2bGSRwqkuXSpsZRAhutjKQMg_WA"> Paul, a good example of a heavenly ambassador, was not political in dealing with the Galatians. He spoke the truth in a frank way. You may feel that Paul was extreme in his frankness. Who else would use such a term as “false brothers”? Would you dare to call someone a false brother? Would you write a letter in which you speak of false brothers who have <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> stolen in to spy out our freedom? Probably none of us would dare to be as frank as Paul was. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85976" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">3:1</span> he addressed the believers as “foolish Galatians.” How bold, honest, and genuine Paul was! The Galatian believers certainly were foolish to turn from Christ to the law. They surely were foolish in following the Judaizers. Therefore, Paul addressed them in a bold and frank manner. Let us learn from him to be faithful and bold and not to play politics. If we lack grace or the wisdom, we may be quiet. But if we speak regarding a particular situation, we should not be political. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="LweBTzPvwX_r0vQLmZs8i7zZAIOdqyIC0CXtoxUzsH1VpY_s7C6CzRpIDMkjJ7gRf">A. Going Up to Jerusalem according to Revelation</h2><p data-content-id="mwgtjC9XS1FGoCtF4PVerTKRsL05CLGZ7EjJw3iBylk8ausrMn3Rya4C_vDviKgZU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85977" data-verses="Galatians 2:1-2">2:1 and 2</span> Paul said, “Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me also. And I went up according to revelation.” As recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85978" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span>, this happened after a number of churches had been raised up in the Gentile world by Paul’s preaching (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85979" data-verses="Acts 13:1-2">Acts 13 and 14</span>). This also indicates that Paul’s preaching of the gospel to raise up the Gentile churches had nothing to do with the believers in Jerusalem and Judea. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZPMSuZ9RJARG2mHH39cp1MOik6hZv4rLeMkbyNUB6rt7BUGo_N35-ZgE1eohkDMv_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85980" data-verses="Galatians 1:18">1:18</span> Paul speaks of going up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85981" data-verses="Galatians 2:1-2">2:1 and 2</span> we see that after a period of fourteen years, he went up to Jerusalem again, according to revelation. Not only Paul’s gospel but also his going up to Jerusalem was according to the Lord’s revelation, not according to any organization or system. His moves and activity were according to the Lord’s instant leading. This again indicates that his preaching of the gospel was not according to man’s teaching, but according to the Lord’s direct revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="AOq37-r2IeHjeXA3qsTxaaAkrAKFb1hYUFmQeMfeSSH0Z7MSjwYi0gvTHsz3tlylV"> From Paul’s experience of going up to Jerusalem after fourteen years according to revelation, we learn that it is often more difficult not to go to a certain place than it is to go there. For example, it is easy for me to make the decision to fly to London. But to refrain from doing so for fourteen years may not be easy. This requires that I be restricted. Because Paul was restricted, he did not go to Jerusalem <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> apart from revelation. However, at a certain time, according to revelation, he went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas and Titus. </p>
<p data-content-id="FgR_87l1H0LrnccVVzJZOiLx_bXsyrimHZBL91SeKVcHVN1MSKn1mYterXmbrgWIP"> Paul’s visit to Jerusalem refers to the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85982" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span>. The Judaizers had caused a great deal of trouble by telling the Gentile believers that they had to be circumcised in order to be saved. They were making circumcision a condition of God’s eternal salvation. This issue was extremely serious. According to revelation, Paul went up to Jerusalem to deal with the source of the problem. Paul did not go to Jerusalem to receive revelation or learn some new teachings. Rather, he went there according to revelation to deal with the source of a serious problem. </p>
<p data-content-id="CU-aCEAv94CWgyGmLnJX6EWeCljJoUGLo0AuX53zp3T1Hmvg_AjLyLvlpXa2-6nQD"> In this matter Paul also is a pattern for us. We should learn from his example not to go anywhere or to take any action in a light way. On the contrary, we must be restricted by the Spirit in our spirit. Whenever we go to a certain place, we should move according to revelation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="PKq_1PV3eAb4MikYTBXhWJNfPBXYFqBwb1Fvjrk6UsLnidkL0QTPNWxbRwhd0-kpK">B. Privately Laying the Gospel<br/>Which He Preached before Those of Reputation</h2><p data-content-id="-V6Wrbqi6m39muO7NhmTDh7C1WmcmJpfHhbKxAbQhJdz_rLvXvxmb2bAzAlQrlG63"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85983" data-verses="Galatians 2:2">2:2</span> Paul also says, “I laid before them the gospel which I proclaim among the nations, but privately to those of reputation, lest somehow I should be running or had run in vain.” In doing this, Paul also was restricted. If we were going up to Jerusalem in that situation, we probably would have gone up with a great deal of fanfare. Perhaps we would have sent out advertisements telling people that the apostle to the Gentile world was coming. This is the way practiced in today’s Christianity. Announcement of the coming of a well-known preacher or evangelist is made in advance in order to assure a large crowd. Paul, in contrast to the way of today’s Christianity, presented his gospel privately to certain ones. This indicates that he went up to Jerusalem privately with no intention of speaking before a large congregation. He simply wanted to contact the leading ones, the apostles and elders. This is according to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85984" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span>, which corresponds to the account in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="85985" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="3r5xmJXvfOZ4GVY3aEYeHip3Pqe0XvZOvvuIuMxp3Acx6Fq7vGqRtFtOPFZ605KPg"> In the book of Galatians Paul presents a number of contrasts between things that are superior and things that are inferior. In a foregoing message we pointed out the contrast between God’s Son and man’s religion. In this message we shall consider another contrast: freedom in Christ versus slavery under law. Christ is versus law, and freedom is versus slavery. When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86038" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapter three</span>, we shall see the contrast between the Spirit and the flesh. To touch the depths of this book, we need to keep in mind the writer’s practice of making contrasts. </p>
<p data-content-id="GCjRwqUUB2Y5qtNstg8IfK99LTJororISgr2t5rmsQf7zPSmVcRtel0rF5TEnkGCT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86039" data-verses="Galatians 2:4">2:4</span> Paul says, “And it was because of the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery.” The King James Version renders the Greek word for slavery as bondage. Although this is not wrong, the root word in Greek means to be a slave. Hence, the thought here is not simply to be in bondage, but to be enslaved, to be held in slavery. </p>
<p data-content-id="cRATS1-L3cm1MtNnkWc4VERzCTT7lCgQiyABPNg5nT87ViyZ-4pqbb-_dLxY-Hqe9"> If we would understand the contrast between freedom in Christ and slavery under law, we need a proper definition of the terms freedom and slavery. As we read these terms in the Scriptures, we may take them for granted without having a proper and adequate understanding. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86040" data-verses="Galatians 2:4">2:4</span> Paul speaks of false brothers who stole in to spy out our freedom. Such strong negative terms as “false brothers,” “stole in,” and “spy out” should impress us with the fact that freedom in Christ is <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> a great matter. Otherwise, the Judaizers, the false brothers, would not have crept in to spy out this freedom. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYatg9NpVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN"> What is this freedom in Christ? First, freedom in Christ implies liberation from obligation. Because we are free in Christ, we are no longer obligated to the law and its ordinances, practices, and regulations. Anyone who tries to keep the law makes himself a debtor to the ordinances, practices, and regulations of the law. Hence, if you try to keep the law, you will place yourself under slavery and you will serve the law as a slave. Freedom in Christ, however, liberates us from all such obligation. </p>
<p data-content-id="ELgAnKoxymVCxEU085F09PAAMOFy5e79Kcjqa9KKz-o0iNiU7mWYl8DgLsSy_YySF"> Second, freedom in Christ includes satisfaction with a rich supply. If we are free outwardly but do not have anything to support us or satisfy us, this freedom is not genuine. Proper freedom is not only liberation from obligation; it is also full satisfaction because of an adequate supply and support. </p>
<p data-content-id="KygeQ8PlDLBH2nvmKS7N8lVqun1P9lyzh2JU0Vr4XlZjGo7XUqfsMNWRRv7JIAeWe"> Third, to be free in Christ is to enjoy rest. Those who still observe the Sabbath day do not have true rest because their efforts to keep the Sabbath place them under a heavy burden. But in Christ we have true rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="lf-ra6zpDBsmQzyyZJ16f_UZMs6T8rpUTX0gibWXBynit-bMMYmuy00n-xPKw7p05"> Fourth, freedom in Christ implies the enjoyment of Christ. Because we are free in Him, we enjoy all that He is. Real freedom in Christ is the full enjoyment of the living Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="O5j0zA-qf0Mh3AhAARFQ7lmkIq4Kho1dbjbNSwkTTf9dBNb-Jl3CA_ksU2tziRdNZ"> If we would have a proper definition of freedom in Christ, a definition that matches our experience, we need to see that such a freedom involves liberation from obligations, satisfaction through the Lord’s rich supply, genuine rest, and the enjoyment of Christ. Those who have this kind of freedom are not enslaved by anything. Although Satan may sometimes put us into a difficult situation, we can still be at rest. We need not be enslaved by any situation. Instead, we can enjoy the Lord. This means that we are free in the depths of our being. This is our freedom in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="4_qA8Hy-y0ewiG9-6MsH-MoP9MIh9UkArgTfy6n1bWzEZGnixsWeAeScztLyq67eK"> As you consider this description of freedom in Christ, you will find that it corresponds to your experience with the Lord. Our experience may differ in degree, but it does not differ in nature. <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="oU2lAEAfF60Z32GAq6eomfHJlPeI_1Hvg7_2rk0Sn_tuTwbA7nRurGY_QO909OTcO"> Freedom in Christ is a treasure. Satan, the subtle one, sent in the Judaizers to spy out this freedom and to deprive the Galatian believers of this treasure. He wanted to take away their liberation from obligation and their satisfaction, their rest, and their enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="3r5xmJXvfOZ4GVY3aEYeHip3PqelYvZOvvuIuMxp3Acx6Fq7vGqRtFtOPFZ605KPg"> Once we have a proper understanding of freedom in Christ, it is easy to understand what slavery is. It is the opposite of freedom. Slavery under law obligates us to the law with its commandments, ordinances, practices, and regulations. However, no one can fulfill the requirements of the law. Most of the Ten Commandments control people outwardly. But the commandment related to coveting exercises an inward control. We may be able to keep the other commandments, but not this one. We simply cannot escape the greediness within us. For example, we may see someone with a new pen that is better than ours. Deep within, we desire to have a pen just like it. This is covetousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="GCjRwqUUB2Y5qtNstg8IfK99LTJ1norISgr2t5rmsQf7zPSmVcRtel0rF5TEnkGCT"> Because we all have human shortcomings, we cannot fulfill the requirements of the law. Throughout history, only one person—the Lord Jesus—has kept the law. The requirements of the law are too heavy for us to fulfill. If we try to keep the law, we come under the yoke of the law. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86041" data-verses="Acts 15:10">Acts 15:10</span> Peter said, “Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?” Slavery under law is this yoke. </p>
<p data-content-id="cRATS1-L3cm1MtNnkWc4VERzCTTioCgQiyABPNg5nT87ViyZ-4pqbb-_dLxY-Hqe9"> To be enslaved under the law also means to be without satisfaction. Under the law there is no satisfaction because there is no supply. The law makes demands, but it offers no supply to meet those demands. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYatg9orVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN"> Furthermore, with slavery under law it is not possible for us to be at rest. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86042" data-verses="Matthew 11:28">Matthew 11:28</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Come to Me all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.” This promise was spoken especially to those who were trying to keep the law. It refers in particular to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations. To have rest here means to be set free from labor and burden under law and religion. In making this declaration, the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, “Come <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> to Me, all who are burdened under the law, and I will release you. I will set you free from the yoke of the law. Under the law, you have no rest. True rest is found in Me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ELgAnKoxymVCxEU085F09PAAMOFT6e79Kcjqa9KKz-o0iNiU7mWYl8DgLsSy_YySF"> Finally, with slavery under law there is no enjoyment of Christ. Those who place themselves under obligation to the law have no satisfaction, rest, or enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="DEb9lLplhJh_b-ToTExfg9uMfDfifqBAmO_hOEwnHQvhFVJvBhvWxecGMMAdTQUXF"> If we consider this contrast between freedom in Christ and slavery under law, we shall be full of praise to the Lord. In Christ we have been liberated from all manner of obligation. In Him we also have satisfaction, rest, and enjoyment. This freedom in Christ is versus slavery under law. Many of us can testify that we have such liberation, satisfaction, rest, and enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sg88U9K0yJlgyYkOTTYYeg-znE8ujC0LNRDbxGhs9u9M3IxMpYooF2YKtp-9frUCd"> Concerning New Testament truth, Galatians is a more basic book than Colossians. Colossians deals with Christian experience, but Galatians touches the basic truths of the New Testament. Galatians is even more basic than Romans. Galatians is the most basic book with respect to God’s New Testament economy. This book is unique in its revelation of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESWBgW_wcLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS"> The slavery under law spoken of in Galatians is not the same as the slavery of the children of Israel under Pharaoh. These two kinds of slavery should not be confused. Egypt was satanic, whereas the law is spiritual and was given by God. Realizing this distinction will help us to be impressed with the fact that no other New Testament book presents the basic truths in the way Galatians does. </p>

<p data-content-id="N78TKjbEXVwSfszdd30oED09uvQ9WQ--ofRmWsRF1_iiqC8arZJbwvJC5VunnOdmn"> We need to see something further concerning slavery under law. The law was typified by Hagar, Abraham’s concubine, who had no proper standing. This indicates that in God’s promise and grace, the law has no position (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86043" data-verses="Galatians 4:24-25">4:24-25</span>). As Abraham’s wife, Sarah had the proper position in God’s promise and grace. The wife could even tell Abraham to cast <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> out the maidservant and her son. This shows that the law typified by Hagar has no position in God’s promise and grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAMs0xEFj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1"> The Seventh-Day Adventists need to hear such a word. In obligating themselves to keep the Sabbath, they place themselves in the position of a concubine. When they do this, they have no position in God’s grace. </p>

The word truth in these verses does not mean the doctrine or teaching of the gospel; it denotes the reality of the gospel. Although Galatians is a short book, it affords us a complete revelation of the reality of the gospel. This revelation, however, is given not in detail, but in certain basic principles. Therefore, in this message we shall cover the truth of the gospel revealed in these basic principles. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAMj0xVJj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1">I. MAN NOT JUSTIFIED BY WORKS OF LAW</h2><p data-content-id="hwMadJIZ14zUSl3gCcShY89tRJQqBmfydHXU1tIkWKzKdKgtXF3CB5KwOuJngqEmP"> The first aspect of the truth of the gospel is that fallen man cannot be justified by works of law. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86067" data-verses="Galatians 2:16">2:16</span> Paul says, “Knowing that a man is not justified by works of law.” At the end of this verse Paul declares, “By works of law no flesh shall be justified.” The word flesh in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86068" data-verses="Galatians 2:16">2:16</span> means fallen man who has become flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86069" data-verses="Genesis 6:3">Gen. 6:3</span>). No such man will be justified by works of law. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86070" data-verses="Galatians 3:11">3:11</span> Paul goes on to say, “Now that by law no one is justified before God is evident.” In these verses Paul tells us clearly that no one is justified by works of law. </p>
<p data-content-id="U0hKzeGUKiJ9Ln5z4YNTcfeVQbLwZWosB97DAfeztAm8eOk3lOS0ACBjVbUPD323A"> The Seventh-Day Adventists insist on strict observance of the Sabbath. However, they seem to forget that by endeavoring to keep the law with respect to the Sabbath, they make themselves debtors to keep all the commandments. The New Testament says that if we keep all the commandments except one, we transgress the whole law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86071" data-verses="James 2:10">James 2:10</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86072" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> proves that we cannot keep all the commandments. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86073" data-verses="Romans 7:7">verse 7</span> Paul refers to the commandment <span class="pg" data-page-id="70" id="70">[70]</span> about coveting: “I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86074" data-verses="Romans 7:8">verse 8</span> he goes on to say, “But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, wrought in me coveting of every kind.” The more Paul tried to keep this commandment, the more he failed. This indicates that it is impossible for fallen man to keep all of God’s commandments. How ridiculous it is to go back to the law and try to keep it! We simply do not have the ability to keep the law. As Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86075" data-verses="Romans 7:14">Romans 7:14</span>, the law is spiritual, but we are fleshly, sold under sin. Therefore, by works of law shall no flesh be justified. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MW1PrIO1NZkL7m7Ua0gn0XKBOLZ84yxZO7paon9rt0Llao3pVSvH-BXWTu0cTco71">II. LAW BEING THE CUSTODIAN<br/>TO KEEP GOD’S CHOSEN PEOPLE UNTIL CHRIST CAME</h2><p data-content-id="CU-aCEAv94CWgyGmLnJX6EWeMljJgUGLo0AuX53zp3T1Hmvg_AjLyLvlpXa2-6nQD"> Since it is not possible for fallen man to keep the law, we may ask why the law was given. It was not God’s intention in giving the law that man should keep it. When God gave the law, He knew that man would not be able to keep it. God’s purpose in giving the law was to use it as a custodian to keep His people until Christ came (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86076" data-verses="Galatians 3:23-24">3:23-24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86077" data-verses="Galatians 4:2">4:2</span>). God’s intention was to use the law as a fold in which to keep His sheep. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKq_1PV3eAb4MikYTBXhWJNfBBXYNqBwb1Fvjrk6UsLnidkL0QTPNWxbRwhd0-kpK"> Perhaps you are wondering why Christ did not come earlier than He did. Why did He not come at the time of Moses? If Christ had come sixteen hundred years earlier, there would have been no need for the law. Why did He not come before the law was given? The best way to answer this question is to turn to the Scriptures. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86078" data-verses="Romans 3:19-20">Romans 3:19 and 20</span> say, “Now we know that whatever things the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become subject to the judgment of God; because by the works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for by law is knowledge of sin.” </p>
<p data-content-id="-V6Wrbqi6m39muO7NhmTDh7C7WmQkJpfHhbKxAbQhJdz_rLvXvxmb2bAzAlQrlG63"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86079" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">Galatians 3:19</span> Paul asks, “Why then the law?” In the same verse he answers his own question: “It was added because of transgressions.” The law was given to expose what man is and where man is. The best way for man to be exposed is to cause his situation to be seen in the light of <span class="pg" data-page-id="71" id="71">[71]</span> God’s attributes. The Ten Commandments are composed mainly of four divine attributes: holiness, righteousness, light, and love. God is holy and righteous; He is also light and love. If you look into the Ten Commandments, you will see that they embody the divine holiness, righteousness, light, and love. For this reason, the law became God’s testimony. In other words, the Ten Commandments testify that God is holy and righteous and that God is light and love. God used this testimony to expose man. As man stands before this testimony, his sinfulness is exposed. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1lTdeqpfiM5O4JJibZTHmVgox8pMU3Ocr4jsEOQAzOWGr2bvXZul_bdpDy_0-9KZ"> When the law was given, the children of Israel promised to obey God’s commandments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86080" data-verses="Exodus 19:8">Exo. 19:8</span>). Before the children of Israel responded in this way, the atmosphere around Mount Sinai was not threatening. But when the people declared that they would keep God’s commandments, the atmosphere changed and became terrifying. God exercised His holiness, and the people were not allowed to approach further. Frightened by the manifestation of God’s holiness, the people asked Moses to go to God on their behalf. This indicates that the function of the law is to expose fallen mankind. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGJw21xvx_4iyiGpDEqnpkGvyX3DbqUVmjkRTasq1cTT8ENWrMNtao5xjcOTyhFf0"> As the law functions to expose people, it keeps them. Thus, the law was used by God as a custodian to keep His people just as a fold keeps a flock of sheep during the winter or during a storm. The time before the coming of Christ can be compared to a winter season. Hence, God used the law as a fold in which to guard the people. In their blindness the Judaizers thought that the law had been given for them to keep. They did not realize that the law was given to guard God’s people in custody. Paul makes this basic principle clear in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86081" data-verses="Galatians 3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>. “But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86082" data-verses="Galatians 3:24">verse 24</span> he goes on to say, “So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.” These verses reveal clearly that the law functions as a custodian. As it exposed man’s transgression, it guarded God’s people until Christ came. <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="WA9v3u5-3Lwi17H2ixIskGrIGSqrorXkuEq15-Op_KCV9NmwKiBW9UQjWZtKTZiSu"> Now that Christ has come, the law is over. But the foolish Judaizers wanted to go back to the law and try to keep it. They did not realize that the law has a dispensational function. When this function has been fulfilled, the law should not remain any longer. The stubborn Judaizers did not know God’s purpose in giving the law. Therefore, even after Christ came, they held to the law. This is against the basic principle of God’s economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2a2q7x6_ya-MrF4vWREnskCntQyqiLNKn4UAmFZ6n1uV18kympe4IfkgeG_OZh2ep">III. LAW BEING OVER AFTER CHRIST CAME</h2><p data-content-id="uc7kzXp0thJHgKfcmJ22Wl023-H7RCa-RsBkJeSW3J8W-fJ2HPsWWLCVwvllAti1T"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86083" data-verses="Galatians 3:25">3:25</span> Paul says, “But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.” Since Christ has come, the law is over. The Seventh-Day Adventists need to learn this basic truth. Now that Christ has come, God’s purpose in giving the law has been fulfilled. The law has handed God’s people over to Christ. It is rebellion against God’s economy to snatch the people away from Christ and lead them back to the law. We must be bold to tell the Seventh-Day Adventists that, as Christians, we must not go back to the law. The law has fulfilled its purpose. </p>

<p data-content-id="Hlq_gUShg2G7IhotoZBaNpfjI5ftrJVlHrXNP3YQSM19wOBoXfa9nS1og1JwPplH9"> Under God’s New Testament economy, we are not to keep the law. On the contrary, we are justified by faith in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86084" data-verses="Galatians 2:16">2:16</span>). We may be so familiar with the expression “justified by faith in Christ” that we take it for granted. But what actually is faith in Christ, and what does it mean to be justified by faith in Christ? Faith in Christ denotes an organic union through believing. The proper preaching of the gospel is not the preaching of a doctrine; it is the preaching of the Person of the Son of God. The Son of God is the embodiment of the Father and is realized as the Spirit. To preach the gospel is to preach this Person. Whenever we preach the gospel, we must impress those who hear us with the living Person of the Son of God. No matter what the subject of our gospel message may be, the focal point of our preaching must be this living Person. <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> </p>

The crucial point in that message was the organic union with Christ which takes place spontaneously when we believe in Christ. In this message we shall go on to see that we have died to law so that we might live to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86099" data-verses="Galatians 2:19">2:19</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nx8SwJqAHSCfDXHqBW34mrU2Tb2TMNkVdfHur975RksbbmfglvanrtbLMme-cP2Wn">ORGANIC UNION</h2><p data-content-id="6dR3l0TKVK5BVc1WfrOnHw6y_ctka9O55ZdMpdNdldLArsZ1aOoLZ1aATo3wP97vY"> How can we die to law in order to live to God? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86100" data-verses="Galatians 2:19">Galatians 2:19</span> indicates that we have already died to law. According to your experience, have you actually died to law, or is this simply a matter of doctrine to you? Furthermore, how can we live to God? If we would answer these questions, we must know the truth, the reality, of the gospel. If we are not actually organically united with Christ but are in ourselves, then we are neither dead to law nor are we living to God. Apart from the organic union with Christ, we cannot live to God. On the contrary, we shall be alive to many things other than God. </p>
<p data-content-id="RWVsQ_5NusVXYDHGxpbs0M_ZfUW0EPEcjaGDW74RHmUjtOizB-mcAbBc3CjOpxqzi"> The concept of organic union is implied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86101" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. In this chapter Paul uses the illustration of married life. Marriage is a union of life. In this union the wife is one with the husband, and the husband is one with the wife. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86102" data-verses="Romans 7:4">Romans 7:4</span> Paul speaks of our being married to Christ: “So that, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you might marry another, even Him Who has been raised from among the dead.” According to this verse, we have been married to the resurrected Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> Between Him as the Bridegroom and us as the Bride, there is a wonderful union. We are one with Him in person, name, life, and existence. This shows that our Christian life is a life of organic oneness with Christ. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86104" data-verses="Romans 11:17-24">Romans 11:17-24</span> Paul uses the illustration of branches from a wild olive tree being grafted into a cultivated olive tree. As a result of grafting, the branches from the wild olive tree and the cultivated olive tree grow together organically. We, branches of the wild olive tree, have been grafted into Christ, the cultivated olive tree. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYajg9ojVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN"> Some may say that the cultivated olive tree in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86105" data-verses="Romans 11:1">Romans 11</span> refers to Israel. Although this is correct, it is also true that in the Bible the real Israel is always identified with Christ, and Christ with the real Israel. In the eyes of God, there are not two trees on earth. There is just one tree, the olive tree which includes Christ and God’s chosen people. Once we were wild olive branches, but now we have been grafted into Christ. This illustration indicates that the Christian life is not an exchanged life, the exchange of a lower life for a higher one, but a grafted life, the grafting of the human life into the life of Christ. After a branch has been grafted into another tree, it no longer lives by itself. On the contrary, it lives by the tree into which it has been grafted. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ELgAnKoxymVCxEU085F09PAACOFTye79Kcjqa9KKz-o0iNiU7mWYl8DgLsSy_YySF">CUTTING AND JOINING</h2><p data-content-id="DEb9lLplhJh_b-ToTExfg9uMRDfudqBAmO_hOEwnHQvhFVJvBhvWxecGMMAdTQUXF"> In the matter of grafting, there are two main aspects: cutting and joining or uniting. Without the cutting, there cannot be any grafting. If the branch from one tree is to be grafted into another tree, the branch must firstly be cut. After the cutting occurs, the joining or union takes place. This union is organic. Therefore, in grafting we have the cutting, the joining, and the organic union. The cutting corresponds to the death of Christ, and the uniting, to the resurrection of Christ. In the death of Christ our old life was cut off, and in Christ’s resurrection we were united to Him for further growth. The experience of the death of Christ causes us to die <span class="pg" data-page-id="79" id="79">[79]</span> to the law, whereas resurrection enables us to live to God. Hence, to be dead to the law and alive to God implies the death and resurrection of Christ. Only by being grafted into Christ can we be one with Him in His death and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sg88U9K0yJlgyYkOTTYYeg-zpE8ihC0LNRDbxGhs9u9M3IxMpYooF2YKtp-9frUCd"> In ourselves it is not possible for us to die to law or live to God. However, when the preciousness of the Lord Jesus was infused into us and we began to appreciate Him, we were grafted into Him. On the one hand, we were cut; on the other hand, we were joined to Christ in His resurrection life. After this union took place, we were organically united with Christ. Now we should simply live in this organic union. On the negative side, we have been cut in Christ’s death; on the positive side, we have been united to Christ in His resurrection. In this cutting we died not only to the law, but to everything other than God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86106" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">Galatians 6</span>, we are dead to the world, particularly to the religious world, through the crucifixion of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86107" data-verses="Galatians 6:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>). By the all-inclusive cutting of Christ’s all-inclusive death on the cross, we are dead to everything other than God. Because we have been grafted into Christ, His experience has become our history. When He died on the cross, we died in Him. When He was crucified, we were cut off from the wild olive tree. This means that we were cut off from the self, the flesh, the world, religion, and the law with its ordinances. Furthermore, because we have been grafted into Christ, His resurrection has also become our history. Therefore, we can strongly declare that with Christ we have been crucified, buried, and resurrected. What a wonderful history we have! </p>
<p data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESWPgWz2cLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS"> Having been cut off from everything other than God, we are dead to religion, including Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. One aspect of our history includes the crucifixion by which we have been cut off from everything other than God. But the other aspect of this history includes the resurrection in which we have been united to the Triune God. In this union, we are absolutely one with the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrDQeI5BWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-"> It is crucial that we all see this vision. However, few Christians have seen it. If we see the vision of this organic union, <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> our living will be changed. We shall realize that we have been cut off from the old source and united to the living One. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5euwGBFk7L_E9dzcXZ8PUzynW3r0lMSqW8T1Z9BMt24AQwhyvAVjySQuKVWJUZej3">BY FAITH IN CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="N78TKjbEXVwSfszdd30oED09gvQxUQ--ofRmWsRF1_iiqC8arZJbwvJC5VunnOdmn"> It is by faith in Christ that we enter into such an organic union with Him. We have pointed out that faith is the appreciation of Jesus. This appreciation is implied even in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86108" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>. In this verse we see that we have been crucified with Christ. This refers to one aspect of our history. We also see that Christ lives in us and that the life that we now live in the flesh we live in the faith of the Son of God who loved us and gave Himself for us. It is significant that in this verse Paul specifically refers to the Son of God as the One “who loved me.” If we do not have any consciousness of Christ’s love for us, we shall not be able to have faith in Him. Living faith comes from our sense of His love. This indicates that the faith by which we believe in Him is related to our appreciation of His loveliness. As we sense His preciousness, spontaneously an appreciation for Him wells up within us. This appreciation is our faith. When Paul referred to the Son of God as the One who “loved me and gave Himself for me,” he was filled with appreciation for the Lord Jesus. This appreciation is the very faith about which he speaks in this verse. The life he lived in the flesh he lived in this faith, the faith of the Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAMi0xILj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1"> Whenever we say from the depths of our heart, “Lord Jesus, I love You,” our faith is strengthened. Our organic union with Christ is strengthened also. Furthermore, we sense that we have been cut away from sin, the world, the flesh, and religion. Some who have seen the light concerning the church have not been willing to give up the denominations. But one day they told the Lord how much they loved Him. Spontaneously they had the sense within that they should give up their association with the denominations. Because their organic union with Christ was strengthened, they experienced more cutting. The more we say, “Lord Jesus, I love You,” the more we sense that we have been cut off from everything other than Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> </p>

In this verse is one of the basic items of God’s New Testament economy: no longer I, but Christ living in me. According to God’s economy, we should no longer live; rather, Christ should live in us. This is a basic aspect of the truth of the gospel. However, most Christians do not have the proper and adequate understanding of what it means to say no longer I, but Christ living in me. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CU-aCEAv94CWgyGmLnJX6EWaEljUqUGLo0AuX53zp3T1Hmvg_AjLyLvlpXa2-6nQD">NOT AN EXCHANGED LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="PKq_1PV3eAb4MikYTBXhWJNbJBXBGqBwb1Fvjrk6UsLnidkL0QTPNWxbRwhd0-kpK"> Because this has not been made clear, some Christians, including certain Christian teachers, think that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86126" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span> speaks of what has been called an exchanged life. According to this concept, we are replaced by Christ. Christ comes in, and we go out. According to the concept of an exchanged life, our life is pitiful, and the life of Christ is far better. Therefore, we should exchange our life for Christ’s life. As we shall see, this concept is wrong. </p>
<p data-content-id="-V6Wrbqi6m39muO7NhmTDh7GzWm1sJpfHhbKxAbQhJdz_rLvXvxmb2bAzAlQrlG63"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86127" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> does not speak of an exchanged life. Here Paul says, “No longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” Then he goes on to say, “And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.” On the one hand, Paul says, “It is no longer I who live”; on the other hand, he says, “I live.” If you consider this verse as a whole, you will see that there is no thought of an exchanged life. Here what is presented is not an exchange; rather, it is a profound mystery. <span class="pg" data-page-id="86" id="86">[86]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="p1lTdeqpfiM5O4JJibZTHmVkgx8IFU3Ocr4jsEOQAzOWGr2bvXZul_bdpDy_0-9KZ"> We have pointed out that the book of Galatians reveals the basic truths of God’s New Testament economy. Among these basic truths, the most basic one is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86128" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span>. Because the truth of no longer I, but Christ living in me is so basic, it is also mysterious; and because it is mysterious, it has not been properly understood by Christians throughout the centuries. Therefore, we look to the Lord that He would make this basic truth clear to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="foiLIlvcS80gCzQLJEjLx1zxDlA7oeKfvi_9m0_XuzDf4uNd_MonuQ67A3GsUpFID">THE OLD “I” AND THE NEW “I”</h2><p data-content-id="IEVFDlaYVRjSRK71dHxvanxLRiFioXn-0yai8TnmSQ0mIPD3pnj0_KMZCVI_UK25d"> We have pointed out that in this verse Paul says, on the one hand, “no longer I” and, on the other hand, “I live.” How can we reconcile this? Once again I wish to point out that this is not an exchange of life. The way to interpret the Bible properly is by the Bible itself. This means that other verses are needed if we are to understand this verse. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86129" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Romans 6:6</span> tells us that our old man has been crucified with Christ. This verse helps us to see that the very I who has been crucified with Christ is the old “I,” the old man. As regenerated people, we have both an old “I” and a new “I.” The old “I” has been terminated, but the new “I” lives. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86130" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> we have both the old “I” and the new “I.” The old “I” has been crucified with Christ, terminated. Therefore, Paul can say, “no longer I.” However, the new “I” still lives. For this reason, Paul can say, “I live.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Hlq_gUShg2G7IhotoZBaNpfnA5fhpJVlHrXNP3YQSM19wOBoXfa9nS1og1JwPplH9"> Now we must go on to see the difference between the old “I” and the new “I.” Because we are so familiar with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86131" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span>, we may take this verse for granted and assume that we understand it. But what is the difference between the old “I” and the new “I”? According to the natural understanding, some would say that the old “I” is evil, whereas the new “I” is good. This concept of the difference between the old “I” and the new “I” must be rejected. The old “I” had nothing of God in it, whereas the new “I” has received the divine life. The old “I” has become a new “I” because God as life has been added to it. The “I” that has been terminated is the “I” that was without divinity. The “I” who still lives is the “I” into which God has been added. There is a great difference here. <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> The old “I,” the “I” without God, has been terminated. But the new “I” still lives, the “I” that came into being when the old “I” was resurrected and had God added to it. On the one hand, Paul has been terminated. But, on the other hand, a resurrected Paul, one with God as his life, still lives. </p>
<p data-content-id="X2KpgkkTGpuer9ChrLtbTP3RJQweppPE30oZb2NYjLrZPMqVCuoyr2w9p0BOI3Rme"> Because of their rejection of God’s light many Christians are blind to this understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86132" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span>. If they heard such a word about the old “I” and the new “I,” they would reject it. Their rejection, however, would be completely without ground. As genuine Christians, they have been regenerated. When a person is regenerated, he is not annihilated or destroyed. To be regenerated means to have God added into us. In regeneration, we who once did not have God in us now have Him added to us. The very “I” who did not have God in it is over. This is the old “I,” the old man, who has been crucified with Christ. But from the time that we began to appreciate the Lord Jesus and the operating faith began to work in us, this faith brought the processed Triune God into us and added Him to our being. From that time onward, we have had a new “I,” an “I” with God in it. Hence, the new “I” is the old “I” which has become an “I” resurrected with God added to it. Praise the Lord that the old “I” has been terminated and the new “I” now lives! </p>

But we need a more thorough understanding of what it means to say that Christ lives <em>in us.</em> It is rather easy to understand that Christ lives. But it is difficult to understand how Christ lives in us. This does not mean that I have been crucified and live no longer, and that Christ lives instead of me. On the one hand, Paul said, “no longer I”; on the other hand, he said, “Christ lives in me.” The phrase “in me” is of great importance. Yes, it is Christ who lives, but it is in us that He lives. </p>

Before His death and resurrection, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> Lord Jesus said to the disciples, “Because I live, you shall live also” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86135" data-verses="John 14:19">v. 19</span>). Christ lives in us by causing us to live with Him. Christ does not live alone. He lives in us and with us. He lives by enabling us to live with Him. In a very real sense, if we do not live with Him, He cannot live in us. We have not been altogether ruled out, and our life has not been exchanged for the divine life. We continue to exist, but we exist with the Triune God. The Triune God who now dwells within us causes us to live with Christ. Hence, Christ lives in us through our living with Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aary53Wx3h7_PLJIcdmPvYGWO_giv3BQkZf5Js31NuzMk7UHLOZ9EuU39xv2VI18i">ONE LIFE AND ONE LIVING</h2><p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uT820DRKz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> Once again the illustration of grafting helps our understanding. After a branch has been grafted into a productive tree, the branch continues to live. However, it lives not by itself, but by the tree into which it has been grafted. Furthermore, the tree lives in the branch which has been grafted into it. The branch now lives a grafted life. This means that it lives, not by itself, but by the life of the tree into which it has been grafted. Furthermore, this other life, the life of the productive tree, does not live by itself, but through the branch grafted into it. The life of the tree lives in the branch. Eventually, the branch and the tree have one life with one living. In the same principle, we and Christ also have one life and one living. </p>
<p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZz5IoSfPB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86136" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span> the Lord Jesus said, “As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me.” The Son did not live by Himself. However, this does not mean that the Son was set aside and ceased to exist. The Son, of course, continued to exist, but He did not live His own life. Instead, He lived the life of the Father. In this way the Son and the Father had one life and one living. They shared the same life and had the same living. </p>

This is a strong indication that for us as believers to nullify the grace of God is for us to deny Christ the opportunity to live in us. The grace of God is simply the living Christ Himself. To allow Christ to live in us is to enjoy the grace of God. But not to allow Him to live in us is to nullify God’s grace. </p>

The promise of grace had also been made to Abraham; it was given before the law was. First, God gave the promise of grace to Abraham. Then, four hundred thirty years later, the law was given at Mount Sinai through Moses. Approximately another fifteen hundred years passed before grace came with Jesus Christ, with the incarnated Son of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="kWWIR_PfYdTAivJZe4CjaMml3eJ0CXYMQN8Lfl4WOobFn7DmNjazJgeo2POKKCOfK"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86170" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86171" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>, the Word that was in the beginning with God and which was God became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86172" data-verses="John 1:16">Verse 16</span> says, “For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.” Since grace came with Jesus Christ, grace was not yet present in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="JXqZnZhBWTHYr5N7Yht-3oFpqtZGmjmP3ypdcLgaJCkerNiqlRD_Yss6rPYP8xAja"> Now we must give a definition of grace. Grace is God in His Trinity processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to be everything to us. After passing through such a long process, the Triune God has become everything to us. He is our redemption, salvation, life, and sanctification. Having been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the Triune God Himself is our grace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAIq0xIDj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1">GREATER THAN THE LAW</h2><p data-content-id="hwMadJIZ14zUSl3gCcShY89pYJQzKmfydHXU1tIkWKzKdKgtXF3CB5KwOuJngqEmP"> If we would understand grace as revealed in the New Testament, we need a clear view of the New Testament as a whole. Grace is a matter of tremendous significance. To the Jews, the giving of the law through Moses was a great event. The fact that the coming of grace is contrasted with the giving of the law indicates that grace is greater than the law. As far as the Jews were concerned, apart from God Himself nothing was greater than the law. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86173" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> indicates that grace is greater than the law. The law was given, but grace came. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="U0hKzeGUKiJ9Ln5z4YNTcfeRZbLVRWosB97DAfeztAm8eOk3lOS0ACBjVbUPD323A">THE SON OF GOD LIVING IN US</h2><p data-content-id="MW1PrIO1NZkL7m7Ua0gn0XKFHLZdxyxZO7paon9rt0Llao3pVSvH-BXWTu0cTco71"> According to the concept of many Christians, God’s grace is mainly a matter of material blessing. At the end of the year, some Christians gather together to count the blessings God has bestowed on them during that year and to thank Him for His great grace in sending these blessings. Then they proceed to thank the Lord for things such as a large home and new clothes. Such a concept of grace is much too poor! The Apostle Paul would count such things as dung, not as grace. <span class="pg" data-page-id="97" id="97">[97]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="VJs2_qQSmWRN5nwRMAwzi45ghsx-2h5WHZfAUFc9qWR3k9ARa10q6C3SazdmHHl0y"> We have pointed out that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86174" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>, grace is greater than the law. Surely God Himself is higher than the law. However, if God remains objective to us, in our experience He will not be greater than the law. In order to be greater than the law to us, the Triune God must be subjective. Hence, in the New Testament, grace denotes the Triune God processed to become everything to us and to live in us. Nothing can surpass the living in us of the processed, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="iIHmCvd9sgkOSusZIiEhvMwV7T3s-J4zuIWsbFnSjjf0sUscYCF5zbaUImx-kg4jH"> We have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86175" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span> Paul says that he has been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in him. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86176" data-verses="Galatians 2:21">verse 21</span> he goes on to say that he does not nullify the grace of God. This indicates that the grace of God is the Son of God living in us. Certainly this is much greater than the law. The Son of God was incarnated not only to live on earth, to be crucified, to be resurrected, and to ascend into the heavens; He also came to live in us. This is grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="1d2f_9YogZuGF0F3RaAqS-3zbBir65hkqULOa_lPpNjzrwTnOsnp1GD0BnfWBbdhG"> To go back to the law is to reject this grace. It is to reject the very Son of God who now lives in us. This is to nullify the grace of God. However, if we remain in Christ, enjoying Him as everything to us, we do not nullify the grace of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="9EjNkeFQzuB7lPrvBx2r4mQxCSeQu3MjL5KX4WKv8J4ijozWWaX1GBnucISX6mYPk"> All of Paul’s Epistles begin and end with a word about grace. This is also true of the book of Revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86177" data-verses="Revelation 1:4">Revelation 1:4</span> John writes to the seven churches which are in Asia, “Grace to you”; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86178" data-verses="Revelation 22:21">22:21</span>, he concludes with the words, “The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints.” Paul closes the Epistle to the Galatians by saying, “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.” If grace were a matter of material blessing, how could grace be with our spirit? Grace is not physical or material; it is divine and spiritual. Actually, as we have pointed out emphatically, grace is God Himself in a subjective way to be everything for our enjoyment. I hope that all the saints could grasp this definition of grace in a clear way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jNHNoHhxt7cbszaVs2RjRHRDC_wBWx3ISFPf8Kuf5Jq3AWG9Juh2vq7g1OiSkI5wf">WHAT GRACE DOES FOR US</h2><p data-content-id="Tc7W4PPlRfP7IyYTOzL7seroQV7ut7DFEWMttoR7ZAF4gSuisrqcMjelyDWtvV_KY"> Let us now consider according to the New Testament what this grace has done for us and what it will do for us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> Although man was created in God’s image and likeness in order to express Him and represent Him, man became fallen. In the fall man not only did something wrong outwardly, but the very nature of sin was injected into man’s being. Hence, outwardly we are sinful, and inwardly we are evil. Before the righteous God, our conduct is sinful, and in the eyes of the holy God, our nature is evil. Furthermore, there is nothing we can do about our situation. It is utterly foolish for fallen man to go to the law and endeavor to keep it. Even if we could keep the law, what would we do about our evil nature? How we must praise God for His grace and for what it has done for us! First, the Triune God became incarnated to live on earth to fulfill the requirements of God’s righteous and holy law. Having fulfilled the law’s requirements, He went to the cross and died there for our sins as our substitute. Through His death Christ has redeemed us. Therefore, redemption is the first item of what God’s grace has accomplished for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="nx8SwJqAHSCfDXHqBW34mrUybb2CGNkVdfHur975RksbbmfglvanrtbLMme-cP2Wn"> After accomplishing redemption through His death, Christ was resurrected from among the dead to release the divine life from within Him. In resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit to be received by those who will appreciate Him, love Him, believe in Him, call on Him, and repent. As soon as a sinner responds to Him in this way, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into that one and through regeneration is born in him. Is this not an aspect of God’s grace? It is the second item of what God’s grace has done for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="6dR3l0TKVK5BVc1WfrOnHw623ctxR9O55ZdMpdNdldLArsZ1aOoLZ1aATo3wP97vY"> Third, from the time of our regeneration, Christ has been dwelling in our spirit to live in us and with us. By living in us, Christ enables us to have the kind of living that satisfies God. In His grace, Christ lives in us and with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="RWVsQ_5NusVXYDHGxpbs0M_dXUWdMPEcjaGDW74RHmUjtOizB-mcAbBc3CjOpxqzi"> As Christ lives within us, He also ministers all His riches into our being in order to sanctify us, transform us, and make us sons of God in reality and practicality. In this way, we enjoy full sonship. </p>

<p data-content-id="8QMBpb5u2uHUGqYhAKQo7aPkhYyqGuq03b-0CqpSXjxqjeY42vbmKdMawdZNSBkiv"> In the foregoing message we considered the grace of God. In this message we come to Christ crucified. Christ crucified has a great deal to do with our enjoyment of God’s grace. The enjoyment of the grace of God is altogether dependent on the crucifixion of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0BpDaFkHtIhH2qZitqny5KzDydRk-t6aFanb0dnnLD-DF8DEA-y-PlCDROzpEYzWE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86200" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">3:1</span> Paul says, “O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified?” The crucifixion of Christ indicates that all the requirements of the law have been fulfilled by the death of Christ, and that Christ through His death has released His life that it may be imparted into us in His resurrection to free us from bondage under the law. This was fully portrayed before the eyes of the Galatians in the word of the gospel. How could they neglect this and be bewitched, drifting back to the law? How foolish! </p>
<p data-content-id="7EjiJiKSogg44JUcqVx5SCLRqPkG9zVQuzRHXmWHEsrf9X58XGzqK5yeH8wP2vo49"> Before the eyes of the Galatians, Christ had openly been portrayed crucified. Paul wondered how the Galatian believers could forget such a portrait. Those who go back to the law have nothing to do with such a crucified Christ. If God wants us to keep the law and if we are able to keep it, then there was no need for Christ to be crucified. For this reason, Paul declares in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86201" data-verses="Galatians 2:21">2:21</span>, “If righteousness is through law, then Christ has died for nothing.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86202" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3:1</span> is the direct continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86203" data-verses="Galatians 2:21">2:21</span>. Christ certainly was not crucified without cause. On the contrary, He was crucified for a very great cause. In fact, the cross is the center of God’s operation in His economy, just as Christ Himself is the center of God’s economy. In the carrying out of God’s economy, <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> the cross is the center. Without Christ, God’s economy has no center, and without the cross of Christ the operation of God’s economy is without a center. Thus, the carrying out of God’s economy wholly depends on the cross of Christ. The cross is the center of God’s operation in the universe to carry out His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="_Fv0JBBWQcCEA6UxPCM9K1DhSAR-CRb8K6GGkuofFK8ArsuS12Lmc3gY7CCOW-tTq"> This is the reason that in such a short book Paul many times refers to the cross. He constantly brings us back to the cross. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86204" data-verses="Galatians 2:21">2:21</span> Paul points out that Christ was not crucified for nothing. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86205" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">3:1</span> he goes on to remind the Galatians that the crucifixion of Christ was openly portrayed before their eyes. When Paul came to Galatia, he preached a crucified Christ. In order to be righteous, we need such a Christ. If we could have righteousness through keeping the law, then we would not need a crucified Christ. If this had been the case, there would have been no reason for Christ to die. </p>
<p data-content-id="BgIbIp-MeDbB3RxdRZnnJtwvOlgKRdAdTbG5ey5q42AyqhNIGlvz2jYlJOf2dgoh7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86206" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">3:1</span> Paul brought the Galatians back to the cross. He wanted them to have a thorough look at the crucified Christ. In this message I am burdened that we also have such a view of Christ crucified. Therefore, let us consider the verses in Galatians which refer to the cross or to the death of Christ on the cross, and let us see all the important points in these verses. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uT800DRCz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT">I. TO GIVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS<br/>THAT HE MIGHT RESCUE US<br/>OUT OF THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</h2><p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZz5KoSfHB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86207" data-verses="Galatians 1:4">1:4</span> Paul says that Christ “gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father.” Here we see that in His crucifixion Christ gave Himself for our sins. How foolish were the Galatians, and how stubborn and rebellious were the Judaizers! In returning to the law, they had no way to deal with their sins. In this book Paul seems to be saying, “You have committed many sins. What will you do about them? Apart from the death of Christ on the cross, there is no way to be redeemed from your sins.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="105" id="105">[105]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="yPyDK8U8toP9ddq9fj88PGhjxODKIupaPL4uypQZLsf1WGHSHcqrXPDiSJ3xpUhVH"> Although Christ was crucified for our sins, the goal of His crucifixion was to “rescue us out of the present evil age.” Sins are devilish, whereas this age is satanic. We have pointed out that the present age is the present section of Satan’s cosmos, his world system. As the Devil, God’s enemy is involved with sins; and as Satan, he is involved with the evil age. Even if the Galatians and the Judaizers could have been successful in keeping the law, how would they have dealt with the Devil, Satan? Can you overcome Satan? He is subtle, lurking behind sins and the evil age. Apart from the crucifixion of Christ, we have no way to deal with sins, behind which the Devil hides, or the evil age, behind which Satan hides. Christ was crucified for our sins that He might rescue us from this evil age. This indicates that only Christ can save us from the Devil and Satan. Both sins and the evil age have been dealt with by Christ crucified. He gave Himself for us on the cross according to the will of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8QMBpb5u2uHUGqYhAKQo7aPkhYy7Puq03b-0CqpSXjxqjeY42vbmKdMawdZNSBkiv">II. TO GIVE HIMSELF FOR US<br/>THAT HE MIGHT IMPART LIFE TO US<br/>AND LIVE IN US IN RESURRECTION<br/>TO FREE US FROM THE BONDAGE UNDER LAW</h2><p data-content-id="0BpDaFkHtIhH2qZitqny5KzDydR5wt6aFanb0dnnLD-DF8DEA-y-PlCDROzpEYzWE"> Christ was crucified in order to give Himself for us that He might impart life to us. This is altogether positive, whereas dealing with sins and rescuing us from the evil age are negative. On the positive side, Christ crucified imparts the divine life to us so that He might live in us in resurrection to free us from bondage under law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86208" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span>). Through His death on the cross, Christ released His divine life and imparted the divine life into us. This makes it possible for Him to live in us in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="7EjiJiKSogg44JUcqVx5SCLRqPkfyzVQuzRHXmWHEsrf9X58XGzqK5yeH8wP2vo49"> If Christ had not been crucified, it would not be possible for Him to come into us. A “raw,” unprocessed Christ cannot dwell in us. Before Christ could come into us and live in us, He had to deal with our sins and with our fallen nature. The old “I,” the “I” without God, had to be dealt with. To deal with sin and with our fallen nature, Christ had to be crucified. Dealing with these negative things opened the way for <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> Christ to impart Himself into us as our life and thereby to live in us. Thus, Christ’s living in us is based upon His death on the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="_Fv0JBBWQcCEA6UxPCM9K1DhSARbORb8K6GGkuofFK8ArsuS12Lmc3gY7CCOW-tTq"> Furthermore, the Christ who lives in us is a Christ in resurrection. If Christ had not been crucified, how could He have been resurrected? This would, of course, have been impossible. And if Christ were not in resurrection, He could not live in us. The only Christ who can dwell in us is a resurrected Christ, a processed Christ, a Christ who has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. The process through which Christ has passed affords Him the ground and the way to enter into us and to live in us in His resurrection life. A “raw” Christ could never be life to us. The Christ who is our life and who lives in us is the processed Christ. Through His crucifixion He dealt with our sins and with our fallen nature. Now, based upon the work accomplished in His crucifixion, He lives in us in resurrection. This indicates clearly that the cross is the center of God’s operation for the carrying out of His economy. </p>

The curse of the law issued from the sin of man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86210" data-verses="Genesis 3:17">Gen. 3:17</span>). When Christ took away our sin on the cross, He redeemed us out of the curse. </p>

It is one of the most difficult chapters in the New Testament. Therefore, it is not easy to explain in a few sentences what this chapter reveals. As we read this important chapter, we should not take it for granted, assuming that we understand all the terms used by Paul. For example, in this chapter Paul refers to the hearing of faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86233" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">v. 2</span>). We should not assume that we understand this term. </p>
<p data-content-id="O5j0zA-qf0Mh3AhAARFQ7lmgMq4Xpo1dbjbNSwkTTf9dBNb-Jl3CA_ksU2tziRdNZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86234" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">3:1—4:31</span> we see a basic contrast between the Spirit by faith and flesh by law. In this contrast we have two sets of opposites: the Spirit and the flesh as one set, and faith and law as another. The law goes along with the flesh, whereas faith accompanies the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is by faith, and the law is by flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="4_qA8Hy-y0ewiG9-6MsH-MoL5MI40UkArgTfy6n1bWzEZGnixsWeAeScztLyq67eK"> The first two chapters of Galatians may be regarded somewhat as the outer edge of this book. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86235" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Chapter three</span>, however, is the center of the book, its inner core. In this central section of Galatians is presented the contrast between the Spirit and the flesh, and also the contrast between faith and law. Therefore, it is correct to say that the subject of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86236" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapters three and four</span> is the Spirit by faith versus the flesh by law. To have this understanding of these chapters is to have something of great value. Apart from seeing this contrast, we have no way to understand what these chapters reveal. </p>
<p data-content-id="oU2lAEAfF60Z32GAq6eomfHNhPetx1Hvg7_2rk0Sn_tuTwbA7nRurGY_QO909OTcO"> As we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86237" data-verses="Galatians 3:1-14">3:1-14</span>, we see that the Spirit is the blessing of the promise by faith in Christ. Here we have the Spirit, the blessing, the promise, the faith, and Christ. The Spirit is <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> the blessing, the blessing is of the promise, the promise is by faith, and faith is in Christ. What does it mean to say that the Spirit is the blessing and that the blessing is of the promise? What does it mean that the promise is by faith? Understanding such matters is not easy. Nevertheless, these are the very matters to which we must pay attention as we consider these chapters. </p>
<p data-content-id="3r5xmJXvfOZ4GVY3aEYeHipzLqeEXvZOvvuIuMxp3Acx6Fq7vGqRtFtOPFZ605KPg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86238" data-verses="Galatians 3:1-5">3:1-5</span> Paul refers to the Spirit three times. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86239" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">verse 2</span> he asks, “Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86240" data-verses="Galatians 3:3">verse 3</span> he goes on to ask, “Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86241" data-verses="Galatians 3:5">verse 5</span> Paul asks whether the Galatian believers are supplied the Spirit by works of law or by the hearing of faith. Therefore, the Spirit is a crucial matter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86242" data-verses="Galatians 3:1-5">3:1-5</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="jNHNoHhxt7cbszaVs2RjRHRDA_wBex3ISFPf8Kuf5Jq3AWG9Juh2vq7g1OiSkI5wf"> Another crucial matter is the hearing of faith. Paul mentions the hearing of faith both with respect to receiving the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86243" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">v. 2</span>) and to God’s supplying the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86244" data-verses="Galatians 3:5">v. 5</span>). Both the receiving of the Spirit and the supplying of the Spirit are related to the hearing of faith. Doctrinally speaking, the hearing of faith is of greater importance here than the Spirit, for Paul’s point is the contrast between the works of law and the hearing of faith. Although the hearing of faith is of such vital importance, it is neglected by many readers of Galatians, who either ignore this matter or take it for granted. Rarely does anyone seek to know what actually is the hearing of faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="Tc7W4PPlRfP7IyYTOzL7seroSV7ul7DFEWMttoR7ZAF4gSuisrqcMjelyDWtvV_KY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86245" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> we see the relationship between the Spirit of life and Christ: “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.” What does it mean to say that the Spirit of life is in Christ? Traditional teaching would lead us to believe that the Spirit and Christ are separate and distinct Persons. But if the Spirit is a Person separate from Christ, how can the Spirit be in Christ? Some Christian teachers say that Christ the Son, the second Person of the Trinity, is sitting on the throne in the heavens and that the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the Trinity, is now working within us. In contrast to the traditional teaching that the Spirit and Christ are separate and distinct, the Bible tells us that the Spirit is in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="nx8SwJqAHSCfDXHqBW34mrUyZb2OENkVdfHur975RksbbmfglvanrtbLMme-cP2Wn"> The Lord’s answer to Philip’s question in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86246" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> helps us to understand this matter. When Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86247" data-verses="John 14:8">v. 8</span>), the Lord answered, “Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86248" data-verses="John 14:9-10">vv. 9-10</span>). The Lord’s word indicates clearly that the Father and the Son are not two separate Persons. On the contrary, the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. They cannot be separated. Furthermore, the Son was sent <em>from with</em> the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86249" data-verses="John 6:46">John 6:46</span>, Gk.). On the one hand, He was sent from God; on the other hand, He was always with God. The Son did not actually leave the Father; neither was the Father separated from the Son. Therefore, the Lord said, “Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86250" data-verses="John 14:11">John 14:11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="6dR3l0TKVK5BVc1WfrOnHw621ct9T9O55ZdMpdNdldLArsZ1aOoLZ1aATo3wP97vY"> The principle is the same concerning the relationship of Christ and the Spirit as the relationship between Christ the Son and the Father. The fact that the Spirit of life is in Christ means that an intrinsic relationship exists among the Three of the Godhead. The Son is the Son, and the Father is the Father. Nevertheless, the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. Likewise, while the Son is the Son and the Spirit is the Spirit, yet the Spirit is in the Son. This indicates that the Three of the Triune God cannot be separated. </p>
<p data-content-id="RWVsQ_5NusVXYDHGxpbs0M_dVUWRKPEcjaGDW74RHmUjtOizB-mcAbBc3CjOpxqzi"> A further indication of this truth is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86251" data-verses="Romans 8:9-10">Romans 8:9-10</span>. In these verses Paul says, “But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.” In these verses we read of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ. These titles all denote one reality—the all-inclusive Spirit. The Spirit of God is God, the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God, and Christ Himself is the Spirit of Christ. Christ is the Spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> of Christ, the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is God Himself. All these titles refer to the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This One is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of life, Christ, and God. </p>
<p data-content-id="suGsx2yrlu_xHF1tfjn8zJMlnepgZ_FkeXicCvRkOc4iVF8ZQC36eleSovBwPlpZv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86252" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86253" data-verses="Romans 8:9">9</span> there are three titles of the Spirit: the Spirit is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Christ. Hence, the Spirit is of life, of God, and of Christ. Certainly these titles do not refer to three Spirits. It is utterly wrong to say that the Spirit of life is separate from the Spirit of God or that the Spirit of God is distinct from the Spirit of Christ. On the contrary, the one Spirit is the Spirit of life, of God, and of Christ. Life, God, and Christ are not three separate entities or substances. Rather, life is God, God is Christ, and Christ is life. Therefore, the Spirit of life is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ. These three are one entity, the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>

The law was the basis for the relationship between man and <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> God in God’s Old Testament economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86287" data-verses="Galatians 3:23">3:23</span>); faith is the unique requirement for man to contact God in His New Testament economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86288" data-verses="Hebrews 11:6">Heb. 11:6</span>). Law is related to the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86289" data-verses="Romans 7:5">Rom. 7:5</span>) and depends on the effort of the flesh, the very flesh that is the expression of “I.” Faith is related to the Spirit, and trusts in the operation of the Spirit, the very Spirit who is the realization of Christ. In the Old Testament, “I” and the flesh played an important role in keeping the law. In the New Testament, Christ and the Spirit take over the position of “I” and the flesh, and faith replaces law that we may live Christ by the Spirit. To keep the law by the flesh is man’s natural way; it is in the darkness of man’s concept and results in death and wretchedness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86290" data-verses="Romans 7:10-11">Rom. 7:10-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86291" data-verses="Romans 7:24">24</span>). To receive the Spirit by faith is God’s revealed way; it is in the light of God’s revelation and issues in life and glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86292" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86293" data-verses="Romans 8:6">6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86294" data-verses="Romans 8:10-11">10-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86295" data-verses="Romans 8:30">30</span>). Hence, we must treasure faith, not the works of law. It is by the hearing of faith that we have received the Spirit that we may participate in God’s promised blessing and live Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CbEoIIHjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86296" data-verses="Galatians 3:22-25">3:22-25</span> we see a contrast between law and faith. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86297" data-verses="Galatians 3:23">3:23</span>, “before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.” This verse indicates clearly that there was a time when faith came and was revealed. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86298" data-verses="Galatians 3:24-25">verses 24 and 25</span>, now that faith has come we are no longer under the law as our child-conductor.

Theological terms such as the dispensation of law and the dispensation of grace are used to point out this distinction. According to this understanding, the Old Testament was the dispensation of law, whereas the New Testament is the dispensation of grace. Hence, grace is versus law and replaces law. But have you <span class="pg" data-page-id="121" id="121">[121]</span> ever heard that faith has come to replace law and that faith is versus law? It is possible even to say that in the Old Testament there was a dispensation of law, but in the New Testament there is a dispensation of faith. The dispensation of grace is also the dispensation of faith. When grace came, faith came also. Both grace and faith came with the coming of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="KygeQ8PlDLBH2nvmKS7N8lVutn1P5lyzh2JU0Vr4XlZjGo7XUqfsMNWRRv7JIAeWe"> What a contrast there is between the works of law and the hearing of faith! We must distinguish between a working Christian and a hearing Christian. What kind of Christian are you? We all should declare that we are hearing Christians, not working Christians. To hear is a great blessing. In the meetings of the church we come together for the hearing of faith. By this hearing we receive the supply of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="lf-ra6zpDBsmQzyyZJ16f_UdPs6T4rpUTX0gibWXBynit-bMMYmuy00n-xPKw7p05"> If we would understand the meaning of the hearing of faith, we need to know what faith is and also what grace is. Both grace and faith refer to the same thing. Grace is on God’s side, but faith is on our side. As we have pointed out, grace is the Triune God processed to be everything to us. As we hear of this grace, we spontaneously have faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="O5j0zA-qf0Mh3AhAARFQ7lmgLq4Klo1dbjbNSwkTTf9dBNb-Jl3CA_ksU2tziRdNZ"> If I were preaching the gospel to primitive people who had never heard of God, Christ, the Spirit, the cross, redemption, salvation, or eternal life, I would tell them that the true God is a loving and lovable God. I would go on to tell them the story of how God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to accomplish redemption for us by dying on the cross. I would continue by telling them how wonderful Christ is. I would want them to know about His death on the cross and how He shed His blood so that we might be forgiven. I would tell them that through Christ’s death and resurrection, the divine life within Him has been released. I would also tell them that now Christ, the living One, is the life-giving Spirit who is waiting to be received. Those who hear such a gospel message would spontaneously have the hearing of faith. The word that I would preach would be a word of grace. But once they have heard such a word, in their experience it would become the faith by which they believe. <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="4_qA8Hy-y0ewiG9-6MsH-MoL-MIh5UkArgTfy6n1bWzEZGnixsWeAeScztLyq67eK"> When people hear of the grace of God in the preaching of the gospel, something rises up within them to appreciate what they have heard. The grace presented to them becomes in them the faith by which they believe. Spontaneously they begin to appreciate God, Christ, and the Spirit. They appreciate what Christ has done in accomplishing redemption. This appreciation is faith. Faith comes when they begin to appreciate what they hear in the gospel. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oU2lAEAfF60Z32GAq6eomfHNmPeIz1Hvg7_2rk0Sn_tuTwbA7nRurGY_QO909OTcO">THE OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE ASPECTS OF FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="3r5xmJXvfOZ4GVY3aEYeHipzMqelUvZOvvuIuMxp3Acx6Fq7vGqRtFtOPFZ605KPg"> Concerning faith there are two aspects, the objective aspect and the subjective aspect. Objectively faith is what we believe. Subjectively faith is our believing. Therefore, faith denotes both the act of believing and that in which we believe. Regarding the act of believing, faith is subjective, but regarding what we believe, faith is objective. As we hear about those things in which we are to believe, faith is produced within us. The more we hear about these good things, the more we appreciate them. Spontaneously this appreciation issues in our believing in those very things about which we have heard. Therefore, faith is both objective and subjective. </p>
<p data-content-id="GCjRwqUUB2Y5qtNstg8IfK95ITJ5horISgr2t5rmsQf7zPSmVcRtel0rF5TEnkGCT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86299" data-verses="Galatians 1:23">1:23</span> we are told that Paul, who once persecuted the believers in Christ, now preached “the faith which formerly he ravaged.” Faith here and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86300" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">3:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86301" data-verses="Galatians 3:5">5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86302" data-verses="Galatians 3:7">7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86303" data-verses="Galatians 3:9">9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86304" data-verses="Galatians 3:23">23</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86305" data-verses="Galatians 3:25">25</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86306" data-verses="Galatians 6:10">6:10</span> implies our believing in Christ, taking His Person and His redemptive work as the object of our faith. This, replacing the law, by which God dealt with people in the Old Testament, becomes the principle of God’s dealing with people in the New Testament. This faith characterizes the believers in Christ and distinguishes them from the keepers of law. This is the main emphasis of this book. </p>

The Old Testament was a dispensation of law, whereas the New Testament is a dispensation of faith. As the basis for the relationship between man and God, the law requires that man use his own effort to fulfill the law’s requirements in order to please God. The law is not related to God intrinsically. Rather, it stands apart from God and places demands upon man that must be fulfilled if man is to please God. According to the principle of faith, man is not required to strive in his flesh to please God. Instead, man is to hear how God desires to be everything to him. God has planned to bless us. For our sake, He became incarnated, lived on earth, and died to accomplish redemption. He has been resurrected from among the dead and has become the life-giving Spirit. Now He is calling people to receive Him. He is eagerly expecting to come into people and to be their life and their everything so that they may be one with Him. This is the hearing of faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="9EjNkeFQzuB7lPrvBx2r4mQxGSeJj3MjL5KX4WKv8J4ijozWWaX1GBnucISX6mYPk"> In this hearing of faith, we hear all the well-speaking of God, all His blessing. Faith involves the hearing concerning all the good things of God toward us. Through this hearing an appreciation for the Lord Jesus is awakened within us. Out of our appreciation for the Lord, we spontaneously <span class="pg" data-page-id="128" id="128">[128]</span> call on His name. In this way we receive Him, accept Him, and join ourselves to Him. Then we go on to partake of Him and enjoy Him. All this is related to faith. Law requires man to work, but faith receives all that God is, all that God has planned and purposed, all that God has accomplished, all that God has obtained and attained, and all that God intends to impart into us. With law, there are demands. But with faith there are no demands; there is only the receiving of the processed Triune God. By receiving the Triune God, we also receive redemption, salvation, forgiveness, eternal life, and all the heavenly, divine, and spiritual things. What a contrast between law and faith! Surely it is foolish to turn from faith and go back to the law. </p>

In this chapter Paul seems to go from one subject to another. Many read this chapter without having any idea what Paul is talking about. It seems that the points covered are not related to one another. The way to understand this chapter is not to go verse by verse. Rather, it is to concentrate on the main points. In this chapter Paul covers at least twelve major subjects: Christ crucified; Christ and the Spirit; the hearing of faith versus works of law; the Spirit as the blessing of the gospel; the Spirit versus the flesh; the gospel preached to Abraham; the promise versus the law; faith replacing law; the seed of Abraham and the sons of Abraham; baptized into Christ; putting on Christ; and all one in Christ. These are the crucial points in this chapter. If we spend time to consider them and to dwell on them in prayer, we shall be greatly helped in understanding this chapter. </p>
<p data-content-id="mwgtjC9XS1FGoCtF4PVerTKVvL05GLGZ7EjJw3iBylk8ausrMn3Rya4C_vDviKgZU"> Having covered the subjects of Christ crucified, Christ and the Spirit, and the hearing of faith versus works of law, we come in this message to the Spirit as the blessing of the gospel. During the years I have been a Christian, I have heard that many things are the blessing of the gospel: salvation, redemption, forgiveness, eternal life. In Christianity <span class="pg" data-page-id="129" id="129">[129]</span> people are often told that being able to go to heaven and to live in a mansion is a great blessing related to the gospel. Have you ever heard that the blessing of the gospel is the Spirit? </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZPMSuZ9RJARG2mHH39cp1MOmn6hZr4rLeMkbyNUB6rt7BUGo_N35-ZgE1eohkDMv_">THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="AOq37-r2IeHjeXA3qsTxaaAgoAKFf1hYUFmQeMfeSSH0Z7MSjwYi0gvTHsz3tlylV"> In the Bible, where words are always used economically, <em>the</em> Spirit has a particular meaning, somewhat different from the Holy Spirit. In Galatians Paul speaks not of the Holy Spirit, but of <em>the</em> Spirit. The total blessing of the gospel is not salvation, redemption, forgiveness, life, or going to heaven—it is the Spirit. The Spirit denotes the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—who has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Only after He had entered into resurrection did the Lord Jesus command His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The reason for this is that prior to the resurrection of Christ, the Triune God had not been fully processed. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86319" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>, the Spirit was “not yet,” even though the Holy Spirit was already in existence, as indicated by the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86320" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86321" data-verses="Luke 1:1">Luke 1</span>. The New Testament tells us clearly that the Holy Spirit was involved in the conception of the Lord Jesus in the womb of the virgin Mary. But <em>the</em> Spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was “not yet” until the resurrection of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86322" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> tells us that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified. The Lord was glorified in His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86323" data-verses="Luke 24:26">Luke 24:26</span>). Therefore, after His glorification by resurrection, <em>the</em> Spirit was in existence. </p>
<p data-content-id="FgR_87l1H0LrnccVVzJZOiL18bXs2rimHZBL91SeKVcHVN1MSKn1mYterXmbrgWIP"> From the Gospels we proceed to the Acts and to the Epistles. Paul’s ministry was a completing ministry. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86324" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Colossians 1:25</span> he says that he became a minister according to the stewardship of God to complete the word of God. Hence, the completion of God’s word is found neither in the Gospels, nor in the Acts, but in the Epistles of Paul. In particular, the divine revelation is completed in four books: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. In Paul’s Epistles the <span class="pg" data-page-id="130" id="130">[130]</span> Spirit is revealed in a full way. We do not have such a revelation of the Spirit in the Gospels or in the Acts. The Spirit as revealed in Paul’s writings is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit enters into the believers to be their life and everything to them. Such a Spirit is the total blessing of the gospel. As the blessing of the gospel, the Spirit includes forgiveness, redemption, salvation, reconciliation, justification, eternal life, the divine nature, the uplifted and resurrected human nature, and the very Triune God Himself. </p>

The blessing of Abraham is the blessing promised by God to Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86327" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Gen. 12:3</span>) for all the nations of the earth. This promise was fulfilled, and this blessing has come to the nations in Christ through His redemption by the cross. The context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86328" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">verse 14</span> indicates that the Spirit is the blessing which God promised to Abraham for all the nations and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. The Spirit is the compound Spirit and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, for us to receive as our life and our everything. This is the focus of the gospel of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="-V6Wrbqi6m39muO7NhmTDh7G2WmQgJpfHhbKxAbQhJdz_rLvXvxmb2bAzAlQrlG63"> The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86329" data-verses="Genesis 12:7">Gen. 12:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86330" data-verses="Genesis 13:15">13:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86331" data-verses="Genesis 17:8">17:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86332" data-verses="Genesis 26:3-4">26:3-4</span>), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86333" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Col. 1:12</span>). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86334" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86335" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the promised land.

Because of the influence of our background in Christianity, our understanding of the terms Spirit and flesh in the New Testament is limited. Actually, these terms have a very broad significance. They are two of the most important expressions used in the New Testament. </p>

The flesh, which is our fallen man, is of sin and death. We should not begin by the Spirit and attempt to be perfected by the flesh. Those of us who have begun by the Spirit should be perfected by the Spirit and have nothing to do with the flesh. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86360" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span> the contrast is between Christ and “I”; here the contrast is between the Spirit and the flesh. This indicates that the Spirit is Christ and the flesh is “I” in our experience. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86361" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapter three</span> to the end of the Epistle, the Spirit is Christ in our life experience.

The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man, and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God. The flesh inclines to keep the law and <span class="pg" data-page-id="136" id="136">[136]</span> is tested by the law. The Spirit is received and enjoyed by faith. God’s economy delivers us from the flesh to the Spirit that we may participate in the blessing of the riches of the Triune God. This cannot take place by the flesh keeping the law, but takes place by the Spirit being received by faith and experienced through faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="FgR_87l1H0LrnccVVzJZOiL1_bXN_rimHZBL91SeKVcHVN1MSKn1mYterXmbrgWIP"> In the book of Galatians, the flesh does not refer merely to man’s fallen and corrupted body. Rather, it refers to the totality of man’s fallen being. The flesh is therefore the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man. Hence, the flesh in this sense includes man’s body, soul, and spirit. If you consider the works of the flesh listed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86379" data-verses="Galatians 5:19-21">5:19-21</span>, you will find that some, such as fornication, uncleanness, sensuality, and drunkenness, are related to the lust of the corrupted body; others, such as enmities, strife, angers, and divisions, are related to the fallen soul; and still others, idolatry and sorcery, are related to the deadened spirit. This proves that the three parts of our fallen being are involved with the evil flesh. Therefore, in Galatians the flesh denotes the whole of man’s fallen being. The flesh is not just a part of man’s fallen being; it includes the totality of the fallen tripartite man. </p>
<p data-content-id="oU2lAEAfF60Z32GAq6eomfHNkPeI71Hvg7_2rk0Sn_tuTwbA7nRurGY_QO909OTcO"> According to the revelation in the New Testament, the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God. God is the Spirit, and fallen man is the flesh. God is the processed Triune God, and the flesh is the fallen tripartite man. Have you ever realized that man today is the fallen tripartite man and that God is the processed Triune God? The fallen tripartite man is the flesh, and the processed Triune God is the Spirit. Just as the flesh in Galatians refers not only to the corrupted and lustful body, but to the totality of fallen man, so the Spirit refers not only to the third Person of the Triune God, but to the Triune God who has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The flesh refers to our entire fallen being, and the Spirit, to the entire Triune God, to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Having been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="137" id="137">[137]</span> Triune God is today the Spirit. When we read of the flesh in the New Testament, we need to realize that it denotes the totality of man’s fallen being. In the same principle, when we read of the Spirit in the Epistles of Paul, we need to understand that the Spirit denotes the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—processed to become the all-inclusive life-imparting Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3r5xmJXvfOZ4GVY3aEYeHipzOqelcvZOvvuIuMxp3Acx6Fq7vGqRtFtOPFZ605KPg">SATAN’S MISUSE OF THE LAW</h2><p data-content-id="GCjRwqUUB2Y5qtNstg8IfK95KTJ1jorISgr2t5rmsQf7zPSmVcRtel0rF5TEnkGCT"> God’s economy is to dispense Himself as the processed Triune God into our being to be our life and our everything, to make Himself one with us and us one with Him so that we may express Him in a corporate way for eternity. However, in the attempt to frustrate God’s economy, Satan, the enemy of God, uses the law, which was given by God to serve His purpose temporarily, to keep God’s chosen people from His economy and to distract them from it. If we look at the book of Galatians from this point of view, we shall find that it is not difficult to understand. As we read this Epistle, we need to see that God’s economy is to impart Himself as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit into us to produce an organic union between us and the Triune God so that we may express Him in a corporate way. But Satan utilizes the law given by God in order to distract God’s people from His economy and to hinder the fulfillment of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="cRATS1-L3cm1MtNnkWc4VER3DTTisCgQiyABPNg5nT87ViyZ-4pqbb-_dLxY-Hqe9"> It is important to understand clearly what it means for the law to be misused. The law is misused when it is used to stir up fallen man’s desire to uplift himself by keeping the law in order to have a self-made righteousness. The Judaizers misused the law in this way to distract the believers from God’s economy. What we see in the book of Galatians is this misuse of the God-given law. The law given by God was misused by Satan to keep God’s chosen people from God’s economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYesg9onVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN">THE WAY OF FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="ELgAnKoxymVCxEU085F09PAENOFT2e79Kcjqa9KKz-o0iNiU7mWYl8DgLsSy_YySF"> In a foregoing message we have pointed out that the works of law are contrary to the hearing of faith. Faith is the way for God’s people to apprehend, comprehend, grasp, <span class="pg" data-page-id="138" id="138">[138]</span> enjoy, and participate in all that God is to His people through His having been processed to become the Spirit. According to Galatians, the law has been replaced by faith. In our experience, the law should be over, and faith should be prevailing. </p>
<p data-content-id="DEb9lLplhJh_b-ToTExfg9uIeDfuZqBAmO_hOEwnHQvhFVJvBhvWxecGMMAdTQUXF"> Just as the law and the flesh go together, so faith and the Spirit go together. Whenever we try to keep the law, we are immediately in the flesh. But when we take the way of faith to hear, appreciate, call upon, receive, accept, join, partake of, and enjoy, we spontaneously experience the Spirit. This can be confirmed by our experience. Whenever we strive to keep the law, we are in the flesh, in the fallen tripartite man. But whenever we take the way of faith, we are in our spirit enjoying the Spirit. Here, in the way of faith, we enjoy the Spirit as the processed Triune God. Furthermore, the way of faith causes the organic union between the processed God and regenerated man to be developed and cultivated. God intends that this organic union be developed to the uttermost. </p>

He has done this through the use of three isms: Catholicism, Protestantism, and Pentecostalism. These three isms in today’s Christianity have been utilized by Satan to hinder God’s economy by frustrating the development of the organic union between the regenerated man and the processed Triune God. Suppose that in this country these three isms did not exist, and there was only the Lord’s recovery. If this were the situation, surely the organic union between us and God would become highly developed in a short period of time. However, it is a fact that this organic union has been frustrated. It has been frustrated not mainly by Judaism, Islam, or Buddhism, but by Catholicism, Protestantism, and Pentecostalism. Just as Satan used Judaism in ancient times, so he uses these isms today to keep God’s people from the proper development of their organic union with the Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="139" id="139">[139]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="WA9v3u5-3Lwi17H2ixIskGrMJSq6nrXkuEq15-Op_KCV9NmwKiBW9UQjWZtKTZiSu"> When I first learned that long before Christ came the gospel was preached to Abraham, I was greatly surprised. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86394" data-verses="Galatians 3:8">Galatians 3:8</span> says, “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham: In you all the nations shall be blessed.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86395" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Genesis 12:3</span>, in Abraham all the nations would be blessed. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86396" data-verses="Genesis 12:7">Genesis 12:7</span> the Lord went on to say to Abraham, “Unto thy seed will I give this land.” There are two main aspects of God’s word to Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86397" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span>: the first is that in him all nations would be blessed; the second is that the land would be given to Abraham’s seed. In Christ, Abraham’s unique seed, the nations would be blessed. Furthermore, to this unique seed the land would be given. This was God’s word to Abraham. </p>
<p data-content-id="2a2q7x6_ya-MrF4vWREnskCjiQy3uLNKn4UAmFZ6n1uV18kympe4IfkgeG_OZh2ep"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86398" data-verses="Galatians 3:16">Galatians 3:16</span> Paul refers to God’s word to Abraham as a promise: “To Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86399" data-verses="Galatians 3:17">verse 17</span> Paul goes on to speak of a covenant ratified beforehand by God. This indicates that the promise God gave to Abraham became a covenant, which is more firm than a promise. The word, the promise, and the covenant are the gospel which was preached to Abraham. The gospel is the covenant, the covenant is the promise, and the promise is the word spoken by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="uc7kzXp0thJHgKfcmJ22Wl0y4-HicCa-RsBkJeSW3J8W-fJ2HPsWWLCVwvllAti1T"> It is important to see the difference between these four terms. A word is common or ordinary, whereas a promise is much more specific. If you give a promise to someone, your word is not common; it is specific. You promise to do certain things for that person. The word God spoke to Abraham in <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86400" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> was not common; it was a specific word in which God promised Abraham that in him and in his seed the nations would be blessed. We have pointed out that in this chapter God also promised Abraham that his seed would possess the land. Because the word spoken to Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86401" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> is very specific, it is a word of promise. </p>
<p data-content-id="foiLIlvcS80gCzQLJEjLx1zxElAeieKfvi_9m0_XuzDf4uNd_MonuQ67A3GsUpFID"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86402" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span> this promise became a covenant. Here God appeared to Abraham, and Abraham offered a sacrifice to Him. The sacrifice was divided, and God passed through it. This was a custom in ancient times by which two parties ratified a covenant. By walking through the sacrifice, these parties ratified a covenant in an official and proper manner. In this way the promise given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86403" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> was ratified as a covenant in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86404" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span>. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86405" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span> the covenant was confirmed by the sign of circumcision. </p>
<p data-content-id="IEVFDlaYVRjSRK71dHxvanxLWiFDjXn-0yai8TnmSQ0mIPD3pnj0_KMZCVI_UK25d"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86406" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span> Paul says that the word spoken to Abraham, the word which became a covenant confirmed by circumcision, was the gospel preached to Abraham. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86407" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span> we are given Paul’s understanding and interpretation. Perhaps this interpretation came as a revelation to Paul during the years he was alone with the Lord. Paul came to see that what God had spoken to Abraham was not just a promise or merely a covenant ratified and confirmed, but that it was the very gospel. In this covenant, Paul learned, the main items of the new testament gospel were included. Thus, the covenant ratified with Abraham was a forerunner of the new covenant, of the new testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="vGJw21xvx_4iyiGpDEqnpkGr9X3DfqUVmjkRTasq1cTT8ENWrMNtao5xjcOTyhFf0"> The new testament is a new covenant ratified by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus. The Lord offered Himself up as a sacrifice to God. In a sense, God walked through the sacrifice offered to Him on the cross by Christ. This new covenant may be considered as either a repetition or a continuation of the covenant ratified with Abraham. The gospel we are preaching today is not merely a promise; it is also a covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="WA9v3u5-3Lwi17H2ixIskGrMJSqrsrXkuEq15-Op_KCV9NmwKiBW9UQjWZtKTZiSu"> In message forty-one of the Life-study of Hebrews, we pointed out the difference between a covenant and a testament. A covenant refers to an agreement concerning things <span class="pg" data-page-id="147" id="147">[147]</span> promised, but not yet accomplished. A testament denotes an agreement in which the promised items have been accomplished. When all the items of the promise are accomplished, the covenant becomes a testament. The modern term for testament is will. The new testament is the new will. A will is not an agreement in which the testator promises to do certain things for others. No, a will is a testament which says that the testator has already done certain things or given certain things to particular people. The gospel we preach is first a covenant. Ultimately, however, it is a testament. At the time of Abraham this gospel could not have been a testament. It could only have been a covenant in which God promised to bless all the nations in Abraham and to give the good land to Abraham’s seed. Later, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86408" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span>, this promise became a ratified covenant. But for us the new covenant is a new testament because all the promised things have been accomplished by Christ. All the nations have been blessed in Christ, and the good land has been given to Abraham’s seed. Therefore, what we receive today is not a new covenant; it is a new testament, a new will. This will is the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="2a2q7x6_ya-MrF4vWREnskCjiQyqmLNKn4UAmFZ6n1uV18kympe4IfkgeG_OZh2ep"> Paul received a marvelous understanding of spiritual things. Without the revelation given to him, we would not have the confidence to say that the covenant ratified with Abraham was the gospel preached to Abraham. But Paul boldly declares that the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86409" data-verses="Galatians 3:8">3:8</span>). Apart from Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86410" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span>, we would not realize that God’s word to Abraham was the gospel. Although the gospel is a matter of the new testament, it is important for us to realize that the new testament is a continuation or repetition of God’s promise to Abraham. </p>

This hearing stirred up a sense of appreciation within him. We are told that Abraham believed God and that God reckoned his believing as righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86415" data-verses="Genesis 15:6">Gen. 15:6</span>). The preaching of the gospel was received by Abraham through the hearing of faith. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86417" data-verses="Galatians 3:17">3:17</span> Paul says, “And I say this, a covenant ratified beforehand by God, the law having come four hundred and thirty years after does not annul, so as to make the promise of none effect.” God’s promise to Abraham was given first. The law came four hundred thirty years later. The promise was permanent, but the law was temporary. The temporary law, which came later, cannot annul the permanent promise, which came first. The Galatians left the first and permanent promise and went back to the later and temporary law. </p>
<p data-content-id="JXqZnZhBWTHYr5N7Yht-3oFpstZnljmP3ypdcLgaJCkerNiqlRD_Yss6rPYP8xAja"> The four hundred thirty years mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86418" data-verses="Galatians 3:17">3:17</span> are counted from the time God gave Abraham the promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86419" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> to the time He gave the law through Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86420" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span>. This period was considered by God as the time of the children of Israel’s dwelling in Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86421" data-verses="Exodus 12:40-41">Exo. 12:40-41</span>). The four hundred years mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86422" data-verses="Genesis 15:13">Genesis 15:13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86423" data-verses="Acts 7:6">Acts 7:6</span> are counted from the time Ishmael mocked Isaac in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86424" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span> to the time the children of Israel came out of Egyptian tyranny in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86425" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>.

<p data-content-id="zoSuUTRAjb71fws33A2Ij_qKhAhD6DZHkvk4LihK5YZEcnjH-Rw-Qvjra-Rp4-Cu9"> Paul’s intention was to show that the law given through Moses was not God’s original intention, but something secondary and additional. Because the law is not like Sarah, the genuine wife, but like Hagar, the concubine, it does not have the proper position. It was given four hundred thirty years after the gospel was preached to Abraham. Since God does not change, how could He preach the gospel to Abraham and then, four hundred thirty years later, command the people to fulfill the law in order to satisfy Him? The law was given for the purpose of exposing God’s chosen people and keeping them in His custody. </p>

<p data-content-id="aary53Wx3h7_PLJIcdmPvYGWG_gzi3BQkZf5Js31NuzMk7UHLOZ9EuU39xv2VI18i"> The New Testament reveals that, in eternity past, God made a purpose, a plan. This purpose was to have a people chosen by Him to receive the sonship and thereby to become sons of God, with the Son of God as the Firstborn, and then to be formed into a corporate man to express God for eternity. This is a brief statement of God’s eternal purpose. After conceiving this purpose, God accomplished the work of creation. The focal point of God’s creation is man, because God’s purpose is to have a people for His expression. We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86446" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> that man was made in God’s image and according to God’s likeness. In other words, man was created with the potential to express God. At the time of creation, man had neither the divine life nor the divine nature. However, he was created with the capacity to receive God and to become one with Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uT8-0DMIz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT">THE FALL, THE CURSE, AND THE PROMISE</h2><p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZz5AoSGMB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> We know that after creation, man fell. On the one hand, the fall of Adam brought in sin and sins; on the other hand, Adam’s fall brought in the curse. Hence, the man created by God in His own image and according to His likeness became involved with sin and came under the curse. The fact that mankind followed a downward course after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86447" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> indicates that man is under a curse. We see this curse with Cain, the second generation of mankind. Because Cain’s descendants were all under the curse, they fell lower and lower. Eventually, man fell to such a degree that, at Babel, he became divided and confused. There can be no doubt that fallen man is both involved with sin and under the curse. <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="yPyDK8U8toP9ddq9fj88PGhj7ODvAupaPL4uypQZLsf1WGHSHcqrXPDiSJ3xpUhVH"> In the midst of such a fallen situation, the God of glory appeared to Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86448" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span>). It is significant that the Bible does not say that the God of love appeared to Abraham, but says that the God of glory appeared to him. With Adam we have sin and the curse, but with Abraham we have God’s promise. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86449" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Genesis 12:3</span>, God promised Abraham that in him all the nations would be blessed. The background of this promise was the curse upon mankind. Because mankind was under a curse, man’s direction was downward. But God came in, called Abraham, and promised that in him the nations, mankind in a state of division and confusion, would be blessed. Certainly this was good news. It is no wonder, then, that Paul considered it the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="8QMBpb5u2uHUGqYhAKQo7aPkrYyaGuq03b-0CqpSXjxqjeY42vbmKdMawdZNSBkiv"> However, the matter we are emphasizing here is the promise. In calling Abraham, God gave him a promise. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86450" data-verses="Galatians 3:17">Galatians 3:17</span> Paul speaks of both a promise and a covenant. In this chapter he also tells us, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86451" data-verses="Galatians 3:8">verse 8</span>, that God’s word to Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86452" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Genesis 12:3</span> was the preaching of the gospel to Abraham. The speaking of that promise was the preaching of the gospel. Furthermore, the covenant ratified in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86453" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span> was the confirmation of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESSOgWzycLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86454" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Genesis 12:3</span> the promise was only a promise, for it was still in need of fulfillment. In this chapter we are not told when, how, or where the promise would be fulfilled. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86455" data-verses="Genesis 15:1">Genesis 15</span> the promise became a ratified covenant, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86456" data-verses="Genesis 17:1">Genesis 17</span> this covenant was confirmed by the sign of circumcision. However, even though the promise had been ratified as a covenant and confirmed, it still had not been fulfilled. </p>

This darkness was an indication that before the promise would be fulfilled, God’s people would undergo a time of darkness and suffer intensely. The Bible records that Abraham’s descendants went into Egypt and spent at least <span class="pg" data-page-id="155" id="155">[155]</span> four hundred years under Egyptian tyranny. These years were a long period of darkness. Then, after those four hundred years, God brought them out of the darkness of Egyptian tyranny. God did not deal with them according to the law, which had not yet been given, but He dealt with them according to the promise He made to Abraham, their forefather. </p>
<p data-content-id="N78TKjbEXVwSfszdd30oED05hvQxQQ--ofRmWsRF1_iiqC8arZJbwvJC5VunnOdmn"> It is difficult to find a verse in the book of Exodus telling us that God’s intention in bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt was to give them the law. However, it is clearly stated that God intended for them to hold a feast unto Him. Moses said to Pharaoh, “Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86459" data-verses="Exodus 5:1">Exo. 5:1</span>). No doubt, God also planned to reveal to them the pattern of His dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAIj0xIHj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1"> Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86460" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Exodus 19</span>, there seems to be no indication that God had any intention to give them the law. At the beginning of this chapter, God spoke very pleasant words to the people: “Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86461" data-verses="Exodus 19:4">Exo. 19:4</span>). The Lord went on to tell them that if they would obey His voice and keep His covenant, they would be a special treasure unto Him and become a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86462" data-verses="Exodus 19:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). God’s word was very gracious. When the people heard what God had spoken, they answered, “All that the Lord hath spoken we will do” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86463" data-verses="Exodus 19:8">v. 8</span>). After this response of the people, the atmosphere around Mount Sinai changed. The cherishing atmosphere was replaced by a terrifying one. Frightened by this atmosphere, the children of Israel told Moses to be their representative to meet with God. In the midst of such a situation, the Ten Commandments were given. Therefore, with Adam we have the fall; with Abraham, the promise; and with Moses, the law. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86464" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Chapters twenty through twenty-three</span> of Exodus are all related to the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="hwMadJIZ14zUSl3gCcShY89pRJQzOmfydHXU1tIkWKzKdKgtXF3CB5KwOuJngqEmP"> But immediately following these chapters with their decrees and ordinances, we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86465" data-verses="Exodus 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>, where the situation around Mount Sinai is changed again. <span class="pg" data-page-id="156" id="156">[156]</span> Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up the mountain. In the words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86466" data-verses="Exodus 24:10">Exodus 24:10</span>, “they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.” What a beautiful scene this was! It was in such a setting that God revealed to Moses the pattern of the tabernacle. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="U0hKzeGUKiJ9Ln5z4YNTcfeRQbLVVWosB97DAfeztAm8eOk3lOS0ACBjVbUPD323A">ACCORDING TO THE LAW<br/>AND THROUGH THE TABERNACLE</h2><p data-content-id="MW1PrIO1NZkL7m7Ua0gn0XKFOLZd1yxZO7paon9rt0Llao3pVSvH-BXWTu0cTco71"> After the law with its ordinances was given to the people, God dealt with the children of Israel according to the law through the tabernacle. The people did not contact God through the law, but they contacted Him through the tabernacle with the priesthood and the offerings. All these were the fulfillment, in type, of God’s promise to Abraham. God dealt with the people according to the law through the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings. Suppose an Israelite committed a sin. According to the Ten Commandments, he was to be cut off. But, instead of having him cut off, God fulfilled His promise to Abraham to bless all nations by blessing such a sinner through the altar. The one who committed the sin had to bring a sacrifice as a trespass offering. When this sacrifice was offered on the altar, the one who had sinned could be forgiven. </p>
<p data-content-id="VJs2_qQSmWRN5nwRMAwzi45gosx-6h5WHZfAUFc9qWR3k9ARa10q6C3SazdmHHl0y"> God used the law as a mirror to expose His people. But after the people were exposed, they could turn to the tabernacle, the priesthood, the altar, and the offerings. In type this was the fulfillment of the promise God made to Abraham. The book of Exodus is not actually a book of law; it is a book of the fulfillment of God’s promise, a book of Christ, the cross, and the church. Yes, certain chapters are devoted to the law and its ordinances. But other chapters give the pattern of the tabernacle and describe the setting up of the tabernacle. As we have pointed out, it was in the midst of a clear atmosphere that the pattern of the tabernacle was revealed to Moses. After this pattern was given, the tabernacle was constructed and set up. Then by means of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="157" id="157">[157]</span> priesthood and the offerings those who were condemned under the law were able to have fellowship with God. This fellowship was through the tabernacle, through Christ. This was a fulfillment in type, although not in reality, of God’s promise to Abraham. </p>

It is the Spirit mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86488" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>, who is the life-imparting Christ in resurrection. This Spirit is the bountiful supply to the believers in God’s New Testament economy. We receive this Spirit not by the works of law, but by faith in the crucified and glorified Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="QX_dhXyrTEKgglFbpCHnW_b0tSjb0SmsScRzM7vcR1V4yTQVrfjL1P8cefckdiwb8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86489" data-verses="Galatians 3:6">verse 6</span> Paul goes on to say, “Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.” The bewitched Galatians, by drifting back to the law, were clinging to Moses, through whom the law was given. But Paul referred them to Abraham, who was the father of faith. Faith was of God’s original economy; the law was later added because of transgressions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86490" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">v. 19</span>). After Christ fulfilled the law through His death, God wanted His people to return to His original economy. With Abraham it was not a matter of keeping the law, but a matter of believing God. It should be so with all the New Testament believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="KygeQ8PlDLBH2nvmKS7N8lVugn1q3lyzh2JU0Vr4XlZjGo7XUqfsMNWRRv7JIAeWe"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86491" data-verses="Galatians 3:9-10">verses 9 and 10</span> Paul says, “So that they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham. For as many as are of the works of law are under a curse; for it is written, <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the law to do them.” Faith in Christ brings us into the blessing God promised to Abraham, which is the promise of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86492" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">v. 14</span>). This faith had brought the Galatian believers into the blessing in Christ. They were enjoying the grace of life in the Spirit. But the Judaizers bewitched them and caused them to come under the curse of the law, thus depriving them of the enjoyment of Christ and causing them to fall from grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86493" data-verses="Galatians 5:4">5:4</span>). </p>

It was preached to him not only before the accomplishing of redemption by Christ, but also before the giving of the law through Moses. What God promised to Abraham corresponds to what God accomplished in Christ, which is the fulfillment of His promise to Abraham. The New Testament economy is a continuation of His dealing with Abraham and has nothing to do with the law of Moses. All the New Testament believers should be in this continuation and should have nothing to do with the law given through Moses. </p>

<p data-content-id="zoSuUTRAjb71fws33A2Ij_qKvAhP4DZHkvk4LihK5YZEcnjH-Rw-Qvjra-Rp4-Cu9"> Law was the principle according to which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament economy. In dealing with the children of Israel according to the law, God dealt with them through the tabernacle with the priesthood and the offerings. On the one hand, He dealt with them according to the law; on the other hand, He dealt with them through the tabernacle. After the giving of the law, God came to dwell in the tabernacle. At the end of the book of Exodus, the tabernacle was set up. Then at the very beginning of Leviticus, we see that God spoke from within the tent of meeting. God was hidden within the tabernacle and spoke in the tabernacle. Thus, God dealt with His people from within the tabernacle, through the tabernacle, and according to the law. <span class="pg" data-page-id="163" id="163">[163]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="aary53Wx3h7_PLJIcdmPvYGWH_gir3BQkZf5Js31NuzMk7UHLOZ9EuU39xv2VI18i"> Suppose an Israelite committed a certain sin. According to the law, that one had to be condemned, perhaps even put to death. The law exposed his sin and condemned him. However, the sinner could present a trespass offering, which was then offered on the altar by the priest. In this way the one who had sinned could be forgiven. After the law exposed and condemned him, it brought him to the tabernacle through the altar. This indicates that the law first exposes us and then brings us unto Christ. If there had been no law to condemn the people, there would have been no need of redemption. We need redemption because we are under the condemnation of the law. By exposing and condemning us, the law brings us to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uT8_0DRGz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> The law is a custodian which keeps sinners by condemning them. Apart from the law’s condemnation, it could not function as a custodian. Without the law’s exposure and condemnation, we cannot realize how many sins we have committed against God. Without the law, we would be without regulation or restriction. But because the law condemns us, we are kept by the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZz5BoSfDB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> In keeping us by condemning us, the law brings us to Christ. In the Old Testament, an Israelite who had sinned was condemned by the law and required to bring a trespass offering. The law functioned as a custodian to bring the sinning Israelite to Christ, his Redeemer, typified by the trespass offering. In this way the law keeps us and brings us to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="yPyDK8U8toP9ddq9fj88PGhj6ODKMupaPL4uypQZLsf1WGHSHcqrXPDiSJ3xpUhVH"> On the one hand, Paul put the law in the position of Hagar, Abraham’s concubine. On the other hand, the law has a positive position, that of a custodian to keep us and that of a child-conductor to bring us to Christ. We should not return to the law. To do this is to go to Hagar. However, we should not despise the law either, for it serves as a warden to care for those who are weak or childish. In its role as a child-conductor, the law takes care of the child. It does this by convicting, judging, condemning, and exposing the child. When the child is tempted to do something wrong, the law rebukes him and condemns him in order to keep him and to <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> bring him to the proper place. Therefore, by exposing us and condemning us, the law serves as a child-conductor to bring us to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="8QMBpb5u2uHUGqYhAKQo7aPkqYy7Luq03b-0CqpSXjxqjeY42vbmKdMawdZNSBkiv"> We have pointed out that the law was the basic principle according to which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament. If it were not for the law, not many of the children of Israel would have come to the altar with a trespass offering. Because the law exposed them and condemned them, they realized their need to come to the altar with the required offering. In this, the law is very useful to God. Although God dealt with His people according to the law, He did not deal with them through the law, but dealt with them through the tabernacle. </p>

It was added while God’s economy was proceeding because of man’s transgression, until the seed, Christ, should come, to whom God’s promise was made. Since it was added because of man’s transgressions, it should have been deducted when those transgressions were taken away. Because Christ, the seed, has come, the law must be terminated. Its function is to expose man’s fallen condition. </p>

To be guarded under law, by being shut up there, can be compared to sheep being enclosed in a fold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86497" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86498" data-verses="John 10:16">16</span>). In God’s economy, the law was used as a fold to keep God’s chosen people until Christ came. Because Christ has come, God’s people should no longer be kept under the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="xjqmn9R1X5blwipEnjasYmA4hAFLK4qU2NWwLyw0snQQ-qgOjt6rZiX-2SZwAnQMv"> The Greek word rendered “unto” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86499" data-verses="Galatians 3:23">3:23</span> can also be translated “with a view to.” This indicates that the shutting <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> up has an objective or goal in view. It should result in bringing the guarded people to the faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CbJoIEFjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> In caring for their children, Christian parents need to preach the law to them. We should not first preach grace to the children. If we give them regulations according to the law, the law will keep them in custody for Christ. Thus, we should first give them the law in a strong way. The law will expose them, guard them, and keep them, serving as a custodian to keep them for Christ. </p>

The seed is singular, whereas the sons are plural. It is rather difficult for many readers of Galatians to understand the significance of this. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYSqg91pVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN"> Concerning God’s promise to Abraham, there is the aspect of fulfillment and the aspect of enjoyment. To fulfill the promise is one thing, but to enjoy the blessing of the promise is another. Concerning promises made by one person to another, the one who fulfills the promise is seldom the one who enjoys the blessing of the promise. Usually the person who makes the promise is the one to fulfill the promise, and the one to whom the promise is made is the one who enjoys its blessing. In the case of God’s promise to Abraham, God, strictly speaking, is not the one to fulfill the promise. Instead, the promise is fulfilled by the seed, Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86541" data-verses="Galatians 3:16">v. 16</span>). Christ has fulfilled God’s promise to Abraham. Thus, the fulfillment of this promise does not depend on the many sons of Abraham, but on the unique seed of Abraham. However, with respect to the enjoyment of the blessing of this promise, the many sons are involved. Whereas the unique seed is the fulfiller, the many sons are the enjoyers. If we understand this matter, we shall be able to understand what Paul is talking about in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86542" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="ELgAnKoxymVCxEU085F09PAILOFK5e79Kcjqa9KKz-o0iNiU7mWYl8DgLsSy_YySF"> Paul wrote the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86543" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">third chapter</span> of Galatians as if he were an attorney writing a legal document. His wording is specific and precise. Consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86544" data-verses="Galatians 3:16">verse 16</span>: “But to Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed. He does not say, And to <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one, And to your seed, Who is Christ.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86545" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">verses 19</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86546" data-verses="Galatians 3:29">29</span> Paul also refers to the seed. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86547" data-verses="Galatians 3:26">verse 26</span> he speaks of the sons of God. The sons of Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86548" data-verses="Galatians 3:7">verse 7</span> are the sons of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86549" data-verses="Galatians 3:26">verse 26</span>. Now we must ask how the many sons of Abraham can be the many sons of God. The answer to this question involves the seed. On the one hand, the seed is the heir who inherits the promise. However, as the seed of Abraham, Christ also fulfills the promise. </p>
<p data-content-id="DEb9lLplhJh_b-ToTExfg9uEYDfLVqBAmO_hOEwnHQvhFVJvBhvWxecGMMAdTQUXF"> The children of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, inherited the good land of Canaan. In typology, the good land signifies Christ. Christ is both the seed and the land. He is not only the seed inheriting the promise; He is also the good land. Both the seed and the good land are types of Christ. As the unique seed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86550" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span>, Christ not only inherits the promise, but He also fulfills the promise. The promise God made to Abraham was fulfilled by Christ as Abraham’s seed. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sg88U9K0yJlgyYkOTTYYeg-7gE8DoC0LNRDbxGhs9u9M3IxMpYooF2YKtp-9frUCd"> In the matter of fulfilling the promise, we have no part. Only Christ, the unique seed, is qualified to fulfill God’s promise to Abraham. In this sense, the seed is uniquely one. But in the aspect of enjoying the fulfilled promise, the seed becomes many, the many sons of Abraham. </p>

Christ is the seed, and the seed is the heir who inherits the promises. Here, Christ is the unique seed inheriting the promises. Hence, in order to inherit the promised blessing, we must be one with Christ. Outside of Him, we cannot inherit the promises given by God to Abraham. In God’s eyes Abraham has only one seed, Christ. We must be in Him that we may participate in the promise given to Abraham. He is not only the seed inheriting the promise, but also the blessing of the promise for inheritance. For the Galatian believers to turn back from Christ to the law meant that <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> they would forfeit both the Heir and the inheritance of the promises. </p>

In one sense, when Christ died on the cross, He was crucified alone as our Redeemer. But in another sense, when He was crucified, we were with Him. For the accomplishment of redemption, Christ was crucified alone. But for terminating the old creation, Christ included us in His crucifixion. In the same principle, in the fulfillment of the promise made by God to Abraham, we are not included as part of the unique seed. We can have no share in the fulfillment of this promise. However, for inheriting the promise and enjoying it, we are included. Christ alone fulfilled the promise. But Christ and we share in the enjoyment of the promise. Therefore, on the one hand, the seed is uniquely one; on the other hand, it is all-inclusive. For fulfillment, the seed is one; for inheritance and enjoyment, the seed is all-inclusive, including all believers who have been baptized into Christ. </p>

Faith in Christ makes the New Testament believers sons of God, a relationship altogether in life. We, the New Testament believers, were born sons of fallen Adam, and in Adam, because of transgressions, we were under the law of Moses. But we have been reborn to become sons of Abraham and have been freed from the law of Moses by faith in Christ. We are sons of Abraham not by natural birth, but by faith. Hence, our being sons of Abraham is based upon the principle of faith. It is based on our believing, not on our working. Our basis for being sons of Abraham surely is not natural descent. We are Abraham’s sons according to the principle of faith. </p>

We may also say that faith is a photograph of the divine scenery. Through such faith we become true sons of Abraham. When we believed in Christ, an organic union took place. The divine life entered into us, and we were born of God through faith. As our faith photographed the divine scenery of grace, something of a real and <span class="pg" data-page-id="175" id="175">[175]</span> substantial spiritual nature was infused into us. Although this substance is neither material nor physical, it is nonetheless very real. Faith is not superstition. It is related to substantial spiritual reality, a reality which admittedly is very mysterious. This reality is actually the processed Triune God Himself. When we exercise faith in Christ and thereby take a spiritual photograph of the divine scenery, the processed God enters into our being to be our life. This life is divine, spiritual, heavenly, and holy. Entering into us, it causes a spiritual birth to take place. This birth brings about an organic union between us and the Triune God. Because God has been born into our being, we have become sons of God. Thus, we may say that we are God-men. </p>

We need to exercise our entire being in order to have a proper understanding of such a wonderful baptism. Regrettably, many Christians today do not have an adequate view of baptism. Some Christians argue about the method of baptism or about the kind of water used. Some reduce baptism to a dead ritual. Other Christians go to another extreme and associate baptism with speaking in tongues. Rarely among today’s Christians do we see baptism practiced in a proper, genuine, and living way, with the believers baptized into the name of the Triune God, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into the Body of Christ. Such a baptism, a baptism into the divine name, a living Person, an effective death, and a living organism, puts the believers into a position where they can experience an organic union with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="xjqmn9R1X5blwipEnjasYmA0pAFHM4qU2NWwLyw0snQQ-qgOjt6rZiX-2SZwAnQMv"> Commenting on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86595" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> in his <em>Word Studies in the New Testament,</em> M. R. Vincent says, “Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with him.” The Greek preposition rendered “into” is crucial, for it points to this spiritual, mystical union. Moreover, Vincent says that the word “name” here “is the expression of the sum total of the divine Being....It is equivalent to his <em>person.”</em> Therefore, to baptize believers into the name of the Triune God means to baptize them into the very being, the Person, of the Triune God. The name denotes the Person, and the Person is the all-inclusive, processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit. When we baptize people into the name of the Triune God, we baptize them into such a divine Person. To baptize anyone into the name of the Trinity is to immerse that one into all the Triune God is. </p>
<p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CXBoIIDjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> According to the Gospel of Matthew, baptism brings repentant people out of their old state into a new one, by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ that they may become the kingdom people. John the Baptist’s recommending ministry began with a preliminary baptism by water only. Now, after the heavenly King <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> accomplished His ministry on earth, passed through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the ones they discipled into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water, and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86596" data-verses="Acts 2:38">Acts 2:38</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86597" data-verses="Acts 2:41">41</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86598" data-verses="Acts 10:44-48">10:44-48</span>). The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect; whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible aspect by the Spirit, the visible aspect by water is vain; and without the visible aspect by water, the invisible aspect by the Spirit is abstract and impractical. Both are needed. Not long after the Lord charged the disciples with this baptism, He baptized them and the entire church in the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86599" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Cor. 12:13</span>) on the day of Pentecost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86600" data-verses="Acts 1:5">Acts 1:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86601" data-verses="Acts 2:4">2:4</span>) and in the house of Cornelius (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86602" data-verses="Acts 11:15-17">Acts 11:15-17</span>). Then, based upon this, the disciples baptized the new converts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86603" data-verses="Acts 2:38">Acts 2:38</span>), not only visibly into water, but also invisibly into the death of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86604" data-verses="Romans 6:3-4">Rom. 6:3-4</span>), into Christ Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86605" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>), into the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86606" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>), and into the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86607" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Cor. 12:13</span>). The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb to terminate the old history of the one being baptized. Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, and since Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God, and the Triune God is eventually one with the Body of Christ, so to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to terminate their old life, on the negative side, and, on the positive side, to germinate them with new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ. Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86608" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> is one that baptizes people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens. </p>

To be baptized into Christ is to enter into an organic union with the Triune God. God’s intention in His economy is to put us into Him and to come into us and live in us. This is what we mean by the organic union, an organic oneness in life. </p>

Believing and being baptized are two parts of one step. First we believe into Christ, then we are baptized into Him. The Greek preposition, <em>eis,</em> used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86646" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86647" data-verses="John 3:18">18</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86648" data-verses="John 3:36">36</span>, means into. These verses indicate that we need to believe into the Son. By believing in Christ we enter into Christ. We believe ourselves <em>into</em> Him. We have seen that M. R. Vincent says that this Greek preposition, as used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86649" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>, implies a mystical, spiritual union with the Triune God. Chinese people may believe Confucius, but they would never say that they believe into Confucius. Neither would Greeks claim to believe into Plato. Chinese do not become one with Confucius, and Greeks do not enter into a spiritual union with Plato. But when we believe into the Lord Jesus, we experience an organic union with Him. When we believe in Him, we believe into Him and thereby become one spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> with Him. This is what we mean by the expression <em>organic union.</em> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86650" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span> Paul speaks often about faith and believing. But at the end of the chapter, he speaks of being baptized into Christ. The step which begins with believing into Christ is completed by being baptized into Him. In this way there takes place in full an organic union between the believers and the Triune God. </p>

<p data-content-id="suGsx2yrlu_xHF1tfjn8zJMpmepgd_FkeXicCvRkOc4iVF8ZQC36eleSovBwPlpZv"> To put on Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ. Whenever we clothe ourselves in a certain way, we indicate that we intend to live in that way. In like manner, to put on Christ means that we live by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ. In particular, it means that we live out Christ. Christ becomes the expression of our living. Immediately after we have been put into Christ and have entered into an organic union with Him, we need to live Christ, to put Christ on in our living.

Paul seemed to be telling them, “You have all been baptized into Christ and into the one Body. Now you should take Christ as your clothing, your expression, and live Him. Don’t go back to the law to try to fulfill its requirements. Stay with Christ and live out Christ. Remember, you are members of the one Body, of the one new man. Stay with all those who are in Christ, and practice the church life so that God’s purpose can be fulfilled. If you go back to the law, you will be in slavery again. The desire of God’s heart cannot be satisfied by your efforts to keep the law. It can be satisfied only if you remain with Christ and live Him out.” Praise the Lord that we have entered into an organic union with Him and that now we are living Christ in the church, the one Body. Surely this satisfies God. </p>

These verses indicate that the Apostle Paul was in a difficult situation with respect to the believers in Galatia. They had been brought to the Lord through Paul’s preaching of the gospel, and he had a heart to care for them. Paul’s burden was not to carry on a Christian work, but was to minister Christ to the believers, to labor that Christ might be formed in them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86718" data-verses="Galatians 4:19">v. 19</span>). It is possible to work for the Lord and to help the saints, without having the burden to minister Christ to them. We may earnestly work for Christ without having any burden to see Christ formed in the saints. Hence, it is important for us to see that Paul’s burden as expressed in these verses was altogether different from that of most Christian workers. We may be burdened for the raising up of local churches and for the strengthening of the churches. However, we may not have the burden to minister Christ into the saints. To preach the gospel and raise up churches is one thing; to bear the burden to minister Christ into the saints is another. Paul’s burden was not for a work; it was for ministering Christ into the believers. This is the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86719" data-verses="Galatians 4:8-20">4:8-20</span> Paul uses certain intimate expressions, expressions which show the closeness of his relationship to the Galatian believers and his affection for them. Let us now consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86720" data-verses="Galatians 4:8-20">4:8-20</span> verse by verse. </p>

They were considered gods by their superstitious worshippers, but by nature they do not exist as gods. </p>

They are the elementary principles of the law, its rudimentary teachings. Here Paul points out that by turning again to the weak and poor elements of the law, the Galatian believers would once again become enslaved. Paul’s use of the word enslaved indicates how serious the Judaizers were in working on the Galatian believers. The Judaizers bewitched them, deceived them, to such a degree that they were brought into slavery. To the Judaizers, the law was a matter of life and death. Therefore, they were desperate in their attempt to mislead the Galatians. Paul realized that once the Galatian believers had been deceived, they would be enslaved. To say that the Galatians were enslaved means that they had been deceived to the uttermost. </p>

The days mentioned were the Sabbaths and new moons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86724" data-verses="Isaiah 66:23">Isa. 66:23</span>). The months were the sacred months like the first, Abib, the ear-month (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86725" data-verses="Exodus 13:4">Exo. 13:4</span>); the second, Zif, the flower-month (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86726" data-verses="1Kings 6:1">1 Kings 6:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86727" data-verses="1Kings 6:37">37</span>); the seventh, Ethanim, the month of streaming rivers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86728" data-verses="1Kings 8:2">1 Kings 8:2</span>); and the eighth, Bul, the month of rain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86729" data-verses="1Kings 6:38">1 Kings 6:38</span>). The seasons were festal seasons such as the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86730" data-verses="2Chronicles 8:13">2 Chron. 8:13</span>). The years perhaps denoted sabbatical years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86731" data-verses="Leviticus 25:4">Lev. 25:4</span>). </p>

Their turning to the Jewish religious observances might cause <span class="pg" data-page-id="201" id="201">[201]</span> Paul’s labor upon them to be in vain. It seems Paul was telling the believers in Galatia, “I labored on you and ministered Christ into you. Why, after receiving what I ministered to you, would you go back to the ordinances of the law?” Paul was puzzled. He simply could not believe that those who had received his preaching could be bewitched to such a degree that they would return to the observances of the law and become enslaved to them. </p>

You did not injure me at all.” Paul was free from the bondage of Jewish observances. He besought the Galatians to become as he was, even as he had become as a Gentile for the truth of the gospel. Having done his best to become the same as the Galatians, he now besought them to become as he is. He seemed to be saying, “I love you and became like you. Now I ask you to become as I am. I am not for days, months, seasons, and years. I am for Christ. I beg you, become as I am.” </p>

For I testify to you that if possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.” The Greek words rendered “your blessedness” also mean your felicitation, your happiness. The Galatians formerly considered Paul’s being retained in their place and preaching the gospel to them a blessing. They were happy about it and boasted of it. That became their felicitation. However, now that they had departed from Paul’s preaching of the gospel, the apostle questions them, “Where then is your blessedness, your happiness, your felicitation?” </p>
<p data-content-id="DEb9lLplhJh_b-ToTExfg9uEbDfifqBAmO_hOEwnHQvhFVJvBhvWxecGMMAdTQUXF"> When Paul was among them, the Galatians celebrated their happiness with one another and congratulated one another for the opportunity to have such a minister of Christ with them. When Paul was in Galatia preaching the gospel, ministering Christ to the people, they were happy and regarded Paul’s presence as a great blessing. This happiness, blessedness, felicitation, is what is implied by the Greek term used here. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sg88U9K0yJlgyYkOTTYYeg-7jE8ujC0LNRDbxGhs9u9M3IxMpYooF2YKtp-9frUCd"> The Galatians appreciated Paul’s preaching and loved him to such an extent that, as he says, if possible, they would have torn out their eyes and given them to him. This may indicate that Paul’s physical weakness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86738" data-verses="Galatians 4:13">v. 13</span>) was in his eyes. This may be confirmed by the large letters he used in writing to them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86739" data-verses="Galatians 6:11">6:11</span>). It may also be the thorn in his flesh, some physical weakness, which he prayed might be removed from him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86740" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7-9">2 Cor. 12:7-9</span>). </p>

Suppose some brothers visit the saints in a certain region, and the saints there receive them gladly. However, later the saints are distracted by some teaching or practice and turn against the very brothers whom they once gladly received and appreciated highly. In such a case, these brothers may <span class="pg" data-page-id="203" id="203">[203]</span> be tempted to give up on the saints in that region. But this definitely was not Paul’s attitude. On the contrary, he was burdened to write them and to appeal to them in a loving manner. We should learn of Paul to take up the burden for those believers who have turned away from us. Perhaps we should write them and say, “Do you not remember how you served us in love? Where is your love today? It seems that now you consider us your enemies. To be sure, this is not reasonable. Are we enemies simply because we speak the truth to you?” </p>

Those who are sons of Abraham through faith are the heirs of the promise, those who inherit the blessing. These heirs need to be filled, occupied, and saturated with Christ. They need to have Christ formed in them. </p>

The book of Galatians indicates that God’s intention is for Christ to be wrought into His chosen people that they may become sons of God. In order to be God’s sons, we need to be permeated and saturated with Christ. Christ must occupy our entire being. The Galatians, however, were distracted from Christ to the law. Hence, Paul told them repeatedly that it was altogether wrong to leave Christ and return to the law. The believers should come back to Christ, who is both the seed who fulfills God’s promise to Abraham and also the good land, the all-inclusive Spirit to be our enjoyment. As believers, we need the full enjoyment of this blessing, the full enjoyment of the life-giving Spirit. We need to be permeated, saturated, possessed, and fully taken over by this Spirit and with this Spirit. According to the context of the book of Galatians, to have Christ formed in us is to <span class="pg" data-page-id="210" id="210">[210]</span> allow Him to permeate our being and to saturate our inward parts. When Christ occupies our inner being in this way, He is formed in us. </p>

Even things which come from God and are scriptural may not be Christ Himself. Although the law was given by God, it must be set aside so that all the ground in our being may be given over to Christ. We need to allow Him to saturate every part of our inner being. He must occupy us and saturate our mind, emotion, and will. To have Christ possess our entire being is to have Him formed in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="CU-aCEAv94CWgyGmLnJX6EWWAljJgUGLo0AuX53zp3T1Hmvg_AjLyLvlpXa2-6nQD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86783" data-verses="Ephesians 3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span> we see that Paul prayed that “Christ may make His home in your hearts.” We know that the heart includes the mind, the will, the emotion, and the conscience. To let Christ make His home in our hearts means that He makes His home in all these parts of our inner being. If Christ is to make home in our hearts, He needs to be able to settle down within us. Once again, this is to have Christ formed in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKq_1PV3eAb4MikYTBXhWJNXNBXYNqBwb1Fvjrk6UsLnidkL0QTPNWxbRwhd0-kpK"> To have Christ formed in us is to allow the all-inclusive Spirit to occupy every part of our inner being. The law should not have any room in our mind, emotion, or will. All the ground within us must be for Christ. We need to allow Christ to occupy us fully. He should not only spread into our mind, emotion, and will; He should actually become our mind, emotion, and will. Let Christ be your thought, decision, and love. Let Him be everything to you. This is to have Christ formed in you. Everything other than Christ must diminish, and Christ must become everything to us in our experience. </p>

To have the full <span class="pg" data-page-id="211" id="211">[211]</span> enjoyment of this blessing is to let Christ be formed in us. This means that if we would have the full enjoyment of the blessing of the gospel, we need to have Christ formed in us. If Christ is not yet fully formed in us, then our enjoyment of the blessing of the New Testament is not yet full. Although we have enjoyed the blessing in part, we need to go on to allow Christ to occupy us wholly, to take us over and saturate every part of our being with Himself. To do this is to enjoy the blessing of the gospel to the uttermost. This was Paul’s goal in writing to the Galatian believers. As He appealed to their personal affection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86784" data-verses="Galatians 4:8-20">4:8-20</span>, Paul had this goal clearly in mind. He appealed to the believers’ affection so that Christ might be formed in them for the fulfillment of God’s goal. </p>

Such deviation shuts the believers out from the enjoyment of Christ as their life and their everything. </p>

He did this for the purpose of ministering Christ to them. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86787" data-verses="Galatians 4:21">verse 21</span> Paul goes back to the tone he used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86788" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapter three</span>. In fact, he speaks to them in an even stronger way. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86789" data-verses="Galatians 4:22-23">verses 22 and 23</span> Paul continues, “For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one of the maidservant and one of the free woman. But the one of the maidservant was born according to flesh, and the one of the free woman through the promise.” To be born according to flesh is to be born by man’s fleshly effort, whereas to be born through the promise is to be born through God’s power in grace, which is implied in His promise. Ishmael was born in the former way, but Isaac in the latter. According to the context, the law goes with the flesh, and grace goes with the promise. The child born of the maidservant was born according to the flesh, whereas the one born of the free woman was born according <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> to grace. Because grace goes with the promise, to be born through promise is to be born through grace. </p>

Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the Jerusalem which now is, for she is in slavery with her children.” Of the two covenants mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86792" data-verses="Galatians 4:24">verse 24</span>, one is the covenant of promise to Abraham, which is related to the New Testament, the covenant of grace, and the other is the covenant of law related to Moses, which has nothing to do with the New Testament. Sarah, the free woman, represents the covenant of promise, and Hagar, the maidservant, the covenant of law. </p>
<p data-content-id="IEVFDlaYVRjSRK71dHxvanxHViFigXn-0yai8TnmSQ0mIPD3pnj0_KMZCVI_UK25d"> Mount Sinai was the place where the law was given (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86793" data-verses="Exodus 19:20">Exo. 19:20</span>). The slavery spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86794" data-verses="Galatians 4:24">verse 24</span> is the slavery under the law. Hagar, the concubine of Abraham, signifies the law. Hence, the position of the law is like that of a concubine. Sarah, the wife of Abraham, symbolizes the grace of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86795" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>), which has the right position in God’s economy. The law, like Hagar, brought forth children unto slavery like the Judaizers. Grace, like Sarah, brings forth children unto sonship. These are the New Testament believers. They are no longer under law, but under grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86796" data-verses="Romans 6:14">Rom. 6:14</span>). They should stand in this grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86797" data-verses="Romans 5:2">Rom. 5:2</span>) and not fall from it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86798" data-verses="Galatians 5:4">Gal. 5:4</span>). </p>

However, because it brings God’s chosen people into the bondage of law, it corresponds to Mount Sinai, which belongs to the covenant of law represented by Hagar. Jerusalem and her children were slaves under the law at Paul’s time. </p>
<p data-content-id="X2KpgkkTGpuer9ChrLtbTP3dNQwSrpPE30oZb2NYjLrZPMqVCuoyr2w9p0BOI3Rme"> Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86803" data-verses="Galatians 4:24-25">verses 24 and 25</span> was clear and strong. No doubt, the Judaizers must have been offended by it. </p>

<p data-content-id="7EjiJiKSogg44JUcqVx5SCLdtPkO9zVQuzRHXmWHEsrf9X58XGzqK5yeH8wP2vo49"> The first four chapters of Galatians present a revelation of the gospel preached by the Apostle Paul. If you compare the revelation in these chapters with that conveyed in the four Gospels, you will see that, in a certain sense, the revelation in these chapters is richer, deeper, and more profound than that in the Gospels. For example, in the four Gospels we do not have a clear view of the desire of God’s heart. But the first four chapters of Galatians do present such a clear view of this. As we have pointed out, God’s promise to Abraham was the unveiling of the desire of God’s heart. Because many Christians concentrate on the Gospels alone, they do not know the desire of God’s heart. Furthermore, although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86828" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> speaks of grace, in Galatians we see that grace is the fulfillment of God’s promise according to the desire of His heart. The Gospels also present the living Person of Christ as viewed from four angles. But without the first four chapters of Galatians, we would not understand Christ in such a deep way. The same is true concerning the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86829" data-verses="John 14:1">Chapters fourteen through sixteen</span> of the Gospel of John reveal much concerning the Spirit. But if we did not have the book of Galatians, we would not know that the Spirit is Christ as the seed of Abraham to fulfill the promise. In fulfilling the promise, Christ is the seed; but for our enjoyment, He is the land, which typifies the all-inclusive Spirit. Hence, the seed is for fulfillment, whereas the land is for enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="_Fv0JBBWQcCEA6UxPCM9K1DtVARGCRb8K6GGkuofFK8ArsuS12Lmc3gY7CCOW-tTq"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86830" data-verses="Galatians 5:1-6">5:1-6</span>, which begins another major section of Galatians, concerned with the walk of God’s children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86831" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">5:1—6:17</span>). After presenting the profound <span class="pg" data-page-id="220" id="220">[220]</span> revelation found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86832" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">chapters one through four</span>, Paul turns to the walk of God’s children according to the Spirit. </p>

This charge is based upon the revelation presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86834" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">chapters one through four</span>, where he spoke of slavery under the law and of how Christ has delivered us from that slavery. The freedom in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86835" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">5:1</span> denotes freedom from the slavery of law. Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom and grace. To stand fast is to stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of law, not deviating from Christ, not falling from grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CXFoIpMjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> The Greek word rendered entangled may also be translated held ensnared. To deviate from Christ to law is to be entangled or held ensnared. The yoke of slavery is the bondage of law, which makes the law-keepers slaves under a binding yoke. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYSvg9ojVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86836" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">5:1</span> Paul uses an unusual expression, “For freedom Christ has set us free.” Paul’s composition here is somewhat awkward, even redundant. He could have said simply, “Christ has set us free.” The Bible is often redundant and repetitious. Consider how often Paul speaks of faith in the book of Galatians, or how many times the New Testament refers to justification by faith. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86837" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">5:1</span> Paul writes in a redundant manner in order to impress us with the preciousness of our freedom in Christ. It seems Paul was saying to the Galatians, “I want you to remember that it was for freedom that Christ has set us free. Since Christ has set us free for freedom, we should stand fast and not be entangled again with the yoke of slavery.” Paul used strong terms in order to impress the distracted Galatians that they must set aside the yoke of slavery and come back to their freedom in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="221" id="221">[221]</span> </p>

To be brought to nought from Christ is to be reduced to nothing from Christ, deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated from Him (Darby), so that He is made void of effect. To go back to law is to become severed from Christ, to be brought to nought from Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sg88U9K0yJlgyYkOTTYYeg-7lE8ihC0LNRDbxGhs9u9M3IxMpYooF2YKtp-9frUCd"> The different renderings of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86840" data-verses="Galatians 5:4">5:4</span> are all implied in the one Greek expression. Literally, this expression means to be brought to nothing from Christ. Dean Alford says that an exact, accurate, and literal translation of the Greek term would be annihilated, which in its original meaning means to bring something to nothing. Hence, in this verse Paul is talking about being brought to nothing, to nought, from Christ. He was telling the Galatians, “Dear saints, you who seek to be justified by law have been brought to nothing from Christ. You were grafted into Christ, and you were enjoying the riches of Christ. But by going back to the law and to circumcision, you are brought to nought, you are annihilated, from Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESeDgWz2cLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS"> If a branch from an inferior tree is grafted into a superior tree, it will enjoy all the benefits of being part of that superior tree. But suppose the grafted branch is later detached from the superior tree. In such a case we may say that it is brought to nothing from the superior tree, for by being separated from that tree, it relinquishes all the benefits of being joined to it. Thus, it reduces itself to nothing from the superior tree, in particular from the enjoyment of the riches of that tree. This illustrates Paul’s meaning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86841" data-verses="Galatians 5:4">5:4</span>. By believing into Christ and being baptized into Him, we have been grafted into Him as the rich tree. As branches grafted into Him, we may enjoy His unsearchable riches. As long as we <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> remain grafted into Him, we may enjoy all His riches. But if we relinquish Christ, let Him go in a practical way in our experience, we shall be brought to nothing from the unsearchably rich Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrLceI5BWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-"> The Galatians had been distracted to the law and to circumcision. In turning to the law in this way, they were brought to nothing from Christ. Darby says that they were deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated from Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="5euwGBFk7L_E9dzcXZ8PUzyva3r0lMSqW8T1Z9BMt24AQwhyvAVjySQuKVWJUZej3"> It is difficult to find Christians today who, in some way or other, have not been brought to nought from Christ. What Christians remain grafted to Christ in a practical way to enjoy all His riches? We admit that there are a good number of Christians in Catholicism. But Catholicism has brought them to nothing from Christ. The same is true of the vast majority of Christians in the denominations. The rituals, forms, and practices have caused them to be brought to nothing from Christ. All these things deprive believers of their profit in Christ. This is even true among those in the Brethren assemblies, where strong emphasis is placed on right doctrine. Many of the Brethren care more for doctrine than for the abiding in Christ and the enjoyment of Christ. In fact, it is not likely that they would even use the expression “the enjoyment of Christ.” They are preoccupied with doctrine; they do not care for how to contact the Lord, to remain in the spirit, to abide in the Lord, and to enjoy the riches of Christ. This may be like a foreign language to them. Although they regard themselves as the most biblical of Christians, to some extent they also have been brought to nought from Christ. Those in today’s Pentecostalism and charismatic movement have also been brought to nothing from Christ in certain ways. Some care for such things as the lengthening of legs and for speaking in tongues, but not for remaining grafted into Christ to enjoy His riches. </p>

This persuasion is not of Him Who calls you.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86863" data-verses="Galatians 4:20">4:20</span> Paul told the Galatians that he was perplexed about them. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86864" data-verses="Galatians 5:7-8">5:7 and 8</span> Paul assumes a rather mild tone. He praises them by saying that they were running well. Then he asks them who hindered them that they should not obey the truth. Truth here does not refer to doctrine, but refers to the reality in Christ, as preached to the Galatians by Paul. In these verses it is difficult to tell whether Paul is mild or bold. On the one hand, he praises them, but, on the other hand, he seems to rebuke them. In talking to the Galatian believers Paul was very careful. </p>
<p data-content-id="cRATS1-L3cm1MtNnkWc4VER7DTTDlCgQiyABPNg5nT87ViyZ-4pqbb-_dLxY-Hqe9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86865" data-verses="Galatians 5:8">5:8</span> Paul says, “This persuasion is not of Him Who calls you.” The persuasion Paul mentions here is that of the Judaizers’ teaching, which was distracting the Galatians <span class="pg" data-page-id="228" id="228">[228]</span> from Christ to the observances of the law. This persuasion was not of God, the One who had called them. Thus, it must have been from another source, from Satan. Paul’s word here is a strong indication that the Judaizers were one with Satan in acting against God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="foiLIlvcS80gCzQLJEjLx1z9FlA7oeKfvi_9m0_XuzDf4uNd_MonuQ67A3GsUpFID"> We may apply this principle to our situation today. The persuasive talk of the opposers and the dissenting ones is not of the One who has called us. Therefore, its source must be Satan. This is a very serious matter. Be careful when listening to the persuasive speech of dissenting ones. Do not just listen to their words, but check whether or not their speech is of the One who has called us. Discern whether or not their persuasive talk is of God. Do not be misled by pleasant words. Deceivers are often sweet talkers. They use soothing, comforting, enticing words in their attempt to persuade you. But concealed within these words there is poison. Speaking with sugar-coated words, the dissenting ones may try to entice the weak ones away from the enjoyment of Christ and from the proper church life. Such talk is not of the One who called us. It issues from another source, from Satan, God’s enemy. The goal of this persuasion is to bring us to nothing from the enjoyment of Christ. Beware of the subtlety of the enemy behind this kind of persuasion. </p>

Not Allowing a Little Leaven<br/>to Leaven the Whole Lump</h2><p data-content-id="Hlq_gUShg2G7IhotoZBaNpfrG5fhpJVlHrXNP3YQSM19wOBoXfa9nS1og1JwPplH9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86866" data-verses="Galatians 5:9">verse 9</span> Paul goes on to say, “A little leaven leavens the whole lump.” Leaven here refers to the false teachings of the Judaizers (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86867" data-verses="Matthew 16:12">Matt. 16:12</span>), and the lump, to all the believers collectively. The whole lump is the church. Actually, Paul did not regard the false teachings of the Judaizers merely as a small amount of leaven, a little leaven. Certain of the Galatian believers, however, may have considered the persuasive speech of the Judaizers as something rather small. For this reason, Paul pointed out that even a little leaven leavens the whole lump. </p>
<p data-content-id="X2KpgkkTGpuer9ChrLtbTP3dPQweppPE30oZb2NYjLrZPMqVCuoyr2w9p0BOI3Rme"> In his subtle strategy, Satan uses the opposing ones and the dissenting ones to inject a little leaven through their <span class="pg" data-page-id="229" id="229">[229]</span> persuasive speech. This leaven works as an appetizer that stirs up our desire in a negative way. The negative points covered in the first four chapters of Galatians were not merely a little leaven, but a large amount of leaven. But in dealing with those believers who had been distracted by the teaching of the Judaizers, Paul speaks in a careful way and refers to a little leaven. Whether the amount is large or small, leaven is leaven. Leaven is like germs in that it multiplies; it causes the whole lump to be leavened. We need to learn from the experience of the Galatians not to open ourselves to even a little leaven, for a little leaven is capable of leavening the whole church. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="kWWIR_PfYdTAivJZe4CjaMmpweJRMXYMQN8Lfl4WOobFn7DmNjazJgeo2POKKCOfK">C. In Nothing Otherwise Minded</h2><p data-content-id="JXqZnZhBWTHYr5N7Yht-3oFlttZnpjmP3ypdcLgaJCkerNiqlRD_Yss6rPYP8xAja"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86868" data-verses="Galatians 5:10">verse 10</span> Paul says, “I have confidence as to you in the Lord that in nothing you will be otherwise minded.” This word indicates that Paul had great faith. Notice, however, that Paul’s confidence was not in the Galatians, but in the Lord. Paul did not say, “I have confidence in you”; rather, he said, “I have confidence as to you in the Lord.” Because Paul had been praying for the Galatians, he could have confidence in the Lord concerning them and not be disappointed. In particular, Paul was confident that the Galatians would not be otherwise minded. </p>
<p data-content-id="zoSuUTRAjb71fws33A2Ij_qGgAhP8DZHkvk4LihK5YZEcnjH-Rw-Qvjra-Rp4-Cu9"> In referring to the matter of being otherwise minded, Paul touches the most important source of problems in the church life—that of having a different mind, of being otherwise minded. As long as there is no idolatry, immorality, or divisiveness in the church, we should not be otherwise minded concerning anything. Instead, we should be one with the church and go along with the church, no matter what direction the church may pursue. Regarding doctrines and practices, do not be otherwise minded. For example, do not say that you agree with arranging the chairs in a particular way, but not with arranging them in some other way. Also, we should not say that we prefer to meet in homes instead of in the meeting hall. It is absolutely not of God to be otherwise minded in this way. The source of this is the enemy, <span class="pg" data-page-id="230" id="230">[230]</span> Satan. None of us should give ground for a different kind of mind to enter into the church life. We need to close ourselves to such an invasion of the enemy. We all must take the responsibility not to be otherwise minded. If the church practices idolatry, we should stand against it. But even in this we must have a proper spirit in order to be helpful to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="aary53Wx3h7_PLJIcdmPvYGaI_giv3BQkZf5Js31NuzMk7UHLOZ9EuU39xv2VI18i"> To repeat, we should not agree with anything idolatrous, immoral, or divisive. However, we should not be dissenting about other things. Suppose we come to a meeting and find the chairs arranged in a very unusual way. If none of the saints speak critically of this arrangement, this will be a sign that the church life is very strong. It will be a clear indication that we care for Christ and not for a particular way of arranging the chairs. </p>
<p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uTww0DRKz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> If we have truly seen the enjoyment of Christ and the oneness of the church, we shall not be otherwise minded. We shall not care for any particular opinion, way, or practice. Instead, we shall care only for the enjoyment of Christ and for the oneness of the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZz1OoSfPB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> In the church life, we should not exercise our mind to gather unnecessary information. We should not be spies trying to gather information. The weaker we are in life, the greater will be our tendency to act like a spy. Should such a weak one visit a church in another locality, he may want to spy out things there. This kind of practice is devilish. Whenever we visit another church, we should be content to be blind, not knowing anything about the situation of the saints there. </p>
<p data-content-id="yPyDK8U8toP9ddq9fj88PGhv1ODGKupaPL4uypQZLsf1WGHSHcqrXPDiSJ3xpUhVH"> When Paul uttered the words that he was confident in the Lord concerning the Galatian believers that they would not be otherwise minded, the situation among the saints was much different than it is today. When Paul wrote the book of Galatians, there was still the proper emphasis on the oneness of the church in each locality and on the enjoyment of Christ. Paul’s confidence was based upon the fact that there was just one church in each locality and that in his ministry there was a strong and clear emphasis on <span class="pg" data-page-id="231" id="231">[231]</span> Christ as everything to the saints. This was the basis for Paul’s confidence in the Lord that in nothing the believers in Galatia would be otherwise minded. Paul prayed much for the believers and was confident that in everything they would not be otherwise minded. He had a solid ground for this confidence. But because of the pervasive influence of poisonous leaven, our situation is very different. The matter of being otherwise minded is found virtually among all Christians. But at Paul’s time the church was one, and Paul had reason for confidence in the Lord concerning the saints. </p>

<p data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrLeeIoOWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86883" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> Paul tells us to walk by the Spirit. The Christian walk is absolutely by the Spirit, not by the flesh. According to the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86884" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">chapter five</span>, the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86885" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in our regenerated spirit and mingles with it. To walk by the Spirit is to have our walk regulated by the Holy Spirit within our spirit. This is contrasted with our walk being regulated by the law in our flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="5euwGBFk7L_E9dzcXZ8PUzyvY3rppMSqW8T1Z9BMt24AQwhyvAVjySQuKVWJUZej3"> The word walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86886" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> means to move, act, and have our being. It includes everything we do and say. Hence, it covers our whole daily life. In this verse Paul is charging us to have our daily life—to live, walk, and have our being—by the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="N78TKjbEXVwSfszdd30oED01uvQoZQ--ofRmWsRF1_iiqC8arZJbwvJC5VunnOdmn"> In composing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86887" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">verse 16</span>, Paul did not use the term Holy Spirit. In fact, he did not even use the definite article before the word Spirit. Literally, he simply said, “Walk by Spirit.” We have indicated that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86888" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">chapter five</span> the Spirit refers to the Spirit indwelling our spirit and mingled with it. Therefore, the Spirit here is the mingled spirit. The emphasis, however, is on the indwelling Spirit. When the New Testament refers to the indwelling Spirit, it implies that our spirit is indwelt by the Spirit. The two spirits are one. As Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86889" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Corinthians 6:17</span>, “He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.” The Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86890" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> thus denotes the Holy Spirit mingled with the human spirit. Every saved person has such a spirit within him. To be regenerated is to have the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit mingled with our spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAEs0xtJj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86891" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">3:2</span> Paul asked the Galatians a question: “Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?” Paul was trying to impress the distracted Galatian believers with the fact that they had received the Spirit, who was now mingled with their spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86892" data-verses="Galatians 3:3">3:3</span> he went on to ask them, “Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?” They began their Christian life by the Spirit. However, they were being distracted from the Spirit to the law, circumcision, and the ordinances of Judaism. Now after covering a number of important matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86893" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapters three and four</span>, Paul charges them in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86894" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> to walk by the Spirit. There was no need for the Galatians to walk by the law, circumcision, or ordinances. It was sufficient for them to walk by the Spirit. If they would walk by the Spirit, they would by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="hwMadJIZ14zUSl3gCcShY89leJQSBmfydHXU1tIkWKzKdKgtXF3CB5KwOuJngqEmP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86895" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">chapter five</span> Paul indicates that our only choice is to walk either by the Spirit or by the flesh. We have seen that the flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man, whereas the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God. To walk by the Spirit, therefore, is to walk by the processed Triune God. Because of Christ’s redemption and the Spirit’s work of regeneration, we, who have received God’s dispensation, can walk by the Spirit instead of by the flesh. This means that instead of walking by our fallen being, we can walk by the processed Triune God. We have the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit. We cannot deny that we possess such a marvelous reality through Christ’s redemption, the Spirit’s regeneration, and God’s dispensation. Of course, we also have to contend with our fallen tripartite being. Concerning our walk, we thus have the possibility of walking either by the fallen being or by the wonderful Person in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAEs0xIDj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1"> We should not go back to the law. If we try to keep the law, attempting to do good in order to please God, we shall be in the flesh, for the law is related to the flesh. Whenever we try to fulfill the requirements of the law, we exercise our flesh. This means that the flesh is active not only when we do evil, but even when we try to fulfill the law. Whenever we in ourselves <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> try to do good, the flesh is active. Instead of trying to fulfill the law, we may walk by the processed Triune God who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit. Paul wrote the book of Galatians not only to rescue the distracted Galatian believers from the law on the negative side, but also on the positive side to bring them into the realization that the believers have the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in their spirit and that they should live, walk, and have their being by this Spirit. It is possible for us to live, walk, and have our being by this Spirit. We should not believe in our weaknesses, failures, or shortcomings. We should forget all such things and realize that the processed Triune God is in us right now, not only as our Redeemer and Savior, but as the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="hwMadJIZ14zUSl3gCcShY89leJQzKmfydHXU1tIkWKzKdKgtXF3CB5KwOuJngqEmP"> I love Paul’s expression, “Walk by the Spirit.” In his Epistles, Paul does not charge us mainly to walk according to doctrine, nor even to walk according to certain Bible verses. This does not mean, however, that our walk should not be according to the Bible. The point here is that Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit in a living way. A crucial lesson for us to learn is to have our being in our spirit. This is basic. </p>
<p data-content-id="U0hKzeGUKiJ9Ln5z4YNTcfedfbLVRWosB97DAfeztAm8eOk3lOS0ACBjVbUPD323A"> When I was young, I read books on how to be victorious, how to be holy, and how to pray. Eventually I came to realize that the way to be victorious and holy and to have a proper prayer life is to be in spirit. The proper way to talk to your husband or wife is to speak in spirit. There is no need for us to seek methods. We have the unique method—to be in our spirit. The proper way to read the Bible is to read it in spirit. The way to overcome sin, to deal with our temper, and to defeat Satan is to be in spirit. To walk by the Spirit is to have our daily life in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="MW1PrIO1NZkL7m7Ua0gn0XKJBLZdxyxZO7paon9rt0Llao3pVSvH-BXWTu0cTco71"> It is not possible to separate our spirit from the Spirit, for the two spirits have been mingled and have become one spirit. We have already referred to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86896" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Corinthians 6:17</span>, where he says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. Since our spirit is mingled with the Spirit, we need to learn to have our daily life in the Spirit. We can never overemphasize the importance of having our daily walk in our spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="238" id="238">[238]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="VJs2_qQSmWRN5nwRMAwzi45snsx-2h5WHZfAUFc9qWR3k9ARa10q6C3SazdmHHl0y"> Often during the day, we may want to take a leave of absence from our spirit. Throughout the course of the day, we may leave our spirit many times and live in the flesh. For example, if your wife speaks to you in a certain way, you may immediately forsake your spirit and talk to her according to the flesh. Even if your attitude toward your wife is good, as long as you are absent from the spirit, you are in the flesh. We do not get into the spirit once for all. On the contrary, we need to exercise continually to be in the spirit in order to walk by the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="iIHmCvd9sgkOSusZIiEhvMwZ9T3s-J4zuIWsbFnSjjf0sUscYCF5zbaUImx-kg4jH"> When I was young, I did not appreciate the Lord’s word about watching and praying (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86897" data-verses="Matthew 26:41">Matt. 26:41</span>). But the more I practice to have my daily walk in my spirit, the more I recognize the need to watch and pray. We need to watch lest we be away from the spirit. We also need to pray in order to get back to the spirit and stay there. The Christian life is a life of abiding in our spirit. Since we are so easily drawn away from our spirit, we need to watch and pray. In Paul’s word to the Colossians, he says that we need to “persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86898" data-verses="Colossians 4:2">4:2</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86899" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">Ephesians 6:18</span> Paul also speaks of “praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance.” To repeat, we need to watch to see whether or not we are in the spirit and pray in order to be kept in the spirit. </p>

But here it says that we have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. The old man and “I” are our being; the flesh is the expression of our being in our practical living. The crucifixion of our old man and “I” is a fact accomplished by Christ on the cross, whereas the crucifixion of our flesh with its passions and lusts is our practical experience of that fact. For this practical experience, it is necessary that we through the Spirit execute the crucifixion which Christ has accomplished. In this way we carry out what He has accomplished.

<p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uTw-0DRCz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> Notice that in speaking of the crucifixion of the flesh, Paul uses the perfect tense. Paul says not that we are crucifying the flesh, nor that we shall crucify it, but that we have crucified it. He speaks of this as if it were an accomplished fact. Concerning the crucifixion, there are two aspects. The first is that when Christ was crucified, He crucified our old man and the “I.” The other aspect is that we have crucified our flesh. Based upon the fact that Christ has crucified the old man and the “I,” we have crucified the flesh. Hence, the second fact, our crucifixion of the flesh, is the application of the first fact, Christ’s crucifixion of the old man and the “I.” In our experience we need to apply Christ’s crucifixion to our flesh. Paul’s use of the perfect tense to describe this indicates that such should be the normal experience of the believers. All believers should be those who have applied Christ’s crucifixion to their flesh. As those who belong to Christ, who have been put into Christ, we have done this. Here Paul is speaking according to the principle. If we have never crucified our flesh, our experience is abnormal. If our experience is normal, then we who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh. </p>

The cross has nullified the “I” which is trying to keep the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86943" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span>) and the flesh which lusts against the Spirit, that Christ may replace the law, and the Spirit may replace the flesh.

To walk by the Spirit is to have our practical living and acts in our daily life guided and ruled by the Spirit, not by the law. Concerning our Christian walk, Paul’s concept is that since our life is not by the law of letters, but by the Spirit of life, so our walk also should be not by the law of ordinances, but by the Spirit of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0BpDaFkHtIhH2qZitqny5KzP4dR5wt6aFanb0dnnLD-DF8DEA-y-PlCDROzpEYzWE"> The Greek word rendered “we live” implies both to have life and to live. Initially we have life, but continually we live. If we have life by the Spirit, we should continue to live by the Spirit.

Some prefer to make <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86954" data-verses="Galatians 5:26">verse 26</span> the opening verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86955" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">chapter six</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86956" data-verses="Galatians 5:26">verse 26</span> Paul deals with vainglory, provoking, and envying. The reason Paul mentions these matters is that they test whether or not we are walking by the Spirit. Only when we walk by the Spirit can we overcome vainglory, provoking, and envying. In a sisters’ or a brothers’ house it is easy for there to be vainglory. Certain brothers or sisters may think that they should be the leading ones. This attitude gives rise to provoking and to envying. Perhaps a certain sister gives a rich and releasing testimony in a meeting. Out of envy, another sister may determine to give an even better testimony in the next meeting. </p>
<p data-content-id="xjqmn9R1X5blwipEnjasYmA0gAFHA4qU2NWwLyw0snQQ-qgOjt6rZiX-2SZwAnQMv"> Vainglory may be found even between a husband and wife. Because of the desire for vainglory, a brother may <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> become envious if his wife receives praise that he does not receive. </p>
<p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CXIoIIPjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> Vainglory, provoking, and envying are all of the flesh. We can check whether or not we are walking by the Spirit by asking whether we have any vainglory, provoking, or envying. This is a very practical way of testing our daily walk. By putting forth such a test, Paul showed how practical he was and how experienced. From his experience he knew what it meant to suffer from the same diseases that afflict us in our spiritual life today. </p>
<p data-content-id="dAK1QX3DACkGkV630vG0aHRzoNq3Y02rmCc8eQITY-KFTzu6Ham8ErljFItEgmczR"> For quite a long time, I was bothered by the inclusion of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86957" data-verses="Galatians 5:26">verse 26</span>. Eventually I came to realize that without this verse it is purely theoretical to talk about living by the Spirit. But when we test our living by the matters of vainglory, provoking, and envying, living by the Spirit becomes extremely practical. In relation to others, it is easy for us to be subject to vainglory, provoking, and envying. </p>
<p data-content-id="QX_dhXyrTEKgglFbpCHnW_b4sSjO_SmsScRzM7vcR1V4yTQVrfjL1P8cefckdiwb8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86958" data-verses="Romans 8:14">Romans 8:14</span> Paul says, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” Paul’s thought is somewhat different here from his thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86959" data-verses="Galatians 3:26">Galatians 3:26</span>, where he says, “You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.” Yes, through faith we have become sons of God. But now we need a walk which proves that we are God’s sons. In such a walk we are led by the Spirit. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86983" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">5:25</span> Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86984" data-verses="Galatians 6:1-10">6:1-10</span> Paul develops this matter of walking by the Spirit. In these verses he covers three things: how to restore one who has fallen, how to fulfill the law of Christ, and how to sow unto the Spirit. For all three, we need to turn to our spirit and walk by the Spirit. </p>

This is the only way to be genuinely spiritual. Those who are spiritual should restore one who has fallen in a spirit of meekness. This is our regenerated spirit, indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit. Such a spirit is the issue of living and walking by the Spirit. Notice that Paul speaks of a <em>spirit</em> of meekness. The meekness we need must be in our spirit. The source of what we do should be our spirit, not simply our kind heart. Therefore, this verse indicates that everything we do in our daily walk should be done in our spirit and from our spirit. </p>

HOW TO FULFILL THE LAW OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="PKq_1PV3eAb4MikYTBXhWJNXABX5GqBwb1Fvjrk6UsLnidkL0QTPNWxbRwhd0-kpK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86986" data-verses="Galatians 6:2">6:2</span> Paul continues, “Bear one another’s burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.” Some expositors say that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="256" id="256">[256]</span> law of Christ here refers to the Lord’s commandment that we love one another. According to them, the law of Christ is the law of love. This is correct. However, we must go on to see that the law of Christ is the higher and better law of life which works through love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86987" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86988" data-verses="John 13:34">John 13:34</span>). The law of love, which is the law of Christ, is the law of life. Love is the expression, but life is the substance. Real love is that which issues from the divine life. The love described by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86989" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">1 Corinthians 13</span> is the expression of the divine life. Furthermore, the fact that love is a fruit of the Spirit indicates that the substance of love must be the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="86990" data-verses="Galatians 5:22">Gal. 5:22</span>). In fact, all spiritual virtues must have the Spirit with the divine life as their substance. The law of Christ, which is the law of love, must be substantiated by the divine life. This is the reason we say that the law of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86991" data-verses="Galatians 6:2">6:2</span> denotes the law of life. Expressed by the law of love, the law of life will cause us to bear one another’s burdens. In this way we fulfill the law of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="jNHNoHhxt7cbszaVs2RjRHRPK_wBex3ISFPf8Kuf5Jq3AWG9Juh2vq7g1OiSkI5wf"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86992" data-verses="Galatians 6:3">verse 3</span> Paul says, “For if anyone thinks he is something, being nothing, he deceives himself.” Apparently there is no connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86993" data-verses="Galatians 6:3">verse 3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86994" data-verses="Galatians 6:2">verse 2</span>; actually there is a very real and significant connection. Those who think of themselves as something will not bear the burdens of others. Only those who do not regard themselves as anything will bear others’ burdens. Perhaps you would say that certain ones who consider themselves to be something seem to bear the burdens of others. However, this is merely an outward show, the exhibition of the self, not the genuine bearing of someone else’s burden. In the eyes of the Lord, such a person does not actually bear anyone’s burden. Instead, thinking himself to be somebody, he takes advantage of an opportunity to display himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="Tc7W4PPlRfP7IyYTOzL7serkYV7ul7DFEWMttoR7ZAF4gSuisrqcMjelyDWtvV_KY"> No doubt, Paul wrote these verses according to his experience. From experience he realized that it is when we consider ourselves as nothing that we spontaneously, even unconsciously, bear the burdens of others. We do not place a high estimate on what we do. We simply do it because we are walking in the Spirit and by the Spirit. Walking by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="257" id="257">[257]</span> Spirit, we are led of the Spirit to do certain things. The result is that we bear someone’s burden without even realizing it. Paul’s word is simple and brief, but it is full of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="nx8SwJqAHSCfDXHqBW34mrU-Tb2OENkVdfHur975RksbbmfglvanrtbLMme-cP2Wn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86995" data-verses="Galatians 6:6">6:6</span> Paul says, “But let him who is instructed in the word share with him who instructs in all good things.” The good things in this verse refer to things which are good for this life, the necessities of daily living. Even in the matter of sharing such things, we may fulfill the law of Christ, fulfilling the law of love according to the law of life. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86997" data-verses="Galatians 6:7">verse 7</span> he warns, “Do not be led astray, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he shall also reap.” The admonition not to be led astray was spoken in reference to the false teachings of the Judaizers. These teachings led the Galatians astray from the Spirit in their spirit to the law by their flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="suGsx2yrlu_xHF1tfjn8zJMptepgZ_FkeXicCvRkOc4iVF8ZQC36eleSovBwPlpZv"> The matter of sowing is quite mysterious. What is it that we sow, and for what purpose do we sow? Some may understand Paul’s word about sowing to refer to what he has previously spoken about bearing the burdens of others and about sharing the necessities of life with those who have need. According to this understanding, if one contributes to the daily need of a person serving the Lord in the Word, he is then sowing to the Spirit. I would agree that this is a proper application of Paul’s word about sowing. However, our understanding of sowing should not be limited to this matter. As we shall seek to point out, sowing covers the totality of our Christian life. </p>
<p data-content-id="wQgrOGxTAR-3cCZQG4vA7yp2nJDYJxy-1YMzeB2bGSRwqkuXSpsZRAhutjKQMg_WA"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86998" data-verses="Galatians 6:8">Verse 8</span> says, “Because he who sows unto his own flesh, shall reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.” To sow unto the flesh is to sow with a view to the flesh, or for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view, fulfilling what the flesh covets. To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires. To sow for the fulfilling of the purpose of the flesh <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> issues in corruption; to sow for the accomplishing of the aim of the Spirit issues in life, even eternal life. Corruption is of the flesh, indicating that the flesh is corrupted; eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="LweBTzPvwX_r0vQLmZs8i7zRPIOduyIC0CXtoxUzsH1VpY_s7C6CzRpIDMkjJ7gRf"> Everything we do is some kind of sowing, either to the flesh or to the Spirit. Wherever we may be and whatever we are doing, we are sowing seeds. You sow at work and also at school. The elders sow while they are caring for the church, and those who minister the Word sow as they minister. Husbands and wives are constantly sowing in their married life, and parents are sowing in their family life. Everything parents say to their children and do with them is a seed sown into them. Day by day we all are sowing. The Christian life is a life of sowing. Furthermore, the place where we live and work is our farm. You are sowing even by the way you dress or style your hair. Virtually everything you do is an act of sowing. It is crucial for us to realize that the Christian walk must be a walk by the Spirit and a life of sowing to the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="mwgtjC9XS1FGoCtF4PVerTKZjL05OLGZ7EjJw3iBylk8ausrMn3Rya4C_vDviKgZU"> Paul showed marvelous wisdom in his writing of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="86999" data-verses="Galatians 6:1-10">6:1-10</span>, covering a number of crucial points. As we have seen, he speaks of things such as restoring a fallen one in a spirit of meekness and of fulfilling the law of Christ by giving something to meet the need of another. Then he tells us not to be led astray, since God is not mocked. There is no need for us to go far off to be led astray. We may be led astray even in our thinking. But God is not mocked, and we cannot deceive Him. He knows what we are and what we are doing. Thus, Paul admonishes us to take care of our sowing. Instead of sowing to the flesh, we should sow to the Spirit, realizing that everything we say or do is part of our daily sowing. </p>

Through using large letters, Paul may have wanted to impress his readers with the importance of this Epistle. Second, the use of large letters may have been due to the weakness of Paul’s eyes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87014" data-verses="Galatians 4:13-15">4:13-15</span>). The weakness to which Paul refers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87015" data-verses="Galatians 4:13">4:13</span> may have been in his eyes. This would have caused him to write in large letters.

For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.” The Greek expression rendered “good show” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87018" data-verses="Galatians 6:12">verse 12</span> means a good countenance, hence a good appearance for making a <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> good show, a good display. It is used here in a negative sense. Circumcision, like the cross, is not a good show, but an abasement. However, the Judaizers made it a good show as a boast in the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="xjqmn9R1X5blwipEnjasYmAwoAFHI4qU2NWwLyw0snQQ-qgOjt6rZiX-2SZwAnQMv"> The expression “in the flesh” means outwardly in the sphere of the flesh, which is condemned and repudiated by God. Their circumcision was in man’s natural and external being, without the inward reality and spiritual value which are in our regenerated spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CTAoIIHjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87019" data-verses="Galatians 6:13">verse 13</span>, not even those who compelled the Galatians to be circumcised kept the law. They wanted the Galatians to be circumcised so that they could boast in their flesh. On the one hand, they wanted to make a display in their own flesh; on the other hand, they wanted to boast in the flesh of the Galatians. </p>

<p data-content-id="KygeQ8PlDLBH2nvmKS7N8lVmpn1P5lyzh2JU0Vr4XlZjGo7XUqfsMNWRRv7JIAeWe"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87020" data-verses="Galatians 6:14-16">verses 14 through 16</span> we have the boast of the Apostle Paul. “But far be it from me to boast,” Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87021" data-verses="Galatians 6:14">verse 14</span>, “except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.” The cross is truly an abasement, but Paul made it his boast. The world has been crucified to us, and we to the world. This has taken place not directly, but through Christ, the One who was crucified. The explanation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87022" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">verse 15</span> proves that the world here refers mainly to the religious world. The word “for” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87023" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">verse 15</span> indicates that this verse is an explanation of the foregoing verse. Furthermore, circumcision, being a religious matter, indicates that the world in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87024" data-verses="Galatians 6:14">verse 14</span> must be mainly the religious world. </p>
<p data-content-id="lf-ra6zpDBsmQzyyZJ16f_UVLs6T4rpUTX0gibWXBynit-bMMYmuy00n-xPKw7p05"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87025" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">verse 15</span> Paul says, “For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.” When this verse is considered along with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87026" data-verses="Galatians 6:11-14">verses 11 through 14</span>, we see that Paul’s concern here is mainly with the religious world, not the secular world. Those who were seeking to compel the Galatian believers to be circumcised were not trying to lure them into the secular world; they were wanting to bring them <span class="pg" data-page-id="265" id="265">[265]</span> into the religious world to make a display in the flesh and to avoid persecution. The various matters Paul covers in these verses are thus related to religion, not to the secular world. Therefore, we see clearly from the context that the world in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87027" data-verses="Galatians 6:14">verse 14</span> is the religious world. </p>
<p data-content-id="O5j0zA-qf0Mh3AhAARFQ7lmoPq4Klo1dbjbNSwkTTf9dBNb-Jl3CA_ksU2tziRdNZ"> On the one hand, the religious world was crucified to Paul; on the other hand, he was crucified to the religious world. Because of the cross of Christ, the religious world would not have anything to do with Paul, nor would Paul have anything to do with the religious world. The same is true of us today. </p>
<p data-content-id="4_qA8Hy-y0ewiG9-6MsH-MoD6MIh5UkArgTfy6n1bWzEZGnixsWeAeScztLyq67eK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87028" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">verse 15</span> Paul says that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, but a new creation. The old creation is our old man in Adam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87029" data-verses="Ephesians 4:22">Eph. 4:22</span>), our natural being by birth, without God’s life and the divine nature. The new creation is the new man in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87030" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">Eph. 4:24</span>), our being regenerated by the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87031" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>), having God’s life and the divine nature wrought into us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87032" data-verses="John 3:36">John 3:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87033" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>), with Christ as its constituent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87034" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">Col. 3:10-11</span>). It is this new creation that fulfills God’s eternal purpose by expressing God in His sonship. </p>

The former is of dead letters; the latter is of the living Spirit. Hence, it counts, it avails. This book exposes the inability both of the law and of circumcision. Law cannot impart life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87035" data-verses="Galatians 3:21">3:21</span>) to regenerate us, and circumcision cannot energize us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87036" data-verses="Galatians 5:6">5:6</span>) to live a new creation. But the Son of God who has been revealed in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87037" data-verses="Galatians 1:16">1:16</span>) can enliven us and make us a new creation, and Christ who lives in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87038" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span>) can afford us the riches of His life to live the new creation. Law is replaced by Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87039" data-verses="Galatians 2:19-20">2:19-20</span>), and circumcision is fulfilled by Christ’s crucifixion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87040" data-verses="Galatians 6:14">6:14</span>). Hence, neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation with Christ as its life. </p>
<p data-content-id="GCjRwqUUB2Y5qtNstg8IfK9xMTJ5horISgr2t5rmsQf7zPSmVcRtel0rF5TEnkGCT"> The new creation spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87041" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">6:15</span> is the old creation transformed by the divine life, by the processed Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> The old creation was old because God was not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it. We who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God are still God’s creation, but we are now His new creation. However, this is real only when we live and walk by the Spirit. Whenever we live and walk by the flesh, we are in the old creation, not in the new creation. Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="cRATS1-L3cm1MtNnkWc4VER_FTTuuCgQiyABPNg5nT87ViyZ-4pqbb-_dLxY-Hqe9"> God’s intention is that we become a new creation. This new creation is composed of sons. In a very practical sense, the corporate sonship is God’s new creation. Those in the old creation are sons of Adam in the fall. But through God’s redemption and regeneration and through the dispensation of Himself into us, we who once were sons of Adam have now become sons of God. Here in this divine sonship we are the new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYWqg9khVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN"> If we would be in the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God. Apart from such a union, we shall remain in the old creation. But now by the organic union with the Triune God we are in the new creation. Here in the new creation neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything or avails anything. </p>
<p data-content-id="ELgAnKoxymVCxEU085F09PAMLOFfwe79Kcjqa9KKz-o0iNiU7mWYl8DgLsSy_YySF"> Apparently Paul wrote the book of Galatians to deal with the law. Actually this book deals with the old creation. Although Paul tells us that we are justified by faith, the main point is not justification, but the new creation. When we were in the flesh, we were very much involved with the law and we were, of course, in the old creation. But when we are in the Spirit, we are not under the law and we are in the new creation. Thus, Paul’s concern in Galatians is not merely with the doctrine concerning the law and justification by faith; it is with the revelation that we are God’s new creation. Here we are no longer involved with law-keeping, circumcision, and religious practices. In the new creation only one thing is vital and crucial to us—the Triune God who has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit so that He may be our life, our nature, and our everything <span class="pg" data-page-id="267" id="267">[267]</span> through the organic union between us and Him. How wonderful it is that in this organic union we are a new creation! </p>

<p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZzxJoSOMB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> In the foregoing message we considered Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87059" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">6:15</span>: “For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.” The new creation is altogether different from any kind of religion. Religion is part of the old creation. All the practices of today’s religion are, therefore, of the old creation. Only that kind of living and walk which is by the Spirit is part of the new creation. In order to be the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God. Everything outside this union, whether religious or nonreligious, is part of the old creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="yPyDK8U8toP9ddq9fj88PGhryODXAupaPL4uypQZLsf1WGHSHcqrXPDiSJ3xpUhVH"> In this message we shall consider the brands of Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87060" data-verses="Galatians 6:17">6:17</span>) and the grace of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87061" data-verses="Galatians 6:18">v. 18</span>). It is rather strange that, at the end of this Epistle, Paul inserts a word about the brands of Jesus between the mention of peace and grace. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87062" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">verse 16</span> he says, “And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” But instead of following this immediately with a word about grace, Paul refers to bearing in his body the brands of Jesus. Then he says, “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87063" data-verses="Galatians 6:18">v. 18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="8QMBpb5u2uHUGqYhAKQo7aPsiYyiGuq03b-0CqpSXjxqjeY42vbmKdMawdZNSBkiv"> It is important to know the reason Paul inserted a word about the brands of Jesus between his mention of peace and grace. When we write a letter, we express the concept, feeling, or sense we have within us. Likewise, when Paul wrote to the Galatians, he was expressing the concept and feeling within him. As he was writing about peace and grace, he had the realization within him that he enjoyed peace because he was bearing the brands of Jesus. The brands of Jesus kept <span class="pg" data-page-id="272" id="272">[272]</span> him in a peaceful condition. Through the enjoyment of grace, Paul was brought into a peaceful state. He was maintained in this peace by bearing the brands of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="0BpDaFkHtIhH2qZitqny5KzLxdRc-t6aFanb0dnnLD-DF8DEA-y-PlCDROzpEYzWE"> In order to understand Paul’s concluding word, we need a certain amount of spiritual experience. As he was drawing this Epistle to a close, he greeted his readers with peace and grace. As he was extending this greeting to them, he spontaneously had the realization that he could enjoy peace because he was bearing the brands of Jesus. It seems as if Paul were saying, “Brothers, I am at peace. I am maintained in this peaceful condition because I am bearing the brands of Jesus. Let no one trouble me.” Not to trouble a person means not to disturb him, not to deprive him of peace. The word trouble in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87064" data-verses="Galatians 6:17">verse 17</span> stands in contrast to peace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87065" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">verse 16</span>. After saying that peace should be on all those who walk by this rule, Paul asked that no one trouble him, for he bore the brands of Jesus. This indicates that Paul’s peace was maintained by the brands of Jesus he was bearing in his body. Therefore, Paul could say, “Since I am bearing the brands of Jesus, I am at peace. Let no one bother me.” Paul knew that the Judaizers and the persecutors could not take away his peace. Not even the whole system of Satan could trouble him, for he was bearing the brands of Jesus. However, if he cast away these brands, refusing to bear them any longer, he would have immediately lost his peace. Then he could have been troubled by anything or anyone. But because he was enjoying peace through bearing the brands of Jesus, he could say, “Let no one trouble me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="7EjiJiKSogg44JUcqVx5SCLZpPk-9zVQuzRHXmWHEsrf9X58XGzqK5yeH8wP2vo49"> In principle, our situation is the same as Paul’s. Bearing the brands of Jesus will also keep us at peace. But if we refuse to bear these brands, we shall be troubled, and our peace will disappear. Then, having lost our peace, it will be difficult for us to continue in the enjoyment of grace. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mwgtjC9XS1FGoCtF4PVerTKdrL05GLGZ7EjJw3iBylk8ausrMn3Rya4C_vDviKgZU">I. THE BRANDS OF JESUS</h2><p data-content-id="ZPMSuZ9RJARG2mHH39cp1MOuj6hZr4rLeMkbyNUB6rt7BUGo_N35-ZgE1eohkDMv_"> The word brands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87066" data-verses="Galatians 6:17">verse 17</span> refers to the marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners. With Paul, a slave of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87067" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Rom. 1:1</span>), physically the brands were the scars of his wounds <span class="pg" data-page-id="273" id="273">[273]</span> received in his faithful service to his Master (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87068" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:23-27">2 Cor. 11:23-27</span>). Spiritually, they signify the characteristics of the life he lived, a life like that lived by the Lord Jesus when He was on this earth. Such a life is continually crucified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87069" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>), doing the will of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87070" data-verses="John 6:38">John 6:38</span>), seeking not its own glory but the glory of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87071" data-verses="John 7:18">John 7:18</span>), and submissive and obedient to God, even unto the death of the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87072" data-verses="Philippians 2:8">Phil. 2:8</span>). Paul followed the pattern of the Lord Jesus, bearing the brands, the characteristics of His life. In this he was absolutely different from the Judaizers. </p>
<p data-content-id="AOq37-r2IeHjeXA3qsTxaaAosAKFf1hYUFmQeMfeSSH0Z7MSjwYi0gvTHsz3tlylV"> Paul considered himself a slave of Christ. Just as a slave might bear a brand mark testifying that he belonged to a certain owner, Paul bore in his body the brands of Jesus. It was as if the name of Christ had been branded upon him again and again as a testimony and declaration that Paul belonged to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="FgR_87l1H0LrnccVVzJZOiL94bXs2rimHZBL91SeKVcHVN1MSKn1mYterXmbrgWIP"> Paul had been wounded many times because of his faithfulness in service to Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87073" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:24-25">2 Corinthians 11:24 and 25</span> he tells us that five times he received “forty stripes save one,” that three times he was beaten with rods, and that once he was stoned. Therefore, there were many scars on his body testifying of his years of service to Christ. These scars may also be considered the brands of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="CU-aCEAv94CWgyGmLnJX6EWSFljJkUGLo0AuX53zp3T1Hmvg_AjLyLvlpXa2-6nQD"> As we have already indicated, the spiritual significance of the expression “the brands of Jesus” is that Paul lived a crucified life. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He took the lead to live such a crucified life. As we read the four Gospels, we see the portrait of a Man constantly living a crucified life. This kind of life is a brand. Thus, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He bore such a brand. He was persecuted, ridiculed, despised, and rejected. However, He did not say anything to defend Himself. Instead, living a crucified life, He bore a brand to show that He belonged to God the Father. Paul followed the Lord Jesus to live this kind of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87074" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Philippians 3:10</span> he refers to “the fellowship of His sufferings.” As one who lived in the fellowship of Jesus’ sufferings, Paul bore the brands of Jesus as the sign that he lived a crucified life. When Paul was greeting the Galatians with a <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> word of peace, he was reminded of the fact that it was the brands of Jesus that kept him in this peace. Because he was persecuted, despised, ridiculed, rejected, and condemned, he could truly say that he bore the brands of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKq_1PV3eAb4MikYTBXhWJNTIBXYJqBwb1Fvjrk6UsLnidkL0QTPNWxbRwhd0-kpK"> Although we do not presume to classify ourselves with Paul, we can say truly that, at least to some extent, we also are bearing the brands of Jesus, for we are ridiculed, mocked, despised, criticized, and condemned. Many evil things are written about us and spoken concerning us. As long as we continue to take the way of the cross, we shall be opposed in this way. If we are faithful to live a crucified life, opposition will rise up again and again. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87075" data-verses="Galatians 4:29">Galatians 4:29</span> Paul said, “But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit, so also it is now.” This word indicates clearly that those who are according to the flesh will persecute those who are according to the Spirit. Just as the Lord Jesus and Paul were persecuted because they lived a crucified life, the same will happen to us if, by the Lord’s mercy and grace, we follow their footsteps to live such a life. When we are despised, rejected, condemned, ridiculed, and mocked, we bear the brands of Jesus. However, because we bear these brands, we enjoy peace, and we are not troubled by any situation or circumstances. </p>

To be born of the Spirit is a tremendous matter, for it means to be actually born of God. Because we have been created by God, we are God’s creatures, and because we are fallen, we are sinners. Nevertheless, we, creatures and sinners, have been born of God. How marvelous! </p>

Using the illustration of a dog receiving a human life, we see that the natural concept is merely that a dog can be cleansed and beautified. In principle, many Christians are occupied with cleansing people and beautifying them, instead of helping them receive the divine life and nature <span class="pg" data-page-id="280" id="280">[280]</span> through regeneration. God’s way is not merely to wash us, beautify us, and decorate us outwardly. His intention in His economy is to regenerate us, to cause us to be sons of God born of Him. This matter is unspeakably great. </p>
<p data-content-id="3r5xmJXvfOZ4GVY3aEYeHip7KqelcvZOvvuIuMxp3Acx6Fq7vGqRtFtOPFZ605KPg"> There is no doubt that God’s salvation includes cleansing by the redeeming blood of Christ. In a very real sense, we, the saved ones, have been cleansed by God. Being cleansed, however, is not the highlight of God’s salvation. The highlight is that God has regenerated us, that He has actually imparted His life and nature into us to make us His sons. Now we are not God’s sons-in-law—we are the sons of God in life. Certainly there is no greater wonder in the whole universe than that sinful men by being regenerated can become sons of God. Many today are seeking wonders and miracles. But they do not realize that there is no greater miracle than regeneration. By regeneration fallen people become sons of God. In His salvation God has made us, fallen sinners, His divine sons. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GCjRwqUUB2Y5qtNstg8IfK9xOTJ1jorISgr2t5rmsQf7zPSmVcRtel0rF5TEnkGCT">THE MEANING OF REGENERATION</h2><p data-content-id="cRATS1-L3cm1MtNnkWc4VER_HTTisCgQiyABPNg5nT87ViyZ-4pqbb-_dLxY-Hqe9"> Among fundamental Christians today, there is little talk about God as the generating Spirit. When I was regenerated more than fifty years ago, I realized that regeneration was wonderful, and I tried to find a book that could give me an adequate definition of regeneration. Eventually I purchased a book entitled <em>The Genuine Definition of Regeneration,</em> expecting that this book would give me the definition I wanted. But much to my disappointment, that book said nothing about God as the Spirit coming into us to regenerate us. Rather, it merely said that regeneration means that we have a new beginning and that all the old things have passed away. But after years of experience and of studying the Bible and the writings of others, we have come to see that to be regenerated is simply to be born of God. In regeneration, God as the life-giving Spirit comes into our spirit to regenerate us with His life and nature. This is the reason the Lord Jesus said, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87098" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>). That which is born of <span class="pg" data-page-id="281" id="281">[281]</span> the Spirit of God is our regenerated spirit. At the time of our regeneration, God’s Spirit came into our deadened spirit to enliven it with the divine life and nature and thereby to make us sons of God. What a marvelous fact it is that we are sons of God! We have the assurance that we are truly God’s sons because in our spirit we can sweetly cry, “Abba, Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87099" data-verses="Romans 8:15">Rom. 8:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87100" data-verses="Galatians 4:6">Gal. 4:6</span>). </p>

My burden is on the Spirit. Only by being the Spirit is God able to regenerate us. If you ask people who God is, some will say that He is the Creator. Others may say that He is also our Redeemer and Savior. Not many will say that God is the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="DEb9lLplhJh_b-ToTExfg9uAaDfuZqBAmO_hOEwnHQvhFVJvBhvWxecGMMAdTQUXF"> As the Spirit, God is not simple, for the Spirit is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sg88U9K0yJlgyYkOTTYYeg-_iE8ilC0LNRDbxGhs9u9M3IxMpYooF2YKtp-9frUCd"> Christians commonly take spiritual matters for granted. Some talk about Christ’s incarnation and human living with little realization of the significance of these things. The One who was born in a manger in Bethlehem and who was raised in a carpenter’s home in Nazareth was the very God Himself in human form. Imagine that the almighty God, the Creator, became a man and was restricted to the home of a carpenter and even worked for years as a carpenter! Jesus was called Emmanuel, God with us. This means that when Jesus lived on earth, God lived on earth. Furthermore, in His living He was patient and hidden. He did not make a display of Himself. For years, He was limited there in Nazareth. When He came forth to carry out His ministry, He did not do so on a large scale, but on a small scale and even in a lowly way. People wondered about Him, asking who He was, for they knew His mother, brothers, and sisters. They knew Him merely as Jesus of Nazareth. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESaEgWz6cLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS"> When some Christians say that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, they consider that as the Son of God He is different from God. They do not realize that the Son of God is God <span class="pg" data-page-id="282" id="282">[282]</span> Himself. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87101" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> does not say, “In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was the Son of God.” Rather this verse tells us that the Word in the beginning was God. This Word became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87102" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>). For the Word to become flesh means that God Himself became flesh. It was God in the flesh who worked on earth, who washed the feet of the disciples, who was arrested in the garden, who was tried before the high priest and before Pilate and Herod, and who was sentenced to death and crucified. Yes, the One who was crucified was the very God. Some may ask: Is it possible for God to be crucified? The answer is that God was crucified in the humanity of Jesus. Recognizing this, Charles Wesley says in one of his hymns, “Amazing love! How can it be that Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?” (<em>Hymns,</em> #296). The second stanza of the same hymn opens with the line: “’Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!” The One who died for us was not only Jesus of Nazareth, but God, the very One who created us. Yet, as God was dying on the cross, He cried out to God, saying, “My God, My God...” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87103" data-verses="Matthew 27:46">Matt. 27:46</span>). Those with a doctrinal mentality may be at a loss to explain this. How can God say to God, “Why have You forsaken Me?” The answer is that God was dying on the cross in the form of a man. Therefore, as a man He could cry, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” After His crucifixion, He was buried. Then, on the third day, He was resurrected. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87104" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">First Corinthians 15:45</span> says that as the last Adam He became a life-giving Spirit. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87105" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span> Paul goes on to say, “Now the Lord is the Spirit” (Gk.). </p>
<p data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrPbeI5NWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-"> God today is the Spirit including the elements of incarnation, humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection. The effectiveness of Christ’s wonderful death, the power of His resurrection, and the reality of His resurrection life are all in the Spirit. This Spirit is no longer merely the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ. </p>

God’s desire to work Himself into our being is the focal point of the divine revelation in the Scriptures. Because this matter is so mysterious, it is hidden in the Scriptures, although it is not altogether hidden. On the one hand, it is indeed a mystery; on the other hand, it is a mystery that has been revealed in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESaFgWW4cLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS"> Throughout the centuries, Christians have not seen this matter clearly. Most readers of the Bible have paid their attention to many things other than this crucial and mysterious point in the divine revelation. We admit that it is not easy to see this crucial point in the Bible. Just as a person’s physical life is mysterious and hidden within him, so it is with the matter of God’s intention to work Himself into His chosen people. It is hidden in the Word. Life is the most vital element in a person’s being. But who can analyze it or adequately explain it? With the Bible, as with a human being, there are many things that are outward and easily identified. But there is also a hidden element, which we may call the life factor in the Scriptures. We may say that this life factor is Christ or the Spirit. However, the life <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span> factor in the Bible is actually God’s intention to work Himself into us. This is the kernel of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrPaeIYOWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-"> Many theologians and Bible teachers have not seen the kernel of the Bible. In their writings they speak of many other things, but they do not mention this basic life factor. They have not pointed out definitely and particularly that according to the divine revelation in the Bible, God’s intention is to work Himself into us. This is the reason that in the Lord’s recovery we have given message after message on this point. Even after hundreds of messages have been given on the subject of God’s intention, I still do not have the confidence that all the saints have an adequate understanding of it or that they have all truly seen it. I can testify that the vision of God’s eternal intention has never been more clear to me than it is now. Throughout the years, this vision has become crystal clear. God’s intention truly is to work Himself into us. </p>

These gifts are actually God Himself. God is the Spirit, and God is also the Word. The Gospel of John is a book which clearly reveals God, the Spirit, and the Word. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87125" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87126" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, the Word, God Himself, became flesh. Eventually, this incarnate Word was crucified, and after His resurrection He, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87127" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). The Gospel of John also links the Word to the Spirit. “It is the Spirit Who gives life,” the Lord Jesus said in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87128" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>, and, “the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.” God is life, the Spirit is life, and the Word is life. According to the Gospel of John, these three are one. God is the Word, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God. </p>
<p data-content-id="2a2q7x6_ya-MrF4vWREnskCrmQyqmLNKn4UAmFZ6n1uV18kympe4IfkgeG_OZh2ep"> If you consider church history, you will see that throughout the centuries two great tragedies have taken place, one related to the Word and the other related to the Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="289" id="289">[289]</span> God’s intention is that the Bible be used to impart Himself as life into His chosen people. But many Christian teachers have neglected this proper use of the Bible and have taken the Bible only as a book of knowledge, not as a book of life for the divine impartation. Different opinions and interpretations of the Bible have led to controversy and debate. Many of these debates have been centered on Christology, the theological study of Christ’s Person. In their argument about the Person of Christ, some of the great teachers, including certain church fathers, neglected the living Person of Christ. They paid more attention to Christology than to Christ Himself. God’s intention is that the Bible should be the tree of life, but in their use of the Bible, certain teachers turned it into the tree of knowledge. First they brought themselves into death, and then they spread death in the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="uc7kzXp0thJHgKfcmJ22Wl068-H7VCa-RsBkJeSW3J8W-fJ2HPsWWLCVwvllAti1T"> Today there is still controversy among Christians about many matters in the Bible. Take baptism as an example. Who can count how many divisions have been caused by differing opinions about baptism? There has been argument about the kind of water used, about the way people are put into the water, and about the name in which people are baptized. What a tragedy that the Word has been used in such a way as to become a factor of division! It has been used to divide Christians into thousands of groups. However, the Bible itself is not to blame for this. The blame rests with those who pay attention to knowledge, but neglect the living Person. </p>
<p data-content-id="foiLIlvcS80gCzQLJEjLx1z5AlA7seKfvi_9m0_XuzDf4uNd_MonuQ67A3GsUpFID"> The second tragedy to occur in the history of the church concerns the Spirit. Concerning the Bible and its interpretation, there has been division, whereas concerning the Spirit there has been confusion. Because of this confusion, many fundamental Christians do not even want to hear about the Spirit. Some are actually frightened by any mention of the Spirit, regarding the Spirit as something too mysterious to talk about. What a tragedy is this neglect of the Spirit! <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> </p>

If to us God is only on the throne in heaven as the object of our worship, how can He be our life and how can He be wrought into our being? It would not even be possible for us to be born of Him if He were only in heaven. </p>

Birth involves an intimate, organic relationship. Because we are born of our parents, we have an intimate, organic relationship with them. Because we have been born of God, God in a very real sense has been born into us. This is what makes us sons of God. If we were not born of God, how could we be sons of God? According to the Bible, we are not God’s sons-in-law nor merely His adopted sons. As those born of God, we are sons of God in life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87130" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span> the Lord Jesus declared, “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” Once again we say, we have been born of the Spirit to receive the Spirit. </p>

But I do not have the assurance that we are clear about how to receive the Spirit. The word receive is used in many places in the New Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87131" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87132" data-verses="John 20:22">20:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87133" data-verses="Romans 8:15">Rom. 8:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87134" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17">Eph. 6:17</span>). In Galatians Paul speaks definitely about receiving the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87135" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">3:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87136" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">14</span>). The Spirit we have received and whom we continue to receive is the processed Triune God. Some may object to this statement and may claim that the Spirit refers only to the Holy Spirit, the third of the Godhead, not to the Triune God. But according to the New Testament, especially Paul’s Epistles, the Spirit we are receiving is the processed Triune God. </p>

To receive the sonship means that we are born of God and thereby receive the divine life and nature. As sons of God, we have God’s life and nature. Regeneration by which we are born of God to become His sons is accomplished by God Himself as the life-giving Spirit. There is no doubt that the Lord Jesus came to be our Savior and to die on the cross as our Redeemer. But the goal of God’s salvation and redemption is to bring us into sonship. Not only have we been saved and redeemed; we are even one spirit with the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87155" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>) and, as a result, we have the divine life and nature. We are not simply one with God in a general way. We are actually one spirit with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="VJs2_qQSmWRN5nwRMAwzi45oksxj4h5WHZfAUFc9qWR3k9ARa10q6C3SazdmHHl0y"> We who believe in the Lord Jesus should not have a low view of ourselves. We are not merely natural, physical, and material—we are now one spirit with God! If such a word were not written in the Scriptures, I would find it extremely difficult to believe that the very ones who were originally only God’s creatures and who then fell to become sinners, have now become one spirit with God through regeneration. Can you testify with assurance that you truly believe that you are one spirit with God? Do you see this experientially as well as doctrinally? We all need to humble ourselves before the Lord and pray, “Lord, show us the vision that we are one spirit with You. I am not satisfied, Lord, with a mere doctrinal knowledge of this. Lord, open the heavens and cause me to see that I am now one spirit with You.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="298" id="298">[298]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="iIHmCvd9sgkOSusZIiEhvMwd-T31xJ4zuIWsbFnSjjf0sUscYCF5zbaUImx-kg4jH"> On the one hand, the Lord is in heaven; on the other hand, He is with our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87156" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>). Although the Lord has come into our spirit and dwells in our spirit, much of the time we ourselves are not in the spirit. On many occasions we leave the Lord in our spirit and go off to spend time in the chambers of our mind or emotion. Perhaps we want to do a certain thing which does not make the Lord happy. At such times, our attitude toward the Lord may be that He should stay in our spirit and not come to trouble us as we live for a while in our mind or emotion. Certain sisters, for example, may want a leave of absence from the Lord for a few hours in order to indulge themselves in their desire to go shopping. However, the Lord is never willing to give us such a leave of absence, no matter how we may try to bargain with Him about it. </p>
<p data-content-id="1d2f_9YogZuGF0F3RaAqS-37eBiO25hkqULOa_lPpNjzrwTnOsnp1GD0BnfWBbdhG"> At the time we were saved and regenerated, our spirit was joined to the Lord, and we became one with Him. Now, no matter what we do, we cannot separate ourselves from being one with Him in spirit. Even if we would seek to break this union, the Lord would not agree. </p>
<p data-content-id="9EjNkeFQzuB7lPrvBx2r4mQ5HSexj3MjL5KX4WKv8J4ijozWWaX1GBnucISX6mYPk"> Sometimes the younger saints may say that they need to practice the Lord’s presence and not go to certain places or do certain things lest they lose His presence. They may think that the Lord will be with them if they go to the church meetings, but not if they go to a movie. According to their concept, they will lose the Lord’s presence if they go to a movie. Doctrinally this sounds quite good, but actually it is not true in our experience. If you were to attend a movie, the Lord’s presence is apt to be more obvious to you than when you are in a meeting. You may think that by going to the theater you will be able to run away from the Lord and be free. But, contrary to your expectation, you may discover that while you are there, the Lord manifests His presence to you more than ever. The more you beg Him to give you the liberty to do what you want, the more prevailing His presence becomes. Many of us can testify of having had this kind of experience. <span class="pg" data-page-id="299" id="299">[299]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESaCgWzycLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS"> To be saved is a serious matter, for it is to be brought into oneness with the Lord. When a person is saved and regenerated, he enters into an organic union with the Triune God. This union is real and vital. As a result of salvation and redemption, the Lord dispenses Himself into our spirit and makes us one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrPdeI5FWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-"> Christians from a Pentecostal background often inquire of others if they have received the Spirit. We should never be troubled by such a question. As long as a person has been saved and regenerated, he has not only received the Holy Spirit, but he has even become one spirit with the Lord. Therefore, we have the ground to testify boldly that, as saved and regenerated ones, we are now one spirit with the Triune God. This is the divine revelation in the holy Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="5euwGBFk7L_E9dzcXZ8PUzyrb3r0hMSqW8T1Z9BMt24AQwhyvAVjySQuKVWJUZej3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87157" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">3:2</span> Paul asks the Galatian believers, “Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87158" data-verses="Galatians 3:5">3:5</span> he inquires, “He therefore Who is supplying to you the Spirit and doing works of power among you, is it by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?” Paul’s questions indicate that the Galatians had received the Spirit and that God was continuing to supply the Spirit to them. God was supplying, and they were receiving. A marvelous, divine transmission was taking place. </p>
<p data-content-id="N78TKjbEXVwSfszdd30oED0xtvQxQQ--ofRmWsRF1_iiqC8arZJbwvJC5VunnOdmn"> If we would receive the Spirit continually, we need to exercise our spirit to pray. In our prayer we should not be occupied with trivial matters. Instead, we should open ourselves to the heavenly transmission and receive the supply of the Spirit. The Christian life is not a religious life or an ethical life, but it is a life of being one spirit with God. Whenever we exercise our spirit to call on the Lord, we experience the divine transmission, the flow of the heavenly current. Therefore, the Christian life is a life of supplying and receiving. God continually supplies, and we continually receive of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAAv0xIHj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1"> Many of today’s Christians neglect the crucial matter of receiving the Spirit. Instead, they concentrate on helping people to be religious and ethical. For this reason, there is the urgent need for the Lord to have a recovery. The Lord’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> recovery is utterly different from religion. Concerning Christ, life, the Spirit, and the church, the Lord’s recovery stands one with the Bible, but it stands apart from religion and tradition. Surely both we and the Lord Himself need the recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="hwMadJIZ14zUSl3gCcShY89hdJQzOmfydHXU1tIkWKzKdKgtXF3CB5KwOuJngqEmP"> The Spirit we have received of God is the total blessing of the gospel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87159" data-verses="Galatians 3:13-14">3:13 and 14</span> Paul says that Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law so that “the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” In the gospel we have received not only the blessing of forgiveness, washing, and cleansing; we have received the blessing of the Triune God as the processed, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. This living, all-inclusive Person is the blessing. Day by day, God is supplying this blessing to us, and we are receiving this blessing of God. Oh, how blessed we are! What a marvelous blessing we are enjoying! This unique blessing is the all-inclusive Person of the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—processed to become the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us in a most subjective way for our enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="U0hKzeGUKiJ9Ln5z4YNTcfeZcbLVVWosB97DAfeztAm8eOk3lOS0ACBjVbUPD323A"> A well-known hymn tells us to count our blessings one by one. In a very real sense, we do not have that many blessings to count. We have one bountiful blessing—the Spirit. At the end of the year, some may take time to count all the material blessings they have received that year. But we may simply praise the Lord for the unique blessing of the immeasurable, bountiful, all-inclusive Triune God processed to be the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us. </p>

It is not God’s intention to keep His people under the law. His intention is to dispense Christ into them. Thus, Christ as the center of God’s economy must replace the law. Because the Judaizers were misusing the law, the Epistle to the Galatians was written to reveal Christ as the replacement of the law. Yes, the law was given for a specific purpose, but God did not intend for the law to be permanent. Christ has come to replace the law with Himself. This is the focal point of Galatians. </p>
<p data-content-id="LweBTzPvwX_r0vQLmZs8i7zVDIOEjyIC0CXtoxUzsH1VpY_s7C6CzRpIDMkjJ7gRf"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87171" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">chapter one</span> Paul shows that God is pleased to reveal His Son, Jesus Christ, in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87172" data-verses="Galatians 1:15-16">1:15-16</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87173" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">chapter two</span> we see that we should live this Christ, not the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87174" data-verses="Galatians 2:19-21">2:19-21</span>). God does not want us to be occupied with keeping the law and be distracted from living Christ. According to the pleasure of His heart, He has revealed His Son in us that we may live Him. The crucial points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87175" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">chapters one and two</span> are that the Son of God has been revealed into us and that we should live Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mwgtjC9XS1FGoCtF4PVerTKdvL0cMLGZ7EjJw3iBylk8ausrMn3Rya4C_vDviKgZU">THE CONTRAST BETWEEN FLESH AND SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="ZPMSuZ9RJARG2mHH39cp1MOun6h4g4rLeMkbyNUB6rt7BUGo_N35-ZgE1eohkDMv_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87176" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapters three and four</span> Paul shows us how to experience this Christ and enjoy Him. The One revealed as the center of God’s economy is Christ. But in our experience this One is the Spirit. This is the reason that, beginning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87177" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapter three</span>, Paul speaks of the Spirit again and again. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87178" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">3:2</span> he asks the Galatians if they received the Spirit by the works of <span class="pg" data-page-id="308" id="308">[308]</span> law or by the hearing of faith. Then, in a somewhat rebuking tone, he goes on to ask in the next verse, “Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?” Here we see the contrast between the Spirit and the flesh. This is somewhat different from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87179" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span>, where the contrast is between Christ and “I.” The Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87180" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapter three</span> is the very realization of the Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87181" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">chapter two</span>, and the flesh is the experiential aspect of the “I.” Doctrinally we may say that our problem is with the “I,” the self, but in experience our problem is with the flesh, which is the totality of our fallen being. It may be easy for us to testify in the church meetings that we are nothing but flesh. But in our daily life it is not so easy to admit that we are flesh. In the sight of God, fallen man is nothing but flesh. Beginning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87182" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapter three</span> and continuing into <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87183" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">chapter six</span>, Paul contrasts the Spirit with the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="kWWIR_PfYdTAivJZe4CjaMmtzeJRIXYMQN8Lfl4WOobFn7DmNjazJgeo2POKKCOfK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87184" data-verses="Galatians 4:29">Galatians 4:29</span> says, “But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit, so also it is now.” In this verse we see two categories of people: those born according to flesh and those born according to Spirit. As saved ones, we are in both categories. On the one hand, we are children born according to flesh; on the other hand, we are also children born according to Spirit. Within us we have two elements, two natures—the Spirit and the flesh. These two elements make us two kinds of children. </p>
<p data-content-id="JXqZnZhBWTHYr5N7Yht-3oFhutZntjmP3ypdcLgaJCkerNiqlRD_Yss6rPYP8xAja"> The contrast between the Spirit and the flesh continues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87185" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">chapter five</span> with the contrast between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87186" data-verses="Galatians 5:19-23">5:19-23</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87187" data-verses="Galatians 5:17">5:17</span> we are told, “The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.” The Spirit and the flesh can never work together or go along with each other. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zoSuUTRAjb71fws33A2Ij_qCjAhP4DZHkvk4LihK5YZEcnjH-Rw-Qvjra-Rp4-Cu9">TWO KINDS OF SOWING</h2><p data-content-id="aary53Wx3h7_PLJIcdmPvYGeL_gir3BQkZf5Js31NuzMk7UHLOZ9EuU39xv2VI18i"> Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87188" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">chapter six</span>, we have the contrast between two different kinds of sowing: the sowing unto the flesh and the sowing unto the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87189" data-verses="Galatians 6:7-8">6:7-8</span>). On the one hand, we may sow unto the flesh to accomplish the purpose of the flesh. On the other hand, we may sow unto the Spirit with the Spirit as <span class="pg" data-page-id="309" id="309">[309]</span> our goal. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87190" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapter three</span>, the Spirit is mainly for us to have the divine life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87191" data-verses="Galatians 4:1">chapter four</span>, the Spirit is for us to be born of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87192" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">chapter five</span>, the Spirit is for us to live and walk. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87193" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">chapter six</span>, the Spirit is for our aim, our goal. In the first two chapters of Galatians we have the revelation of Christ as the focal point of God’s economy, but in the last four chapters we have the Spirit in our experience. We have somewhat covered the aspects of the Spirit for life, birth, and walk. In this message we need to consider the Spirit as our aim. This has much to do with sowing unto the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uT0z0DRGz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87194" data-verses="Galatians 6:8">6:8</span> Paul says, “He who sows unto his own flesh, shall reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.” It is very important to understand what Paul means by sowing. Because of his human experience and what he had learned and because of the revelation he received from God, Paul had a thorough understanding of human life. His use of the word sow in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87195" data-verses="Galatians 6:8">6:8</span> points to the true meaning of human life. According to Paul’s view, human life is a process of sowing. Day by day, we are sowing. We sow by what we say and do and by what we are. </p>
<p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZzxNoSfDB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> To sow is to put forth something that will grow and eventually be reaped. In our daily living we are constantly putting forth things that will grow and bring forth a harvest. Even a word uttered by us contains seeds that will land in a particular soil, grow, and produce a harvest which we shall reap. We should not think that our words and actions are without result or issue. On the contrary, all that we say and do involves the sowing of seeds. </p>
<p data-content-id="yPyDK8U8toP9ddq9fj88PGhr2ODKMupaPL4uypQZLsf1WGHSHcqrXPDiSJ3xpUhVH"> Do you realize that you are sowing all day long? You sow when you are happy and when you are sad, when you are calm and when you are angry, when you are praising the Lord and when you are complaining. Whenever you gossip or criticize someone, you are sowing. When you sing you sow, and when you scold your children you also sow. The human life is a life of sowing, a life of putting forth things that grow and produce a harvest. </p>
<p data-content-id="8QMBpb5u2uHUGqYhAKQo7aPsmYy7Luq03b-0CqpSXjxqjeY42vbmKdMawdZNSBkiv"> People sow whether they realize it or not and whether they intend to sow or not. You may have no intention for a <span class="pg" data-page-id="310" id="310">[310]</span> certain negative thing to grow and produce a disastrous harvest. But as long as you sow, a harvest will result. Unsaved people do not realize that their life of sowing will eventually cause them to reap death and the lake of fire. No matter what your intention may be, as long as you sow, you will reap, and you will reap what you sow. We should not be surprised that we reap a certain thing, for that kind of reaping comes from that particular kind of sowing. A person should not be surprised if he sows soybeans and then reaps soybeans instead of corn. As long as he sows soybeans, he should not expect to reap corn or any crop other than soybeans. We need to be impressed with the serious fact that what we sow will return to us. </p>

<p data-content-id="p1lTdeqpfiM5O4JJibZTHmVsmx84FU3Ocr4jsEOQAzOWGr2bvXZul_bdpDy_0-9KZ"> Because the Galatian believers were missing the mark of God’s economy, Paul wrote them this Epistle in the attempt to unveil God’s economy and to bring them back to Christ. They had been distracted from the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ to the keeping of the law and the practice of circumcision. Paul wanted them to turn back from the law and circumcision to the real blessing of God’s gospel—the blessing of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This is the underlying thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87200" data-verses="Galatians 6:7-16">6:7-16</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vGJw21xvx_4iyiGpDEqnpkGj8X3eVqUVmjkRTasq1cTT8ENWrMNtao5xjcOTyhFf0">SOWING UNTO THE FLESH</h2><p data-content-id="WA9v3u5-3Lwi17H2ixIskGrEISqynrXkuEq15-Op_KCV9NmwKiBW9UQjWZtKTZiSu"> Paul’s concept was that those who were trying to keep the law and were practicing circumcision were sowing unto the flesh. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87201" data-verses="Galatians 6:8">6:8</span> Paul says that the one who “sows unto his own flesh, shall reap corruption of the flesh.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87202" data-verses="Galatians 6:12-13">verses 12 and 13</span> he goes on to say, “As many as desire to make a good show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.” Paul’s use of the word flesh in these verses affords us a key to understanding what it means to sow unto the flesh. According to the underlying thought in this portion of Galatians, to sow unto the flesh is to practice circumcision and to endeavor to keep the law. Circumcision and law-keeping are both outward things. Paul strongly pointed out that the Judaizers boasted of circumcision in the flesh. They compelled others to be circumcised so that they <span class="pg" data-page-id="316" id="316">[316]</span> could boast in their flesh. Paul even says that they desired to “make a good show in the flesh.” It was almost as if the Judaizers were saying, “Look at us—we have been circumcised. We have a sign in our flesh to show that we are circumcised people.” In Paul’s words, this is to make a good show in the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="2a2q7x6_ya-MrF4vWREnskCrjQyPuLNKn4UAmFZ6n1uV18kympe4IfkgeG_OZh2ep"> By seeking to make such a display in the flesh, the Judaizers were sowing unto their flesh, and the result was sure to be corruption. The Greek term for corruption does not mainly denote rottenness; on the contrary, the primary significance of this term is destruction. Those who were sowing unto the flesh by practicing circumcision were an offense to God, and God came in to destroy their religious system. Not too long after the Epistle to the Galatians was written, God sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy the city of Jerusalem with the temple and all that pertained to it. It was a most serious matter for the Judaizers not to give up law-keeping and circumcision. </p>
<p data-content-id="uc7kzXp0thJHgKfcmJ22Wl065-HacCa-RsBkJeSW3J8W-fJ2HPsWWLCVwvllAti1T"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87203" data-verses="Galatians 6:7">6:7</span> Paul declares, “Do not be led astray, God is not mocked.” God is the Creator, the Administrator, and the One operating all things in the universe. He is not mocked by those who stand against His economy. When He decided to put aside the law and circumcision, who had the right to stand against Him? What right did the Judaizers have to continue the practice of circumcision when God Himself had abolished it? By maintaining this practice in order to make a fair show in the flesh, the Judaizers were rebelling against God’s governmental administration. Such rebellion, a real sowing unto the flesh, was bound to issue in corruption, in destruction. </p>

God’s economy is to give us Himself as the Spirit. We should take the Spirit as our aim, our goal, and not be so foolish as to aim at the law or circumcision. God’s goal is to become the all-inclusive Spirit in us for our enjoyment. What reason could we have for not aiming at such a marvelous goal? <span class="pg" data-page-id="317" id="317">[317]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="1d2f_9YogZuGF0F3RaAqS-37cBir-5hkqULOa_lPpNjzrwTnOsnp1GD0BnfWBbdhG"> When we see God’s goal in His economy, we can realize how foolish the Judaizers were. We can also understand why God would send the Roman army to destroy the system of Judaism. It is a matter of utmost seriousness to insist on law-keeping and circumcision when God has made a change in His economy. Such insistence is offensive to God and is rebellion against Him and His economy. Nothing is more pleasing to God than to take the all-inclusive Spirit as our goal and to sow unto the Spirit. If we sow unto the Spirit, we shall reap eternal life. </p>

In the New Jerusalem there will be neither the law nor circumcision. Instead, there will be the river of water of life flowing with the tree of life. This is life eternal. The New Jerusalem, the ultimate embodiment of eternal life, will be the consummate issue of our sowing unto the Spirit. </p>

Circumcision is a shadow, but the cross is the reality. Whereas the Judaizers boasted in the shadow, Paul boasted in the cross through which the entire religious world—Judaism, the law, ordinances, and circumcision—was crucified to Paul. Furthermore, Paul could boast in the cross by which he had been crucified to the religious world. </p>

What matters to Him is a new creation. Through the cross of Christ the new creation was brought in. This new creation is the rule by which the believers should now walk (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87205" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">v. 16</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="6dR3l0TKVK5BVc1WfrOnHw6-wct9X9O55ZdMpdNdldLArsZ1aOoLZ1aATo3wP97vY"> As we have already pointed out elsewhere, the world in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87206" data-verses="Galatians 6:14">verse 14</span> is primarily the religious world, as indicated by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87207" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">verse 15</span>. Paul could say, “Judaism has been crucified to me, and I have been crucified to Judaism. On the cross of Christ, the law, circumcision, and all the Judaistic observances have been crucified. At one time, Judaism was my world. But through the cross of Christ this world has been crucified to me, and I have been crucified to it.” By the cross Paul was separated from Judaism. Therefore, he could declare that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision was anything. The only thing that avails is a new creation. </p>

The result of sowing unto the Spirit is a new creation. Hence, we should sow unto the Spirit for the new creation. However, if we care for law-keeping and circumcision, we shall sow unto the flesh. Circumcision does not change the old creation, for it cannot change our nature. Circumcision cannot regenerate us, give us the divine life, or transform us. After a person is circumcised, he remains the old creation. But when we aim at the Spirit and sow unto the Spirit, the Spirit makes us a new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="wQgrOGxTAR-3cCZQG4vA7ypyoJDUPxy-1YMzeB2bGSRwqkuXSpsZRAhutjKQMg_WA"> We have seen that the phrase “unto the Spirit” means to aim at the Spirit and to take the Spirit as the goal of our living. Therefore, to sow unto the Spirit means that our life, living, and walk all must aim at the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="LweBTzPvwX_r0vQLmZs8i7zVAIORoyIC0CXtoxUzsH1VpY_s7C6CzRpIDMkjJ7gRf"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87209" data-verses="Galatians 6:8">6:8</span> Paul charges us to sow unto the Spirit. Sowing involves all that we say and do and all that we are in our daily life. We should not think that after we say or do a particular thing there will be no consequences. No, whatever we say or do is an act of sowing that will eventually produce a harvest and be reaped by us. We Christians are sowing all the time, and we shall reap what we sow. Instead of sowing unto the flesh, we should sow unto the Spirit, with a view to the Spirit. This means that we should take the Spirit as the goal of our sowing. The Judaizers were absolutely for Judaism. They focused <span class="pg" data-page-id="319" id="319">[319]</span> their attention on the law, circumcision, and dietary regulations. Their aim in life was to carry out the law, circumcision, the ordinances, the regulations, and the keeping of the Sabbath. Their goal was Judaism and nothing but Judaism. The Judaizers were exceedingly ambitious to keep the law, to practice circumcision, and to fulfill all the regulations and ordinances of their religion. They were absolutely for Judaism, even at the cost of their lives. </p>

Amen.” At the beginning of this Epistle, Paul said, “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87220" data-verses="Galatians 1:3">1:3</span>). But at the end Paul speaks first of peace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87221" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">6:16</span>) and then of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="aary53Wx3h7_PLJIcdmPvYGeJ_g7i3BQkZf5Js31NuzMk7UHLOZ9EuU39xv2VI18i"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87222" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">6:16</span> Paul says, “And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” According to this verse, peace is upon those who “walk by this rule.” The rule here is that of sowing unto the Spirit to live the new creation. If we walk by this rule, peace will be upon us. The Israel of God consists of those who walk by this rule. In other words, all who live the new creation by sowing unto the Spirit are the true Israel of God, and peace is upon them. Paul’s use of the preposition “upon” implies that peace rains upon us. Peace rains upon the real Israel of God, upon those who walk by the rule of living a new creation by sowing unto the Spirit. God is bestowing peace upon His real Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uT0x0D0Iz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87223" data-verses="Galatians 6:17">6:17</span> Paul goes on to say, “For the rest let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus.” Here Paul seems to be saying, “I am enjoying peace. As far as anything else is concerned, do not trouble me. I have just one goal, and that is to walk by this rule. Because I’m a part of the true Israel of God, peace is bestowed upon me. I am under <span class="pg" data-page-id="324" id="324">[324]</span> the rain of peace. Do not speak to me about the law, circumcision, or the priesthood. For the rest, do not trouble me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZzxPoS-MB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> Why at the beginning of Galatians does Paul mention grace before peace and at the ending speak of peace before grace? Grace is God as our enjoyment, and peace is a condition which results from grace. Therefore, at the beginning we first have grace, then peace. But once we enter by grace into a condition of peace both with God vertically and with others horizontally, we need grace to keep us in such a peaceful situation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0BpDaFkHtIhH2qZitqny5KzL3dR50t6aFanb0dnnLD-DF8DEA-y-PlCDROzpEYzWE">GRACE WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="7EjiJiKSogg44JUcqVx5SCLZvPkf2zVQuzRHXmWHEsrf9X58XGzqK5yeH8wP2vo49"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87224" data-verses="Galatians 6:18">6:18</span>, the grace we enjoy is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Furthermore, Paul points out that this grace is with our spirit. In the book of Galatians Paul refers to the human spirit only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87225" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">chapter six</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87226" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">6:1</span> he says, “Brothers, if ever a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness.” The spirit here is the regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit. The fact that Paul mentions the human spirit both at the beginning and at the ending of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87227" data-verses="Galatians 6:1">chapter six</span> indicates that this chapter deals mainly with our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="_Fv0JBBWQcCEA6UxPCM9K1DpXARbKRb8K6GGkuofFK8ArsuS12Lmc3gY7CCOW-tTq"> If we do not know our human spirit, which has been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, we have no way to enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit. We may use the practical application of electricity as an illustration of this. Although electricity has been installed in your home, you still need to use the switch to turn it on. If you do not know where the switch is, you will have no way to experience the benefit of electricity. The heavenly “electricity” has been installed in us, and our human spirit is the “switch” by which we may apply it. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ—the heavenly “electricity”—is with our spirit, the “switch.” </p>
<p data-content-id="BgIbIp-MeDbB3RxdRZnnJtwnLlgrYdAdTbG5ey5q42AyqhNIGlvz2jYlJOf2dgoh7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87228" data-verses="Galatians 6:18">6:18</span> Paul does not say that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with our mind, emotion, or will. He clearly and definitely tells us that this grace is with our spirit. Do you know the location of your spirit, mind, emotion, and will and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="325" id="325">[325]</span> difference between them? We know that we have all these faculties, but it is difficult to define them or to locate them. From our experience we have discovered these different aspects of our being. When we are happy or angry, we are exercising the emotion. When we make a decision, we use our will. When we think, we obviously use our mind. When a husband and wife are arguing, they may express their heated emotion, use their mind to present their case, and exercise their will to make decisions concerning the situation. But as they are arguing, something deep within may tell them to settle down and be quiet. This is not the mind, the emotion, or the will. It is the spirit, the leading part of which is the conscience. Whenever the conscience works, the spirit is functioning. In other words, your spirit works primarily through your conscience. The point here is that we have a faculty within us in addition to the mind, emotion, and will, and this faculty is the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="xjqmn9R1X5blwipEnjasYmAwvAFHM4qU2NWwLyw0snQQ-qgOjt6rZiX-2SZwAnQMv"> According to the Bible, the function of the spirit is to contact God. When we heard the gospel, we repented of our sins. Repentance involves the exercise of our conscience. When the light of the truth was allowed to shine through our mind into our conscience, our conscience caused us to repent. Therefore, repentance involves the exercise of the leading part of our spirit. Although we probably did not realize it at the time, when we were saved, we exercised our spirit. In addition to repenting, we prayed to the Lord and called on Him. We may have said, “O Lord Jesus, You are my Redeemer. I thank You for dying on the cross for my sins. Lord, I love You, and I take You as my Savior.” When we prayed in this way, exercising faith in the Lord, the Spirit of God came into our spirit and regenerated it. At the time we were saved, our spirit was exercised to repent and to receive the Lord. From that time onward, the Spirit has been dwelling in our spirit. Hence, the spirit is the place within us where we contact God, for it is here that the processed Triune God dwells as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CTHoIIDjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> Often when we begin to pray, we are in our mind or emotion. But gradually we pray ourselves into the spirit. Then we have the sense that we are meeting the Lord and that we <span class="pg" data-page-id="326" id="326">[326]</span> and He are one. No words can describe how good it is to be one spirit with the Lord. How enjoyable this is! This enjoyment brings in the assurance that the Triune God is real. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dAK1QX3DACkGkV630vG0aHR3nNq7e02rmCc8eQITY-KFTzu6Ham8ErljFItEgmczR">THE SPIRIT OF GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="QX_dhXyrTEKgglFbpCHnW_b8jSjC5SmsScRzM7vcR1V4yTQVrfjL1P8cefckdiwb8"> In order to understand what Paul means by grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87229" data-verses="Galatians 6:18">6:18</span>, we need to turn to the Gospel of John. In this Gospel we read that the Word which was in the beginning with God, and which was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87230" data-verses="John 1:1">1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87231" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87232" data-verses="John 1:16">John 1:16</span>, “Of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.” Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87233" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> tells us, “The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.” The fact that the law was given and that grace came indicates that grace is a person. Grace was not given; it came with Jesus Christ. The grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87234" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> is the very Spirit mentioned elsewhere in the Gospel of John. When Christ came, something wonderful, called grace, came with Him. Actually, this grace is a wonderful Person, Christ Jesus Himself. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87235" data-verses="John 1:16">John 1:16</span>, of Christ’s fullness we have received grace upon grace. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87236" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87237" data-verses="John 20:22">20:22</span> we see that we actually received the Spirit, the holy breath. Putting these verses together, we see that the grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87238" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> is the very Spirit, the holy breath, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87239" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87240" data-verses="John 20:1">20</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87241" data-verses="Hebrews 10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span> the Spirit is even called the Spirit of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="KygeQ8PlDLBH2nvmKS7N8lVmun1P1lyzh2JU0Vr4XlZjGo7XUqfsMNWRRv7JIAeWe"> To say that the Spirit is the Spirit of grace does not mean that the Spirit is one thing and grace is another, just as the expression “the Spirit of life” does not mean that the Spirit and life are two different things. Rather, just as the Spirit and life are one, so the Spirit and grace are one. In the same way, to speak of the light of God does not mean that light is something apart from God Himself. It means that God is the very light. In the same principle, when the Bible speaks of the Spirit of grace, it means the Spirit as grace. </p>

<p data-content-id="BgIbIp-MeDbB3RxdRZnnJtwnElg6RdAdTbG5ey5q42AyqhNIGlvz2jYlJOf2dgoh7"> In this message we shall begin to consider the matter of two kinds of walk by the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87257" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> Paul says, “But I say, walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87258" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">Galatians 5:25</span> says, “If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.” As we shall see, in these two verses Paul uses two different Greek words for walk. </p>

I did not know the difference between living and walking. It seemed to me that walking included living. Eventually I came to see that to live by the Spirit involves first to have life and then to live. To be born is a once-for-all matter, but to have life and to live is not once for all. On the contrary, it is a lifelong matter, for we are constantly receiving life in order to live. For example, to stay alive we must breathe moment by moment. It is not sufficient to breathe only at the moment we are born. In like manner, we need to receive life moment by moment in order to live. To live by the Spirit is, therefore, to have life and then to live. Once we have life and live, we are able to walk, to have our being in a particular way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dAK1QX3DACkGkV630vG0aHR3oNqeS02rmCc8eQITY-KFTzu6Ham8ErljFItEgmczR">WALKING ABOUT AND WALKING IN LINE</h2><p data-content-id="QX_dhXyrTEKgglFbpCHnW_b8sSjj0SmsScRzM7vcR1V4yTQVrfjL1P8cefckdiwb8"> As we consider the two kinds of walk by the Spirit, we shall refer to the walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87260" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> as the first kind and to that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87261" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">5:25</span> as the second. The Greek word for walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87262" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">verse 16</span>, <span class="pg" data-page-id="332" id="332">[332]</span> <em>peripateo,</em> means to have our being, to deport ourselves, to order our manner of life, to walk about. It is used with respect to ordinary daily life. It denotes a common, habitual daily walk. This understanding of walking by the Spirit is confirmed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87263" data-verses="Galatians 5:22-23">verses 22 and 23</span>, where Paul speaks of the fruit of the Spirit. The various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in these verses are not unusual things; they are aspects of our ordinary daily life. Therefore, the walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87264" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">verse 16</span> is our habitual and common daily walk. </p>
<p data-content-id="RWVsQ_5NusVXYDHGxpbs0M_VeUWROPEcjaGDW74RHmUjtOizB-mcAbBc3CjOpxqzi"> The Greek word for walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87265" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">verse 25</span>, <em>stoicheo,</em> has a very different meaning. It is derived from a root which means to arrange in a line. This may be illustrated by the movement of traffic in designated lanes on a highway. Thus, the Greek word for walk here means to walk in line. It also means to march in military rank. Walking in this way, like soldiers marching in rank, requires that we keep in step. </p>
<p data-content-id="suGsx2yrlu_xHF1tfjn8zJMtsepgd_FkeXicCvRkOc4iVF8ZQC36eleSovBwPlpZv"> As we compare these two kinds of walk, we see that the second is more regulated than the first. In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about. However, both kinds of walk, the common, ordinary walk and the walking in line or in rank, are by the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="wQgrOGxTAR-3cCZQG4vA7ypymJDYNxy-1YMzeB2bGSRwqkuXSpsZRAhutjKQMg_WA"> The same Greek word used for walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87266" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">5:25</span> is also used elsewhere in the New Testament. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87267" data-verses="Romans 4:12">Romans 4:12</span> Paul speaks of those “who walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.” Here the walk is not the ordinary walk, but the walk that is regulated, a walk in a definite line. In this case, the walk is in the steps of the “faith of our father Abraham.” Hence, the walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87268" data-verses="Romans 4:12">Romans 4:12</span> is not a common, ordinary walk; it is a definite, particular walk, the walk in the steps of Abraham’s faith. Paul’s concept was that Abraham’s faith was a lane in which we should walk and follow Abraham’s steps. </p>
<p data-content-id="LweBTzPvwX_r0vQLmZs8i7zVOIOdqyIC0CXtoxUzsH1VpY_s7C6CzRpIDMkjJ7gRf"> Elsewhere in the book of Romans Paul used the Greek word for the first kind of walk. This word is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87269" data-verses="Romans 6:4">Romans 6:4</span>, where Paul says that “we also should walk in newness of life.” It is also found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87270" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Romans 8:4</span>, where Paul speaks of walking not according to flesh, but according to spirit. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="333" id="333">[333]</span> walk in these verses is the common, ordinary walk of believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="mwgtjC9XS1FGoCtF4PVerTKdiL05CLGZ7EjJw3iBylk8ausrMn3Rya4C_vDviKgZU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87271" data-verses="Philippians 3:16">Philippians 3:16</span> Paul also speaks of the second kind of walk: “Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.” Here Paul uses the Greek word <em>stoicheo</em> to denote an orderly walk in line or military rank. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87272" data-verses="Philippians 3:17-18">Philippians 3:17 and 18</span> he uses the Greek word for the first kind of walk to refer to the common, ordinary walk: “Be imitators together of me, brothers, and observe attentively those who thus walk as you have us for an example. For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ.” Paul’s use of two different Greek words for walk indicates clearly that there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit in the New Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZPMSuZ9RJARG2mHH39cp1MOuq6hZv4rLeMkbyNUB6rt7BUGo_N35-ZgE1eohkDMv_">THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="AOq37-r2IeHjeXA3qsTxaaAolAKFb1hYUFmQeMfeSSH0Z7MSjwYi0gvTHsz3tlylV"> In order to understand more adequately the two kinds of walk by the Spirit, we need to see that the book of Galatians is a book that is very much concerned with the Spirit. The simple expression “the Spirit” is profound. This term is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87273" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>: “But this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” This verse says that before Jesus was glorified, “the Spirit was not yet.” For years I had difficulty understanding this. I wondered how it could be possible for the Spirit to be “not yet.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87274" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</span>, the Spirit of God was in existence, brooding over the water. Furthermore, in the Old Testament we are told many times that the Spirit of the Lord, or of Jehovah, came upon certain people. Moreover, when the Lord Jesus was about to be conceived in the womb of Mary, we are told that the Holy Spirit would come upon her (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87275" data-verses="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</span>). All these clearly indicate that the Spirit of God was in existence before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87276" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>. In order to solve the problem raised by this verse, the translators of the King James Version added the word “given” in italics after the words “not yet.” To their understanding, the writer of this <span class="pg" data-page-id="334" id="334">[334]</span> verse was saying that the Spirit was not yet given. Nevertheless, the fact remains that, according to the way the Bible was actually written, not according to the way it is altered in translation, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87277" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> says that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified. </p>
<p data-content-id="FgR_87l1H0LrnccVVzJZOiL9xbXsyrimHZBL91SeKVcHVN1MSKn1mYterXmbrgWIP"> In his Epistles Paul uses the expression “the Spirit” a number of times, especially in the book of Galatians. In fact, in Galatians Paul does not even once speak of the Holy Spirit, although he frequently refers to “the Spirit.” There is a great difference between the use of the term “the Holy Spirit” and the term “the Spirit.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87278" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</span> the Spirit of God is mentioned in relation to creation. Later the Spirit of the Lord, or of Jehovah, is used concerning the fellowship between God and His people. The term Holy Spirit is not used until the New Testament. (In the places where this expression is used in the Old Testament in the King James Version, the Hebrew should be rendered “Spirit of His holiness.”) The Holy Spirit is spoken of with respect to the conception of the Lord Jesus in the womb of Mary, because God’s intention was to bring forth One who is holy. Thus, the Holy Spirit was about to produce something holy out of humanity. The expression “the Spirit” is used for the Spirit of God only after the resurrection of Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="3r5xmJXvfOZ4GVY3aEYeHip7Bqe0XvZOvvuIuMxp3Acx6Fq7vGqRtFtOPFZ605KPg"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The first kind of walk refers to our ordinary daily living. The second kind of walk is a walk within a lane or in rank. In this message we shall consider in more detail the second walk, the walk in the divine rules and steps by the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="GCjRwqUUB2Y5qtNstg8IfK9xFTJororISgr2t5rmsQf7zPSmVcRtel0rF5TEnkGCT"> Actually everyone has two kinds of walk in his human life. The first kind of walk is general, a walking about. This includes all the ordinary things in our daily living. The second kind of walk is a walk with a specific purpose and toward a definite goal. For example, each day a young person must take care of the affairs of ordinary life. This is the first kind of walk. However, he must also go to school and study with a view toward graduation. This is the second kind of walk, the walk toward a goal. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cRATS1-L3cm1MtNnkWc4VER_MTT7lCgQiyABPNg5nT87ViyZ-4pqbb-_dLxY-Hqe9">TWO KINDS OF WALK</h2><p data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYWjg9NpVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN"> According to the Bible, every believer in Christ should have two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The first walk is our daily walk; the second is the walk in the divine rules and steps. As Christians, we are not those walking about on earth without a purpose. We have been created by God and also re-created and regenerated by Him with a definite purpose. Therefore, we must have the second kind of walk, a walk to fulfill God’s purpose and to reach the goal of our life on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="ELgAnKoxymVCxEU085F09PAMCOFy5e79Kcjqa9KKz-o0iNiU7mWYl8DgLsSy_YySF"> The first kind of walk is needed as a support for the second kind. For example, no student can do well in school if his ordinary daily walk is not proper. If he walks in a way that is <span class="pg" data-page-id="344" id="344">[344]</span> foolish or nonsensical, he will not be able to graduate. In such a case he would not have the first walk as a support for the second walk toward the goal of graduation. The second walk, which is related to carrying out our purpose in life, must be sustained by the first walk. Every human being needs to have two kinds of walk. In the first, he lives and walks about; in the second, he accomplishes his purpose on earth. To fulfill our purpose on earth, we need the second walk. But to carry out the second walk, we need the first walk. Thus, the first walk supports the second, and the second is the walk toward the goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="KygeQ8PlDLBH2nvmKS7N8lVmgn1P9lyzh2JU0Vr4XlZjGo7XUqfsMNWRRv7JIAeWe"> In the first kind of walk by the Spirit, we live, have our being, and walk about by the Spirit. This walk is a support to the second walk, a walk with a direction toward a goal. As children of God, we are not those without purpose. Our lives on earth have a definite purpose. We do not walk about aimlessly. God has an eternal purpose, and His intention is that His people should live for His purpose. Both God’s creation of us and His regeneration are for the carrying out of His purpose. Because God is purposeful and seeks to reach His goal, He charges us to have two kinds of walk by the Spirit: the walk which builds up a proper daily living and a walk in line with the divine rules and principles to reach the goal established by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="lf-ra6zpDBsmQzyyZJ16f_UVCs6T8rpUTX0gibWXBynit-bMMYmuy00n-xPKw7p05"> Among today’s Christians, both kinds of walk have been damaged. In the first place, many Christians do not live a proper Christian life. They do not have a life of prayer, they do not read the Bible regularly, and they do not contact the Lord consistently. Instead of walking by the Spirit, they walk by their ethics or morality. They may not steal or lie; however, even though they are good, honest, and faithful, they do not walk by the Spirit. Rather, they walk by their own standards. This means that in actual practice they walk by the flesh and the self. They may succeed in refraining from evil, but they do not care for the Spirit. They care for their taste, choice, preference, and desire. </p>
<p data-content-id="O5j0zA-qf0Mh3AhAARFQ7lmoGq4Kho1dbjbNSwkTTf9dBNb-Jl3CA_ksU2tziRdNZ"> In order for us to have a proper living as children of God, we need to have the first kind of walk by the Spirit. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="345" id="345">[345]</span> means that we should not walk by anything in place of the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4_qA8Hy-y0ewiG9-6MsH-MoDzMIh9UkArgTfy6n1bWzEZGnixsWeAeScztLyq67eK">CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="oU2lAEAfF60Z32GAq6eomfHFrPeI_1Hvg7_2rk0Sn_tuTwbA7nRurGY_QO909OTcO"> If we would have the first kind of walk by the Spirit, we need to pray and call on the name of the Lord. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87304" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:17">1 Thessalonians 5:17</span> Paul commands us to pray without ceasing. I have found that it is impossible to pray unceasingly if we try to pray in a formal way, asking the Lord for help. We may carry on this kind of prayer for a long time, but we cannot do it unceasingly. However, we can pray without ceasing by simply calling, “Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.” Although I am an elderly person and have been in the Lord for many years, I am still learning to call on the Lord’s name continually. From experience I have discovered that it is very easy to forget this. Upon waking in the morning, I may begin to call on the Lord’s name. But a few minutes later, I may be distracted by some thought and stop my calling. Suddenly, I realize where I am, and I once again begin to call, “O Lord Jesus.” </p>
<p data-content-id="3r5xmJXvfOZ4GVY3aEYeHip7BqelYvZOvvuIuMxp3Acx6Fq7vGqRtFtOPFZ605KPg"> Prayer is spiritual breathing. As we all know, we must breathe in order to stay alive. Wherever we may be, we can breathe spiritually by calling on the Lord’s name. All day long, no matter what we are doing, we can contact the Lord by breathing His name. As we are going through our early morning routine, we can call on the Lord Jesus. We may find that as we are taking care of practical matters, we have thirty minutes to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. If we practice, we shall build up the habit of calling on the name of the Lord. This is part of the first walk, the walk in which we have a proper daily living by the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="GCjRwqUUB2Y5qtNstg8IfK9xFTJ1norISgr2t5rmsQf7zPSmVcRtel0rF5TEnkGCT"> If we do not have the first walk by the Spirit, we are not qualified to have the second. Because many Christians do not have a proper daily life by the Spirit, they are not equipped to have the walk for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. In order to have this second kind of walk, we must practice living one spirit with the Lord. We should not be loose, careless, or lazy. We must have a proper daily life by walking in oneness with the Lord. We should pray, read the <span class="pg" data-page-id="346" id="346">[346]</span> Word, contact the Lord, and conduct ourselves properly in our relations with others. We all need to have this first kind of walk by the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cRATS1-L3cm1MtNnkWc4VER_MTTioCgQiyABPNg5nT87ViyZ-4pqbb-_dLxY-Hqe9">WALKING TOWARD THE GOAL</h2><p data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYWjg9orVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN"> A good number of Christians have a proper daily walk, but they do not have the second walk. It seems that the goal of their Christian life is simply to be nice, good, and proper. If you ask them what the goal of their Christian life is, they may tell you that their goal is to be a good Christian in order to glorify God and to go to heaven one day and to see the Lord without any sense of shame. If you had asked me many years ago what the goal of my Christian life was, I would have said that my goal was to be a good Christian and to behave properly for the glory of God. Now I realize that according to the Bible God has a specific purpose, and He has set before us a definite goal that He wants us to reach. In addition to His purpose and goal, He also has provided a way. We may liken this way to a highway which leads to a specific destination. God’s way is the line, the rule, the principle, by which we must walk to reach the goal. Praise our God that He is purposeful! He has a purpose to fulfill and a goal to reach. He also has set up a road which leads us to this goal. This road is the rule, principle, line, by which we must walk. To be sure, this walk is not the first kind of walk by the Spirit; it is the second kind of walk, the walk in line to reach God’s goal. </p>

<p data-content-id="N78TKjbEXVwSfszdd30oED0tpvQgZQ--ofRmWsRF1_iiqC8arZJbwvJC5VunnOdmn"> Colossians and Galatians are two books in the New Testament which reveal that Christ is life and everything to us. Colossians deals with culture, and Galatians, with the law given through Moses and the religion formed according to this law. Both the culture devised by man and the law given by God have been used by Satan to frustrate God’s chosen people from experiencing Christ and enjoying Him. God’s intention is to dispense Himself as the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, into our being so that He and we may be organically one. If we are organically one with the Triune God, He will be our life, and we shall be His living. Thus, God’s ultimate intention in the universe is to dispense Himself into His people that they may have one life and one living with Him. Because Satan utilizes culture and the law to frustrate us from experiencing the Spirit as the ultimate realization of the Triune God, the books of Colossians and Galatians are very important. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87327" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">chapter one</span> we see that the Son of God is versus the very religion formed and established according to the law given by God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87328" data-verses="Galatians 1:16">1:16</span> Paul indicates that the Son of God has been revealed in us. The Son of God is not merely an object of our belief apart from us; He is the One who has been revealed to us subjectively and has become one with us. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="354" id="354">[354]</span> dear Son of God who has been revealed in us and who is now one with us is versus religion with all its traditions. God’s intention is that religion and tradition must go and that only the Son of God remain. </p>
<p data-content-id="U0hKzeGUKiJ9Ln5z4YNTcfeFYbLwZWosB97DAfeztAm8eOk3lOS0ACBjVbUPD323A"> However, today’s Judaism and Christianity are filled with religion and tradition. Not much of the Son of God can be seen either in Catholicism or in the denominations. We are still surrounded by religion and tradition. I do not have the confidence that religion with all its traditions has been fully removed from us in the Lord’s recovery. Do not think that because you have been in the church life for a period of time you have no religion or tradition, but only Christ, the Son of God. I do not have the assurance that only Christ is in us and that we are free from all religion and tradition. </p>
<p data-content-id="MW1PrIO1NZkL7m7Ua0gn0XKRGLZ84yxZO7paon9rt0Llao3pVSvH-BXWTu0cTco71"> When Peter, James, and John witnessed the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on the mountain, Peter made the foolish suggestion that they build three tabernacles, one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. Suddenly a voice from heaven declared, “This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight; hear Him!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87329" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">Matt. 17:5</span>). When the disciples lifted up their eyes, “They saw no one except Jesus Himself alone” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87330" data-verses="Matthew 17:8">v. 8</span>). Their experience on the mount of transfiguration illustrates what Paul is saying in the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87331" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">first chapter</span> of Galatians. Just as Moses and Elijah had to give way to Christ, the beloved Son of God, so religion and tradition must be set aside, and only the Son of God should remain. </p>
<p data-content-id="CU-aCEAv94CWgyGmLnJX6EWOEljJgUGLo0AuX53zp3T1Hmvg_AjLyLvlpXa2-6nQD"> Because religion is in our very marrow, it is extremely difficult to get rid of it. We may be under the influence of tradition when we pray. For example, we may feel that the best way to pray is to kneel down, not to sit in a chair. But how can we say what is the best position to take in prayer? The feeling that kneeling to pray is better than sitting may come from tradition. It is common among Moslems to prostrate themselves during set times of prayer. In a visit to Jerusalem I observed Moslems in a mosque praying in this way. Within me I had the sense that they were not truly worshipping God. Instead of worshipping Him in reality, they performed their ritual in a religious, traditional manner. Although the Lord Jesus and <span class="pg" data-page-id="355" id="355">[355]</span> Paul the apostle knelt to pray, the Lord did not command us to kneel down to pray or to prostrate ourselves before God the Father when we worship Him. The Lord gave no such commandment. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87332" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> He said that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit. This word was spoken to a Samaritan woman beside a well. The Lord Jesus ministered living water to this woman, and she drank of this living water. According to the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87333" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span>, to drink the living water is to worship God the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKq_1PV3eAb4MikYTBXhWJNPJBXYNqBwb1Fvjrk6UsLnidkL0QTPNWxbRwhd0-kpK"> While the Lord Jesus was talking with the Samaritan woman, the priests in Jerusalem were worshipping God in the temple. Where was the true worship taking place—in the temple or beside the well? To answer this question properly we need to realize that the One who spoke to the Samaritan woman beside the well was actually God Himself. God was there with the Samaritan woman, not in the temple in Jerusalem. The worship carried on by the priests in the prescribed, orderly way was vain. If you had been there, would you have been worshipping God with the priests in the temple or with the Samaritan woman by the well? If we are honest, we must admit that we probably would have been with the priests worshipping according to tradition. </p>

In a very subtle way tradition continues to undermine our experience of Christ and enjoyment of Him. We need to see from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87334" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">Galatians 1</span> that tradition must be set aside and that only the Son of God should be revealed in us. This revealed Son of God is versus religion with all its tradition. </p>

Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87336" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span> we see that Christ, God’s anointed One, replaces the law. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87337" data-verses="Galatians 2:19">verse 19</span> Paul says that through the law he died to the law that he might live to God.

But when he turns to our experience in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87350" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">chapter three</span> and in the chapters following, he emphasizes the Spirit. The Spirit we have received is the totality of the blessing of the gospel promised by God to Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87351" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">3:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="2a2q7x6_ya-MrF4vWREnskC3lQyqiLNKn4UAmFZ6n1uV18kympe4IfkgeG_OZh2ep"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87352" data-verses="Galatians 4:6">4:6</span> we see that we have not only received the Spirit, but that the Spirit of God’s Son has entered into us. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87353" data-verses="Galatians 4:29">4:29</span>, we are those born according to the Spirit. The Spirit has come into us, and we have been born of Him. As sons of God, we have His life and nature. The life and nature of God are not poured into us like water into a bottle. No, we receive the Father’s life and nature through a process of conception and birth. We all have been born of God through the Spirit. Now that we have received God’s life and nature, in a very real sense we are divine. How could a child not have the life and nature of his father? Likewise, how could the children of God not have God’s life and nature? However, to say that we have received the divine life and nature does not mean that we shall ever be deified or worshipped as God Himself. To say that we are deified to become an object of worship is blasphemy. But it by no means is blasphemy to testify that we have the divine life and nature because we have been born of God, and as a result we are divine. We are children of God with the Spirit dwelling in our being in a very subjective way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="357" id="357">[357]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="Tc7W4PPlRfP7IyYTOzL7ser8QV7_u7DFEWMttoR7ZAF4gSuisrqcMjelyDWtvV_KY"> In the book of Galatians God’s two economies, His Old Testament economy and His New Testament economy, are dealt with in a full way. Concerning each of these economies, the Bible uses a particular word. The word for God’s economy in the Old Testament is law, and the word for His economy in the New Testament is Christ. Which do you prefer, law or Christ? In contrast to the Jews, who love the law, we who believe in Christ would all say that we prefer Christ to the law. Yes, on the one hand, we do love Christ, but, on the other hand, we may still embrace the law. In actual experience, we may embrace the law more than we embrace Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nx8SwJqAHSCfDXHqBW34mrUmbb2TMNkVdfHur975RksbbmfglvanrtbLMme-cP2Wn">A HIDDEN LOVE FOR THE LAW</h2><p data-content-id="6dR3l0TKVK5BVc1WfrOnHw6i3ctka9O55ZdMpdNdldLArsZ1aOoLZ1aATo3wP97vY"> Most Christians who love the Lord and have a heart to seek Him have a hidden love for the law. When some hear such a word, they may argue and say, “We don’t want the law. We love Christ and want only Him.” This may be the situation on the surface, but deep within, subconsciously, most Christians still love the law. Although they may not realize it, there is some kind of law hidden within them, like a cancer growing on a person’s vital inward organs. Such a person may appear healthy on the surface, but he has a serious disease within him. Only when surgery is performed does the extent of this disease become known. We may be good Christians who love the Lord and seek Him; however, we may not be conscious of the fact that we still keep the law hidden within us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="362" id="362">[362]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="RWVsQ_5NusVXYDHGxpbs0M_JXUW0EPEcjaGDW74RHmUjtOizB-mcAbBc3CjOpxqzi"> Not many Christians have their daily walk according to Christ. Can you say that you have been walking according to Christ today? During times of prayer we may have our living and our being according to Christ. But after we pray we may have our living and our being according to something other than Christ. Whenever we do not live according to Christ, we live according to law. This is my reason for saying that although we love Christ, we still hold to the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="suGsx2yrlu_xHF1tfjn8zJMxlepBW_FkeXicCvRkOc4iVF8ZQC36eleSovBwPlpZv"> Our situation can be compared to that of Abraham, who loved Sarah, his wife, but who also became involved with Hagar, a concubine, who signifies the law. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87376" data-verses="Galatians 4:24-25">4:24 and 25</span> Paul identifies Hagar with Mount Sinai, the place where the law was given. In typology Hagar, the maidservant, signifies the law. In a very real sense, Hagar, the law, is within us, and we love her. This law may not be the law of Moses. Instead, it may be some type of self-made law. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y0LGwy28qZ9mnOF6XgDpmlYKrg9ojVc1iflC1a98YbIGoOUxZHiCLht4tjd0CJOpN"> As seeking Christians, we may walk day by day according to the law hidden within us, not according to Christ. Suppose, for example, that a sister is subject to many irritations, but she does not become angry and lose her temper. Her behavior is very good. However, we need to ask why she does not lose her temper. Is it because she is living according to Christ, or because she is walking according to certain rules and regulations? Let us suppose, as another example, that whenever a certain brother is tempted to tell a lie, he exercises himself to speak the truth. But why does he tell the truth instead of a lie? Does he speak the truth according to Christ or according to some kind of rule or regulation? In other words, in the matter of telling the truth, does he live according to Christ or according to the law? It is very possible in matters such as this to live not according to Christ, but according to the law. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ELgAnKoxymVCxEU085F09PAQKOFTye79Kcjqa9KKz-o0iNiU7mWYl8DgLsSy_YySF">FOUR KINDS OF LAWS</h2><p data-content-id="DEb9lLplhJh_b-ToTExfg9ucZDfudqBAmO_hOEwnHQvhFVJvBhvWxecGMMAdTQUXF"> From my experience I have learned that it is easy for Christians to live according to various kinds of laws instead of according to Christ. We may live by ethical teachings we have assimilated from our culture, or according to biblical <span class="pg" data-page-id="363" id="363">[363]</span> principles learned from studying the Scriptures. Moreover, we may live according to the laws we ourselves have made. How easy it is for us to make laws for ourselves! Although we make laws easily, it is difficult for us to change them. In addition to living by ethical teachings, principles, and our self-made laws, we may also live according to what may be called “the law of the inner life.” When we live by this law, we may try without Christ to deal with the flesh or deny the self. Instead of living according to Christ, we may live according to these four different kinds of law—the laws of social ethics, biblical ethical principles, self-made laws, and the inner life law. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sg88U9K0yJlgyYkOTTYYeg-jhE8ihC0LNRDbxGhs9u9M3IxMpYooF2YKtp-9frUCd"> Recently, I have been enlightened of the Lord and also rebuked by Him concerning how little I actually live Christ day by day. I have had to confess to the Lord that only a small part of my time each day has been spent in living Christ. Most of the time I unconsciously and automatically live according to ethics, some kind of law, or certain habits I have built up. Instead of having Christ as the unique constituent of my daily walk, I have ethics, principles, self-made laws, and even the law of the inner life as my constituent. As a result, much of the time I live by natural ethics, biblical ethics, self-made laws, or the inner life law instead of according to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESGHgWz2cLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS"> Living by these four kinds of laws does not require that we pray, trust in the Lord, or depend on Him. Our attitude may be that the Lord may sit on the throne in heaven, but we do not need Him to help us live on earth. We may think that we ourselves are quite capable of living in a proper way. We can be ethical and even “spiritual” without Christ and without the spirit. We may even succeed to “bear the cross” and “crucify” ourselves, also without Christ. Nevertheless, in doing all these things, we are not living according to Christ, but according to certain of the laws I have mentioned. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrTYeI5BWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-">OUR FAILURE TO LIVE CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="5euwGBFk7L_E9dzcXZ8PUzy3e3r0lMSqW8T1Z9BMt24AQwhyvAVjySQuKVWJUZej3"> Before you were saved, you might have paid little attention even to your self-made laws. But after you were saved <span class="pg" data-page-id="364" id="364">[364]</span> and especially after you began to seek the Lord in the church life, your self-made laws began to exert a very strong influence on your daily living. You can say truly that you love the Lord and seek Him, but can you honestly say that you live Christ day by day? Instead of living Christ, you may live your kind of law. When you break one of your self-made laws, you repent and make confession to the Lord. But have you ever repented and confessed for not living Christ? I do not believe that many Christians have made this kind of confession. </p>
<p data-content-id="N78TKjbEXVwSfszdd30oED0tovQxUQ--ofRmWsRF1_iiqC8arZJbwvJC5VunnOdmn"> In recent months my confession to the Lord has mainly been related to my failures in living Christ. In the morning I may have an excellent time to pray and enjoy the Lord. During my prayer, I am one spirit with the Lord and live Him. But afterward I may go to the breakfast table, begin to eat, and completely forget about Christ and living Him. Sometime later I may suddenly realize what has happened and come back to Christ and say, “O Lord, forgive me. Lord, I want to be one spirit with You.” For a few minutes, I may again be with the Lord. However, I soon become occupied with something else and forget Him again. Is this not your experience also? We cannot say that we live Christ. Instead of living Him, we live our laws, culture, religion, and tradition. </p>
<p data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAcq0xILj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1"> We have pointed out that the book of Galatians covers God’s two economies. His first economy, the economy in the Old Testament, involves law, our ethical laws as well as the God-given law. Whenever a person is regenerated, he continues to live according to the ethical laws he has assimilated from his culture. Very few, if any, live Christ. Even though we may seek Christ, we still live our own cultural laws and, thereby, in our actual experience, keep ourselves in God’s first economy. </p>

<p data-content-id="FgR_87l1H0LrnccVVzJZOiLh7bX9_rimHZBL91SeKVcHVN1MSKn1mYterXmbrgWIP"> We have pointed out that the book of Galatians presents a comparison of God’s two economies: the economy in the Old Testament, which concerns the law, and the economy in the New Testament, which is centered on Christ Himself. According to His New Testament economy, God’s intention is to dispense Christ into us and to make Christ one with us and us one with Him. This is altogether different from our natural concept. For this reason, I am rather concerned that many of us still do not fully realize that as those who are saved and regenerated by the Spirit of God with the divine life and nature, we are now one spirit with God. Before we were saved, we and God were separate, far removed from each other. But when we were saved and regenerated, God was conceived in us and born into us. By the new birth we and God have become one spirit. How marvelous! </p>
<p data-content-id="CU-aCEAv94CWgyGmLnJX6EWOGljUqUGLo0AuX53zp3T1Hmvg_AjLyLvlpXa2-6nQD"> We may read the Bible again and again without being impressed with God’s intention as revealed in the Bible. Instead, we may pay our attention to such things as Paul’s commandment for husbands to love their wives, or for wives to submit to their husbands. Matters such as love and submission fit our natural concepts. But the mystery of God dispensing Himself into us to make us one with Him is contrary to our natural concept. This is the reason that even though this is revealed in the Scriptures, we do not have the ability to comprehend it. How we need the Lord’s mercy that we may know His intention! <span class="pg" data-page-id="372" id="372">[372]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87401" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> he says, “Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.” Here the Greek word is <em>peripateo.</em> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87402" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">5:25</span> Paul goes on to say, “If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.” Here the Greek word is <em>stoicheo,</em> the verbal form of the Greek word for element used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87403" data-verses="Galatians 4:3">4:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87404" data-verses="Galatians 4:9">9</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87405" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87406" data-verses="Galatians 4:3">Galatians 4:3</span> speaks of “the elements of the world,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87407" data-verses="Galatians 4:9">4:9</span>, of “the weak and poor elements.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87408" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">Colossians 2:8</span> also refers to “the elements of the world.” These elements denote basic, rudimentary, or elementary principles. For example, in mathematics there are the elementary principles of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Likewise, philosophy and ethical teachings are also composed of rudimentary elements. There are also elements, basic principles, elementary rules, in God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1lTdeqpfiM5O4JJibZTHmVwix8IFU3Ocr4jsEOQAzOWGr2bvXZul_bdpDy_0-9KZ"> As we have indicated, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87409" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">Galatians 5:25</span> the Greek word for element is used as a verb. The same word is also used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87410" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">6:16</span>, where Paul says, “And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” It is difficult for translators to find an English equivalent for this Greek verb. If we say, “If we live by the Spirit, let us also element by the Spirit,” no one will be able to understand what we mean. Thus, translators are forced to use the word “walk.” Yes, according to Greek usage, the word does convey the thought of walking. However, it is not to walk in a general way, in the sense of walking about, but to walk in a specific way according to a certain rule, principle, or lane. </p>
<p data-content-id="foiLIlvcS80gCzQLJEjLx1zlBlA7oeKfvi_9m0_XuzDf4uNd_MonuQ67A3GsUpFID"> This Greek word is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87411" data-verses="Acts 21:24">Acts 21:24</span> with the meaning of walking orderly with respect to the teachings of the law. The expression “walk orderly” in this verse is the translation of the Greek word <em>stoicheo.</em> It is used to denote a walk that is in order or in line. For example, when soldiers march, they walk in order, keeping rank and walking in line. This is an illustration of what it means to walk orderly. </p>
<p data-content-id="IEVFDlaYVRjSRK71dHxvanxfTiFioXn-0yai8TnmSQ0mIPD3pnj0_KMZCVI_UK25d"> In our daily living as Christians, we need to have two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The first is a general walk, whereas the <span class="pg" data-page-id="373" id="373">[373]</span> second is the walk according to a certain rule or principle for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. In the first kind of walk, we need to display the fruit of the Spirit, the virtues listed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87412" data-verses="Galatians 5:22-23">5:22 and 23</span>. However, we are not here simply to exhibit such virtues as love, joy, and peace. We are here for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Thus, we need to walk according to certain rules or principles for the fulfillment of this purpose. For God’s purpose, we need to have a walk that is orderly, a walk that is according to certain elementary rules or basic principles. Loving and being joyful are not basic rules or principles. These are simply different aspects of our daily life as Christians, not the characteristics of the walk which leads to the fulfillment of God’s purpose. This walk, the second kind of walk by the Spirit, requires that we walk according to basic principles and elementary rules. </p>
<p data-content-id="Hlq_gUShg2G7IhotoZBaNpfzC5fhpJVlHrXNP3YQSM19wOBoXfa9nS1og1JwPplH9"> We may use the daily life of a young sister who is a student to illustrate the two kinds of walk by the Spirit. On the one hand, this sister lives with her family at home. If she truly lives Christ, she will show forth the virtues of Christ to the members of her family. On the other hand, she needs to be a proper student at school and fulfill all the requirements leading to graduation. At home she needs to walk as a daughter and sister, but at school she needs to walk as a proper student. She needs to have both the general walk at home with her family and the more specific walk at school according to basic rules and elementary principles. </p>
<p data-content-id="X2KpgkkTGpuer9ChrLtbTP3FLQweppPE30oZb2NYjLrZPMqVCuoyr2w9p0BOI3Rme"> In the first three chapters of Galatians, we see that Christ is revealed in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87413" data-verses="Galatians 1:15-16">1:15-16</span>), that Christ lives in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87414" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">2:20</span>), and that Christ has been put upon us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87415" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">3:27</span>). Christ is thus our inward content and also our outward expression. Furthermore, we are all “sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87416" data-verses="Galatians 3:26">3:26</span>), and the Spirit of the Son of God has been sent into our hearts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87417" data-verses="Galatians 4:6">4:6</span>). Praise the Lord that we are now sons of God! As God’s sons, we need a walk by the Spirit to express Christ in all His virtues. We also need another kind of walk by the Spirit, the walk according to certain rules or principles, leading toward the goal for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. If we have the second kind of walk by the Spirit, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="374" id="374">[374]</span> shall be not only sons of God, but also a new creation and the Israel of God. We need to live the new creation and as the new Israel of God. In order to live a new creation and live as the Israel of God, we need the second kind of walk. We need to walk orderly according to the elementary principles of God’s economy. </p>

<p data-content-id="IEVFDlaYVRjSRK71dHxvanxfSiFzjXn-0yai8TnmSQ0mIPD3pnj0_KMZCVI_UK25d"> In God’s New Testament economy He first makes us His sons and then the new creation and the Israel of God. Toward the end of Galatians, Paul speaks both of a new creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87435" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">6:15</span>) and of the Israel of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87436" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">v. 16</span>). The fact that he refers to these matters in the conclusion of the book is an indication of their importance. Hence, it is crucial that we have a proper understanding of the new creation and also of the Israel of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Hlq_gUShg2G7IhotoZBaNpfzD5f8hJVlHrXNP3YQSM19wOBoXfa9nS1og1JwPplH9">PEACE UPON THE ISRAEL OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="X2KpgkkTGpuer9ChrLtbTP3FKQwHgpPE30oZb2NYjLrZPMqVCuoyr2w9p0BOI3Rme"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87437" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">6:16</span> Paul says, “And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” Here Paul does not mention peace in a general way, but in a particular way. Furthermore, he does not say “peace be unto you,” but says “peace be upon the Israel of God.” For peace to be upon us is different from it being unto us. Peace upon us is more subjective than peace unto us. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87438" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">6:16</span>, this peace is not upon the believers generally; rather, it is upon those who walk by this rule, the elementary rule of the new creation. Peace will be upon those who walk by the rule of the new creation. This indicates that here in the conclusion of Galatians peace is conditional. In order for peace to be upon us, we need to be those who walk by the rule of the new creation to be the true Israel of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="kWWIR_PfYdTAivJZe4CjaMmx1eJ0CXYMQN8Lfl4WOobFn7DmNjazJgeo2POKKCOfK"> Before Paul speaks of grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87439" data-verses="Galatians 6:18">verse 18</span>, he inserts <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87440" data-verses="Galatians 6:17">verse 17</span> and says, “For the rest let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus.” The insertion of this verse is a further indication that at the end of Galatians <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> both peace and grace are mentioned with certain conditions. If peace is to come upon us, we must fulfill the conditions. Because peace here comes upon us in a very particular way, we need to meet a certain requirement, the requirement that we walk by the rule of the new creation to be the Israel of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="JXqZnZhBWTHYr5N7Yht-3oF9otZGmjmP3ypdcLgaJCkerNiqlRD_Yss6rPYP8xAja"> We have pointed out that in Galatians Paul speaks of two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87441" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> is a more general walk, whereas the walk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87442" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">5:25</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87443" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">6:16</span> is a particular walk, a walk according to a certain rule or principle. Having the second kind of walk is a condition for peace to come upon the Israel of God. This is not the peace which comes upon God’s people in a general way; it is a specific peace which comes upon a particular people, those who have the second kind of walk by the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="trExTVk8D47gxr7cdBr8mqAco0xIDj8fRN6COb_mALwcvd8A9rLxkQkFpA3_6sPZ1">SONS OF GOD AND THE ISRAEL OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="hwMadJIZ14zUSl3gCcShY899aJQzKmfydHXU1tIkWKzKdKgtXF3CB5KwOuJngqEmP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87444" data-verses="Galatians 3:26">3:26</span> Paul says, “You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.” As sons of God, we are His folks, members of His household. But God’s New Testament economy is not only to make us His sons, but also to make us the Israel of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="U0hKzeGUKiJ9Ln5z4YNTcfeFbbLVRWosB97DAfeztAm8eOk3lOS0ACBjVbUPD323A"> Perhaps we can understand the difference between the sons of God and the Israel of God if we consider as an illustration how a son in a royal family is trained to be king. On the one hand, such a son grows up as a member of the royal family, the son of the king and queen. On the other hand, he must be trained in order to become king in the future. Thus, he must have two kinds of living: the first, as a son in the royal family; the second, as a king-to-be. If he has the first kind of living without the second, he will not become equipped or qualified to be king. A boy is not trained to be a king overnight. Nor does he become qualified to be a king simply by developing certain virtues. If he is joyful, loving, meek, faithful, and self-controlled, he will be a very good boy. But these virtues in themselves do not qualify him to be a king. As a king-to-be, he must be trained to live and act in a kingly way. The way he sits in a chair or converses with <span class="pg" data-page-id="381" id="381">[381]</span> others must be kingly. As one with a dual status—that of a son in the royal family and that of a king-to-be—he must have two kinds of living. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MW1PrIO1NZkL7m7Ua0gn0XKRFLZdxyxZO7paon9rt0Llao3pVSvH-BXWTu0cTco71">TWO KINDS OF LIVING</h2><p data-content-id="VJs2_qQSmWRN5nwRMAwzi450jsx-2h5WHZfAUFc9qWR3k9ARa10q6C3SazdmHHl0y"> We who believe in Christ Jesus also have a dual status. On the one hand, we are sons of God, members of the divine family. On the other hand, we are kings-to-be, those destined to be kings. Kingship is related to the Israel of God. We should be not only sons of God, but also the Israel of God. To be proper sons of God it is sufficient to have the fruit of the Spirit, such as those virtues listed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87445" data-verses="Galatians 5:22-23">5:22 and 23</span>. But to be kings, the Israel of God, we need another kind of living, a particular kind of walk by the Spirit. We need both the living of sons of God and that of the Israel of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="iIHmCvd9sgkOSusZIiEhvMwB5T3s-J4zuIWsbFnSjjf0sUscYCF5zbaUImx-kg4jH"> Many Christians do not have the first kind of walk by the Spirit, much less the second. We thank the Lord that, by His mercy, many in the church life today do have the first kind of walk by the Spirit to live Christ. But now the Lord is calling us to go on to have the second walk by the Spirit, the second kind of living. This is the living not merely of sons in the divine family, but of those who will be kings in God’s kingdom. May our eyes be opened to see that we are kings in the royal family! Our destiny is not only to be sons of God; it is to be kings reigning in the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="1d2f_9YogZuGF0F3RaAqS-3nZBir65hkqULOa_lPpNjzrwTnOsnp1GD0BnfWBbdhG"> Do you live in a kingly way? If you live in this way, you will be kingly even when you laugh. If we see that Paul’s word about the Israel of God implies that we need a kingly walk, the aspiration to live in a kingly way will be stirred up within us. We may even want to pray, “Lord, cause me to live and walk in a kingly way so that I may be qualified to be part of today’s Israel of God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="9EjNkeFQzuB7lPrvBx2r4mQlASeQu3MjL5KX4WKv8J4ijozWWaX1GBnucISX6mYPk"> In a sense, the nation of Israel is the Israel of God and a testimony of God, even though many Israelites are rebellious and very sinful. However, the real Israel, the spiritual Israel, is the church. But because both the nation of Israel and the church are in a low condition, there is the need for the Lord to recover the real Israel of God. For such a <span class="pg" data-page-id="382" id="382">[382]</span> recovery, we need two kinds of living, two kinds of walk. In the first walk we shall have such virtues as love, joy, peace, meekness, and longsuffering, all of which are the expression of the Christ who lives in us. We also need the second kind of walk so that we may be the Israel of God bearing God’s kingship, representing Him with His authority, and executing His governmental administration. </p>
<p data-content-id="jNHNoHhxt7cbszaVs2RjRHRXA_wBWx3ISFPf8Kuf5Jq3AWG9Juh2vq7g1OiSkI5wf"> These two kinds of walks are illustrated by our life as citizens of the United States. On the one hand, we are persons living in an ordinary way; on the other hand, we are citizens of this nation. As persons, we need to be loving, peaceful, joyful, faithful, and meek. However, in order for the United States to remain a strong nation, we also need to live as good citizens, fulfilling all the requirements of the government. As citizens, we need to pay taxes, serve in the army, and fulfill other obligations. Spiritually speaking, we are both the sons of God and the Israel of God. As sons of God, we need to be loving, joyful, peaceful, faithful, and meek. As the Israel of God, we must walk according to the elementary rules of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="Tc7W4PPlRfP7IyYTOzL7ser8SV7ut7DFEWMttoR7ZAF4gSuisrqcMjelyDWtvV_KY"> Whereas those Christians who truly desire to go on with the Lord usually care only for the first kind of walk and desire to be spiritual, holy, and victorious, we need to care also for the second kind of walk. In particular, we need to care for the church life. However, many Christians who are “spiritual” or “holy” do not care in the least for the church life. These Christians are interested in prayer, Bible study, gospel preaching, or improving their behavior. According to their concept, this is all that is necessary. But because they do not walk according to the principle of the new creation, it is not possible for them to become the Israel of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="0BpDaFkHtIhH2qZitqny5KzX0dRk-t6aFanb0dnnLD-DF8DEA-y-PlCDROzpEYzWE"> In the New Testament the books of Romans and Galatians stand together in a special category. These two books reveal not only God’s redemption, but also the economy of God’s redemption. Redemption is one thing, and the economy of redemption is another. When many Christians read the books of Romans and Galatians, they can easily see the matter of redemption. However, very few see God’s economy of redemption, because this matter is somewhat hidden in these two books. Although the word economy cannot be found either in Romans or in Galatians, the fact of the economy of redemption can nonetheless be found in these books. Our burden in this message is to consider God’s economy in His redemption. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7EjiJiKSogg44JUcqVx5SCLFsPkG9zVQuzRHXmWHEsrf9X58XGzqK5yeH8wP2vo49">GOD’S GOAL IN REDEMPTION</h2><p data-content-id="_Fv0JBBWQcCEA6UxPCM9K1D1UAR-CRb8K6GGkuofFK8ArsuS12Lmc3gY7CCOW-tTq"> Although redemption is covered both in Romans and in Galatians, redemption is not God’s goal. Rather, it is a process, or step, toward the goal. In God’s economy redemption is used to bring forth a certain issue or result. What is God’s goal in redemption? Also, what is the issue produced by God’s redemption? The answer to both questions is sonship. Sonship is both God’s goal in redemption and the issue of the process of redemption. However, many Christians only see that Romans covers justification by faith. They do not see the divine sonship in the book of Romans. If we read Romans carefully, we shall see that justification by faith is covered for the most part <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> in the first four chapters. Beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87468" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">chapter five</span>, Paul moves on toward the goal of sonship. According to the revelation found in the book of Romans, God is transforming sinners into sons. Hence, the book of Romans shows us how God is in the process of producing sons out of sinners. Here we see God’s economy. God’s economy is not simply to redeem lost sinners. His economy is to redeem sinners with a view to making them His sons. In God’s economy the two main matters are redemption and sonship. </p>
<p data-content-id="BgIbIp-MeDbB3RxdRZnnJtw7IlgKRdAdTbG5ey5q42AyqhNIGlvz2jYlJOf2dgoh7"> In the Bible the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is not for doctrine, theology, or teaching. The Trinity is for God’s economy. In His economy, God the Father is the One who plans, who forms an eternal purpose. Because He has a purpose, a plan, He has a great many arrangements to correspond to His purpose. In the Trinity, God the Father is the source, the One who plans to accomplish His economy. For the carrying out of the divine economy, two crucial matters must be worked out—redemption and sonship. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87469" data-verses="Galatians 4:1">Galatians 4</span> we see that the Father sent forth His Son to accomplish redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87470" data-verses="Galatians 4:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>). Then He sent forth the Spirit of His Son to bring forth the sonship. Thus, for the accomplishment of His economy, the Father sent forth first the Son and then the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="bC1pcODeYDFv_tT1XJ1X8uToy0DRCz4H7ppBCvGjEwvEcGrkg8G3OM7peOuVMP7WT"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87471" data-verses="Galatians 4:4-5">Galatians 4:4 and 5</span> say, “But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship.” For the accomplishment of redemption, it was necessary for the Son of God to become a human being born of a woman and born under the law. In order to put on humanity, a human nature, He had to “come of a woman.” It is a heresy to say that Mary was the mother of God. Although Jesus was God incarnated as a man, Mary was not the mother of God. She was the mother of the man Jesus. By coming of a woman, Jesus, the Son of God, was a man with blood and flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87472" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). If He had not had blood and flesh, there would have been no way for the Son of God to accomplish redemption. Redemption required the shedding of blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="q3jcmQiBdpveX3yTChY2sZztMoSfHB32FX9edO8cXiqBVIUnD-vccx6O4royDmPGD"> After the Son of God accomplished redemption for us, the Spirit was sent to carry out the sonship and to make it real <span class="pg" data-page-id="389" id="389">[389]</span> to us in our experience. The Spirit was sent to make all the redeemed ones sons of God. Thus, Christ came for redemption, and the Spirit came for sonship. Christ redeemed us, and the Spirit imparts the divine life into us to make us sons of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yPyDK8U8toP9ddq9fj88PGh33ODKIupaPL4uypQZLsf1WGHSHcqrXPDiSJ3xpUhVH">THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="8QMBpb5u2uHUGqYhAKQo7aPwnYy7Puq03b-0CqpSXjxqjeY42vbmKdMawdZNSBkiv"> Again and again, the books of Romans and Galatians speak of the Spirit. This is especially true of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87473" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87474" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Verse 2</span> speaks of the Spirit of life and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87475" data-verses="Romans 8:15">verse 15</span>, of the spirit of sonship. Because we have a spirit of sonship, we have the life of the Son of God. Spontaneously we cry, “Abba, Father.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87476" data-verses="Romans 8:9">verse 9</span> Paul speaks of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87477" data-verses="Romans 8:11">verses 11</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87478" data-verses="Romans 8:13">13</span>, of the Spirit. The expression “the Spirit” is also found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87479" data-verses="Romans 8:16">verse 16</span>: “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="0BpDaFkHtIhH2qZitqny5KzX0dR5wt6aFanb0dnnLD-DF8DEA-y-PlCDROzpEYzWE"> The term “the Spirit” is very significant. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87480" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> says, “But this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” Why does this verse say that “the Spirit was not yet”? Although the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit were in existence before the glorification of Christ, “the Spirit” was not. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87481" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</span> we see that the Spirit of God was brooding upon the water. The Old Testament also speaks frequently of the Spirit of Jehovah. When the Lord Jesus was about to be conceived in the womb of Mary, there is mention of the Holy Spirit, because something common, human nature, was to be made holy by the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87482" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matt. 1:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87483" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">20</span>). But when Jesus cried out, saying, “If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87484" data-verses="John 7:37">John 7:37</span>), He spoke concerning the Spirit. However, “the Spirit was not yet” because Jesus was not yet glorified. He had not been crucified and resurrected. But after His crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit came. Today the very Spirit who witnesses with our spirit is <em>the Spirit.</em> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87485" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">Second Corinthians 3:17</span> even says, “Now the Lord is the Spirit.” Notice that this verse does not say, “The Lord is a Spirit,” but, “The Lord is <em>the</em> Spirit.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="390" id="390">[390]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7EjiJiKSogg44JUcqVx5SCLFsPkfyzVQuzRHXmWHEsrf9X58XGzqK5yeH8wP2vo49">THE WALK OF GOD’S SONS</h2><p data-content-id="_Fv0JBBWQcCEA6UxPCM9K1D1UARbORb8K6GGkuofFK8ArsuS12Lmc3gY7CCOW-tTq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87486" data-verses="Romans 8:14">Romans 8:14</span> says, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” This verse indicates that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87487" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> is concerned not with the birth of the sons of God, but with the walk of God’s sons. Those who are led by the Spirit truly are sons of God. The word walk is used strongly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87488" data-verses="Romans 8:4">verse 4</span>: “That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.” </p>
<p data-content-id="BgIbIp-MeDbB3RxdRZnnJtw7IlgrcdAdTbG5ey5q42AyqhNIGlvz2jYlJOf2dgoh7"> Under the influence of the natural concept, Christians often think that after we are saved, we should have a walk which glorifies God. We pay attention to Paul’s word about walking in a way that is worthy of our calling, but we understand this exhortation according to our natural concept. Immediately after people are saved, they automatically try to behave in a way that glorifies God. Such a thought comes spontaneously. It is not wrong to say that we need behavior that glorifies God. However, regarding this we may be under the influence of a natural concept. According to the natural concept, to walk worthy of our calling is to be honest, faithful, humble, gentle, kind, and loving. We may think that we shall glorify God if we have such virtues, and that others will appreciate us. However, the book of Romans, a basic book in God’s revelation, does not charge us to walk in this way. On the contrary, it teaches us to walk as sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="xjqmn9R1X5blwipEnjasYmAssAFHA4qU2NWwLyw0snQQ-qgOjt6rZiX-2SZwAnQMv"> There is a great difference between walking as sons of God and walking as redeemed sinners who express such virtues as honesty, kindness, and love. The goal of God’s economy is not merely to have a group of people who are faithful, kind, and loving. God’s goal in His economy is to produce sons. A person may be honest, faithful, and loving, but he may not be a son of God. God wants sons. He does not want honest, faithful, loving sinners. His purpose is not to make sinful husbands into those who love their wives, or sinful wives into those who submit to their husbands. We repeat, God’s goal in His economy is to bring forth many divine sons. <span class="pg" data-page-id="391" id="391">[391]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="O5j0zA-qf0Mh3AhAARFQ7lm0Kq4Xpo1dbjbNSwkTTf9dBNb-Jl3CA_ksU2tziRdNZ"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that the books of Romans and Galatians reveal not only God’s redemption, but also the economy of God’s redemption. It is rather easy for us, the children of God, to know God’s salvation, but not so easy to know the economy of God’s salvation. Although the word economy cannot be found in either Romans or Galatians, God’s economy in His salvation is nonetheless implied. In both its ancient and modern usage, the word economy denotes a plan with a certain arrangement, management, administration, and even dispensation. The economy of God has its arrangement, management, and stewardship related to God’s dispensation of Himself in the Son through the Spirit into His chosen and redeemed people. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4_qA8Hy-y0ewiG9-6MsH-Mof_MI40UkArgTfy6n1bWzEZGnixsWeAeScztLyq67eK">SONSHIP—THE GOAL OF GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="oU2lAEAfF60Z32GAq6eomfHZnPetx1Hvg7_2rk0Sn_tuTwbA7nRurGY_QO909OTcO"> Now we must go on to see the goal of God’s economy. God’s goal in His economy is sonship. God’s intention is to produce many sons. If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that God has a good pleasure, a heart’s desire. The desire of God’s heart is that He be expressed through many sons. The Bible reveals that God is a great Father with a very large family. In New Testament terms, God has a household. Who can say how many sons God has? Since every genuine believer in Christ is a son of God, God’s sons must number in the millions. Because God has so many sons, He truly is a great Father. Even the sisters are counted among the sons of God. Nowhere are we told that Christ, the firstborn Son of <span class="pg" data-page-id="398" id="398">[398]</span> God, has sisters. Rather, He has only brothers, and these brothers of Christ are the many sons of God. Thus, it is important for the sisters to realize that they are brothers of Christ and sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="3r5xmJXvfOZ4GVY3aEYeHipnNqeEXvZOvvuIuMxp3Acx6Fq7vGqRtFtOPFZ605KPg"> According to the Bible, the function of a son is to express the father. Hence, the Son of God is the expression of God the Father. The Lord Jesus once said, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87507" data-verses="John 14:9">John 14:9</span>). Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87508" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span> says, “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” The New Testament also indicates that as the Son of God Christ is the image of the invisible God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87509" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Col. 1:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87510" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4">2 Cor. 4:4</span>). An image is an expression of something or someone. For God to have millions of sons means that He, a great Father, needs a vast, universal, and eternal expression. As sons of God, we express our Father, for we have been born of Him. God’s economy, His administration, is to carry out His purpose to have many sons to be His corporate expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="jNHNoHhxt7cbszaVs2RjRHRXG_wBex3ISFPf8Kuf5Jq3AWG9Juh2vq7g1OiSkI5wf"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87511" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4-5">Ephesians 1:4 and 5</span> say that God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, “having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself.” Before anything was created, God chose us and predestinated us, put a mark on us, unto sonship. God has marked us out to be His sons. However, many Christians are not aware of God’s choice and predestination. According to their concept, we are merely fallen sinners in need of God’s salvation. They have never dreamed that God has destined us for sonship. </p>
<p data-content-id="Tc7W4PPlRfP7IyYTOzL7ser8UV7ul7DFEWMttoR7ZAF4gSuisrqcMjelyDWtvV_KY"> According to the Bible, sonship involves having the life and nature of the Father to express Him and inherit all that He is, has, and does. To inherit whatever the Father is, has, and does actually is to inherit God the Father Himself. Sonship in the Bible means to have God’s life and nature to express God and to inherit God with all His riches. Furthermore, sonship implies perfection. As sons of God, we must be perfect even as He is (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87512" data-verses="Matthew 5:48">Matt. 5:48</span>). Perfection is synonymous with maturity. A small boy is the genuine son of his father, but this boy does not yet have the full sonship, because he is not mature. <span class="pg" data-page-id="399" id="399">[399]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="nx8SwJqAHSCfDXHqBW34mrUmfb2OENkVdfHur975RksbbmfglvanrtbLMme-cP2Wn"> Even if we have the Father’s life and nature and have the maturity, the perfection, to express Him and inherit Him, the sonship will not be full until our body is transfigured. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87513" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Romans 8:23</span> Paul says, “And not only so, but we ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.” The redemption of our body refers to the transfiguration of the body. One day our body will be changed, not simply outwardly, but organically and metabolically by having the divine element wrought into it. Today our faces may be rather bright, but they are not yet shining. But when our body has been metabolically and organically transfigured through the supply of the divine life, not only our faces but our whole physical being will shine. That will be the full sonship, for then we shall express God in full. We shall express Him spiritually, psychologically, and even physically. From our faces light will shine to express God. Concerning this <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87514" data-verses="1John 3:2">1 John 3:2</span> says, “Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is” (lit.). When we see Him, He will be shining with the glory of the Father, and we shall be shining with this glory also. This is full sonship. </p>
<p data-content-id="6dR3l0TKVK5BVc1WfrOnHw6izct9T9O55ZdMpdNdldLArsZ1aOoLZ1aATo3wP97vY"> Thus, from the New Testament we see that as sons of God we have God’s life and nature to inherit God with all His wealth and to express Him to the uttermost. This sonship is the desire of God’s heart. Our wonderful, eternal Father wants a universal expression of Himself through many sons. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RWVsQ_5NusVXYDHGxpbs0M_JTUWRKPEcjaGDW74RHmUjtOizB-mcAbBc3CjOpxqzi">AFTER GOD’S KIND</h2><p data-content-id="suGsx2yrlu_xHF1tfjn8zJMxhepgZ_FkeXicCvRkOc4iVF8ZQC36eleSovBwPlpZv"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87515" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> says that God created man in His image and after His likeness. God created man in this way because it is His intention that He be expressed by man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87516" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> indicates that every living thing was created according to its kind. Man, however, was made not after his own kind, but after God’s kind. Do you have the boldness to proclaim that, as a human being you are after God’s kind? If we realize <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> that we were made in God’s image and after God’s likeness, we should have the boldness to say that we were created after God’s kind. However, to say that we are after God’s kind does not mean that we are God or that we shall ever become God. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87517" data-verses="Genesis 1:26-28">Genesis 1:26-28</span>, we human beings are after God’s kind. </p>
<p data-content-id="wQgrOGxTAR-3cCZQG4vA7ypurJDYJxy-1YMzeB2bGSRwqkuXSpsZRAhutjKQMg_WA"> Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87518" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> had the image of God and the likeness of God, but he did not have the life and nature of God. Therefore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87519" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, God placed man in front of the tree of life. This indicates that Adam needed to partake of God’s life with the divine nature. Even though Adam had been created in God’s image and after His likeness, he still needed to eat of the fruit of the tree of life in order to have eternal life. In the first two chapters of Genesis we thus have a complete record of God’s creation of man. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LweBTzPvwX_r0vQLmZs8i7zJDIOduyIC0CXtoxUzsH1VpY_s7C6CzRpIDMkjJ7gRf">REDEMPTION AND REGENERATION</h2><p data-content-id="mwgtjC9XS1FGoCtF4PVerTKBvL05OLGZ7EjJw3iBylk8ausrMn3Rya4C_vDviKgZU"> Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87520" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> did not have eternal life. Rather, he simply had the human life as a vessel to contain the divine life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87521" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span> indicates clearly that man is a vessel. Our human life is a vessel to contain the divine life. But before man received the eternal life, he fell. Therefore, God sent His Son to be a man with blood and flesh to accomplish redemption and to bring fallen man back to God’s original purpose. Redemption thus recovers man to God’s purpose. Hallelujah, through the blood of Christ shed on the cross, we, fallen sinners, have been redeemed! Both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87522" data-verses="Romans 3:1">Romans 3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87523" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span> speak of God’s marvelous redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZPMSuZ9RJARG2mHH39cp1MOyn6hZj4rLeMkbyNUB6rt7BUGo_N35-ZgE1eohkDMv_"> Redemption, however, is not an end in itself. It is a procedure, part of a process, to reach God’s goal of sonship. For this reason, both Romans and Galatians indicate that Christ redeemed us that the divine life could be imparted into us for our regeneration. We had been created by God, but we still needed to be regenerated. Although we were created with the human life, we needed to be regenerated with another life, the divine life. Thus, redemption issues in the impartation of divine life. This is regeneration. By the regeneration of the Spirit, we become sons of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="401" id="401">[401]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="Sg88U9K0yJlgyYkOTTYYeg-jmE8zoC0LNRDbxGhs9u9M3IxMpYooF2YKtp-9frUCd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87551" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">Galatians 5</span> Paul speaks twice about walking by the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87552" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">verse 16</span> he says, “Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87553" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">verse 25</span> he goes on to say, “If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.” For more than forty years I have been seeking the proper understanding of these verses. In itself <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87554" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">verse 16</span> seems rather easy to understand. As a number of Bible teachers have pointed out, the word “walk” here means to live, move, act, and have our being. Hence, to walk by the Spirit is to live, to have our being, by the Spirit. Since the word “walk” has this meaning, why does Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87555" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">verse 25</span> speak both of living by the Spirit and walking by the Spirit? For many years, I was troubled by this verse. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gkpJoxJG4epwFTP9N7CFpESGAgWu4cLW-CfR0RG-dBpb94q3ovfpaq8EKkAklFsGS">ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES</h2><p data-content-id="edFyJ1vp1BrVYfmrQFd-EWrTfeIgOWpPYlKCEs3jU_9DBF5tf_Hj7a_gBrChgOQM-"> It is important to realize that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87556" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">5:16</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87557" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">25</span> Paul uses two different Greek words for walk. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87558" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">verse 16</span> Paul uses the word <em>peripateo,</em> a general word for walking. This word means to walk about, to live and have our being. This meaning of walk is equal to “live” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87559" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">verse 25</span>. To walk by the Spirit is to live by the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87560" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">verse 25</span> Paul uses a different Greek word for walk, <em>stoicheo.</em> It is difficult to find an English equivalent for this Greek word. The word <em>stoicheo</em> is the verbal form of the noun “element.” The Greek noun for element is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87561" data-verses="Galatians 4:3">4:3</span> (“the elements of the world”) and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87562" data-verses="Galatians 4:9">4:9</span> (“poor elements”). It is also found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87563" data-verses="Colossians 2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>, where Paul again speaks of “the elements of the world.” These elements are elementary rules or basic principles. Thus, <em>stoicheo</em> is a verbal form of the Greek <span class="pg" data-page-id="410" id="410">[410]</span> word for elementary principles, basic rules. At least one version adopts the rendering, “to practice the elementary principles.” This version says, “Since we live by the Spirit, let us also practice the elementary principles.” </p>
<p data-content-id="5euwGBFk7L_E9dzcXZ8PUzy3Z3rRpMSqW8T1Z9BMt24AQwhyvAVjySQuKVWJUZej3"> The same Greek verb is also used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87564" data-verses="Acts 21:24">Acts 21:24</span>. After telling Paul that there were thousands of believing Jews and that they were all “zealous of the law,” James urged him to go to the temple with four others and purify himself with them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="87565" data-verses="Acts 21:20-24">vv. 20-24</span>). James went on to tell Paul that if he did this, all would know that “those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.” The expression “walk orderly” is the translation of the Greek word for “walk” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87566" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">Galatians 5:25</span>. To walk orderly means to walk according to certain basic rules or elementary principles. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="N78TKjbEXVwSfszdd30oED0tvvQQZQ--ofRmWsRF1_iiqC8arZJbwvJC5VunnOdmn">LIVING A NEW CREATION</h2><p data-content-id="xjqmn9R1X5blwipEnjasYmAsuAFHI4qU2NWwLyw0snQQ-qgOjt6rZiX-2SZwAnQMv"> Paul also uses the verb <em>stoicheo</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87567" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">6:16</span>: “And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” It is correct to render the Greek here as “walk according to the elementary principles.” Here Paul added the phrase “by this rule.” According to the context, “this rule” is the rule of being a new creation, as mentioned in the preceding verse. To “walk by this rule” is to live a new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="rHmgf6eijlU_XF5eddS8M-CPGoIIHjRp7sepgLx2Xw5ZZnk1eIUHytOc1gMcuTuh1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="87568" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">6:15</span> Paul says, “For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.” Here we see that we are to live neither a life of circumcision nor of uncircumcision, neither a religious life nor an unreligious life. Rather, we are to live a new creation. The new creation here is the totality of all the sons of God. God’s sons are the new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="dAK1QX3DACkGkV630vG0aHRrmNq7a02rmCc8eQITY-KFTzu6Ham8ErljFItEgmczR"> There is a basic difference between the new creation and the old creation. God’s life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature. Adam did not have the life of God or the nature of God. We can receive the divine life and nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus and being regenerated <span class="pg" data-page-id="411" id="411">[411]</span> by the Spirit. When we believed in Christ, God’s life and nature were imparted to us and caused us to become a new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="QX_dhXyrTEKgglFbpCHnW_bgiSjC9SmsScRzM7vcR1V4yTQVrfjL1P8cefckdiwb8"> According to Paul’s concept in Galatians, a person would still be in the old creation even if he were circumcised. The act of cutting the flesh could not cause anyone to receive the life of God. Both those who are circumcised and those who are uncircumcised are still part of the old creation. It is not God’s intention in His economy that we live either a circumcised life or an uncircumcised life. God’s goal in His economy is that we live a new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="KygeQ8PlDLBH2nvmKS7N8lV6vn1P5lyzh2JU0Vr4XlZjGo7XUqfsMNWRRv7JIAeWe"> If we would live a new creation, we must do all things in oneness with the Triune God, and the element of God must be wrought into us. For example, I may love a certain brother according to my natural life, not according to the divine element received through regeneration. Because this particular brother seems to be diligent, obedient, and submissive, I may be very fond of him. This kind of love is entirely a matter of the old creation. It is a case of one person in the old creation loving another in the old creation. If I would love this brother according to the new creation, I must condemn myself and my natural, even selfish, love for him. Then I need to love the brother by my regenerated being with the divine element. In such a case, I do not love him because he is submissive or good to me. Even if he offends me, I would still love him because I am living not by the natural life, but by the divine element within me. Then my love will be of the new creation, full of the divine element. The first kind of love, the natural love, the love in the old creation, is the expression of the love of a fallen creature. But the second kind of love, the love in the new creation, is the expression of the love of a son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="lf-ra6zpDBsmQzyyZJ16f_UJNs6T4rpUTX0gibWXBynit-bMMYmuy00n-xPKw7p05"> What matters today is not whether we are religious or unreligious. What matters is whether or not we are living a new creation. To live a new creation is to live, walk, have our being, and do all things, great and small, with the element of God. In all that we do, we should act not in ourselves, but according to our regenerated being, filled with the divine element. <span class="pg" data-page-id="412" id="412">[412]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="O5j0zA-qf0Mh3AhAARFQ7lm0Jq4Klo1dbjbNSwkTTf9dBNb-Jl3CA_ksU2tziRdNZ"> Even our conversation with others should be by the divine element within. If we sense that we are speaking apart from this element, we should not proceed further. In our daily conversation we should speak not in ourselves, but with the divine element. Then our conversation will be part of the new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="4_qA8Hy-y0ewiG9-6MsH-Mof8MIh5UkArgTfy6n1bWzEZGnixsWeAeScztLyq67eK"> In our relations with others we should not be religious or unreligious, but should live a new creation. Suppose I treat another brother in a very rough manner. This is to be unreligious. But suppose that, as an elderly brother who has been in the church life for many years, my roughness and toughness have been dealt with. Now in relation to others I am refined, gentle, and kind. However, there is no need for me to pray or to be one with the Lord to behave this way. Rather, I am gentle and kind in a religious way without the Lord. Should someone mistreat me or offend me, I may restrain myself and force a smile. This is to be religious, to be in the circumcision rather than in the uncircumcision. </p>
<p data-content-id="oU2lAEAfF60Z32GAq6eomfHZkPeIz1Hvg7_2rk0Sn_tuTwbA7nRurGY_QO909OTcO"> Even in teaching the Scriptures I may be in the old creation. If someone does not understand my teaching the first time, I may patiently explain the matter again. My kindness, patience, and gentleness may be admirable, but they have nothing to do with the new creation. In teaching the Word of God to others, I need to exercise my spirit and do everything by my regenerated being with the divine element and not by the natural life. Then I shall live neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, and I shall be neither religious nor unreligious. Instead I shall live a new creation. To live in this way is to walk “by this rule,” by the elementary principle of the new creation. </p>
