<h1 class="title" data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvaogkqSRQAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry">A FOREWORD</h1><p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fEkkfNxIMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> By the Lord’s mercy, in this life-study we come to the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation. Due to the subtle enemy of God, the book of Revelation has been closed, and few Christians understand it. Hardly anyone has seen something of life, of God’s economy, and of the testimony of Jesus in this book. Thus, we have been burdened by the Lord to have a life-study of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxguBmNxmaxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> Revelation is a book of prophecy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105141" data-verses="Revelation 1:3">1:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105142" data-verses="Revelation 22:7">22:7</span>), for the revelation it contains is in the nature of prophecy. Most of the visions refer to things to come. Even the seven epistles to the seven churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105143" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">chapters two and three</span>, in the sense of signs, are prophecies regarding the church on earth until the Lord’s coming back. Although this book is a book of prophecy, it is not prophecy merely in words, but in visions revealed to the seer. In the eyes of God, all the things prophesied in this book have already transpired and all have been shown to the seer in vision after vision. </p>
<p data-content-id="by2v23Nedf13WGfghX9I29Vrsx1_rARCOuCyECvjxyFHKSsKwXMqeaZkYrTMh3eTi"> In the book of Revelation, most of the verbs and predicates are not in the future tense, but in the past tense, indicating that the events recorded in this book have already transpired. Strictly speaking, Revelation is not merely a prophecy; it is a revelation of things which have already taken place. While they may not seem in our eyes to have transpired, in God’s eyes they have transpired. In God’s eyes, everything recorded in this book occurred nearly two thousand years ago. We all must believe this. Most Christians consider Revelation to be a book of predictions and they are curious to understand these predictions. Many of them read this book only for the sake of their curiosity. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> we must say to the Lord, “O Lord, save us from this. We don’t want to know this book in the way of curiosity.” I say strongly, once again, that Revelation is not merely a book of prophecy, but a record of things which have already taken place. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTmoKY9eLv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> In Revelation, two main things have transpired. The first is that the testimony of Jesus has been accomplished for eternity. Have you not seen the New Jerusalem? The apostle John saw it nearly two thousand years ago. Do you believe that you are in the New Jerusalem? If we appear to be crazy for saying this, we are crazy according to the Bible. The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of God’s work through the centuries, has been completely built up, and we are in it! According to the last two chapters of Revelation, the building of the New Jerusalem has been accomplished. This first item is on the positive side. </p>
<p data-content-id="yIistfmiI2_aDzgmmvCwMJLHGtYHeoDpV_WNoVoXfyhbv9uKSdjFfOREsc87szYIq"> On the negative side, a second main thing has transpired—Satan, the enemy of God, has been dealt with. In the eyes of God and even in the eyes of our brother John, Satan has been cast into the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105144" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">20:10</span>). Satan, the serpent, is in the lake of fire, and we are in the New Jerusalem. Have you seen this? If we have seen that Satan is in the lake of fire, we shall not beg God to deal with him. Rather, we shall praise Him that the enemy has been dealt with. Whenever Satan troubles us, we must tell him, “Satan, you are in the wrong place. You should not be here. You belong in the lake of fire. Go back there and do not come here again.” Have you ever done this? We all must do it. </p>
<p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILJq7-ZvWwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> The Bible is always consistent, even in the matter of Satan, God’s enemy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105145" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, Satan came to humanity in a very subtle way, coming in the form of a serpent. In Revelation, Satan is deliberately called “the old serpent” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105146" data-verses="Revelation 12:9">12:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105147" data-verses="Revelation 20:2">20:2</span>). In the book of Genesis, the serpent was not so old, but in the book of Revelation, he has become old, at least six thousand years old. With a definite intention, the book of Revelation purposely calls him “the old serpent.” At the time of the book of Revelation, however, Satan is not only “the old <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> serpent”; he has also become a dragon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105148" data-verses="Revelation 12:9">12:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105149" data-verses="Revelation 20:2">20:2</span>). According to Revelation, this dragon is firstly cast out of heaven and down to the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105150" data-verses="Revelation 12:7-9">12:7-9</span>). Then, after three and one-half years, he is bound and cast into the abyss (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105151" data-verses="Revelation 20:1-3">20:1-3</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105152" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">Revelation 20</span> we see that, still being somewhat useful in the hands of God, the Lord will release Satan from the abyss at the end of the thousand years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105153" data-verses="Revelation 20:7">20:7</span>). After his release, Satan will try his best to damage humanity, “to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105154" data-verses="Revelation 20:8">20:8</span>). But, shortly afterward, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105155" data-verses="Revelation 20:10">20:10</span>, the Devil will be cast into the lake of fire, which is his destiny and destination. The book of Revelation has been closed because it exposes Satan, disclosing his destiny and destination. But now, at the end of time, we believe that the Lord will open up this book and open up our hearts, spirits, and eyes that we may clearly see that God’s enemy is now in the lake of fire. Hallelujah, Satan, the old serpent, is in the lake of fire and we are in the New Jerusalem! </p>
<p data-content-id="ADcOpTWyGt901MiqV_ZKRV6F7PjPB-zaZ6KLGZIyWdC9Glu88RqQYZsBIACfYqBFW"> The New Jerusalem is the testimony of Jesus. Today’s church is also the testimony of Jesus. Today, we in the churches are the testimony of Jesus. We all must see this to the uttermost, forgetting ourselves, our weaknesses, our besetting sins, and even the fact that we are on earth. When someone asks you where you are, you must reply, “I’m in the New Jerusalem.” In the New Jerusalem there are no bugs, frogs, scorpions, or serpents. Furthermore, in that city there is no sin, death, or world. There is nothing there except Christ and God’s redeemed and transformed people. If we see this, we shall praise the Lord and shout, “Hallelujah!” </p>
<p data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg0_hWMicIpTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105156" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1:1</span> says, “The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves what must swiftly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave, John.” The revelation of this book is mainly composed of signs, that is, symbols with spiritual significance, such as the seven lampstands signifying the churches and the seven stars signifying the messengers of the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105157" data-verses="Revelation 1:20">1:20</span>). Even the New Jerusalem <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> is a sign, signifying the ultimate consummation of God’s economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105158" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">ch. 21—22</span>). This book, then, is a book of symbols through which the revelation is made known to us. John’s Gospel is a book of signs signifying how Christ came to be our life to produce the church, His Bride. John’s Revelation is also a book of signs showing how Christ is now caring for the church and how He is coming to judge and possess the earth and to bring the church, His Bride, into God’s full economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkNzl9uaDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e">I. A BOOK OF CONCLUSION</h2><p data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyLW0fwn8fuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-"> Revelation is a book of conclusion. If the book of Revelation were deleted from the Bible, there would be a great shortage, for there would be a beginning but no ending. Although there is the beginning in the book of Genesis, without the book of Revelation there is no conclusion or consummation. After having a good start and after passing through so many works, there is the need for God to have a consummation. Without Revelation, there is no conclusion of God’s economy. God is great; He is a God of purpose. For the fulfillment of His purpose, His economy must be accomplished. Many Bible students have neglected the matter of God’s economy. If we did not have Revelation, we could not see the consummation of God’s economy. In fact, we would even find it difficult to realize what God’s economy is, because we would not see the result, the issue of His economy. But in this book the revelation of God’s economy is so clear because it contains the conclusion of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="-m2NLiiFqCHFHE8nxPFGHsCUZvVPVsF0yGcvkTVWCVV_Epm3QfZFd6BUh2KJg6mtY"> Without Revelation, we would also have no conclusion to the redemption of Christ. Christ came in the flesh and died on the cross to accomplish redemption. But what does redemption accomplish? To say that Christ’s redemption only saves sinners and brings them to heaven is a very poor conclusion. This kind of conclusion is not so meaningful. But in Revelation we see that Christ redeemed us, purchasing us with His blood, to make us a kingdom and priests. Hence, this book discloses the conclusion of Christ’s redemption. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlaf_E1uj3XBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_">THE REVELATION OF CHRIST<br/>UNIQUE AND ULTIMATE</h1><p data-content-id="xsF1VTQ6uNmvQ0gsEZfYs9IbLQYTBSFzV_mWIqnjliKoXml2ZS6zTzBkq4NzheEv5"> In this message we come to the revelation of Christ. In their reading of the book of Revelation not many Christians have paid their full attention to the revelation of Christ contained in it. This term, <em>the revelation of Jesus Christ,</em> is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105236" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">1:1</span>, and Bible students have held different opinions of its interpretation. Some say that this term means that the book of Revelation is a book given by Christ as a revelation. This interpretation, which makes the revelation of Christ very objective, is not accurate. If we read the whole book of Revelation, we shall see that this term indicates that Revelation is the unveiling of Christ Himself. It is a picture, a depiction, of Christ, not merely a revelation given by Christ. We must see that Christ is the center, the focus, and the predominant figure of the whole book of Revelation. Thus, we must take the term <em>the revelation of Jesus Christ</em> in a subjective way. It is not merely a revelation given by Christ, but a revelation which unveils Christ to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5cA8BC8Jn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> Christ is revealed in the prophecies, types, and clear words of the Old Testament. In a sense, we do not need the New Testament, for if we read the Old Testament, paying close attention to the prophecies, types, and clear words regarding Christ, we shall have a revelation of Christ. Through these revelations, we can visualize what kind of Christ is Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, however perfect are the revelations of Christ in the Old Testament, they are not complete. Hence, we must come to the New Testament which fully is a revelation of Christ. If we merely read the Gospels, <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> the Acts, and the Epistles, we shall see many aspects of Christ, but we shall not see the aspects covered in the book of Revelation. In this message we must see the unique and particular aspects of Christ’s revelation contained in this book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfNIBGTZtc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ">I. CHRIST IN HIS ASCENSION</h2><p data-content-id="QpDUAnrDI_WRFtrr3f3Kzh9t8afECCS3lhyUHZa2seNBxZHOZbMQUNSElYwe-H2bi"> In the book of Revelation, Christ is revealed as the ascended One (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105237" data-verses="Revelation 5:3-6">5:3-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105238" data-verses="Revelation 5:8-14">8-14</span>). In the four Gospels we see Christ incarnated, living on earth, crucified, and resurrected. However, we do not see very much concerning Christ in His ascension. Even in the Epistles we see little of Christ’s ascension. Although the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles say something regarding Christ’s ascension, in none of these books do we find a clear picture of the scene or state in the heavens after Christ’s ascension. If we would see this picture, we must come to the book of Revelation where we have a portrait of Christ in the heavens after His ascension. In this book we have a full and clear picture of the very Christ who has ascended into the heavens. Furthermore, in this picture we see the scene, the sight, the state in the heavens after Christ’s ascension. Only when we see this revelation will we worship Him in an adequate way. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTK0jn-ldhh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj">A. The Lion-Lamb</h2><p data-content-id="lNulM8LrKW8XhGNjyhb8z8_RABxcnWRrAM_UAfWfx_DwAjiko112RRWMunPS7zWYR"> In His ascension, Christ is the Lion-Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105239" data-verses="Revelation 5:5-6">5:5-6</span>). In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist declared, “Behold, the Lamb of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105240" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). But in the scene in the heavens after Christ’s ascension, Christ is revealed mainly as the Lion, not as the Lamb. While John was weeping because “no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105241" data-verses="Revelation 5:4">Rev. 5:4</span>), one of the elders said to him, “Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105242" data-verses="Revelation 5:5">5:5</span>). Before the crucifixion, there might have been reason for John to weep. But it was foolish for him to weep after the ascension. Are you weeping today? If you are still weeping, it means that you have not seen the vision of the ascended Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105243" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span>. You need to behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105244" data-verses="Genesis 49:8-9">Genesis 49:8 and 9</span> prophesy concerning Christ as the Lion of Judah, and only in Revelation are we told that Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome and is worthy to open the seals of God’s economy. After John heard this declaration from one of the elders, he saw “in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105245" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">5:6</span>). He saw the Lion as the Lamb. Is Christ the Lion or the Lamb? He is both. Hence, we may call Him the Lion-Lamb. </p>
<p data-content-id="GYIVpUWkuZmHSrN-tf6YUfoxq7P6wp2-OL81T49tkhetZaHINSoSt6T3Ue9-usg-C"> Why is Christ both the Lion and the Lamb? Because we have two main problems—sin and Satan. Most Christians only take care of the sin problem and forget the Satan problem. Do not think that your husband is so difficult. Do not blame him, but blame Satan who is behind him. Likewise, every wife is good. The bad things which come out of our wives do not actually issue from them but from Satan who is behind them. The Lamb is versus sin and solves the problem of sin, and the Lion deals with Satan. As the Lamb, Christ has accomplished redemption, having washed us from our sins. As the Lion, He has dealt with Satan. He is adequate to meet our needs and to solve our problems. Now sin is over, Satan has been terminated, and we have been redeemed and rescued from the usurping hand of the enemy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3Kaa1LUUAHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG">B. The Worthy One</h2><p data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KmA6m3MQpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S"> Our Savior is the Lamb as well as the Lion. We have a Lion-Lamb Savior. This One is worthy to open the scroll. Apart from Him, no one in the universe is worthy to open the secret, the mystery, of God’s economy. But the Lion-Lamb is worthy because He has accomplished redemption and has won the victory over Satan. Whenever we Christians have said that Christ was worthy, our thought was that He was worthy of our praises and thanks and worship. When we said, “Lord Jesus, You are worthy,” not many of us realized that He was worthy to open the seals of the secret of God’s economy. We only had the concept that Christ was worthy <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> to receive worship, praise, and thanks from us, His little creatures. But this is an inadequate concept of the Lord’s worthiness. Yet most hymns on the worthiness of Christ express this inadequate concept of His worthiness. Not many hymns praise Christ for being worthy to open the secret of God’s economy. This aspect of the Lord’s worthiness is universal and immeasurable. Of course, Christ is worthy of our praises. He is even worthy of our lives. Nevertheless, we must realize that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105246" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span>, Christ’s worthiness is a matter of His being worthy to open the secret of God’s economy. The universe is a mystery which the scientists cannot unravel. They simply do not know the meaning or the purpose of the universe, because it is a secret kept from them. But Christ is worthy to open this secret for He is worthy to open the seals of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="EquHWEovemLQ65DjOF9kgzpp6sCOE2OsiQtpIkUhAc0HmLnNxgDapPV_nZlY4Z7aR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105247" data-verses="Revelation 5:5">Revelation 5:5</span> says that the Lion is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals. A scroll is a roll of parchment paper or other material. Because a scroll is rolled up, it is difficult to determine just how long it is. The scroll in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105248" data-verses="Revelation 5:1">Revelation 5</span> is eternally long. Only Christ is worthy to open this eternally-long scroll. Do not think that you have seen everything contained in this scroll. No, we shall need eternity to see all that is included in it. When we are in the New Jerusalem, we shall still be reading the contents of the scroll. For eternity we shall say, “Now I see something more.” God will give us an eternal surprise. The surprise of the opening of the scroll will last for eternity. When you are in eternity, you may say, “The Lord’s surprise is eternal. Although we are now in eternity, we still cannot see the end.” Christ is worthy to open this scroll of God’s mystery. </p>

The angels are represented by the twenty-four elders, and all the other creatures are represented by the four living creatures. The angels have elders, the twenty-four angelic <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> elders who take the lead to worship Christ. Here in this picture we see the twenty-four elders praising and all the angels praising, the four living creatures praising and all the other creatures praising. Together they render universal worship to God and the Lamb. The Christ in whom we believe is such a universal Christ. </p>

In other words, this book is concerned with Christ and the church. In Revelation, Christ and the church are revealed in a unique and particular way. In the last message we pointed out that many aspects of Christ which are not found in other books in the Bible are unveiled in Revelation. The same is true with the church. The book of Revelation unfolds the church in a very particular way. In this message we shall present a summary of the aspects of the church found in Revelation, while in later messages we shall cover the details. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cgfMaJYFAO1mOpI22kRdhJ3KaalLQGwHK7fr4_AyvD4ITdSSCh7v-cnqPDc7CCaPG">I. THE LAMPSTANDS</h2><p data-content-id="Yf-rmGLmzs8DVJKAZqsHcn6KmAqmweQpwCL8YYxWWYsYffHyYsR_Jf62ch9moi03S"> Firstly, in Revelation the churches are unveiled as being the lampstands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105297" data-verses="Revelation 1:11-20">1:11-20</span>). In no other New Testament book is this term used with respect to the church. In other books we are told that the church is the gathering of God’s chosen ones, that it is the Body of Christ, and that it is the house of God. But apart from Revelation, we are not told that the church is the lampstand. As the lampstands, the churches shine in the darkness. The word <em>lampstand</em> enables us to understand much about the church and its function. The church is not the lamp; it is the lampstand, the stand which holds the lamp. Without the lamp, the lampstand is vain and means nothing. But the lampstand holds the shining lamp. As we saw in the preceding message, God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105298" data-verses="Revelation 21:23">21:23</span>). Thus, Christ is the lamp, and the church is the lampstand holding the lamp. God is in <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> Christ and Christ as the lamp is held by the stand to shine out God’s glory. This is the testimony of the church. </p>

To say this is absolutely scriptural, for the book of Revelation says that the local churches are golden lampstands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105299" data-verses="Revelation 1:20">1:20</span>). These stands are not built of clay, wood, or any inferior substance; they are constructed out of pure gold. This means that all the local churches must be divine. Without divinity, there can be no church. Although the church is composed of humanity with divinity, humanity should not be the basic nature of the local churches. The basic nature of the local churches must be divinity, God’s divine nature. By these two simple words—<em>golden lampstands</em>—we realize a great deal about the church: that the church is something shining with Christ and that it is constituted with the divine nature. </p>

If there were no darkness, there would be no need for the shining of the light of the lamp. The shining of the lamp is quite particular. In order for the lamp to shine, it must have oil burning within it. If the oil burns within the lamp, the light will shine out through all the darkness. This is the function of the church. The function of the church is not simply to preach or to teach doctrine. In the dark night of this age, the church must shine out the very glory of God. This is the testimony of the church. </p>

Many Christians, having taken in a mistaken concept, desire to be different from other Christians. When I came to this <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> country fourteen years ago, I met some dear Christians who were troubled because the local churches were all the same. They told me that they would try their best to be different. This is not right. Everyone has a head, two shoulders, two arms, two hands, and ten fingers, and every human head has seven holes: two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, and a mouth. It is ridiculous to say, “I don’t want to have the same appearance as others. In order to be different, I would like to have five holes in my head.” How ridiculous this is! Those who claim that every local church should be unique base their concept upon the differences among the seven churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105300" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span>. Some have said, “Look! All the seven churches are different.” In the early years, when I was very young, I was influenced by this concept and I taught the same thing. But one day the light dawned upon me and I saw that all the differences in the local churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105301" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span> are negative, not positive. Ephesus lost her first love—negative; Pergamos is worldly—negative; Thyatira is demonic—negative; and Laodicea became lukewarm—negative. On the positive side, however, all the local churches are identical, because they all are seven golden lampstands. If you could place all the seven lampstands on a table before you, unless you numbered or labeled them, you would be unable to tell them apart. All the seven lampstands are the same. </p>
<p data-content-id="ITBVDgsapCA5h0Ba51FA5D5vk46u_xKmvrF7YxN5-1GluETQyeBTiS_tmIqIxEe99"> Nevertheless, since 1962, some voices in this country have declared loudly that they will never be like the church in Los Angeles. Where are those voices today? They have faded away, and all the peculiar concepts they advocated have failed. I am not saying that all must follow the church in Los Angeles. But if Los Angeles has seven “holes,” then it would be ridiculous for others to insist upon having five “holes.” On the positive side, all the local churches must be identical. On the negative side, however, they are different. If the church in Los Angeles would worship idols, then we must refuse to follow them. In matters such as this, we must be different. But it is wrong to say that, on the positive side, the local churches should not be the same. We should not <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> try to make ourselves peculiar or different—this is pride. One day the Lord showed me that the four sides of the New Jerusalem are exactly the same. Each side of the wall is built with the same material—jasper. It is not that one side is built with jasper and the other sides with brass. No, all four sides are the same. Likewise, universally, all the churches must be the same. They need not be the same in organization, but they must be identical in appearance. For example, the churches in New Zealand should be the same as the churches in Japan. Because we all are one church, all the churches on earth should be universally the same. Locally, we are the churches; universally, we are the church. This is the testimony of Jesus. </p>

According to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105303" data-verses="Revelation 7:1">chapter seven</span>, this great multitude is the whole Body of God’s redeemed ones, having been redeemed “out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105304" data-verses="Revelation 7:9">7:9</span>). All of them have passed through tribulation. This indicates that at no time nor at any place is there a church which has not passed through tribulation. The world always persecutes the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105305" data-verses="John 16:33">John 16:33</span>). Wherever the church is, there will always be a certain amount of persecution. That the whole Body of the redeemed ones will pass through tribulation is indicated by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105306" data-verses="Revelation 7:14">7:14</span>, which says, “These are those who come out of the great tribulation.” This great multitude has come out of tribulation in a victorious way, for they all hold palm branches which signify their victory over tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105307" data-verses="Revelation 7:9">7:9</span>). Eventually, in eternity, they will be overshadowed by God with His tabernacle. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105308" data-verses="Revelation 7:15">7:15</span> says, “He who sits upon the throne shall spread His tabernacle over them.” This is the destiny of God’s redeemed ones.

In eternity, their state will be that of enjoying God’s overshadowing and Christ’s shepherding. This is our destiny. This portion of the Word reveals that while Christ is executing God’s judgment upon mankind, He will take care of God’s redeemed ones. All God’s redeemed ones eventually will be raptured to the throne of God and will stand there enjoying God’s overshadowing and the Lamb’s shepherding. </p>

In the book of Revelation we have the ultimate and complete revelation of who God is. God is triune. We all are familiar with the term <em>the Triune God.</em> This is a great matter in God’s revelation. Throughout the centuries, however, most Christians have not fully realized the meaning of the term <em>the Triune God.</em> In the book of Revelation, the book which reveals things in an ultimate way, we see something deeper, higher, richer, and sweeter concerning the Triune God. We have seen that in Revelation, the revelation of Christ and the testimony of Jesus are ultimate. In this message, we need to see that here the revelation of the Triune God is also ultimate. </p>

Jesus Christ, who is to God “the faithful Witness,” to the church “the Firstborn of the dead,” and to the world “the Ruler of the kings of the earth,” is God the Son. This is the Triune God. As God the eternal Father, He was in the past, He is in the present, and He is coming in the future. As God the Spirit, He is the sevenfold, intensified Spirit for God’s operation. As God the Son, He is “the Witness,” the testimony, the expression of God; “the Firstborn of the dead” for the church, the new creation; and “the Ruler of the kings of the earth” for the world. From such <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> a Triune God, grace and peace are imparted into the churches. </p>

In the Hebrew language, the title God means the mighty One, the One who is powerful. But in Revelation we see that God is not only mighty, but Almighty. He is powerful in every way, in every aspect, in everything, and with everyone. God’s title means that He is the Almighty One. </p>

We may say that He is the landlord of the whole universe. He is the Ruler, the authority, in this universe. What we or others say means nothing. But what God says means everything because He is the Lord. When He says, “Yes,” it means yes, and when He says, “No,” it means no. God is not only the Lord, the owner, and the authority; He is also the Master. The whole universe, including the angels and all human beings, is under Him. We have a Master who possesses us. Before I was saved, I did not know to whom I belonged. But now I can shout, “God is my Master, the One who possesses me. Hallelujah, He is my Lord!” </p>

His title, I Am, not only indicates that He exists but that, in a positive sense, He is everything. He is life, light, and every other positive thing. Do you need life? God is life. Do you want light? God is light. Do you desire holiness? God is holiness. God exists from eternity to eternity and He is everything. This is our God. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105345" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> the sequence of the Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105346" data-verses="Revelation 1:4-5">1:4 and 5</span> the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit’s speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105347" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">2:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105348" data-verses="Revelation 2:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105349" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105350" data-verses="Revelation 2:29">29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105351" data-verses="Revelation 3:6">3:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105352" data-verses="Revelation 3:13">13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105353" data-verses="Revelation 3:22">22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105354" data-verses="Revelation 14:13">14:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105355" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">22:17</span>.

It is because in this book the age has been changed from the Son to the Spirit. In the book of Revelation, the age is the age of the Spirit, and in this age the Spirit has been intensified. </p>
<p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAGQuo-K6xc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> Because the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105356" data-verses="Revelation 1:4">1:4</span> is the intensified Spirit of God, He is called the seven Spirits. The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105357" data-verses="Revelation 1:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span>. We cannot understand the Bible according to our natural, limited mentality. According to our concept, the words <em>seven Spirits</em> denote seven individual spirits. But this is not the meaning. The number seven here does not refer to seven different spirits but to one sevenfold Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAumR22xHv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> Seven is the number of completion in God’s dispensational move, while twelve is the number of completion in God’s eternal administration. For example, God created the earth in six days plus one Sabbath day. Furthermore, there are seven dispensations in the Bible. For God’s move today, the church has the number seven. In the book of Revelation the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are all for God’s dispensational move. Thus, the sevenfold Spirit is the intensified Spirit in God’s move today. He is the seven Spirits of God for God’s move. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAGQ-o_YKxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5">THE COMING AGAIN OF CHRIST</h1><p data-content-id="nvHEdQi38H-SlLL6P9OfVCFAumB2wjHv2jZt6ZG6aLbP35LOw849ym4uqoStVA0ft"> Most Christians hold the concept that the book of Revelation is a book of Christ’s second coming. It is absolutely correct to hold this concept because Revelation does cover the second coming of Christ. However, throughout the years, Christians have not been clear about the Lord’s second coming. Due to this lack of clarity, there has been much disputing and wrangling about it. The revelation regarding Christ’s second coming is not simple; rather, it is quite complicated and has several aspects. Therefore, it has been difficult for most Christians to understand thoroughly the Lord’s coming again. </p>
<p data-content-id="6gUudY5_FgkP0IWCRfIYS9bkpiAOoC5MuZnMLKGfCY9m8DxWQTymsdYcJHe9YM_1B"> During the past century and a half, many books have been written, especially by the Brethren, about the second coming of Christ. Some of the leading teachers among the Brethren held different opinions about the Lord’s coming back, and the first division between them was the result of these different opinions. The so-called Brethren testimony was raised up in 1828 or 29 under the leadership of John Nelson Darby. Darby taught that Christ would come back before the great tribulation, while Benjamin Newton, another leading teacher, said that Christ would come back after the tribulation. Because these two great teachers held different opinions, there were many debates about this matter. Eventually, this brought about the first division among the so-called Brethren between those under the leadership of Darby and those under the leadership of Newton. I was associated with the Benjamin Newton group for seven and a half years during which time I learned all their teachings. They certainly had a strong ground for saying that the second coming of Christ would be after the great tribulation. If you <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> read the best writings of all the great teachers during the past one hundred fifty years, you will find that some taught that Christ’s coming would be before the tribulation and others taught that it would follow the tribulation. </p>
<p data-content-id="RcLtLXvO2x49e5HSqeDCRKXOyVMf32QDyI7Yq7O3GLi69XubFEtTV_iN6b9MI_Z-a"> During the past century, the Lord raised up some careful students of the Word, such as G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton. These men discovered that Christ’s second coming is not a simple matter. They saw that, on the one hand, Christ will come back after the tribulation, but that, on the other hand, He will also come back before the tribulation. These careful students of the Bible have supplied strong proof to substantiate the correctness of this view. Christ’s coming back has at least two aspects—one before the tribulation and the other after the tribulation. Furthermore, these students of the Word also learned that the rapture of the saints will be of more than two categories. This means that some saints will be raptured before the tribulation and others after the tribulation. Do not react to such statements too hastily. I reacted that way when I was young, but eventually I was subdued and convinced. The Bible is not as simple as some think it is. </p>
<p data-content-id="sgITvoUbLp9kr7so-lifik0UHiic53maWiA8xIiSnO6y-U0RpWzmI90zjb8ycRLz9"> In this message, we shall consider the subject of Christ’s coming again. We thank God for all the teachers of the Word who have gone before us. We are grateful to them, and whatever we see, we see as those who are standing upon their shoulders. If we would understand the second coming of Christ, we must study the Bible and also read the books written by these great teachers. Then we shall be able to have a comprehensive view of the matter. If we do this, we shall be fully convinced that Christ’s coming has two aspects: the secret, private aspect and the open, public aspect. </p>

<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fElkfIjoMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> In both Matthew and Revelation we see the secret aspect of Christ’s coming again. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105405" data-verses="Revelation 3:3">Revelation 3:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105406" data-verses="Revelation 16:15">16:15</span> both tell us that Christ will come as a thief and that we should be <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> watchful. No thief comes openly or announces his coming. As we pointed out in a previous message, when the Lord comes as a thief, He will come to steal the precious things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105407" data-verses="Matthew 24:40-41">Matthew 24:40 and 41</span>, the Lord spoke of His secret coming, saying, “Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.” The Lord Jesus was very wise, using two brothers in the field and two sisters grinding at the mill as illustrations. Apparently the two brothers are the same and the two sisters are the same. But suddenly one of the brothers and one of the sisters are taken. After giving this illustration, the Lord said, “Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes. But know this, that if the householder knew in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore, you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105408" data-verses="Matthew 24:42-44">vv. 42-44</span>). As we are working, having no consciousness that Christ is coming, some of us will be raptured. Since He is coming as a thief, we must be watchful. </p>

The Time—Unknown</h2><p data-content-id="by2v23Nedf13WGfghX9I29Vrsw1_sSRCOuCyECvjxyFHKSsKwXMqeaZkYrTMh3eTi"> The time of the Lord’s secret coming is unknown (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105409" data-verses="Revelation 3:3">3:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105410" data-verses="Matthew 24:36">Matt. 24:36</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105411" data-verses="Matthew 24:42">42</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105412" data-verses="Matthew 25:13">25:13</span>). When Christ comes again, He will come as a Sent One. Because of this, in Revelation He is called the Angel, One who is sent by God. In His second coming, as in His first, Christ will come as One who has been sent by God. This is the reason that only the Father knows the time of Christ’s secret coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105413" data-verses="Matthew 24:36">Matt. 24:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105414" data-verses="Mark 13:32">Mark 13:32</span>). The Father is the Sender and the Son is the Sent One. Only the Sender, not even the Sent One, knows the time. </p>
<p data-content-id="qFT3je7o6rEOFRguDp8CG0dTmpKY7Mbv-CuesvcrtybeUNGaiOI26ePMHk72T6-ua"> Some people, seeming to know more than the Lord Jesus, have predicted the time of the Lord’s coming. During the past century and a half, there have been many predictions, none of which has been fulfilled. Some predicted that the Lord Jesus would come on a certain date and charged people to prepare themselves by taking a bath and by putting on <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> clean, white clothing. Others have climbed to a mountaintop to await the Lord’s coming back. After World War I, many teachers published books about prophecy, especially concerning the Lord’s coming back. Some of these writers also predicted the time of the Lord’s coming. All these predictions about the time of the Lord’s coming have been proved false. Be careful not to predict anything. According to the Bible, the time of the Lord’s secret coming is unknown. </p>

The Place—in the Cloud to the Air</h2><p data-content-id="8xVo-B7NrMY0kPDgZqBD43ILJr7-R8mwuq3Joqe2LOC9AD1rboXiIgCBQAwKW-c3U"> The place of the Lord’s secret coming will be in the cloud to the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105415" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">10:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105416" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:17">1 Thes. 4:17</span>). The cloud is related to the Lord’s coming back. Christ went to heaven on a cloud, and He will come back to earth in the same way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105417" data-verses="Acts 1:9">Acts 1:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105418" data-verses="Acts 1:11">11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105419" data-verses="Matthew 26:64">Matt. 26:64</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105420" data-verses="Revelation 14:14">Rev. 14:14</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105421" data-verses="Matthew 26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>, the Lord Jesus said to the high priest, “Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” Even with the Lord’s coming in the cloud there are two aspects. Firstly, the Lord will come in the cloud. This means that He will be concealed by the cloud. Secondly, He will come upon the cloud. When He comes in the cloud, He will not come to the earth but to the air. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105422" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">Revelation 10:1</span> reveals that the Lord will come down out of heaven clothed with a cloud, indicating that He will be wrapped up with the cloud. Do not think that He will suddenly descend from the heavens to the earth. Christ is now on the throne in the third heaven. When the proper time comes, the Father will send Him from the throne in the heavens to the cloud in the air. As we shall see in later messages, before He leaves the throne in the heavens, some overcomers will have been raptured to the throne. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105423" data-verses="Revelation 12:1">Revelation 12</span> shows that the man-child will be raptured, not to the air but to the throne of God. This indicates that some overcomers will have been raptured even before the time of the secret coming of the Lord Jesus. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105424" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> we see the firstfruits on Mount Zion in the heavens. Mount Zion in the heavens is where God is in the third heaven; it is not in the air. That the firstfruits will be on Mount Zion <span class="pg" data-page-id="55" id="55">[55]</span> in the heavens proves that some of the early overcomers will be raptured to the third heaven before Christ’s secret coming. After these early overcomers have been raptured, Christ will descend from the throne to the air in the cloud secretly. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="FrpbcRt3yRk0Uxjm1URW7Eg0_gmMgO4pTrxPj1VjX3CdPg4WUZDe1ebWLRh8zhLuo">JOINT PARTAKER<br/>IN THE TRIBULATION, KINGDOM,<br/>AND ENDURANCE IN JESUS</h1><p data-content-id="Cs3ONxeMth5mwllbyYf4lOgkNyV9rIDV8RSd8O8Hqv0o7uTpEdoOJ6dbZT0nyJr-e"> In this message we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105480" data-verses="Revelation 1:9">1:9</span>, which says, “I John, your brother and joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.” The book of Revelation is composed in a marvelous way. It is quite significant that this verse comes shortly after the mention of the Lord’s coming in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105481" data-verses="Revelation 1:7">1:7</span>. This indicates that if we would be those who are watchfully waiting for the Lord’s coming back, we must be those who are joint partakers, not in outward blessing, but in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="P8jMkwpkLdBOj0p4O-2xBwjyLXEf01sfuCHBwhorQzQcIaMpTU1ljj4-xfrJokpi-">I. JOINT PARTAKER<br/>IN THE TRIBULATION IN JESUS</h2><p data-content-id="-m2NLiiFqCHFHE8nxPFGHsCUZulPS_l0yGcvkTVWCVV_Epm3QfZFd6BUh2KJg6mtY"> The phrase <em>in Jesus</em> governs the words <em>tribulation, kingdom,</em> and <em>endurance,</em> and we must pay close attention to it. This phrase very rarely occurs in the New Testament. The phrase <em>in Christ</em> or <em>in Christ Jesus,</em> on the contrary, is used many times. In the New Testament, the truth is mainly in Christ, but here the phrase <em>in Jesus</em> is employed. This tells us that if we would be those who are waiting for the Lord’s coming back, we must be those who are joint partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance “in Jesus.” When we talk about salvation, grace, enjoyment, and all the other good things, we say that we are “in Christ,” for this phrase refers to everything on the positive side of God’s salvation. But to say that we are partakers of the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus means that we are suffering. When Jesus lived on earth as a man, He suffered constantly. <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> According to the facts of His life, His name, Jesus, denotes a suffering person, a man of sorrows (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105482" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3">Isa. 53:3</span>). Hence, when we say that we are in Christ, this means that we are saved, are enjoying God’s grace, have peace with God, and are under God’s blessing. But when we say that we are joint partakers of the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance “in Jesus,” this means that we are suffering and are being persecuted as we follow Jesus the Nazarene. In the book of Revelation, the <em>in Christ</em> is not used. In Ephesians, on the contrary, the term <em>in Christ</em> or <em>in Him</em> is used repeatedly, being found in every chapter of that epistle. The book of Revelation is for those who are suffering tribulation “in Jesus.” This means that those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus must be people who suffer tribulation in Jesus. In other words, those who wait for the Lord’s coming back are the suffering ones. In the eyes of God, we are the followers of Christ, but in the eyes of people, especially religion, we are the followers of Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="p1fZ6JpTsfZKO6kKI7TE51_R4WL9jFaPuaeKh7AA1i31cpyLjD9mnBPgq5VXps5uw">A. Jesus Having Suffered Persecution<br/>While He Was on Earth</h2><p data-content-id="vbXPF1aOezXsRbYDI4kOl4ymJJftHprWiEJdW-6x4LFeEqntgYHUHzSWjNe82P6MP"> While Jesus was on earth, He was persecuted by the Jewish religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105483" data-verses="John 5:16">John 5:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105484" data-verses="John 15:20">15:20</span>). He was not persecuted by a heathen, pagan religion, but by the typical religion formed according to God’s oracles. Religion is greatly utilized by God’s enemy. Religion is versus Christ, and Christ is versus religion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105485" data-verses="John 5:16">John 5:16</span> reveals that the Jews persecuted Jesus because He broke their Sabbath. Religious people cannot tolerate the breaking of their regulations. Any violation of their religious regulations will stir up persecution against the violators. The Jewish religion was established on three pillars, one of which was the Sabbath; the other two are circumcision and dietary regulations. When Jesus broke the Sabbath, He tore down one of the three pillars of the Jewish religion. Hence, they persecuted Him and even sought to kill Him. Eventually, religion succeeded and actually killed the Lord Jesus, sentencing Him to death according to their Scriptures. However, under the sovereignty of God, the Jews <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> at that time did not have the right to kill anyone. Thus, they delivered Jesus over to the Roman government and the Roman government, using its method of executing criminals, crucified the Lord Jesus on the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="Wg7ThGFRgCC6wAt8IVPuOma0L40vKK0qES7VfaycMTRB5rcUso_47aspsnn4s6CTX"> Just as religion persecuted Jesus, it will also persecute the followers of Jesus. We know from the book of Acts that the Jews in the synagogues in every city stirred up opposition against the apostles, and Paul suffered this type of persecution very much. John, the writer of the book of Revelation, also underwent this kind of persecution. When John received the revelation of this book, he was on the island of Patmos, having been exiled there for “the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.” In writing the book, he was encouraging the saints to wait for the Lord’s coming back, telling them that he was their brother and joint partaker, not in grace, life, peace, and light, but in the suffering, the affliction, in Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="1bH1BoKDaRAJxyi_xbCD4VJbThzC27bryd7u8eD4YJle8aJWRrCBJAh3feyA9YqSH"> As we have seen, when Jesus was on earth, He suffered at the hands of religion. The Roman Empire paid very little attention to Him. It was the Jewish religion that asked the Roman government to execute judgment upon Him. Thus, the persecution against Him did not originate with the secular world but with the religious world. In the book of Acts we see that it was the same with the apostles. The opposition did not come mainly from the Gentiles but from the Jewish religion. The Jews followed Paul wherever he went, perhaps even picketing him. In like manner, a great many martyrs suffered persecution by the so-called Roman Catholic Church. As Foxe points out in his history of martyrs, the Roman Catholic Church killed more saints than the Roman Empire did. Who imprisoned Madame Guyon? The Roman Catholic Church. Who imprisoned John Bunyan? The Church of England. Religion always persecutes the genuine followers of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="9rVdP9OOQSCrvWwNpNEghXtIRf_MUbnsp2Q1i322XjDbKlbCI5SwCkdRWdaVi_g0k"> Now it is our turn to undergo this persecution. During the years I was with Brother Nee in China, I saw how much he was persecuted by religion. The rumors, opposition, and condemnation came, not from the Gentiles, but from <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> Christianity, even from some missionaries. The Devil is subtle. The secular world does not oppose us as much as the so-called religious people do. Many Christians think of religion as a good thing, but actually it is something used by the Devil. If you read the book of Galatians, you will see how intensely Paul persecuted the church when he was in the Jewish religion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105486" data-verses="Galatians 1:1">Galatians 1</span> reveals that religion is against Christ and that Christ is versus religion. If we cooperate with religion, there will be a type of compromising peace. But how can we go along with religion? It is so subtle and false; it is a counterfeit of God’s economy. Anyone who sees that religion is a counterfeit of God’s economy will condemn it. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="jA4s3Ofm8UagYZF7i1Vjw0XMrL2abysDNDcRyxqadYigZpP5BmO3xTrtY6N7RJdCR">B. Jesus Now Suffering Persecution<br/>with His Followers</h2><p data-content-id="Te69zzil3D0-mAl8PfN896MAGQOo9Kaxc7b0VET_-Yefo8dz0ktoThHUcteAt6Rr5"> Because we do not cooperate with religion, it persecutes us. The persecution that we are suffering today is the persecution in Jesus. He is now suffering persecution with His followers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105487" data-verses="Acts 9:4-5">Acts 9:4-5</span>). As we are suffering today, He is suffering in and with us. When Saul of Tarsus was traveling to Damascus with the intention of arresting all those who called on the name of Jesus, the Lord Jesus knocked him down to the earth, saying, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105488" data-verses="Acts 9:4">v. 4</span>). When Saul said, “Who are You, Lord?” Jesus answered, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105489" data-verses="Acts 9:5">v. 5</span>). Saul never thought that he was persecuting Jesus. He thought Jesus was in the grave and that he was persecuting Stephen and other followers of Jesus. But according to the Lord Jesus, Saul was persecuting Him, because, at that time, He was in Stephen, Peter, John, and all His other members and was one with them. The same is true today. When the religious people persecute us, they are actually persecuting Jesus because Jesus is in us and is one with us. We may be comforted to realize that the suffering we are experiencing is the persecution in Jesus. We are joint partakers of tribulation in Jesus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> </p>

Now, as His followers, we must bear His reproach, suffering reproach from religion. This is to be a joint partaker of tribulation in Jesus. </p>

Apparently, the various points included in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105512" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">chapter one</span> are unrelated to each other. But if we approach them from the viewpoint of our experience, we shall see that they follow one another in a very good sequence. In the last two messages, we covered the matters of the coming again of the Lord Jesus and of our waiting for Him by being joint partakers in His tribulation, kingdom, and endurance. In this message we now come to the local churches. It may seem that this message on the local churches is unrelated to the two foregoing messages. But, according to our experience, we know that these three messages are all interrelated. The coming again of the Lord Jesus requires that some partake of the tribulation, the kingdom, and the endurance in Jesus. The best way to do so is to be in the local churches. Outside of the church, it is difficult for anyone to participate in these three things. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Xi707fcPG3tgdRrB8u8nSWR7_muqQB6y3SAVJIWn_neLMO9oHqhEzON_RcU2wxzw1">I. THE PROGRESS OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br/>IN THE SCRIPTURE</h2><p data-content-id="kJtprzMv-iEybgkzNyzDTDV_E5nZwpPsrUhhtuCMESGHnnFsJwP3wtj5eeGMBki0p"> We shall approach the local churches by the way of considering the progress of the divine revelation in the Scripture. The divine revelation in the Bible begins with God and consummates with the local churches. The first two chapters of Genesis, along with the entire Old Testament, are a revelation of God Himself, and the four Gospels are a revelation of Christ. This fact reveals the progress in the divine revelation from God to Christ. Following the four Gospels, we have the Acts and the Epistles, which mainly are a revelation of Christ as the Spirit. Hence, the revelation of the Spirit is the continuation of the divine revelation in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> Bible. Following this, the church is revealed. Thus, there are four main sections of the divine revelation in the Bible: the section of God, the section of Christ, the section of the Spirit, and the section of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="J-GpZUZ4kVBIvd5R8J1AINvaohEqWRQAjWB7RQPvz7P22_9iz4SIUft-9nE0gzGry"> The Jews have only the first section of this revelation, for the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament cover only the revelation concerning God. Most Christians have more than this, having the Old Testament plus the four Gospels. Although they have the whole Bible, in practicality they have little more than the Old Testament and the Gospels. They may know God as He is revealed in the Old Testament and they may know the stories in the Gospels about Christ, but they know nothing of either the Spirit of life or the church. In the concept of many Christians, the church is a physical building. On Sunday morning, many parents say to their children, “Let’s go to church.” According to their concept, the church is a bungalow, or a cathedral, with a high tower. They know hardly anything of the church as revealed in the Holy Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="zZdlZsx_Xy-tGxScyNm6rM6fElEfBxIMErtkQIYPSIs0hDew6MtdTE2PZ2QGnjo-X"> Thank God that during the past two centuries other Christians have progressed in their knowledge of the Bible, having not only the Old Testament and the Gospels but also the Epistles. These Christians know God, Christ, and the Spirit. Of course, they do not know much about the Spirit of life. They know the Spirit mainly as the Spirit of power for baptism. They know very little of the indwelling Spirit. Although these Christians may know a little concerning the church, they only see the universal church, not the local churches. However, the first three chapters of Revelation are not concerned with the universal church; they are emphatically concerned with the local churches. </p>
<p data-content-id="aW2aGRh_13sA-UYZ1egivQxguAGN9maxrWvBvRqb8eU43xPKWs7vx4JzgzkzVkyZK"> Today, we in the Lord’s recovery have the whole Bible: the Old Testament, the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and the Revelation. I was with the Brethren Assembly for seven and a half years. During that time, we devoted considerable attention to the books of Daniel and Revelation. However, most of what I heard concerning Revelation was about the beasts and the ten horns. I had no impression that in <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> the book of Revelation there were the local churches. I did not even hear much about the New Jerusalem. I was only told that it was a city in heaven with heavenly mansions, that its street was paved with gold, and that its doors were made of pearls. Praise the Lord that today our book of Revelation is not like this! In our book of Revelation, there are the local churches with the Son of Man in the midst, and there is the New Jerusalem with Christ as its centrality and universality. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_noypB0hbJEfWHQeKjQt1I5FLvOnLX4z0lpvsRzPJX5yPZ5jO8HOWpyV1bAQCiwoF">A. Concerning God</h2><p data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlaf-U1sxHXBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_"> Let us now consider the progress of the divine revelation in the Scriptures in more detail. Firstly, God reveals Himself to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105513" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Gen. 1:1</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105514" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> God is revealed as Elohim, a Hebrew word meaning “the mighty One.” The English word God is the translation of the Hebrew word <em>Elohim.</em> Following this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105515" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Genesis 2:7</span> God is revealed as Jehovah, which means, “I am that I am.” God is the great I Am, the ever-existing One. As the ever-existing One, He is the reality of every positive thing. This name, Jehovah, denotes God in His relationship with man. Concerning His creation, God is revealed as Elohim; concerning His relationship with man, He is revealed as Jehovah. Jehovah is the Old Testament form of the name Jesus, and Jesus is the New Testament form of Jehovah. In other words, in the Old Testament Jesus was called Jehovah, and in the New Testament Jehovah is called Jesus. The entire Old Testament, which comprises thirty-nine books, is mainly a revelation of the two divine titles, Elohim and Jehovah. </p>

Concerning Christ</h2><p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5cBsBGuZn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> The second step in the progress of the divine revelation is the revelation concerning Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105516" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matt. 1:1</span>). At a certain time, God was incarnated as a man called Jesus Christ. Thus, following the Old Testament, we have the four Gospels which reveal a wonderful Person named Jesus Christ. The name Jesus mainly means the Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105517" data-verses="Matthew 1:21">Matt. 1:21</span>), and the title Christ mainly means the anointed One (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105518" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">Matt. 16:16</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="76" id="76">[76]</span> Jesus is not only our Savior but also God’s anointed One or, using today’s term, God’s appointed One. God has appointed Him to carry out His eternal economy. He is not only Jesus to save us, but also Christ to carry out God’s eternal plan. </p>
<p data-content-id="dqTRyG6GA884EmjvR4UyOegfNJRGUKNc9pTPOwHALeZwBCUtG7wCY77G5UKUOOnaQ"> In order for Christ to carry out God’s eternal plan, He needs the church. And to produce the church there is the need of two things—redemption and the imparting of life. After redeeming the fallen, created man, Christ had to impart life into the redeemed ones. For this, there is the need of the Spirit of life, the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, following the four Gospels, we have redemption and the imparting of life in the Acts and the Epistles. In these books, the blood of Christ is frequently mentioned. Along with the blood, we have the Spirit. Blood is for redemption, and the Spirit is for the imparting of life. After being redeemed and regenerated, we become the living members of the Body of Christ, the church. As the church, the Body is the means by which Christ carries out God’s eternal economy. By this we see that in God’s economy the church is a very crucial matter. Without it, Christ cannot accomplish anything. If He would carry out God’s eternal plan, He must have the church. </p>

Concerning the Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="KieXqJ7jgoER4UdfBfZNeFTK0i3-sOhh6wo2bjONxSaxFCktk5VChNS7qxKtiNlUj"> God is revealed as Elohim and as Jehovah, and Christ is revealed as Jesus and as Christ. The revelation concerning the Spirit, however, is not simple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105519" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>); rather, it is a mystery. Few Christians have ever fought for the revelation of God, and not many have fought for the revelation of Christ. But when we come to the matter of the Spirit, there is much argument because the revelation of the Spirit is a mystery. The Spirit is mysterious because it is related to life. There are many aspects of the revelation of the Spirit: the Spirit of truth or reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105520" data-verses="John 14:16-17">John 14:16-17</span>), the Spirit of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105521" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>), the Spirit of power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105522" data-verses="Luke 24:49">Luke 24:49</span>), the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105523" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Rom. 8:9</span>), the Spirit of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105524" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Rom. 8:9</span>), the Spirit of Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105525" data-verses="Acts 16:7">Acts 16:7</span>), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105526" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Phil. 1:19</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="77" id="77">[77]</span>), the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105527" data-verses="Acts 5:32">Acts 5:32</span>), and the seven Spirits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105528" data-verses="Revelation 1:4">Rev. 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105529" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105530" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">5:6</span>). </p>

Most of what this book reveals can be traced back to the Old Testament. Nevertheless, all the items found in Revelation have a new significance. For example, the city of Jerusalem, a city with twelve gates, is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105588" data-verses="Ezekiel 48:1">Ezekiel 48</span>, but at the end of Revelation we see the city of Jerusalem in a new way. Because Revelation is a book of conclusion, the fulfillment of the things in the Bible, nearly everything contained in it is presented in a new way. This is true of the lampstands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105589" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">chapter one</span>. The lampstand is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105590" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105591" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span>, but in Revelation it is mentioned in a new way. In this message we must consider the seven lampstands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105592" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="7_7f53lSdKfhS9KELOla9Lykd8-_CW0QZ68G2Q-ukinNeICCXYLfJ8k0uws0cEQC4"> The lampstands are the symbols of the local churches. Although we have seen that the local churches are the testimony of Jesus, it may be somewhat difficult for many to grasp the meaning of this. What does it mean to say that the local churches are the testimony of Jesus? It means that the churches are the lampstands. </p>
<p data-content-id="_noypB0hbJEfWHQeKjQt1I5FLs-nMFYz0lpvsRzPJX5yPZ5jO8HOWpyV1bAQCiwoF"> Throughout the centuries, few Christians have touched the depths of the significance of the lampstand. In this message we must probe into the depths of this matter of the lampstands. Biblical symbols are difficult to comprehend, for we cannot understand a symbol like the lampstand according to our natural concept. According to our natural concept, a lampstand is simply an object holding a lamp that shines in the darkness. The lampstand in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105593" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> is pure gold, and the lampstands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105594" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span> and Revelation also are golden. Substantially, the lampstand is golden. With the <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> lampstand we see three important things: the gold, the stand, and the lamps. The lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God. Gold is the substance with which the lampstand is made, the stand is the embodiment of the gold, and the lamps are the expression of the stand. The gold signifies the Father as the substance, the stand signifies the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the lamps signify the Spirit as the expression of the Father in the Son. Thus, the significance of the Triune God is implied in the lampstand. </p>
<p data-content-id="BM6WPQDgbT__QB93oHAQLnlaf9k1qj3XBIVTiOGoM8gwQ4MS1D6UUKO84G9MHWJh_"> On the walls of Jewish synagogues there is a symbol of the lampstand. Although the Jews have used this symbol for centuries, they do not know its real significance—the significance of the Triune God. Have you ever realized that the lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God? </p>
<p data-content-id="xsF1VTQ6uNmvQ0gsEZfYs9IbLS4TNSFzV_mWIqnjliKoXml2ZS6zTzBkq4NzheEv5"> Substantially, the lampstand is one, but expressively, it is seven because it is one lampstand with seven lamps. At the bottom, the lampstand is one; at the top, it is seven. Should we argue about whether it is one or seven? In substance, the lampstand is one piece of gold, but it holds seven lamps. This mysteriously indicates that substantially the Triune God is one. In substance, He is one, but in expression, He is the seven Spirits. The Father as the substance is embodied in the Son as the form, and the Son is expressed as the seven Spirits. </p>
<p data-content-id="rFrCGjzy0s3seaoP5ZFz1WE5cCcBO8Jn7QPczLYQpR6KGf-mSZlvxLAT6G-4WlYEl"> How can we prove that the seven lamps are the Spirit expressing Christ? The seven lamps are first mentioned in Exodus. If we only had the record in Exodus, however, it would be difficult to realize that these seven lamps are the Spirit. But as we proceed from Exodus to Zechariah, we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of Christ and the seven eyes of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="105595" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zech. 3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105596" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">4:10</span>). As we continue on to Revelation, we see that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven eyes which are the intensified Spirit of God. Hence, we have a strong basis for saying that the seven lamps are the sevenfold intensified Spirit as the expression of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="w61C8Sf0pRjO1CqIL2kXUnSo4spG3UbXzFDh5Au7smcx1nKys-XlikrZOIVeRdjoV"> We have seen that the lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God; it symbolizes the Triune God embodied <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> and expressed. God the Father as the divine gold is embodied in Christ the Son and then is fully expressed through the Spirit. The expression differs from the embodiment. The embodiment must be uniquely one because our God is uniquely one. Thus, the embodiment must be one stand. The expression, however, must be complete, and complete in God’s move. Recall that seven is the number for completion in God’s move. Throughout the centuries, God has been expressed in His move. This is the reason that the seven lamps signify the intensified Spirit as the expression of Christ in God’s complete move. This is the practical understanding of the Trinity. The Trinity is for the dispensing of God into humanity. God, the divine Being, is firstly embodied in Christ and then expressed through the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Now we not only have the Triune God; in the lampstand we have the Triune God substantially and solidly embodied and expressed. The gold has been formed into the solid stand. It once was just gold, but now it is the stand. The gold has been formed into a stand for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Without the stand, there is no way for God’s purpose to be fulfilled. As we have seen, this stand, which is a type of Christ, is expressed through the seven lamps signifying the seven Spirits of God. The seven Spirits of God are not separate from God; they are the seven eyes of God and of the Lamb, the Redeemer. As we shall see, they are also the seven eyes of the building stone. Hence, they are the seven eyes with the redemption of Christ for God’s building. Whenever these eyes look at people, they are redeemed and built into God’s house. This is the Trinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="LT7GHt_97QehEFI0vw7uvsMOpkvI-77JAK6-4yadHVCpNEmCwmz8MPsIjIZIRoY7N"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105597" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exodus 25</span> the emphasis is upon the stand, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105598" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">Zechariah 4</span> the emphasis is upon the lamps, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105599" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> the emphasis is upon the reproduction. In both Exodus and Zechariah, the lampstand is one, but in Revelation it has been reproduced and has become seven. Firstly, in Exodus the emphasis is on the stand—on Christ. Secondly, in Zechariah the emphasis is on the lamps—on the Spirit. Eventually, in Revelation both the stand and the lamps, that is, both Christ and the Spirit, are reproduced as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> churches. In Exodus and Zechariah there are just seven lamps, but here in Revelation there are forty-nine lamps, for every lampstand has seven lamps. Hence, the one lampstand has become seven and the seven lamps have become forty-nine. The lampstands with their lamps in Revelation are the reproduction of Christ and the Spirit. When Christ is realized, He is the Spirit, and when the Spirit is realized, we have the churches as the reproduction. </p>
<p data-content-id="mQZCaUskgKXnWQwz5-GjAk8SvTdCbWcUewFvjwcuYXvkPdWSc6wkDFGa6M3STyygs"> The church is not only universally one but also expressed locally in many cities. In the whole universe there is only one Christ, one Spirit, and one church. Why then are there the seven churches? Because of the need for an expression. For existence, one is sufficient, but for expression, many are needed. If we would know the church, we must know its substance, existence, and expression. Substantially, the church, and even all the churches, are one. In expression, the many churches are the many lampstands. What is the church? The church is the expression of the Triune God, and this expression is seen in many localities on the earth. The church is signified not by just one lampstand—but by seven lampstands. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="105600" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">Revelation 1</span> there are seven lampstands with forty-nine lamps shining in the universe. This is the testimony of Jesus. The church is the testimony of Jesus. This means that the church is the expression of the Triune God substantially and expressively. Substantially, it is of one substance in the whole universe; expressively, it is many lampstands with the lamps shining in the darkness to express the Triune God. The Father as the substance is embodied in the Son, the Son as the embodiment is expressed through the Spirit, the Spirit is fully realized and reproduced as the churches, and the churches are the testimony of Jesus. If we see this vision, it will govern us and we shall never be divisive. This vision will hold us, guard us, and keep us in the testimony of Jesus. </p>
