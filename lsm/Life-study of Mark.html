Mark is not as profound as the Gospel of John, and it does not contain as many teachings as are found in the Gospel of Matthew. Some readers of the New Testament may think of Mark as the “Galilee” of the four Gospels, and some may wonder what good can come out of Galilee. However, the Lord Jesus came from Galilee. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTQHIM0T6m9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t">THE LORD’S MOVE IN GALILEE AND JUDEA</h2><p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxgyGisO2nJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> The Gospel of John is mainly a record of the Lord’s move in Judea and of His profound words spoken there. Mark, on the contrary, is a record mainly of the Lord’s ministry in Galilee. Mark does not record much of the Lord’s move or teaching in Judea. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkoyV26Yz1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> If we would have a history of the Lord’s life and ministry on earth, we need to learn how to put together the Gospels of John and Mark. When these Gospels are put together, we can see the Lord’s move in the regions of Galilee and Judea. Judea was a highly respected province, and the city of Jerusalem was located there. But the province of Galilee was looked down upon and despised. The Lord’s move in Galilee covered a longer period of time than His move in Judea. We need to see that the record in the Gospel of Mark is a record primarily of the Lord’s move not in Judea but in Galilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZUTpVAjg_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> In the first chapter of the Gospel of John we have a record of profound matters related to Christ’s incarnation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64830" data-verses="John 1:1">Verses 1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64831" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span> reveal that in the beginning was the Word, that the Word was with God and was God, and that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64832" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, the disciples also saw the Lord’s glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father. In the first chapter of his Gospel John goes on to say that the law was given through Moses, but grace and reality came through Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64833" data-verses="John 1:17">v. 17</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64834" data-verses="John 1:18">verse 18</span> John says, “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” Furthermore, John tells us that in the Word was life, and the life was the light of men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64835" data-verses="John 1:4">v. 4</span>). All these matters are very profound. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHnffC5tniWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65">THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</h2><p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl8zVj6Jt7DYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> In contrast to the profound matters revealed in the Gospel of John, in Mark’s Gospel we see the Lord as the Slave-Savior. In the Gospel of Mark we do not have the God-Savior, as in John, the King-Savior, as in Matthew, or the Man-Savior, as in Luke. The Gospel of Mark presents a particular aspect of Christ, the aspect of the Slave-Savior. In John we have God; in Matthew, the King; in Luke, the Man; and in Mark, the Slave. We would hardly expect to hear excellent, profound, marvelous things about a slave. There is a sense in which it is not easy to speak on the Gospel of Mark. </p>
<p data-content-id="2biGa_BPHwBMmqGIo_XaCdS4wtrRfcU4sHxDfRZzyMIzlPqgeTUisrY2QHdBIBzZK"> In the Life-study of James we emphasized the contrast between the writings of Paul and the book of James. The writings of Paul are on a much higher level than those of James. Paul’s writings are on a divine level, on God’s level, and reveal the divine dispensing for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose. Therefore, in the Epistles of Paul we have a revelation of the divine economy. The book of James is on a much lower level. Whereas Paul’s writings are on a divine level, the book of James is on a human level and emphasizes practical Christian perfection. In his Epistle James deals with matters of godliness and character. The differences between the Epistle of James and the Epistles of Paul are actually very great. How could we compare something on <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> the human level with something on the divine level? How can we compare practical Christian perfection with the divine economy, or compare living ethically with living Christ? There is no comparison. </p>
<p data-content-id="uamxl0odSMwfSIWjkQFAsdwo-fcQoDK5WNy2WFyi0oYKbOAd76mwgMMv-zAcUryim"> If we would know the meaning of practical Christian perfection, we need to come to the Epistle of James. Concerning Christian perfection, nothing is better than the book of James. Consider, for example, what James says concerning wisdom: “But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, forbearing, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, unfeigned” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64836" data-verses="James 3:17">James 3:17</span>). James also says, “The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64837" data-verses="James 3:18">v. 18</span>). This teaching certainly is much higher than that of Confucius. Concerning Christian perfection and human ethics, the book of James is excellent. In this regard we all need to respect James. Nevertheless, no matter how excellent James’ writing may be regarding Christian perfection, he remains on the human level, and the human level cannot compare to the divine level. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7CbI3GLmdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_"> To a certain extent we may use the contrast of the levels of the writings of Paul and James as an illustration of the contrast between Mark and the other Gospels. How, for instance, can we compare a slave with God? Furthermore, how can we compare a slave with a king? Apparently, the Gospel of Mark is on a much lower level than that of John, Matthew, and Luke. As recorded in John’s Gospel, the Lord says such profound things as “I am the life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64838" data-verses="John 14:6">14:6</span>), “I am the light of the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64839" data-verses="John 8:12">8:12</span>), and “I am the resurrection” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64840" data-verses="John 11:25">11:25</span>). Such words cannot be found in the Gospel of Mark. However, in the Gospel of Mark we have the excellent record of a wonderful Slave. In the Gospel of Mark we have something that cannot be found in John, Matthew, or Luke. </p>
<p data-content-id="IgKBIj9xvn3kVySf6w4lLiQZB-WDTQgX3dkNC5dvPZxfKOYTZm1eWOeBjrXPL5gF0"> The Lord Jesus is wonderful and all-inclusive. Even His name is called Wonderful (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64841" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isa. 9:6</span>). The Lord is wonderful not only in His divinity but also in His humanity. Where do we see a portrait of the humanity of the Lord Jesus? It is correct to say that the Gospel of Luke emphasizes the Lord’s humanity. In his Gospel Luke presents the Lord as a normal <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> man, as a man fully up to standard. With such a man we see human virtue, excellence, and beauty. However, not even all this can compare with the aspect of the Lord’s humanity seen in the Gospel of Mark. In Mark we see a beautiful expression of Christ’s virtues in His humanity. I believe that more of the Lord’s excellent virtues in His humanity are seen in the Gospel of Mark than in the Gospel of Luke. </p>
<p data-content-id="Hfo6mxQWhV9UNGGlyVrbWJzqFlUtfJf1FVddN1W7drZ0yu-2uolKPKUU_XXH9aAsf"> Only one of the four Gospels—the Gospel of John—is on the Lord’s divinity. The other three Gospels, called the synoptic Gospels, are on the Lord’s humanity. The word “synoptic” indicates that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke all have the same view, the view of the Lord’s humanity. In these three Gospels we see different aspects of Christ in His humanity: the Lord’s humanity in being the King (Matthew), the Lord’s humanity in being a man who is up to standard (Luke), and the Lord’s humanity in being a Slave (Mark). </p>
<p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudI94hKeSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> Suppose the President of the United States, after completing his term of office, would serve as a janitor. After being President, he would willingly lower himself to become a janitor to serve others. Would this not be excellent? The excellency of such a man in his presidency could not compare with the excellency in his becoming a janitor. I believe that most citizens would appreciate him more in his being a janitor than in his being a President. With him as a President we would not see as much of the beauty of his humanity. But if he would become a janitor to serve others, we would see the beauty, the virtue, in his humanity. How beautiful for a person, after occupying the high office of President of the United States, to become a janitor! I doubt that any of us would feel comfortable in the presence of a President, but we would all feel comfortable with a janitor. How excellent it would be to see a former President working as a janitor, for we would see in him excellent human virtue! </p>

We have seen that this Gospel portrays the excellency of Christ’s virtues in His humanity as a Slave. The Gospel of John presents Christ as the God-Savior, the Gospel of Matthew presents Him as the King-Savior, and the Gospel of Luke presents Him as the Man-Savior. But the Gospel of Mark presents Christ as the Slave-Savior. Therefore, the subject of this Gospel is the Slave of God as the Slave-Savior of sinners. First we shall see the Lord as a Slave of God and then as the Slave-Savior of sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64883" data-verses="Mark 10:45">10:45</span>). </p>

The Lord was raised in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth and in the despised province of Galilee. This was the fulfillment of the dry ground in Isaiah. </p>
<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GR7W6m3eMeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> The Lord had no form or comeliness, no physical beauty, that He should be desired.

The word “marred” is a strong word and indicates that the Lord’s visage was somewhat damaged or disfigured. </p>
<p data-content-id="URtKIt0L_s2x9jmmhGPxz1xxo9XCdhKgCltl2BQUyoJ1J6-naGmt6MTZtNA2Ufk2K"> Many years ago a certain artist painted a portrait in which the Lord is depicted as a handsome man. That portrayal is altogether false. Nevertheless, a great many Christians have a copy of that portrait in their homes. While I was traveling in central China in 1936 doing the work of preaching the gospel, I encountered a case of demon possession related to this picture. A young woman had become demon possessed, and those who were trying to help her referred the case to me. I told them that, for the most part, demon possession is due to the worship of idols, and I asked if there were any idols in her home. They told me that there were no idols. However, there was a copy of that well-known picture of Jesus. I told them that the picture was an idol and that they should take it down and burn it. After the portrait <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> was burned, the demon left that young woman. To have such a picture of Jesus is altogether contrary to the Scriptures. My purpose in relating this story is to point out this fact. According to the Bible, the Lord Jesus did not have a handsome face. Rather, His visage was marred, disfigured. </p>

In Hebrew the phrase “a servant of rulers” means one held in thrall by tyrants. The Lord was a Slave kept in thrall, in slavery, by tyrants. </p>

The Jews often made flutes of reeds. When a reed was bruised and no longer useful as a musical instrument, they broke it. They also made torches with flax to burn with oil. The oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it. Some of the Lord’s people are like a bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound; others are like smoking flax that cannot give a shining light. Yet the Lord would not “break” the bruised ones who cannot give a musical sound or quench the ones like dimly burning flax that cannot give a shining light. On the one hand, the Lord would not break a bruised reed or quench a dimly burning flax. On the other hand, according to these verses, He would not faint as a dimly burning flax, nor would He be crushed as a bruised reed. </p>

In this Gospel the Slave-Savior bears the characteristics of His humanity mingled with His deity. The Lord’s humanity is lovely in its virtue and perfection, and His deity is magnificent in its glory and honor. As we go through the Gospel of Mark, we can see these aspects of Christ. The Lord’s humanity is revealed in its virtue and perfection, and His deity is revealed in its glory and honor. We need to be impressed with these aspects of the Lord. Then as we study the book of Mark we shall see what a wonderful Slave-Savior the Lord is. He is God Himself becoming a Slave to serve us by giving His life a ransom for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6w399y9aiYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> In this message we shall consider the beginning of the gospel and the initiation of the Slave-Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64924" data-verses="Mark 1:1-13">1:1-13</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64925" data-verses="Mark 1:1">Mark 1:1</span> says, “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.” The word “gospel” means glad tidings, good news (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64926" data-verses="Romans 10:15">Rom. 10:15</span>). The gospel is the service, the ministry, of the Slave-Savior as a Slave of God to serve His people. Matthew begins with the kingly generations of the King, Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64927" data-verses="Matthew 1:1-17">Matt. 1:1-17</span>), Luke with a human genealogy of the Man, Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64928" data-verses="Luke 3:23-38">Luke 3:23-38</span>), and John with the eternal origin of the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64929" data-verses="John 1:1-2">John 1:1-2</span>). Mark begins with the beginning of the gospel, the service of Jesus as a lowly Slave of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64930" data-verses="Philippians 2:7">Phil. 2:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64931" data-verses="Matthew 20:27-28">Matt. 20:27-28</span>), not with the origin of His Person. As a rule, the service, not the person, of a slave is notable. <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocYqXGO_qNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A">THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8dYp-UC7BkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64932" data-verses="Mark 1:1">1:1</span>, the gospel is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. This Gospel is a biography of the Slave-Savior, who was God incarnated as a Slave to save sinners. The compound title “Jesus Christ, the Son of God” denotes the Lord’s humanity as Jesus Christ and His deity as the Son of God. Both the Lord’s humanity and His deity were adequately expressed by His human virtues and divine attributes in His ministry and His move for His gospel service, as recorded in the Gospel of Mark. </p>
<p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudI9YhKcSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> Although we realize that the word gospel means glad tidings, we need to consider more fully what the gospel actually is. Some of us who have been Christians for years may not yet realize what the gospel is. The gospel is the fulfillment of the entire Old Testament. Therefore, in order to know what the gospel is, we need to read the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and be enlightened concerning the revelation that is given there. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-XsZvqBpYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ">THE DISPENSATIONS IN THE SCRIPTURES</h2><p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1JawhpYxE-UdVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> Bible teachers have pointed out that in the Scriptures there are seven dispensations. (Some teachers reduce this number to four.) These seven dispensations cover the Scriptures from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64933" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64934" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">Revelation 20</span>. The first of these dispensations is the dispensation of innocence. This dispensation, in which there was no sin, covers only the first two chapters of Genesis. </p>
<p data-content-id="zbCxXV8yEF3E20ghfTqyl1tKDAYoqh_2u6LkS3jfEW09yxoZ1BBUaNJDdc2JggHVC"> Following the dispensation of innocence, we have the dispensation of conscience. This covers the time of man’s fall in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64935" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> until the time of the flood. </p>
<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJc1S_2WqJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> After the fall, man was required to live according to his conscience. However, because man failed to do this, the third dispensation—human government—came as the replacement of the second dispensation. After the flood, God required that man would come under the control of human government because he failed to live according to his conscience. During this dispensation, different nations were raised up <span class="pg" data-page-id="21" id="21">[21]</span> and governments were formed. This dispensation also ended in failure. </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQutRhuu6ZSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> The fourth dispensation began with God’s calling of Abraham out of the fallen, corrupted, and rebellious human race. In His calling of Abraham, God gave him a promise. Hence, the fourth dispensation is known as the dispensation of promise. </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNAsPvFQk0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> We have seen that the first four dispensations were innocence, conscience, human government, and promise. It was not God’s intention immediately to fulfill the promise He made to Abraham. Because of the intervening period of time, God decreed the law through Moses with the intention that the law would be used as a fold to keep His people in custody so that they would be preserved. The law may be compared to a fold in which sheep are kept during the night. The law given through Moses was such a fold for the keeping of God’s chosen people. Therefore, the fifth dispensation is the dispensation of the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6w399y7JyYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> Following this dispensation, Christ came. Concerning the coming of Christ, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64936" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span> says, “For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.” Because grace came through Jesus Christ, the sixth dispensation is called the dispensation of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocYqXGHvKNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> The dispensation of grace will last until the Lord’s second coming, at which time He will set up the kingdom on earth. The kingdom will last a thousand years, and this period of time is called the millennium. The seventh dispensation, therefore, is the dispensation of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8dYp-UKrxkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> Through these seven dispensations God will fully accomplish His purpose. After the end of the millennium, everything will be renewed. Then there will be a new universe with a new heaven and a new earth and with the New Jerusalem as its center for eternity. In the New Jerusalem God and His redeemed people will enjoy eternal life. </p>
<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6seri1iENHl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> As we have indicated, some Bible teachers prefer to say that in the Scriptures there are four major dispensations. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64937" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> says that from Adam to Moses there was no law. This long period of time, which includes the dispensations of <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> innocence, conscience, human government, and promise, may be regarded as a single dispensation, the prelaw dispensation, or the dispensation before the law. Then according to this understanding the second dispensation, covering the time from Moses to Christ, is the dispensation of the law. The third dispensation is the dispensation of grace, lasting from Christ’s first coming until His second coming. Finally, there is the fourth dispensation, the dispensation of the kingdom, lasting from the time of the Lord’s second coming until the end of the thousand years. This understanding of the dispensations is easy to remember. In this view there are four dispensations: the dispensation before the law, the dispensation of the law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-Eb42-YPWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD">THE CONTENTS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaQHKNHyDU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> We have said that the gospel is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. Now we need to ask what the contents of the Old Testament are. We may use three words to express the contents of the Old Testament: promise, law, and prophecy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QACl53aRyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo">The Promises</h2><p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8AkyJun_3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> The promise certainly covers the dispensations of innocence, conscience, human government, and promise. This includes the Old Testament from Adam until the giving of the law to Moses. The book of Genesis, in particular, is a book of God’s promise. </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYl1e00hQaxklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> Do you know what was the first promise given by God in Genesis? The first promise is recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64938" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>: “I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” This promise was given immediately after the fall of man. Probably Adam and Eve were in fear and trembling because of their disobedience. But God gave them a marvelous promise. This promise was that a seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent. Although his heel would be bruised, the seed of woman <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> would nevertheless crush the serpent’s head. What a great promise this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPe1jRRIFXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> The gospel is the fulfillment of the promise that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent. We know that Christ, the seed of woman, did come. He was born of a virgin as the fulfillment of the promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64939" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>. This One, the woman’s seed, is the Slave-Savior presented in the Gospel of Mark. </p>
<p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEZTBTqM5uwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> Another promise, also concerning the seed, was given to Abraham. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64940" data-verses="Genesis 22:17-18">Genesis 22:17 and 18</span> the Lord promised Abraham, “In blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” Here we have the promise that Abraham’s seed would be a great blessing to all mankind, for all nations would be blessed through his seed. </p>

Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way.” The beginning of the gospel of the Slave-Savior is even as what is written in Isaiah concerning the ministry of John the Baptist. This indicates that John’s preaching of the baptism of repentance was also a part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It terminated the dispensation of law and changed it to the dispensation of grace. Hence, the dispensation of grace began with the ministry of John before the ministry of the Slave-Savior. </p>
<p data-content-id="O8UhUNYqCBnM85L84xnfDQE6jIJZsoKJvEqYZJW8OEAFLWMdG4aWhxw5QHfd9cISQ"> The beginning of the gospel is the termination of law and the germination of grace. The beginning of the gospel terminated the dispensation of the law and started the dispensation of grace. Not only did the beginning of the gospel start the dispensation of grace, but it also germinated the dispensation of grace. To start something is outward, but to germinate something is to cause it to have an inward beginning in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="MM4hI37Bq0acKu7uad7yFSufA5Jn_2rlWqgP_ZCAOT51o90taGoOAfheGhkXDu6gu"> The beginning of the gospel is the termination of the entire old dispensation, the dispensation of the law. But in order <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> for a termination to be called a beginning, the termination must be followed by germination. This germination involves a divine injection, and this injection was the initiation of the Slave-Savior. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VWxmQv7W4uiwj768H2QdTaXWheU0GEWYtKu8tNXSAC0wKB8UNji7nnTh2Yra9R3z7">THE MINISTRY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST<br/>IN THE WILDERNESS</h2><p data-content-id="isH1YhKLP27GpYb1h_UH6A3jpPE3d1Q-bGo8ZH-xoo3romA6yrPL5uOuCKtIgHwLz"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64962" data-verses="Mark 1:3">Mark 1:3</span> speaks of “a voice of one crying in the wilderness.” The beginning of the ministry of the gospel of the Slave-Savior was only a voice, not a great movement. Furthermore, the preaching of the gospel of the Slave-Savior began not in any center of civilization, but began in the wilderness, beyond the influence of human culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="1YZgJVvfR7nEdPygijHBGvLFC4vhwTC01Dl5_a_Qjw4LWip4gb95cZHsWchz2v1DI"> It was according to prophecy that John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness. This indicates that the introduction of God’s New Testament economy by John was not accidental, but was planned and foretold by God through Isaiah the prophet. This implied that God intended His New Testament economy to begin in an absolutely new way. John the Baptist did his preaching not in the holy temple within the holy city, where the religious and cultured people worshipped God according to their scriptural ordinances, but in the wilderness, not keeping any regulation of the old way. This indicates that the old way of the worship of God according to the Old Testament was repudiated, and a new way was about to be brought in. The wilderness is a place without culture, religion, or anything of human society or civilization. The use of the word “wilderness” here indicates that the new way of God’s New Testament economy is against religion and culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgBd2swo1dGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64963" data-verses="Mark 1:4">Verse 4</span> says, “John the baptizer came in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.” John was born a priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64964" data-verses="Luke 1:8-13">Luke 1:8-13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64965" data-verses="Luke 1:57-63">57-63</span>); hence, he should have lived a priestly life in the temple to do the priestly service. But he went to the wilderness and preached the gospel. This indicates that the age of the priesthood to offer sacrifices to God was replaced by the age of the gospel to bring sinners to God so that God may gain them and that <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> they may gain God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64966" data-verses="Mark 1:6">Verse 6</span> says, “John was clothed in camel’s hair and had a leather girdle around his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey.” The way John lived signifies that his living and work were altogether in a new dispensation, not according to the way of the old religion, culture, and tradition. As a priest, John, according to the regulations of the law should have worn the priestly garment, which was made mainly of fine linen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64967" data-verses="Exodus 28:4">Exo. 28:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64968" data-verses="Exodus 28:40-41">40-41</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64969" data-verses="Leviticus 6:10">Lev. 6:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64970" data-verses="Ezekiel 44:17-18">Ezek. 44:17-18</span>). He also should have eaten priestly food, which was composed mainly of fine flour and the meat of the sacrifices offered to God by His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64971" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1-3">Lev. 2:1-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64972" data-verses="Leviticus 6:16-18">6:16-18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64973" data-verses="Leviticus 6:25-26">25-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64974" data-verses="Leviticus 7:31-34">7:31-34</span>). However, John did altogether otherwise. He was clothed in camel’s hair, he had a leather girdle around his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey. These things are uncivilized, uncultured, and not according to religious regulations. For a priestly person to wear camel’s hair was an especially drastic blow to the religious mind, for the camel was regarded as unclean under Levitical regulations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64975" data-verses="Leviticus 11:4">Lev. 11:4</span>). In addition, John did not live in a civilized place, but lived in the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64976" data-verses="Luke 3:2">Luke 3:2</span>). All this indicates that he had completely abandoned the Old Testament dispensation, which had fallen into a kind of religion mixed with human culture. His commission was to introduce God’s New Testament economy, which is constituted solely of Christ and the Spirit of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="j5IxdItcgq7F7cFXE3D0jZViV23tF5HpwfjHaCnXDkXrkH_o8CLFY2KxyNHpzRRlL">BAPTISM OF REPENTANCE</h2><p data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDztuU_pZgNUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44"> As one who signified the termination of the old dispensation with the old culture and religion, John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. Repentance is to change the mind, turning it to the Slave-Savior, and baptism is to bury the repenting people, terminating them, for the Slave-Savior to germinate them by regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64977" data-verses="John 3:3">John 3:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64978" data-verses="John 3:5-6">5-6</span>). The Greek word rendered “for” in this verse also means unto. Repentance with baptism is for, and results in, forgiveness of sins so that the obstacle of man’s fall may be removed and man may be reconciled to God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoUTDRidzfrq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm"> In his preaching John the Baptist emphasized repentance. To repent is to turn our mind from anything other than God, including our culture, religion, knowledge, education, and social life, and turn it to God. Religion, culture, civilization, society, knowledge, and education all distract us from God. Now that the old dispensation has been terminated, we must repent and turn our mind to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UbQprfbQaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> According to the Gospel of Mark, John the Baptist did not teach the repentant ones what they should do. Instead, he simply buried them. This burial signifies termination. In the wilderness John preached repentance and terminated all those who repented. This is included as part of the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. </p>

The gospel is of a Man named Jesus Christ. This Jesus Christ is the Son of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64980" data-verses="Mark 1:1">Mark 1:1</span> does not say, “Jesus Christ and the Son of God”; it says, “Jesus Christ, the Son of God.” The comma here indicates that “Son of God” is in apposition to “Jesus Christ.” This indicates that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that the Son of God denotes Jesus Christ. The title “the Son of God” denotes the Lord’s deity. Hence, the fact that the gospel is of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, means that it is of humanity and deity. This gospel is full of humanity and also full of the Godhead. This compound title used in relation to the gospel reveals that both human virtues and divine attributes are in this gospel. This gospel is full of the Lord’s humanity in its virtue and perfection and also full of His deity in its glory and honor. Therefore, the gospel is of humanity full of virtue and perfection and of deity full of glory and honor. All these aspects can be seen in the sixteen chapters of the Gospel of Mark. </p>

When John came out in an uncultured and unreligious way announcing repentance, that was the beginning of the gospel. As we have seen, the beginning of the gospel involves the termination of the dispensation of law and the germination of the dispensation of grace. The dispensation of law ended with the coming of John the Baptist, and the dispensation of grace began also with him. </p>

In the foregoing messages we have considered the beginning of the gospel and the initiation of the Slave-Savior. With this message we shall begin to consider the ministry of the Slave-Savior for the spreading of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="DioGnuR0sUvA-HjiqOYZ6BpkDeFgdlHkYsKOva-5So8_5JX330ghXt3Lqsjs98JZo"> We have seen that the Slave-Savior was initiated into His ministry by two steps—the steps of baptism and testing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65020" data-verses="Mark 1:14">1:14—10:52</span> the Slave-Savior carries out the ministry into which He has been initiated, a ministry that is for the spreading of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DbIrDOA_I3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ"> In the third message of this Life-study we saw that the gospel is the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types in the Old Testament and the removal of the law. Both the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types and the removal of the law are a living Person, Jesus Christ. Christ Himself is the fulfillment, and He Himself is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> removal of the law. What, then, is the beginning of this gospel? The beginning of the gospel is actually the ushering in of this living Person. For us today, Christ is everything. As long as we have Him, we have everything. We do not have promises—we have Christ. We do not have prophecies—we have Christ. We do not have types—we have Christ. We do not strive to keep the law, because Christ is here, and we have Him. In our spiritual dictionary the unique word is Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPEoCF5GLFN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> Now that we have seen what the gospel is, we need to go on to consider the contents of the gospel service revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65021" data-verses="Mark 1:14-45">1:14-45</span>. According to this section of the Gospel of Mark, the contents of the gospel service include five items: preaching the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65022" data-verses="Mark 1:14-20">vv. 14-20</span>), teaching the truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65023" data-verses="Mark 1:21-22">vv. 21-22</span>), casting out demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65024" data-verses="Mark 1:23-28">vv. 23-28</span>), healing the sick (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65025" data-verses="Mark 1:29-39">vv. 29-39</span>), and cleansing the leper (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65026" data-verses="Mark 1:40-45">vv. 40-45</span>). In simple terms, the contents of the Slave-Savior’s gospel service are preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing, and cleansing. It is possible to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65027" data-verses="Mark 1:14-45">1:14-45</span> a number of times without realizing that these verses portray the contents of the gospel service. Let us now go on to consider what <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65028" data-verses="Mark 1:14-20">1:14-20</span> records concerning the preaching of the gospel. </p>

Hence the Slave-Savior left that region and returned to the despised region for His service of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-EaY29YvWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> Although John the Baptist ministered in the wilderness, not in the holy temple in the holy city, his ministry was nevertheless in Judea, not far from the “holy things.” Due to the people’s rejection of John, the Lord Jesus came into Galilee to begin His gospel service, far away from the holy temple and the holy city. This occurred sovereignly to fulfill the prophecy of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65030" data-verses="Isaiah 9:1-2">Isaiah 9:1-2</span>. Galilee was a place with a <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> mixed population of both Jews and Gentiles. Hence, it was called “Galilee of the nations (Gentiles)” and was despised by orthodox Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65031" data-verses="John 7:41">John 7:41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65032" data-verses="John 7:52">52</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaQGqNEzjU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> The gospel service was initiated by the ministry of the Slave-Savior’s forerunner (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65033" data-verses="Mark 1:1-11">1:1-11</span>) in Judea, the region of honor. But it continued by the ministry of the Slave-Savior in Galilee, the despised region, for a period of about three years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65034" data-verses="Mark 1:14">1:14—9:50</span>). Mark narrates nothing of the Slave-Savior’s ministry in Jerusalem and Judea during this time, as John does in his Gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65035" data-verses="John 1:29-42">John 1:29-42</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65036" data-verses="John 2:13">2:13—3:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65037" data-verses="John 5:1-47">5:1-47</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65038" data-verses="John 7:10">7:10—11:57</span>). Mark does not narrate anything of the Slave-Savior’s ministry in Judea until He left Galilee for Jerusalem the last time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65039" data-verses="Mark 10:1">Mark 10:1</span>) to accomplish His redemptive work. Then the gospel service continued by His ministry on the way to Jerusalem and in Jerusalem and its vicinity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65040" data-verses="Mark 10:1">10:1—14:42</span>). It was concluded with His redeeming death, His life-imparting resurrection, His ascension for exaltation, and the continuation of His gospel service by His disciples’ preaching to all the creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65041" data-verses="Mark 14:43">14:43—16:20</span>). The Apostle John, however, in his Gospel narrates events in Jerusalem and Judea before the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65042" data-verses="Mark 10:1">Mark 10</span> that are not included in Mark’s Gospel (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65043" data-verses="John 1:29-42">John 1:29-42</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65044" data-verses="John 2:13">2:13—3:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65045" data-verses="John 5:1-47">5:1-47</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65046" data-verses="John 7:10">7:10—11:57</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QADF50bxyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65047" data-verses="Mark 1:14">Mark 1:14</span>, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God. The Slave-Savior’s preaching was to announce God’s glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage. His teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65048" data-verses="Mark 1:21-22">vv. 21-22</span>) was to enlighten the ignorant ones in darkness with the divine light of the truth. His preaching implied teaching, and His teaching implied preaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65049" data-verses="Matthew 4:23">Matt. 4:23</span>). This is the first thing He did in His ministry, and it was the all-embracing structure of His evangelical service (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65050" data-verses="Mark 1:38-39">Mark 1:38-39</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65051" data-verses="Mark 3:14">3:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65052" data-verses="Mark 6:12">6:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65053" data-verses="Mark 14:9">14:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65054" data-verses="Mark 16:15">16:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65055" data-verses="Mark 16:20">20</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8AlSJtnf3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l">Developing the Skill to Teach the Gospel</h2><p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYl1fU0iQ6xklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> The first item in the Slave-Savior’s gospel service was to preach the gospel. We have pointed out that the Lord’s preaching always implied teaching, and His teaching implied preaching. This indicates something important related to <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> our gospel preaching today. Many saints are burdened for the preaching of the gospel. They earnestly desire to preach the gospel to their relatives, neighbors, friends, classmates, and colleagues. However, many have had the experience of not knowing what to say when they try to preach the gospel. The reason for this is that they have not developed the skill to teach the gospel, although they have the burden to preach the gospel. If we do not know how to teach, we shall not be able to preach effectively. Gospel preaching depends on teaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPe0DRSLlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> I urge all the saints who are faithful to the Lord in His recovery to learn not just to preach the gospel, but also learn how to teach the gospel. For example, in speaking of God, some may say, “Friends, in the universe there is only one true God. Apart from Him, there are no other gods. Anything that claims to be God is false. The true God is the God we worship.” This way of speaking concerning God is very limited. In this kind of preaching, there is no teaching of others concerning God. I use this as an example of the need to develop the skill both to teach and preach the gospel. Therefore, I would encourage the elders in the churches to spend much time and energy to get into the Word and to help the saints learn the various truths of the gospel and also learn how to present them to others. First, all the saints need to learn the truths themselves. Then they need to gain the skill of presenting these truths to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEZShTpPZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> The meetings of the local church should be all-inclusive. Spiritually speaking, the church is a home, a restaurant, a hospital, a hotel, a gymnasium, and also a school. Regarding our need to develop the skill of teaching the gospel, certain meetings of the church should be like a class for instruction. In these meetings the saints may be helped to know the truth and present it. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w9YREm-5S764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> Concerning this need, I would say a word to the elders. It is very difficult to be an elder in a local church because an elder must be able to do a number of different things. Since the church is a home, an elder must know how to raise spiritual children. Since the church is the restaurant, an elder <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> must know how to prepare nourishing spiritual food for the saints. Since the church is a hospital, an elder must learn to care for the brothers and sisters as a spiritual doctor. Since the church is a hotel, an elder must learn how to serve the saints, how to wait on them. Since the church is a gymnasium, an elder should know how to be a coach, training the members of the “team” in their spiritual exercise together. Since the church is also a school, an elder must know how to teach the saints. This teaching of the saints is on different levels: kindergarten, elementary, junior high, college, and even graduate school. An elder should be able to teach the saints in spiritual things on all these different levels. Although the responsibility of the eldership concerning all these matters is extremely heavy, by the Lord’s mercy the elders need to learn to do these things. </p>

Man’s fall into sin broke his fellowship with God. As a result, man became ignorant of the knowledge of God.

The Slave-Savior, as the light of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65129" data-verses="John 8:12">John 8:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65130" data-verses="John 9:5">9:5</span>), came to Galilee, the land of darkness, where people were sitting in the shadow of death, and He came as a great light to shine upon them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65131" data-verses="Matthew 4:12-16">Matt. 4:12-16</span>). His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death so that they might receive the light of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65132" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span>). We have already seen that the first thing the Slave-Savior did in His service was to preach the gospel. Now the second thing the Slave of God as the Slave-Savior to fallen men did in His service was to carry out such teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65133" data-verses="Mark 2:13">Mark 2:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65134" data-verses="Mark 4:1">4:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65135" data-verses="Mark 6:2">6:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65136" data-verses="Mark 6:6">6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65137" data-verses="Mark 6:30">30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65138" data-verses="Mark 6:34">34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65139" data-verses="Mark 10:1">10:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65140" data-verses="Mark 11:17">11:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65141" data-verses="Mark 12:35">12:35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65142" data-verses="Mark 14:49">14:49</span>) to bring people out of satanic darkness into the divine light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65143" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UbQJrfZQaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> It was of God’s sovereignty that the Lord Jesus was raised in the region of Galilee and also that He began His preaching and teaching not from Judea, but from Galilee. According to the biblical record, Galilee was not only a despised region, but was also a place of darkness. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65144" data-verses="Matthew 4:15-16">Matthew 4:15-16</span> says, “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations: The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death, to them light sprang up.” This indicates that when the Lord Jesus walked through Galilee, He was a great light shining in the darkness and shining upon the people sitting in the region and shadow of death. In particular, the teaching of the Slave-Savior was the shining of a great light. Every word that issued out of His mouth was an enlightening word. Therefore, while He was teaching the people, the light was shining upon them. In this way the people in darkness were enlightened by the Lord’s teaching. </p>

The self-appointed scribes, teaching vain knowledge by themselves, had no authority and no power. But this God-authorized Slave, teaching realities by God Himself, had not only spiritual <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> power to subdue people but also divine authority to subject them to the divine ruling. </p>

A man with an unclean spirit cried out, and the Lord Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65147" data-verses="Mark 1:23-25">vv. 23-25</span>). This unclean spirit was not a fallen angel; this spirit was a demon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65148" data-verses="Mark 1:32">vv. 32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65149" data-verses="Mark 1:34">34</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65150" data-verses="Mark 1:39">39</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65151" data-verses="Luke 4:33">Luke 4:33</span>), one of the spirits of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan’s rebellion (see Life-study of Genesis, Message 2). The fallen angels worked with Satan in the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65152" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Eph. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65153" data-verses="Ephesians 6:11-12">6:11-12</span>), and these demons, the unclean spirits, move with him on the earth. Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan. The possession of people by demons signifies Satan’s usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose. The Slave-Savior came to destroy the works of Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65154" data-verses="1John 3:8">1 John 3:8</span>), and the third thing He did as a part of His service to God was to cast out these demons from the possessed people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65155" data-verses="Mark 1:34">Mark 1:34</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65156" data-verses="Mark 1:39">39</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65157" data-verses="Mark 3:15">3:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65158" data-verses="Mark 6:7">6:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65159" data-verses="Mark 6:13">13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65160" data-verses="Mark 16:17">16:17</span>) so that they might be delivered from Satan’s bondage (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65161" data-verses="Luke 13:16">Luke 13:16</span>), out of Satan’s authority of darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65162" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65163" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Col. 1:13</span>), into God’s kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65164" data-verses="Mark 1:15">Mark 1:15</span>). Five cases are recorded in this Gospel to illustrate this (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65165" data-verses="Mark 1:23-27">1:23-27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65166" data-verses="Mark 5:2-20">5:2-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65167" data-verses="Mark 7:25-30">7:25-30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65168" data-verses="Mark 9:17-27">9:17-27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65169" data-verses="Mark 16:9">16:9</span>). </p>

A new teaching! With authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.” This verse speaks not of the Lord’s power, but of His authority to cast out demons. For His gospel service, the Slave-Savior had divine authority not only to teach people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65171" data-verses="Mark 1:22">v. 22</span>), but also to cast out demons. </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TH6Ws6Ycc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> Many years ago, a missionary named Dr. Nevius wrote a book describing many cases of demon possession in China. Throughout China there were instances of demon possession, and in his book Dr. Nevius gives the details of these cases. Today, in a highly cultured and civilized country like the United States, apparently there no longer are cases of <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> demon possession. However, Satan is subtle, and he seeks to possess people in different ways. In his subtlety, he has a way to possess people in highly civilized countries just as he has a way to possess the people in undeveloped countries. Therefore, even today, in the most highly cultured nation, Satan is able to use different means to possess people. For this reason, in our preaching of the gospel we should have not only the proper teaching, but also the casting out of demons, the casting out of those things used by Satan to possess people. In order to do this, we must learn how to pray to receive the power, even the authority, to cast out the possessing element. Once we receive this power and authority, then our preaching and teaching will come forth with the power to cast out the possessing element of the enemy. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPDBonvNyBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> We need the power to cast out the satanic element used by the enemy to possess people in today’s modern countries. Satan, the subtle serpent, is very clever, and he knows how to possess people in modern ways. In an uncultured country, he may use an uncultured means to possess people. But in a modern, cultured country, he will use modern, cultured means to usurp people. For example, in the leading colleges and universities, Satan will possess people in an intellectual way. We cannot defeat the enemy’s possession of mankind simply by ordinary preaching and teaching. In order to cast out today’s demons, in our teaching and preaching we must have divine authority and power. This power and authority can be exercised only in the name of Jesus. Therefore, we need to call on the Lord’s name and exercise divine authority in and through His name. If we do this, then in our preaching and teaching there will be power and authority to cast out the evil possessing element of the enemy. The casting out of demons, therefore, is the third item of the content of the gospel. </p>

The fourth thing the Slave-Savior did to rescue sinners, as another part of His gospel service, was to heal their sick condition both physically and spiritually and restore them to normal so that they might serve Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65176" data-verses="Mark 1:34">1:34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65177" data-verses="Mark 3:10">3:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65178" data-verses="Mark 6:5">6:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65179" data-verses="Mark 6:13">13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65180" data-verses="Mark 6:56">56</span>).

Following this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65222" data-verses="Mark 2:1">2:1—3:6</span> we see the ways of carrying out the gospel service. In this section of the Gospel of Mark we have five incidents: forgiving the sins of the sick (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65223" data-verses="Mark 2:1-12">2:1-12</span>), feasting with sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65224" data-verses="Mark 2:13-17">2:13-17</span>), causing His followers to be merry without fasting (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65225" data-verses="Mark 2:18-22">2:18-22</span>), caring for His followers’ hunger rather than for the regulations of religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65226" data-verses="Mark 2:23-28">2:23-28</span>), and caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65227" data-verses="Mark 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>).

In this Gospel one case follows another without any apparent order or arrangement. For this reason, we may read Mark a number of times and still not be able to make an outline of this book or divide it into sections. But by the Lord’s mercy I believe that we have a useful outline, an outline that helps us get into all the sections of this Gospel. According to this outline, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65228" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> presents the complete contents of the gospel.

<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TH6GsyLsc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> The five incidents recorded vividly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65231" data-verses="Mark 2:1">2:1—3:6</span> form one particular group, showing how the Slave-Savior as the Slave of God carried out His gospel service to care for the need of fallen people, who were captured by Satan from God and the enjoyment of God. The Lord cared for their need so that they might be rescued from their captivity and brought back to the God of enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPe0jRSJlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> First, the Lord forgave the sins of the victim of sickness. He did this as God with divine authority so that He might release the sick one from Satan’s oppression (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65232" data-verses="Acts 10:38">Acts 10:38</span>) and restore him to God. The scribes considered this to be against the theology of their religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65233" data-verses="Mark 2:1-12">2:1-12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEZSBTpNZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> Second, as a physician to the sick and miserable people, He feasted with the tax collectors, those who were disloyal and unfaithful to their race, and with sinners despised and isolated from society, that they might taste the mercy of God and be recovered to the enjoyment of God. This was condemned by the self-righteous yet merciless scribes of the Pharisees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65234" data-verses="Mark 2:13-17">2:13-17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w9YxEl-ZS764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> Third, He caused His followers to be merry and happy without fasting, as a bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber. Thus, He annulled the practice of the disciples of John (the new religionists) and the Pharisees (the old religionists), so that His followers might be delivered from the practices of their religion into the enjoyment of God’s Christ as their Bridegroom, with His righteousness as their outer clothing and His life as their inner wine in God’s New Testament economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65235" data-verses="Mark 2:18-22">2:18-22</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="O8UhUNYqCBnM85L84xXfLCU6jIJZsoKJvEqYZJW8OEAFLWMdG4aWhxw5QHfd9cISQ"> Fourth, He allowed His followers to pick the ears of grain in the grainfields on the Sabbath that they might satisfy their hunger. Thus, they apparently broke God’s commandment concerning the Sabbath. But actually they pleased God, for the hunger of Christ’s followers was satisfied through Him, as the hunger of David and his followers was satisfied with the bread of the presence in the house of God. This indicates that in God’s New Testament economy it is not a matter of keeping the regulation of religion, but of enjoying <span class="pg" data-page-id="61" id="61">[61]</span> satisfaction in and through Christ as the real Sabbath rest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65236" data-verses="Mark 2:23-28">2:23-28</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-7yDpGP9H6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF"> Fifth, the Lord healed a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath. He did not care for keeping the Sabbath, but rather cared for the health of His sheep. Thus, He indicated that in God’s New Testament economy it is not a matter of keeping regulations but of imparting life. For this, He was hated by the Pharisees—the religionists (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65237" data-verses="Mark 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>). </p>

This chapter tells us what the gospel is, when the gospel began, and what the contents of the gospel are. In this chapter we see the nature, substance, essence, element, contents, and reality of the gospel. I believe that the churches will carry out this rich gospel through their gospel service. </p>

It is significant that in Mark the Lord Jesus does not teach us in words how to carry out the gospel service. Instead, in the Gospel of Mark He is portrayed as a working One, a serving One, not as a speaking One. Therefore, in Mark it is mainly by the Lord’s acts, not by His words, that we learn how to carry out the gospel service. </p>

If we would know how to carry out this service, we need to consider what the Lord does in forgiving the sins of the sick, in feasting with sinners, in causing His followers to be merry without fasting, in caring for His followers’ hunger rather than for religion’s regulation, and in caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion. <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> </p>

In no other chapter of the Scriptures do we have such a full display of the gospel as we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65244" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> of Mark. Not even in the writings of Paul can we find a single chapter that gives us such a detailed and full display of the gospel in its nature and contents. However, we need to be enlightened in order to see what is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65245" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> of Mark. Someone may memorize this chapter, yet still not have any light concerning it. Someone else may thoroughly study this chapter in Greek, knowing the meaning of every Greek word, and nevertheless not have any light concerning the gospel displayed in this chapter. I believe that, by the Lord’s mercy, we have seen a clear view of the gospel displayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65246" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> of Mark. Now we also should have a clear view of the Lord’s way to carry out the gospel service, that is, a clear view of what the Lord practices in His gospel service. Let us now go on to consider the first incident related to this, the incident of forgiving the sins of the sick (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65247" data-verses="Mark 2:1-12">2:1-12</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DioGnuR0sUvA-HjiqO4Z_TZkDeFgdlHkYsKOva-5So8_5JX330ghXt3Lqsjs98JZo">FORGIVING THE SINS OF THE SICK</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DbILDES_I3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ">A Sinner Paralyzed by Sin </h2>

This paralytic signifies a sinner paralyzed by sin, one who is unable to walk and move before God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> </p>

Then through the roof they lowered the bed, a small mattress or pad, on which the sick man was lying. </p>

<p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxgwWilcWnJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65300" data-verses="Mark 2:14">Verse 14</span> says, “And passing by, He saw Levi the son of <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> Alpheus, sitting at the tax office, and He says to him, Follow Me! And rising up, he followed Him.” The tax office was a toll house, where tax was collected for the Roman government. Levi, also known as Matthew, was one of the tax collectors, probably one in a high position (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65301" data-verses="Matthew 10:3">Matt. 10:3</span>). The tax collectors were condemned, despised, and abhorred by the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65302" data-verses="Luke 18:11">Luke 18:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65303" data-verses="Matthew 5:46">Matt. 5:46</span>). Most of these tax collectors abused their office by demanding more than they should by false accusation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65304" data-verses="Luke 3:12-13">Luke 3:12-13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65305" data-verses="Luke 19:2">19:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65306" data-verses="Luke 19:8">8</span>). To pay taxes to the Roman government was very bitter to the Jews. Those engaged in collecting these taxes were despised by the people and counted unworthy of any respect (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65307" data-verses="Luke 18:9-10">Luke 18:9-10</span>). Hence, they were classed with sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65308" data-verses="Mark 2:16">Mark 2:16</span>). Even though Matthew was a tax collector, he was called by the Slave-Savior and later chosen and appointed as one of the twelve apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65309" data-verses="Mark 3:18">3:18</span>). What mercy! </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkowF2yKD1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> The record of the calling of Matthew is very simple. He was a tax collector, one who was considered a traitor by the Jews because he helped the Roman imperialists. In the New Testament these tax collectors were classified with prostitutes. Nevertheless, such a person as Matthew was called by the Slave-Savior. The Lord simply said to him, “Follow Me!” We are told that Matthew rose and followed Him. According to the record here, it seems that this was the first time the Lord met Matthew. There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pu9555BwdXseDKhVHfTfqZEuIg4gGqssN05hXWqG5AOWLMiJFHRYC9yb9EUElWhG0"> To follow the Lord includes believing in Him. No one follows Him unless he believes in Him. To believe in the Lord is to be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65310" data-verses="Acts 16:31">Acts 16:31</span>), and to follow Him is to enter the narrow gate and walk the constricted way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65311" data-verses="Matthew 7:13-14">Matt. 7:13-14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="-5AXIggToD6uMh3UEseeDF5fYbf5HiOdJu1FrqXNWLmcCgTAMm7L2e-ug40_gpPOy"> This is not the first case recorded in the Gospel of Mark of the Lord calling people to follow Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65312" data-verses="Mark 1:16">1:16</span> He saw Simon and Andrew casting a net into the sea. Then He said to them, “Come after Me, and I will make you become fishers of men. And immediately, leaving the nets, they followed Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65313" data-verses="Mark 1:17-18">vv. 17-18</span>). Soon afterward, the Lord called James <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in a boat mending nets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65314" data-verses="Mark 1:19">v. 19</span>). When He called them, they left their father with the hired servants and followed Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65315" data-verses="Mark 1:20">v. 20</span>). We have a similar situation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65316" data-verses="Mark 2:1">chapter two</span>. The Lord saw Levi, or Matthew, at the tax office and told him to follow Him, and Matthew simply rose up and followed Him. His action as an answer to the Slave-Savior’s call implies his abandoning his unclean job and sinful life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZUR5VAig_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle">The Sick in Need of a Physician</h2><p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHndPC5sniWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65317" data-verses="Mark 2:15">Verse 15</span> indicates that Matthew not only followed the Lord, but also prepared a great feast for Him: “And it came about that He reclined at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were reclining at the table with Jesus and His disciples, for there were many, and they followed Him.” Matthew invited many tax collectors and sinners to this feast. If we had been invited to such a feast, we probably would have declined the invitation, not wanting to feast with such people. However, the Lord Jesus attended that feast. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl8zXz6Js7DYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> If we read the Gospel of Mark carefully, we shall realize that the scribes followed the Lord like spies wherever He went. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65318" data-verses="Mark 2:16">Verse 16</span> says, “And the scribes of the Pharisees, seeing that He ate with sinners and tax collectors, said to His disciples, He is eating with tax collectors and sinners!” We have seen that these scribes, as the proponents of the old and dead religion, were motivated and used by Satan, the enemy of God, to oppose, resist, and frustrate the gospel service of the Slave of God throughout all His ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65319" data-verses="Mark 2:16">2:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65320" data-verses="Mark 2:24">24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65321" data-verses="Mark 3:22">3:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65322" data-verses="Mark 7:5">7:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65323" data-verses="Mark 8:11">8:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65324" data-verses="Mark 9:14">9:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65325" data-verses="Mark 10:2">10:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65326" data-verses="Mark 11:27">11:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65327" data-verses="Mark 12:13">12:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65328" data-verses="Mark 12:28">28</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65329" data-verses="Mark 2:16">verse 16</span> the scribes were self-righteous in condemning the Slave-Savior for His feasting with tax collectors and sinners. The scribes’ word to the Lord’s disciples indicates that, in their self-righteousness, they did not know the grace of God. They assumed that God deals with man only according to righteousness. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65330" data-verses="Mark 2:16">verse 16</span> the scribes continued the opposition that began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65331" data-verses="Mark 2:6-7">2:6-7</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="2biGa_BPHwBMmqGIo9HaCcS4wtrRfcU4sHxDfRZzyMIzlPqgeTUisrY2QHdBIBzZK"> Hearing what the scribes said to His disciples, the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> said to the scribes, “Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65332" data-verses="Mark 2:17">v. 17</span>). This word indicates that the Slave-Savior considered Himself a Physician to the people who were sick with sins. In calling people to follow Him, the Lord ministered as a Physician, not as a judge. The judgment of a judge is according to righteousness, whereas the healing of a physician is according to mercy and grace. The Lord came to minister as a Physician; that is, He came to heal, recover, enliven, and save people. </p>
<p data-content-id="uamxl0odSMwfSIWjkSVAsewo-fcQoDK5WNy2WFyi0oYKbOAd76mwgMMv-zAcUryim"> The Lord’s word that the strong have no need of a physician implies that the self-righteous scribes did not realize their need of Him as a Physician. They considered themselves strong. Therefore, blinded by their self-righteousness, they did not know that they were sick. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7CZY3GImdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65333" data-verses="Mark 2:17">verse 17</span> the Lord said that He did not come to call the righteous, but sinners. This indicates that the Slave-Savior is the Savior of sinners. Actually, there is none righteous, not even one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65334" data-verses="Romans 3:10">Rom. 3:10</span>). Those who think they are righteous are self-righteous. The Slave-Savior did not come to call these “righteous” ones; He came to call sinners. </p>
<p data-content-id="IgKBIj9xvn3kVySf6yolIjwZB-WDTQgX3dkNC5dvPZxfKOYTZm1eWOeBjrXPL5gF0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65335" data-verses="Mark 2:17">verse 17</span> the Lord seems to be saying to the scribes, “The strong do not need a physician. The sick ones, however, know that they need a physician. Are you scribes strong or weak? Are you sick or healthy? You are more sick than these tax collectors, but you are not willing to admit it. Because you will not admit your need, I cannot heal you. I have come as the Physician to heal you, but you will not admit that you are sick. Furthermore, I have not come to call the righteous ones—I have come to call sinners.” </p>

This is to help people have their sins forgiven so that they may enter into the enjoyment with God. To feast with the Lord Jesus is to enjoy God with Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-XupvpBJYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> All sinners have lost God and have also lost the enjoyment of God. Sinners have been taken captive away from God and from the enjoyment of God to be slaves of Satan. All sinners are slaves under the authority of Satan. Because they are such slaves, they have no enjoyment and no peace. In carrying out the service of the gospel, the Lord Jesus first forgives our sins and then brings us into the enjoyment of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQutTBumppSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> We have seen that the five incidents recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65343" data-verses="Mark 2:1">2:1—3:6</span> form a group. These five incidents are the forgiving of the sins of the sick (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65344" data-verses="Mark 2:1-12">2:1-12</span>), feasting with sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65345" data-verses="Mark 2:13-17">2:13-17</span>), causing His followers to be merry without fasting (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65346" data-verses="Mark 2:18-22">2:18-22</span>), caring for His followers’ hunger rather than for religion’s regulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65347" data-verses="Mark 2:23-28">2:23-28</span>), and caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65348" data-verses="Mark 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>). Each of these incidents can be summarized by a particular word. The word to summarize the first incident is forgiveness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65349" data-verses="Mark 2:1-12">2:1-12</span> we have a case of the forgiveness of sins by the Son of Man, who was the forgiving God incarnated in the form of a Slave. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65350" data-verses="Mark 2:5">2:5</span> the Lord Jesus said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven!” When the scribes heard this they reasoned in their hearts, “He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except one—God?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65351" data-verses="Mark 2:7">v. 7</span>). Eventually, the Lord said, “But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—He says to the paralytic, To you I say, Rise, pick up your bed and go to your house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65352" data-verses="Mark 2:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>). The Son of Man, even though He was in the form of a Slave, <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> had the authority to forgive sins. Here we have a strong indication that the forgiving God was present in the form of this Man, a man who was a Slave. Therefore, the first incident in this series of five incidents concerns forgiveness. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XKBnfB4sWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv">Enjoyment</h2><p data-content-id="YsklwMzN513qLhmk4DEqbZ3z79rzoaz16RIy_1aceu91KDfDQgSH1KFDyFgXuTwem"> The word to describe the second incident is enjoyment. In this incident, recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65353" data-verses="Mark 2:13-17">2:13-17</span>, the Slave-Savior as a Physician was feasting with sinners. Therefore, here we have the enjoyment of feasting with the Savior. Those who feasted with Him enjoyed the goodness of the Slave-Savior, who is the embodiment of God. Therefore, what they actually experienced was the enjoyment of God Himself. For this reason, the word “enjoyment” is a summary of this incident. </p>

Without these factors, we cannot have joy. The first basic factor is the Bridegroom: “Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65355" data-verses="Mark 2:19">v. 19</span>). A bridegroom is the most pleasant person. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65356" data-verses="Mark 2:1">chapter two</span> of Mark the basic factor of our joy is the Savior as the Bridegroom. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPErCFxV7FN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> Two other factors of joy are the new cloth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65357" data-verses="Mark 2:21">v. 21</span>) and the new wine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65358" data-verses="Mark 2:22">v. 22</span>). The new cloth is for making a garment to cover us and beautify us. Unshrunk cloth is cloth that has not yet been treated or worked upon. This new cloth is for making a new garment. This new garment, which is actually Christ Himself, covers us and beautifies us. The new wine satisfies us and makes us joyful. Outwardly, we have the new cloth; inwardly, we have the new wine. Furthermore, we are with the Bridegroom. Now we have these basic factors for us to be joyful. <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="eW1-pGBoAGH7gOu2GgRWazR2iEuzXGZKhHTHlippcE-tSBQA2AEb8Btsa6mr5pa6x"> No philosopher could utter a word like what is spoken by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65359" data-verses="Mark 2:18-22">2:18-22</span>. In His wisdom the Lord uses ordinary things like cloth and wine to illustrate wonderful points. The Lord speaks of a bridegroom, new cloth, and new wine to show us how we may be joyful. We can be joyful because we are with the Bridegroom, because we have a new covering to beautify us, and because we have new wine to fill us, satisfy us, and cause us to be beside ourselves with joy. Therefore, in the third incident we have joy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4fgtQZiVcuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF">Satisfaction</h2><p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GR5m6m0eMeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> The fourth incident, recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65360" data-verses="Mark 2:23-28">2:23-28</span>, is that of the Lord’s caring for His followers’ hunger rather than for religion’s regulation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65361" data-verses="Mark 2:23-24">Mark 2:23 and 24</span> say, “And it came about that He passed through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way, picking the ears of grain. And the Pharisees said to Him, Look! Why are they doing on the Sabbath what is not lawful?” Here we see that the Slave-Savior cared for the hunger of His followers rather than for the regulation of religion. As those who follow the Savior we are not hungering. Instead, we are filled and satisfied. Because we are satisfied, we can testify, “We don’t care to keep the regulations of religion and remain hungry. Religious regulations always leave us hungry. But as those who follow the Slave-Savior, we are not hungry any longer. Every day of the week, including the Sabbath, He gives us something to eat. Now we are satisfied. We don’t care if others condemn us according to their religious regulations. Others may care for religious regulations, but we care to be satisfied in the Lord.” This case, therefore, may be summarized by the word satisfaction. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_uTLLqJZEraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV">Freedom</h2><p data-content-id="hx_zzSpG4rVvnFzTQ1f6iUo79ejIThvBxQ7OaGa7mOy9TYjUhbSqG4WclLusd8YDB"> The word that best summarizes the fifth incident, that of the Slave-Savior’s caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65362" data-verses="Mark 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>), is the word freedom. In this incident we see that on the Sabbath the Savior restored a man’s withered hand. Here we see that He did not <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> care for the ritual of religion; He cared for the relief of the suffering one. He wanted to release that one, to liberate him. Thus, in this incident we have the matter of freedom. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="URtKIt0L_s2x9jmmhE_xw0Rxo9XCdhKgCltl2BQUyoJ1J6-naGmt6MTZtNA2Ufk2K">THE ACTUAL HISTORICAL SEQUENCE</h2><p data-content-id="MM4hI37Bq0acKu7uaeryGSOfA5Jn_2rlWqgP_ZCAOT51o90taGoOAfheGhkXDu6gu"> Let us review the five words used to describe these five incidents: forgiveness, enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom. What a marvelous sequence we have here! Imagine how different it would be if forgiveness came last instead of first. According to the historical sequence recorded in Mark, first we have forgiveness and then enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom. The forgiveness of our sins by the Lord always issues in enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom. We can testify of this from our experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="VWxmQv7W4uiwj768H1AdQa3WheU0GEWYtKu8tNXSAC0wKB8UNji7nnTh2Yra9R3z7"> These incidents were not arranged by Mark in order to present a doctrine. On the contrary, these incidents are presented according to historical fact and sequence. In other words, they happened in the order in which Mark put them. These five events took place under the Lord’s sovereignty according to the actual sequence of the enjoyment of His salvation. The first item in this sequence is the forgiveness of sins. We can testify from our experience of the Lord’s salvation that when we have the forgiveness of sins we also have enjoyment and joy. This joy is followed by satisfaction and freedom. How wonderful! </p>
<p data-content-id="isH1YhKLP27GpYb1h8EH5BXjpPE3d1Q-bGo8ZH-xoo3romA6yrPL5uOuCKtIgHwLz"> As we consider the sequence of these five incidents in the Gospel of Mark, we realize once again that the Bible truly is the Word of God. Apart from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, no human being could compose such a writing as we have in the Gospel of Mark. I do not believe that Mark was highly educated or had a thorough knowledge of Greek. To be sure, the Greek in the Gospel of Mark is not as high as that in the Gospel of Luke or in the Epistles of Paul. But even though the language in the Gospel of Mark may not be especially polished, the five incidents in this section are arranged in a marvelous sequence, a sequence that corresponds fully with our experience of the Lord’s salvation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> According to this sequence, we have forgiveness, enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom. </p>
<p data-content-id="1YZgJVvfR7nEdPygigXBFurFC4vhwTC01Dl5_a_Qjw4LWip4gb95cZHsWchz2v1DI"> As we consider Mark’s record, we need to worship the Lord that this indeed is part of His holy Word. This is not merely a composition written by a person with limited education. No, it is the breath of the sovereign God. All the Scripture, including the Gospel of Mark, is God-breathed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65363" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</span>). This means that the narration in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65364" data-verses="Mark 2:1">Mark 2:1—3:6</span> is God-breathed. As a reminder of the sequence here, I recommend that you write in the words forgiveness, enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom next to these sections in your Bible. </p>

<p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaRH6NDgDU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> In this message we shall continue to consider the ways the Slave-Savior carried out His gospel service. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65388" data-verses="Mark 2:23-28">2:23-28</span>, He cared for His followers’ hunger rather than for religion’s regulation, and according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65389" data-verses="Mark 3:1-6">3:1-6</span> He cared for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QBCV5yIByr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo">CARING FOR HIS FOLLOWERS’ HUNGER<br/>RATHER THAN FOR RELIGION’S REGULATION</h2><p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8BkCJk0f3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65390" data-verses="Mark 2:23">Mark 2:23</span> says, “And it came about that He passed through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way, picking the ears of grain.” I believe that the Lord Jesus purposely led His followers into the grainfields on the Sabbath. He certainly knew that it was a Sabbath day. As a rule, He should not have made a decision to pass through the grainfields on the Sabbath, for that was a breaking of the regulation concerning the keeping of the Sabbath. Nevertheless, He, as the Shepherd, led all of His followers, His sheep, into the grainfields, and those fields became their pasture. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65391" data-verses="Mark 2:23">Verse 23</span> says that “His disciples began to make their way, picking the ears of grain.” Here we see that the disciples were eating the fresh ears of grain. Through this kind of eating they were satisfied. </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYl0eE0qDqxklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65392" data-verses="Mark 2:24">verse 24</span> “the Pharisees said to Him, Look! Why are they doing on the Sabbath what is not lawful?” The Sabbath was for the Jews to remember God as the Creator (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65393" data-verses="Genesis 2:2">Gen. 2:2</span>), <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> to keep the sign of God’s covenant with them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65394" data-verses="Ezekiel 20:12">Ezek. 20:12</span>), and to remember God’s redemption of them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65395" data-verses="Deuteronomy 5:15">Deut. 5:15</span>). Hence, to profane the Sabbath was a serious matter in the eyes of the religious Pharisees. To them it was not lawful, not scriptural, for the Lord’s disciples to pick ears of grain on the Sabbath. As we shall see, the Pharisees did not have adequate knowledge of the Scriptures. According to their meager knowledge, they cared for the ritual of keeping the Sabbath, not for the hunger of the people. What folly to observe a vain ritual! </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="uamxl0odSMwfSIWjlQVAscwo-fcQoDK5WNy2WFyi0oYKbOAd76mwgMMv-zAcUryim">The Real David</h2><p data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7DbY3GKmdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65396" data-verses="Mark 2:25-26">Mark 2:25-26</span> we see the Lord’s reply to the Pharisees: “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and was hungry, he and those with him? How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the presence, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he gave also to those who were with him?” The Pharisees said that it was not lawful for the Lord’s disciples to pick the ears in the grainfields and eat. The Pharisees condemned them for acting contrary to Scripture. But the Lord asked them, “Have you not read?” He pointed out to them another aspect of the truth in the Scriptures that justified Him and His disciples. This condemned the Pharisees for lacking adequate knowledge of the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="IgKBIj9xvn3kVySf7wolLjQZB-WDTQgX3dkNC5dvPZxfKOYTZm1eWOeBjrXPL5gF0"> The Lord’s answer in these verses indicates that He must have had an excellent way of studying the Bible. Here the Lord seemed to be telling the Pharisees, “Have you never read what David did? You religionists respect the Bible to the uttermost. Have you not read how David entered into the house of God, ate the bread of the presence, and also gave it to those who were with him? Don’t you know that David led his followers to do this? Would you say that he misled them in this matter?” How excellent is the Lord’s way of studying the Bible! We all need to learn of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Hfo6mxQWhV9UNGGlzV7bWIzqFlUtfJf1FVddN1W7drZ0yu-2uolKPKUU_XXH9aAsf"> In the eyes of the Jews, the Lord was unlearned. They marveled and said concerning Him, “How does this man <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> know letters, having never learned?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65397" data-verses="John 7:15">John 7:15</span>). This One, who apparently was unlearned in the Scriptures, questioned the scribes, ancient scholars of the Bible, concerning their knowledge of the Scriptures. Although they were regarded as Bible scholars, they knew the Scriptures only in a superficial way and in the way of doctrine in dead letters. The Lord exposed their inadequate knowledge of the Scriptures when He asked them if they had never read what David did when he and those with him were in need and were hungry. </p>
<p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudJ9ohKdSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> The Lord’s word to the Pharisees is very wise and rich in its implications. The Lord’s word here implies that He is the real David. In the ancient time, David and his followers, when rejected, entered into the house of God and ate the showbread, seemingly breaking the Levitical law. Now the real David and His followers were also rejected and took action to eat, seemingly against the sabbatical regulation. Just as David and his followers were not held guilty, neither should Christ and His disciples be condemned. </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-WspvqApYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> Furthermore, the Lord’s word here implies a dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship. In the ancient time, the coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, to the age in which the kings were above the priests. In the age of the priests, the leader of the people should listen to the priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65398" data-verses="Numbers 27:21-22">Num. 27:21-22</span>). But in the age of the kings, the priest should submit to the king (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65399" data-verses="1Samuel 2:35-36">1 Sam. 2:35-36</span>). Hence, what King David with his followers did was not illegal. Now by the coming of Christ the dispensation was also changed, this time from the age of the law to the age of grace, the age in which Christ is above the law. Whatever He does is right. </p>
<p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1JawgpoxE_UdVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> We have seen that the Lord’s word to the Pharisees implies that He is the real David. Matthew the tax collector was one of the followers of this David, the One who was fighting for God’s kingdom. When David led his company to the house of God, He was fighting for the kingdom. Likewise, as the real David, Christ and His followers were also <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> fighting for the coming of the kingdom. Moreover, with the coming of the Lord there was a change of dispensation. </p>
<p data-content-id="zbCxXV8yEF3E20gheTayl0tKDAYoqh_2u6LkS3jfEW09yxoZ1BBUaNJDdc2JggHVC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65400" data-verses="Mark 2:27">2:27</span> the Lord went on to say to the Pharisees, “The Sabbath came into being for man’s sake, and not man for the Sabbath’s sake.” Man was not created for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath was ordained for man so that man might enjoy it with God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65401" data-verses="Genesis 2:2-3">Gen. 2:2-3</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJd1i_2VqJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1">Lord of the Sabbath</h2><p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQusRRuu5ZSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65402" data-verses="Mark 2:28">verse 28</span> we have a strong display of who the Lord is: “So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.” This indicates the Slave-Savior’s deity in His humanity. He, the Son of Man, was the very God who ordained the Sabbath, and He had the right to change what He had ordained concerning the Sabbath. As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath. </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNBs_vGRE0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> The Lord Jesus indicated to the condemning Pharisees that He was the real David, the King of the coming kingdom of God, and also the Lord of the Sabbath. Therefore, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by who He is. He was above all rituals and regulations. Because He was present, no one should pay any attention to rituals and regulations. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6w29Ny4ISYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> I would call your attention to the word “even” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65403" data-verses="Mark 2:28">2:28</span>. Here the Lord says that the Son of Man is the Lord <em>even</em> of the Sabbath. His use of the word “even” here implies that He is not merely the Lord of one thing, but the Lord of everything, including the Sabbath. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocZqnGEtqNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> The Lord’s word implies and indicates that He is the almighty God, the very One who ordained the Sabbath in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65404" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>. As the One who had the authority to ordain the Sabbath, He also has the right to change it. Therefore, the Lord could have said to the Pharisees, “Why do you trouble Me? I am the Lord who ordained the Sabbath, and I have the full position and right to change it. Whether I ordain the Sabbath or change it, I do it for the sake of man. The Sabbath came into being for man’s sake; man did not come into being for the sake of the Sabbath. You Pharisees <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> would even let people die by the way you keep the Sabbath. But on the Sabbath I care for feeding My followers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65405" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> I ordained the Sabbath because I wanted man to have rest. Therefore, the Sabbath came into being for the sake of man. But now that I am here, I want to cancel the Sabbath in order to feed My followers. As the Lord of the Sabbath, I certainly have the right to do this.” </p>

We have also seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65433" data-verses="Mark 2:1">2:1—3:6</span> five ways in which the Slave-Savior carried out this gospel service: forgiving the sins of the sick (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65434" data-verses="Mark 2:1-12">2:1-12</span>), feasting with sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65435" data-verses="Mark 2:13-17">2:13-17</span>), causing His followers to be merry without fasting (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65436" data-verses="Mark 2:18-22">2:18-22</span>), caring for His followers’ hunger rather than for religion’s regulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65437" data-verses="Mark 2:23-28">2:23-28</span>), and caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65438" data-verses="Mark 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65439" data-verses="Mark 3:7-35">3:7-35</span> we have another group of five items. This group includes the auxiliary acts for the gospel service: averting the crowd’s pressing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65440" data-verses="Mark 3:7-12">vv. 7-12</span>), appointing the apostles to preach (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65441" data-verses="Mark 3:13-19">vv. 13-19</span>), not eating because of the urgent need (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65442" data-verses="Mark 3:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>), binding Satan and plundering his house by the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65443" data-verses="Mark 3:22-30">vv. 22-30</span>), and not remaining in the relationship of the natural life but in that of the spiritual life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65444" data-verses="Mark 3:31-35">vv. 31-35</span>). In all the items in each of these three groups we see the excellency of the Lord Jesus. In this message and in the message following we shall consider these auxiliary acts for the Slave-Savior’s gospel service. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GoWRQTh2JAOfaAt9zQAarIquFozX66HQ3Rw0vb4ArxIVsvkriGZ32FGW746MXwzF2">AVERTING THE CROWD’S PRESSING</h2><p data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XLDnfIqMWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv"> In carrying out a ministry which God has commissioned <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> to us, we shall face problems, opposition, and frustration. Certain problems are caused by something that is done in a natural way with the intention of helping us. The Lord faced this kind of frustration in His ministry. As He was carrying out the ministry of His gospel service, He met problems. </p>
<p data-content-id="YsklwMzN513qLhmk5BEqTLHz79rzoaz16RIy_1aceu91KDfDQgSH1KFDyFgXuTwem"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65445" data-verses="Mark 3:7-12">3:7-12</span> we have the problem of the crowd pressing upon the Lord. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65446" data-verses="Mark 3:7">Verse 7</span> says that a great multitude followed Him and His disciples, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65447" data-verses="Mark 3:8">verse 8</span> we see that “a great multitude, hearing what great things He was doing, came to Him.” The multitude gathered around Him because they heard what He was doing. This crowd was a frustration to the Lord’s ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GQ7m6m2eMeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> Many of today’s preachers and evangelists like to have a large crowd. However, the crowd is not a help to the real ministry of life. On the contrary, a crowd, a multitude, for the most part may help us to have a movement, but it does not help the ministry in life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_vRLLqLZEraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV">Pressing and Touching</h2><p data-content-id="hx_zzSpG4rVvnFzTR3f6hUI79ejIThvBxQ7OaGa7mOy9TYjUhbSqG4WclLusd8YDB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65448" data-verses="Mark 3:7-12">3:7-12</span> two significant words are used with respect to the crowd: press (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65449" data-verses="Mark 3:9-10">vv. 9-10</span>) and touch (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65450" data-verses="Mark 3:10">v. 10</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65451" data-verses="Mark 3:9">Verse 9</span> says, “And He told His disciples that a little boat should stand ready near Him because of the crowd, that they might not press upon Him.” The Lord wanted to get into a boat in order to avert the pressing of the crowd. The crowd’s pressing hindered the way for the sincere ones to come to the Lord and touch Him directly. If we are among those who merely press upon the Lord, we shall not receive anything from Him. In order to receive from Him, we need to touch Him. Therefore, in this portion of the Gospel of Mark the word “press” is used in a negative sense, whereas the word “touch” has a positive meaning. </p>
<p data-content-id="URtKIt0L_s2x9jmmgG_xz0xxo9XCdhKgCltl2BQUyoJ1J6-naGmt6MTZtNA2Ufk2K"> According to the record of the Gospels, a number of times people pressed upon the Lord. But only those who touched Him received any benefit. It is through a direct touch with the Lord that life is imparted from Him to us. This impartation of life we call transmission or infusion. Another term is <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> dispensing. When we contact the Lord directly, we receive the divine dispensing. But pressing upon the Lord does not accomplish anything as far as the divine dispensing is concerned. We experience the divine dispensing only by directly touching the Lord. Because the Lord realized this, He wanted to separate Himself from the crowd. For this reason He withdrew with His disciples to the sea. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="MM4hI37Bq0acKu7ubcryFTufA5Jn_2rlWqgP_ZCAOT51o90taGoOAfheGhkXDu6gu">A Little Boat</h2><p data-content-id="VWxmQv7W4uiwj768G3AdTbXWheU0GEWYtKu8tNXSAC0wKB8UNji7nnTh2Yra9R3z7"> Although the Lord left the crowd, the crowd continued to follow Him. Because of this, even when He was at the seashore the crowd was seeking to press upon Him. Hence, He told His disciples that a little boat should stand ready near Him. He did not want the crowd to press upon Him. The boat was a means for the Lord Jesus to be separated from the crowd. </p>
<p data-content-id="isH1YhKLP27GpYb1g-EH6B3jpPE3d1Q-bGo8ZH-xoo3romA6yrPL5uOuCKtIgHwLz"> In figure, the little boat that the Lord wanted to stand ready near Him signifies the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65452" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> the boat has this significance. The church is different from the nation of Israel, which is signified by the land. The church is also different from the Gentile world, which is signified by water. The church is something that is separated from the land and is on the water. Therefore, the church is neither on the land nor in the water. Although the church “boat” is on the water, it is not in the water, and the water is not in the boat. Therefore, the land signifies the nation of Israel, the sea signifies the Gentile world, and the boat, which is separated from both the land and the sea, signifies the church. By this we see that the church is separated both from the nation of Israel and from the Gentile world. This understanding is according to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65453" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:32">1 Corinthians 10:32</span> concerning the Jews, the Greeks (the Gentiles), and the church of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="1YZgJVvfR7nEdPygjiXBGuLFC4vhwTC01Dl5_a_Qjw4LWip4gb95cZHsWchz2v1DI"> Today the Lord is ministering His life to those in the church; He is also ministering from within the church to others. This is the significance of the boat. If we see the significance of the figure of the boat, we shall realize that if we are out of the church and try to minister to people, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> may suffer the pressing of the crowd. Today many ministries are being rendered to a crowd without a boat. However, the proper ministry is a ministry in the boat, a ministry that imparts the life supply not to those who press the Lord, but to those who sincerely desire to touch Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgAcmswr1dGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> What the Lord did concerning the crowd should be an example to us, and we should follow in His steps. However, most preachers and evangelists today appreciate a crowd. The greater the crowd, the happier they are. But the facts of history indicate that a great crowd causes a loss, not a benefit, to the genuine ministry of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="j5IxdItcgq7F7cFXF2T0jaViV23tF5HpwfjHaCnXDkXrkH_o8CLFY2KxyNHpzRRlL"> Here we see that the Lord’s way is different from man’s way. Instead of treasuring the crowd, He sought to avoid the crowd. When the crowd followed Him, He asked that a little boat be made ready in order that He might go away from the crowd that pressed upon Him. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDzsvE_qYANUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44">Receiving the Ministry of Life</h2><p data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoUSCBiey_rq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm"> Although the Lord sought to avoid the crowd, He wanted the sincere ones to be able to touch Him. If we are simply part of the crowd, we shall not receive anything from the Lord. We need to single ourselves out from among the crowd and touch Him directly and honestly. If we do this, we shall receive the ministry of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UaR5rcZwaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> The first of the auxiliary acts for the Slave-Savior’s gospel service was averting the pressing of the crowd. Concerning this, we need to learn of the Lord. Often preachers are deceived by a crowd. When a crowd surrounds us, this may be deceiving; it also may be frustrating. Hence, we need to avoid the crowd. But this does not mean that we should give up the people. No, as we avoid the crowd, we need to allow others to contact us, to touch us, directly in order to receive the genuine ministry of life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxfOGQrXb4uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr">The Unclean Spirits</h2><p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxPZpr63sS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65454" data-verses="Mark 3:11-12">Mark 3:11 and 12</span> say, “And the unclean spirits, when they beheld Him, fell before Him and cried out, saying, You are the Son of God! And He warned them many times that <span class="pg" data-page-id="101" id="101">[101]</span> they should not make Him manifest.” The crying out of the demons concerning the Slave-Savior was also a frustration to His gospel service. Therefore, He warned them and forbade them. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wpXywTj2q7bZ6nRb6mQXs3746v2MilKq_Qrlx_oVfo-DxccuXUCSfxlA5gn9T8oHg">APPOINTING THE APOSTLES TO PREACH</h2><p data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98qQBBEk40xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB"> We have seen that the Slave-Savior first needed the sea and then a little boat to avert the pressing of the crowd. This indicates that the crowd pressing upon Him was a frustration to His gospel service. In order to get away from the crowd, the Lord went to the sea. Later, He went from the sea to a mountain. </p>

<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GQ7W6hk-MeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65474" data-verses="Mark 3:7-35">3:7-35</span> we see five auxiliary acts for the Slave-Savior’s gospel service: averting the crowd’s pressing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65475" data-verses="Mark 3:7-12">vv. 7-12</span>), appointing the apostles to preach (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65476" data-verses="Mark 3:13-19">vv. 13-19</span>), not eating because of the urgent need (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65477" data-verses="Mark 3:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>), binding Satan and plundering his house by the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65478" data-verses="Mark 3:22-30">vv. 22-30</span>), and not remaining in the relationship of the natural life but in that of the spiritual life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65479" data-verses="Mark 3:31-35">vv. 31-35</span>). In the foregoing message we covered the first three of these auxiliary acts. In this message we shall consider the last two—the binding of Satan and the Lord’s not remaining in the relationship of the natural life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_vR7LsZpEraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV">BINDING SATAN AND PLUNDERING HIS HOUSE<br/>BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="hx_zzSpG4rVvnFzTR3v6oGI79ejIThvBxQ7OaGa7mOy9TYjUhbSqG4WclLusd8YDB"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65480" data-verses="Mark 3:21">3:21</span>, the Lord’s “relatives went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, He is beside Himself.” This exclamation expressing natural concern on the part of the Slave-Savior’s relatives regarding Him opened the way for the scribes to blaspheme Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65481" data-verses="Mark 3:22">Verse 22</span> says, “And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and by the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons.” This was a word of blasphemy ushered in by the expression of natural concern in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65482" data-verses="Mark 3:21">verse 21</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="URtKIt0L_s2x9jmmgGPx7mhxo9XCdhKgCltl2BQUyoJ1J6-naGmt6MTZtNA2Ufk2K"> Because the Lord’s relatives could not understand Him, they said that He was beside Himself. This saying opened the door for the scribes, the opposers, to defame the Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> The scribes could have said, “You see, even his relatives say that he is beside himself. Do you know why he is beside himself? He is beside himself because he has a demon, and this demon is Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.” The Slave-Savior cast out demons, the evil workers for the dark kingdom of Satan; yet the opposers said that He did it by the ruler of the demons. What subtlety of the evil one, who motivated these evil opposers to say this! They were his co-workers and were even one with him. </p>
<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJd1C_2XqJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> Beelzebub means the lord of flies, the name of a god of the Ekronites (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65483" data-verses="2Kings 1:2">2 Kings 1:2</span>). It was changed in contempt by the Jews to Baalzebel, which means lord of the dunghill, and was used for the ruler of the demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65484" data-verses="Matthew 12:24">Matt. 12:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65485" data-verses="Luke 11:15">Luke 11:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65486" data-verses="Luke 11:18-19">18-19</span>). The scribes reviled the Slave-Savior by saying that He cast out demons by the ruler of demons. This most blasphemous name expressed their strongest objection and rejection. </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQusRxuu7ZSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> No doubt, the name Beelzebub refers to the Devil. The Devil is lord of flies and lord of the dunghill. The scribes could not have chosen a worse term with which to defame the Lord Jesus. They said not only that He had a demon, but that He was under Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons. This blasphemy was so serious that the Lord later indicated that it was unforgivable, being a blasphemy against the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65487" data-verses="Mark 3:28-30">Mark 3:28-30</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNBsfvFRk0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> We need to remember that the door for such a defamation was opened by the word of the Lord’s relatives, their word that He was beside Himself. They accused the Lord of being abnormal, and this gave opportunity for the scribes to defame Him. The scribes could have said, “He certainly is abnormal, for he has a demon, Beelzebub.” From this we see that it is possible for our relatives’ natural love for us to open the door for Satan to come in. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6w29ty7IyYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65488" data-verses="Mark 3:23-25">Mark 3:23-25</span> says, “And calling them to Himself, He said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand; and if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.” The Lord’s word here indicates that <span class="pg" data-page-id="111" id="111">[111]</span> Satan has not only a house but also a kingdom. His house is a house of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65489" data-verses="1John 3:8">1 John 3:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65490" data-verses="1John 3:10">10</span>), and his kingdom is a kingdom of darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65491" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Col. 1:13</span>). Sinners belong both to Satan’s house and to his kingdom. The demons belong to his kingdom and possess people for his kingdom. Satan is the ruler of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65492" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>) and the ruler of the power of the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65493" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Eph. 2:2</span>). He has his authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65494" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>) and his angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65495" data-verses="Matthew 25:41">Matt. 25:41</span>), who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65496" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>). Hence, Satan has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65497" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Col. 1:13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocZqHGHsKNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> We have seen that Satan has both a house and a kingdom. Satan’s kingdom is against God’s kingdom, and Satan’s house is against God’s house. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8dZpuUKoxkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65498" data-verses="Mark 3:26">Mark 3:26</span> the Lord points out that if “Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but has an end.” Then He continues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65499" data-verses="Mark 3:27">verse 27</span>, “But no one can enter into the house of the strong one to plunder his goods unless he first bind the strong one, and then he will plunder his house.” The “goods” here are sinners kept in Satan’s house for his kingdom. The Slave-Savior bound Satan, the strong one, and entered into his house to plunder his goods so that the sinners might be brought into the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65500" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19">Eph. 2:19</span>) through regeneration for the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65501" data-verses="John 3:5">John 3:5</span>). While the Slave-Savior was doing the gospel service, He was binding the strong one, Satan. The gospel service is a warfare to destroy Satan and his kingdom of darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6seqiliHMnl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65502" data-verses="Mark 3:27">verse 27</span> indicates that while He was preaching the gospel, He was binding the strong one in order to destroy his kingdom by plundering his house. In other words, the Lord’s preaching was a plundering. Satan has captured all sinners and has placed them into his house, which is a prison. Hence, all sinners have become Satan’s captives. But the Lord Jesus, who has the power of the Spirit, has come to preach the gospel. He has come to plunder Satan’s house and to release his captives. </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-Fbo29ZvWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> If we did not have the Lord’s word recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65503" data-verses="Mark 3:27">verse 27</span>, <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> we would not realize that when we preach the gospel we should plunder Satan’s house. We may think that gospel preaching is simply a matter of soul winning, a matter of saving lost sinners. The Lord, however, has a different concept concerning the preaching of the gospel. His concept is that the preaching of the gospel to save sinners is the plundering of Satan’s house to release his captives. To be sure, this plundering destroys Satan’s kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaRHaNEwjU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> The word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65504" data-verses="Mark 3:27">3:27</span> corresponds to the Lord’s word to Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65505" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>: “To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God.” When Paul was called by God to preach the gospel, he was told to turn people from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God. The authority of Satan is simply the kingdom of Satan. Today when we preach the gospel to sinners, we also should turn them, Satan’s captives, from the authority of darkness unto God and His kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QBC150Yxyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65506" data-verses="Mark 3:28-29">Mark 3:28 and 29</span> the Lord went on to say to the scribes, “Truly I say to you, that all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and blasphemies, whatever they may blaspheme; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an everlasting sin.” The Lord’s word here concerning the Holy Spirit indicates that the Slave-Savior’s gospel service, especially in the casting out of demons to destroy the dark kingdom of Satan, was by the Holy Spirit. The Lord had been anointed by the Spirit and He was continually led by the Spirit in His move (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65507" data-verses="Luke 4:18">Luke 4:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65508" data-verses="Luke 4:1">1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65509" data-verses="Mark 1:12">Mark 1:12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8BkiJum_3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> As He was preaching the gospel, the Lord was destroying the kingdom of Satan by the power of the Holy Spirit. At the time of His baptism He denied Himself, having Himself buried in the waters of death. The Lord would not do anything by His own power, strength, or energy. On the contrary, He did everything by the Holy Spirit. In particular, by the Holy Spirit He preached the gospel in order to plunder Satan’s house and destroy his kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYl0ek0hRaxklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65510" data-verses="Matthew 12:28">Matthew 12:28</span> indicates that when the Lord Jesus was destroying Satan’s kingdom by preaching the gospel, He <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> was bringing in the kingdom of God: “But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you.” The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God. Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground. </p>

<p data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoUSChibgPrq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm"> Once again I would call your attention to the sequence of the narration of the Gospel of Mark. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65538" data-verses="Mark 1:14-45">1:14-45</span> we have the contents of the gospel service: preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65539" data-verses="Mark 2:1">2:1—3:6</span> we see the ways of carrying out the gospel service: forgiving the sins of the sick, feasting with sinners, causing His followers to be merry without fasting, caring for His followers’ hunger rather than for religion’s regulation, and caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion. Following this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65540" data-verses="Mark 3:7-35">3:7-35</span> we have five auxiliary acts for the gospel service: averting the crowd’s pressing, appointing the apostles to preach, not eating because of the urgent need, binding Satan and plundering his house by the Holy Spirit, and not remaining in the relationship of the natural life but in that of the spiritual life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UaRZrWLwaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK">THE KINGDOM OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxfOmQgFL4uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr"> Although we see in these three sections a complete view concerning the gospel, we do not see the intrinsic essence of the gospel. Neither do we see in these sections of Mark the purpose of the gospel and its issue. We do not yet see what the gospel is for. This is the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65541" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span> the record of this Gospel comes to the matter of the kingdom of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgAcGswp1dGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65542" data-verses="Mark 1:15">1:15</span> we have the first utterance of the Lord Jesus in His gospel preaching: “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent and believe in the gospel!” This verse indicates clearly that the gospel is for the kingdom, and this kingdom is neither the kingdom of man nor the kingdom of Israel, but the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="j5IxdItcgq7F7cFXF2z0jYViV23tF5HpwfjHaCnXDkXrkH_o8CLFY2KxyNHpzRRlL"> What is the kingdom of God? It is not easy to define the kingdom. In order to understand what the kingdom of God is, we need to consider the entire Old Testament, for in the Old Testament we have a clear view of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDzsvk_pYgNUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44"> We may say that a kingdom is a sphere, or a realm, where a person accomplishes something. Sometimes we say that a certain person has his own kingdom. This means that he has a realm, a sphere, where he can work to reach his goal or fulfill his plan. Hence, a kingdom is a realm where a person does what he wants to do. According to the Old Testament, there is a realm called the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is a sphere, a realm, for God to work out His eternal purpose and accomplish His goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoUSChidyfrq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm"> After creating the heavens, the earth, and billions of items, God created man. According to the book of Genesis, God created man for a twofold purpose. On the positive side, God created man in His image so that man may express Him. On the negative side, God gave man His dominion over all created things. Dominion means authority in a particular realm or sphere. Dominion, therefore, is related to God’s kingdom. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65543" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> we see that with man we have God’s image and God’s dominion. God’s image is for His expression, and God’s dominion is for His kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UaRZrfYQaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> God in His creation wanted man to express Him. In order to have such an expression, God needs a sphere, and this sphere is a kingdom, a realm where God can exercise His authority. God gave His authority to man and established man as the head of all created things. By this we see that immediately after the creation of man, God set up a kingdom on earth. The kingdom of God, therefore, can be seen in the first chapter of Genesis. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxfOmQoW74uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr"> Eventually, after the fall of man, God called Abraham, <span class="pg" data-page-id="119" id="119">[119]</span> Isaac, and Jacob. The book of Genesis records the experiences of these patriarchs and of the children of Israel and their sojourn in Egypt. According to the record in Exodus, God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65544" data-verses="Exodus 19:6">Exodus 19:6</span> reveals God’s purpose in bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt: “Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.” The Lord brought the children of Israel out of Egypt in order to make them a kingdom of priests, a kingdom in which everyone would be a priest, one who serves God. Hence, God’s goal was to have a priestly kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxPZJr53MS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65545" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Exodus 19</span> until the end of the Old Testament we have the record of the history of a kingdom. We should not regard this kingdom merely as the kingdom of Israel. Rather, this was the kingdom of God expressed in the kingdom of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="wpXywTj2q7bZ6nRb6mwXv3b46v2MilKq_Qrlx_oVfo-DxccuXUCSfxlA5gn9T8oHg"> As we study the Old Testament, we see that God was not able to accomplish His purpose with Adam, Noah, or the nation of Israel. Although the kingdom of God was expressed in the kingdom of Israel, God was not able to reach His goal through the children of Israel. Therefore, eventually God Himself came through the way of incarnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98qQhBHnY0xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB"> Not being able to fulfill His purpose through the first Adam and his descendants, God came through incarnation as the last Adam. As God incarnate, the Lord Jesus came to establish the kingdom of God, to establish a realm in which God can carry out His purpose through the exercise of His authority. This was the reason the Lord taught His disciples to pray for the coming of the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65546" data-verses="Matthew 6:10">Matt. 6:10</span>). This was also the reason the Lord Jesus in His preaching of the gospel told people to repent for the kingdom of God. The Lord declared that the kingdom of God had drawn near and that people must repent in order to enter into the kingdom. Those who repent because the kingdom of God has drawn near will be able to participate in the accomplishment of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TG7Gs6bcc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl">THE GOAL AND ISSUE OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPCA4nsMSBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> In the preaching of the gospel, the kingdom of God is <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> often neglected. Much of today’s gospel preaching gives people the impression that the gospel is only for soul winning, for transferring people out of hell into heaven, for helping people have peace, joy, and eternal blessing. In the New Testament, however, we have a different impression concerning the gospel. When the Lord Jesus preached the gospel, He spoke concerning the kingdom of God, and He told them to repent for the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTRHoMxBKm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> One day, in His training of His disciples, the Lord brought them to Caesarea Philippi, which is in the northern part of the Holy Land, close to the border, at the foot of Mount Hermon. Then the Lord began to ask His disciples concerning Himself: “Who do men say that the Son of Man is?...But you, who do you say that I am?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65547" data-verses="Matthew 16:13">Matt. 16:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65548" data-verses="Matthew 16:15">15</span>). Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65549" data-verses="Mark 4:16">v. 16</span>). Peter recognized the Lord as the Christ, the Son of the living God. This means that the Son of the living God was appointed to be God’s anointed One, the Christ. After Peter received this revelation concerning the Lord, the Lord went on to say, “On this rock I will build My church....I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens...” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65550" data-verses="Mark 4:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>). In these verses the words “church” and “kingdom” are used interchangeably. First the Lord said, “I will build My church,” and then, “I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.” This indicates that in order for the church to be built, the kingdom needs to be opened. In other words, opening the kingdom is the way to begin the building of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxhymimc2nJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> We need to see the crucial matter that the intrinsic essence of the gospel is the kingdom. The gospel is preached for the kingdom, and the kingdom is a divine sphere for God to work out His plan, a realm where God can exercise His authority to accomplish what He intends. The only way for God to reach His goal is through the kingdom. Therefore, there is a section in the Gospel of Mark revealing the purpose of the gospel. The purpose of the gospel is to have the kingdom. The kingdom of God is the goal of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkpy12xKj1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> The kingdom of God is not only the goal of the gospel, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="121" id="121">[121]</span> also the issue of the gospel. When the gospel is preached, what will be the outcome? What will be the issue of the gospel? This outcome, this issue, is the kingdom. The preaching of the gospel is to bring forth the kingdom. </p>

<p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxhzWiiO2nJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> The word “kingdom,” no doubt, denotes some kind of ruling. To say that we are practicing the kingdom life means that we are under God’s ruling. In this message, however, we shall consider the kingdom of God from a very different point of view. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkpzF20Yz1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm">THE SEED OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="Pu9555BwdXseDKhVGcTfjLEuIg4gGqssN05hXWqG5AOWLMiJFHRYC9yb9EUElWhG0"> Let us begin our consideration of the kingdom by asking the following question: What is the gospel? We may say that the gospel is a wonderful Person, a wonderful God-man. The gospel tells us that one day the very God became incarnate. This wonderful One, God incarnate, was the God-man. When He reached the age of thirty, He came forth to preach the gospel. As we pointed out in a previous message, the gospel is the replacement of the entire Old Testament, for it is the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types and it is also the removal of the law. With the coming of the God-man, Jesus Christ, the Old Testament was over. This One is Himself the gospel. The gospel, therefore, is this wonderful God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="-5AXIggToD6uMh3UFveeLXpfYbf5HiOdJu1FrqXNWLmcCgTAMm7L2e-ug40_gpPOy"> According to the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65568" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span> of the Gospel of Mark, we may say that the gospel is the wonderful God-man coming to sow Himself as a seed of life. This seed of life is conveyed in the Lord’s word. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65569" data-verses="Mark 4:2-3">4:2 and 3</span> say, “And He taught them many things in parables, and said to them in His teaching: Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.” In Greek the word “taught” is in the imperfect tense, <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> indicating repeated action in the past. The word “sower” indicates that the Slave-Savior, who was the Son of God, came to sow Himself as the seed of life in His word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65570" data-verses="Mark 4:14">v. 14</span>) into men’s hearts so that He might grow in them, live in them, and be expressed from within them. The seed sown here is the word that proceeded out of the mouth of the Slave-Savior. Hence, His word is the seed, and in this seed is the divine life. Actually, this seed of the divine life is the Lord Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaRG6NEyjU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> The seed sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65571" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span> of Mark is the seed of the gospel. Just as a carnation seed is actually the carnation itself, so the seed of the gospel is the gospel itself. As the God-man, Jesus Christ is the seed of the gospel. When we speak of the seed of the gospel, we mean that this seed is the gospel, just as a carnation seed is a carnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QBDV50axyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65572" data-verses="Mark 4:1">Mark 4</span> we have the seed of the gospel, or the gospel as a seed. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65573" data-verses="Mark 4:3">4:3</span>, as the Lord was teaching He was sowing. This sowing was the Slave-Savior’s preaching of the gospel of God that brought in the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65574" data-verses="Mark 1:14-15">1:14-15</span>). It was, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65575" data-verses="Mark 4:26">4:26</span>, the sowing of this seed of life in the word spoken by the Slave-Savior. This indicates that His gospel service was to sow the divine life into the people whom He served. The growth of this life depends upon the condition of the ones served by Him, with its issue differing according to their various conditions, as portrayed in the parable of the sower (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65576" data-verses="Mark 4:1-20">4:1-20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8BlCJtmf3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> The Lord Jesus sowed the seed into the human heart. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65577" data-verses="Mark 4:1">Mark 4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65578" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> the human heart is likened to soil. Our heart is the field, the soil, into which the Lord Jesus has sown Himself as the seed of life, which is the seed of the gospel. In the parable of the sower, the Lord Jesus is both the Sower and the seed sown. As the Sower, the Lord sows Himself as the seed of life through His word. </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYl0fE0iR6xklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> In the parable of the sower itself there is no mention of the kingdom of God. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65579" data-verses="Mark 4:3">4:3</span> the Lord does not say anything about the kingdom; instead, He tells us that the sower went out to sow. Why is there no mention of the kingdom in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65580" data-verses="Mark 4:1-8">4:1-8</span>? The reason is that, although the kingdom <span class="pg" data-page-id="127" id="127">[127]</span> of God had drawn near, it had not yet come. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65581" data-verses="Mark 4:26">4:26</span> we see that the kingdom had come. This was the reason the Lord could say, “So is the kingdom of God....” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65582" data-verses="Mark 4:30">4:30</span> the Lord went on to ask, “How shall we liken the kingdom of God?” In the parable of the seed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65583" data-verses="Mark 4:26-29">vv. 26-29</span>) and in the parable of the mustard seed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65584" data-verses="Mark 4:30-34">vv. 30-34</span>) the kingdom of God was there. But in the first parable, the parable of the sower, the kingdom of God had not yet come. As we have seen, in this parable the seed of the kingdom is sown. </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPf0TRSIlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> When the Lord sowed the seed of the kingdom of God, He sowed Himself into His disciples. Then this seed of the kingdom passed through a process of development within the disciples for three and a half years. As a result, when the day of Pentecost came, the kingdom of God was present with the disciples. The time from the Lord’s coming forth to preach the gospel until the day of Pentecost was less than four years. That was a period of time for the seed sown into the “earth” to grow. The seed continued to grow and develop until the day of Pentecost, when the kingdom was clearly present with Peter and the one hundred twenty. </p>
<p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEYSxTpMZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> It is easy to speak concerning the outward aspect of the kingdom. But it is difficult to talk about the kingdom of God in the inner way of life. We need to be impressed with the fact that the kingdom of God is very different from the kingdom of man. The kingdom of man is a matter of organization. The kingdom of God is not a matter of organization; rather, the kingdom of God is absolutely a matter of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w8YBEl_ZS764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> What is the kingdom of God? The kingdom of God is actually the God-man, Jesus Christ, sown as a seed into His believers. After this seed has been sown into them, it will grow in them and eventually develop into a kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="O8UhUNYqCBnM85L85xnfLDU6jIJZsoKJvEqYZJW8OEAFLWMdG4aWhxw5QHfd9cISQ"> Jesus Christ is the seed of the kingdom of God, and this seed has been sown into those who believe in Him. Now this seed is growing and developing within the believers. Eventually, this growth and development will have an issue, and the issue will be the kingdom. Then this issue, the kingdom, will bring all the Lord’s believers to reach the goal. This goal also is the kingdom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65585" data-verses="Mark 4:1">Chapter four</span> of the Gospel of <span class="pg" data-page-id="128" id="128">[128]</span> Mark serves the particular purpose of revealing the kingdom to us in this way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-7zDZGP-H6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF">THE INTRINSIC ELEMENT OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9b73ACXxB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m"> In this message I am not concerned with a verse-by-verse study of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65586" data-verses="Mark 4:1-34">4:1-34</span>, nor even with a study of the different parables. My burden is that we may see what the kingdom of God is. It is crucial for us to see that the gospel is the gospel of the kingdom of God. This gospel is actually the God-man, Jesus Christ, sown into us as a life seed, a seed which is the seed of the kingdom. This seed is now growing and developing in us. Eventually, a kingdom will issue from the growth and development of this seed. </p>
<p data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAemQjyp-6qrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj"> If we say that in the Lord’s recovery we are practicing the kingdom life, we need to realize that this kingdom is not something of organization. No, this kingdom is something of the inner life, a life which is actually the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. He has been sown into our being as a seed, and now He is growing and developing within us. Praise the Lord that this seed is in each one of us and is now growing and developing in us! The growth and development of this seed will issue in the kingdom. Furthermore, this kingdom will bring us to the destination so that God’s goal may be reached. Do you know what this goal is? This goal is the full development of the kingdom of God. </p>

The kingdom of God is not produced by activity or organization. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="134" id="134">[134]</span> kingdom of God is actually God Himself sown into human beings and developing in them into a kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TG6ms6Zcc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> We need to be impressed with the fact that the kingdom of God is not a matter of teaching, activity, or organization. On the contrary, the kingdom of God is the Triune God in His incarnation sown into His chosen people to grow and develop in them into a kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPCBYnvMyBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> In this brief definition of the kingdom we have a statement of the intrinsic element of the entire teaching of the New Testament. What does the New Testament teach us? The New Testament teaches us that the Triune God has been incarnated in order to be sown into His chosen people and then develop within them into a kingdom. This is the intrinsic element of the New Testament teaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTRGIMyBqm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> If we read the New Testament in this light, we shall see that the Triune God became a man. When this man, Jesus Christ, began to preach the gospel and teach the truth, He was sowing Himself into others. This means that His preaching of the gospel and His teaching of the truth were actually a sowing of Himself into those who heard Him. While He was preaching and teaching, He was sowing His word into His hearers. His word conveyed Himself into them. Hence, through His word He Himself as the God-man, the Triune God in humanity, was sown into His chosen people. Preaching and teaching were His way of sowing Himself as the seed of the kingdom. When God’s chosen people heard the word of this God-man and received it, they were actually receiving a wonderful Person, the One who is both the Triune God and a real man. This is what is recorded in the four Gospels. </p>
<p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxhzGildWnJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> The four Gospels reveal the Triune God incarnated. This God-man eventually came forth to sow Himself into God’s chosen people by preaching and teaching. When those who had been chosen by God heard His word and received it, they received the seed, the gene, of the kingdom. This seed, this gene, is the incarnated God, the Triune God in humanity. In the Gospels we have the sowing of this seed of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkpzV2yLD1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> In the Acts we have the propagation and spreading of <span class="pg" data-page-id="135" id="135">[135]</span> this sowing. In the Gospels we do have some spreading, first from one Sower to twelve sowers and then from twelve sowers to seventy sowers. But in Acts hundreds and even thousands of sowers were raised up. All these sowers were those who received the seed, the gene. By receiving the seed they became those who could then sow it into others. In this way we have the propagation of the sowing and of the seed. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pu9555BwdXseDKhVGcDfqYEuIg4gGqssN05hXWqG5AOWLMiJFHRYC9yb9EUElWhG0"> In the Epistles we see the growing of the seed, the gene of the kingdom. We see this growth, in particular, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65621" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">chapter three</span> of 1 Corinthians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65622" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9b</span> Paul says, “You are God’s farm.” Elsewhere in the same chapter Paul says, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65623" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6">v. 6</span>). Here in this chapter we have the growth, the development, of the seed. </p>
<p data-content-id="-5AXIggToD6uMh3UFvOeDE5fYbf5HiOdJu1FrqXNWLmcCgTAMm7L2e-ug40_gpPOy"> Further development of the kingdom gene is seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65624" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">chapter one</span> of 2 Peter. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65625" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span>, God’s “divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness.” All things pertaining to the divine life have been given to us for the purpose of development. We have a description of this development in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65626" data-verses="2Peter 1:5-7">2 Peter 1:5-7</span>: “Supply bountifully in your faith virtue, and in virtue knowledge, and in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness, and in godliness brotherly love, and in brotherly love love.” Here we have the steps of the development of the seed unto maturity. Peter indicates that if we have this development, “So shall be richly and bountifully supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65627" data-verses="2Peter 1:11">v. 11</span>). Hence, we clearly have in the Epistles the development of the seed of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZVSpVAhg_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> The harvest of this seed is found in the last book of the New Testament, the book of Revelation. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65628" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span>, we first have the firstfruit and then the harvest. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65629" data-verses="Revelation 14:4">Revelation 14:4</span> speaks of those who “were purchased from among men as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65630" data-verses="Revelation 14:15">verse 15</span> we see that the “harvest of the earth is ripe.” </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHmefC5vniWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> Those who are the firstfruit spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65631" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14 </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="136" id="136">[136]</span> will be among those who will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium. The millennium, the thousand years, will be the full development of the gene of the kingdom. During the millennium many of those who have received the kingdom gene will be co-kings with Christ. At that time our Father might boast to His enemy, “Little Satan, where are you? You are in the abyss. I ask you, Satan, to look at My kingdom. I especially ask you to look at all those who are now co-kings with Christ. Many who have believed in My Son and received the gene of the kingdom have become co-kings with Him. My Son is the King, and all the overcoming believers are His co-kings. Satan, look at the King and the co-kings. What a wonderful kingdom this is!” </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl8yUj6KtbDYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> Our God is the everlasting God, the eternal One, and with Him there is no element of time. “One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65632" data-verses="2Peter 3:8">2 Pet. 3:8</span>). From God’s point of view, the thousand years of the millennium will simply be one day for Him to display His wonderful kingdom. But for Satan that display of the kingdom will last a thousand years. During that time Satan will be bound in the abyss. </p>
<p data-content-id="2biGa_BPHwBMmqGIp-XaBdy4wtrRfcU4sHxDfRZzyMIzlPqgeTUisrY2QHdBIBzZK"> At the end of the millennium, Satan will be released and allowed to rebel again. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65633" data-verses="Revelation 20:7-8">Revelation 20:7 and 8</span> say, “And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog.” Although Satan will instigate rebellion among the nations, he will not be able to touch the co-kings, for they will have been transformed by the kingdom gene. All the rebellious element that is in the fallen humanity of these co-kings will have been swallowed up by the kingdom gene. Therefore, it will be impossible for Satan, the evil one, to instigate the “kingdom-gene people” to rebel against God. However, a large number of those in the restored nations will follow him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65634" data-verses="Revelation 20:9">Revelation 20:9</span> tells us the outcome of this last rebellion: “And they went up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city; and fire came down out of heaven and <span class="pg" data-page-id="137" id="137">[137]</span> devoured them.” Those of the restored nations who do not join in the rebellion will be transferred into the new earth. </p>

In particular, we have paid attention to the seed of the kingdom as the intrinsic element of the kingdom. Now we shall go on to consider the relationship between the church and the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocZrHGA_qNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> The church and the kingdom are among the greatest subjects in the Bible. If we read the New Testament carefully and properly, we shall see the importance of the church and the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8dZouUM7BkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65704" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3</span>, very near the beginning of the New Testament, we have a word concerning the kingdom. John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65705" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">Matt. 3:2</span>). John the Baptist’s preaching was the initiation of God’s New Testament economy. Repentance in the preaching of John the Baptist, as the opening of God’s New Testament economy, was to have a turn for the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that God’s New Testament economy is focused on His kingdom. </p>

After they responded, the Lord went on to ask, “But you, who do you say that I am?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65708" data-verses="Matthew 16:15">v. 15</span>). Receiving a revelation <span class="pg" data-page-id="144" id="144">[144]</span> from the Father, Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65709" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">v. 16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-7zD5GP8H6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65710" data-verses="Ephesians 5:32">Ephesians 5:32</span>, there is a great mystery of two parts, Christ and the church. Because the Father’s revelation concerning Christ is only the first half of this great mystery, the Lord went on to speak concerning the church: “And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65711" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matt. 16:18</span>). This indicates strongly that the church must be something of Christ and for Christ. First, Christ was recognized, known, and even possessed. Then the Lord said that on “this rock” He would build His church. “This rock” refers not only to Christ but also to the revelation of Christ, which Peter received from the Father. The church is built on this revelation concerning Christ. Hence, the “rock” here is not merely Christ Himself; it is also the realization, knowledge, experience, and possession of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9b7XACVxB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m"> Today many claim to recognize that Christ is the foundation of the church. However, they have not seen that the real foundation for the building of the church is the realization of Christ. If we do not realize Christ in our experience, we shall not have the foundation for the building of the church. Therefore, we must know Christ. Then our knowing, experiencing, enjoying, and possessing of Christ will be the foundation upon which He will build the church. </p>

I would not say that these terms are synonymous; however, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65713" data-verses="Matthew 16:18-19">verses 18 and 19</span> they are used interchangeably. This is strong proof that the genuine church is the kingdom in this age.

We have the first aspect of this fulfillment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65716" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> and the second aspect in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65717" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>. In these two instances Peter used two keys. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65718" data-verses="Matthew 16:19">Matthew 16:19</span> the Lord spoke of keys, not of one key. On the day of Pentecost, as recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65719" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapter two</span> of Acts, Peter used one of the keys to open the door for the Jewish people to come into the kingdom. Then in the house of Cornelius, as recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65720" data-verses="Acts 10:1">chapter ten</span> of Acts, Peter used the second key to open the door for the Gentiles to come in. This is the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65721" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> we see that both Jews and Gentiles are built up together into the one church: “So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65722" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19-20">vv. 19-20</span>). </p>

This indicates that when the church is first mentioned in the New Testament, it is mentioned in relation to the kingdom. Furthermore, as we have seen, in these verses the church and the kingdom are interchangeable terms. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65726" data-verses="Mark 4:26-29">4:26-29</span> we have the parable of the seed. “And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65727" data-verses="Mark 4:26">v. 26</span>).

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65731" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9b</span>, a word addressed to the church in Corinth, Paul says, “You are God’s farm.” Literally, the Greek word translated “farm” means cultivated land. The church is God’s farm, His field, His cultivated land. If we consider Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65732" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span> along with the parable of the seed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65733" data-verses="Mark 4:26-29">Mark 4:26-29</span>, we shall see that Paul’s word helps us understand the relationship between the church and the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="eW1-pGBoAGH7gOu2HjhWZyx2iEuzXGZKhHTHlippcE-tSBQA2AEb8Btsa6mr5pa6x"> We may use gardening as an illustration of the relationship between the church and the kingdom. In the yard of my home there is a little garden that we may call a kingdom—the kingdom of plants. This kingdom of plants illustrates the kingdom that was sown as a seed in the Gospels. In the Epistles this seed grows and develops, and, eventually, in the book of Revelation, there will be a harvest. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65734" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> speaks of the firstfruit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65735" data-verses="Revelation 14:4">v. 4</span>) and then of the reaping of the harvest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65736" data-verses="Revelation 14:14-16">vv. 14-16</span>). That harvest will be the full development of the kingdom, and, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65737" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>, the field in which the harvest is growing is the church. Hence, using the illustration of my garden, we may say that the garden itself portrays the church, and the plants growing in the garden portray the kingdom. This illustration helps us to see how the kingdom is in the church. The Gospel of Matthew especially reveals that in the church today we have the reality of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4ejdQaj1cuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> Suppose in my yard there was only the bare ground, the soil, without any plants growing. Would that bare ground be a garden? No, instead of being a garden, it would simply be a yard with soil. How, then, could such a yard become a <span class="pg" data-page-id="147" id="147">[147]</span> garden? It becomes a garden only by having plants growing in it. The more plants grow in the yard, the more the yard becomes a garden. In a similar way, the more the seed of the kingdom grows in the tilled ground, the farm, of the church, the more the church is the reality of the kingdom. </p>

In this message we shall consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65769" data-verses="Mark 4:35">4:35—5:43</span>. In this portion of the Gospel of Mark we have three matters: the silencing of the wind and the stilling of the sea for the voyage (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65770" data-verses="Mark 4:35-41">4:35-41</span>), the casting out of a legion of demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65771" data-verses="Mark 5:1-20">5:1-20</span>), and the healing of a woman with a flow of blood and the raising up of a dead girl (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65772" data-verses="Mark 5:21-43">5:21-43</span>). </p>

It may be surprising that at the end of this chapter we have the record of a storm on the sea. Perhaps you are wondering how the last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65774" data-verses="Mark 4:35">chapter four</span> fits in with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65775" data-verses="Mark 4:1-34">4:1-34</span>, in which we have the parables of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9b7HAKHBB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m"> First, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65776" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span> of Mark speaks concerning the kingdom of God. Then immediately after the record of the kingdom, there is a record of rebellion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65777" data-verses="Mark 4:37">Mark 4:37</span> says that a great windstorm came, and the waves beat into the boat. This is a picture of rebellion. By this we see that, at the end of this chapter on the kingdom of God, rebellion is still present. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZVSJVAjg_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> It is not sufficient to use a single word as the topic for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65778" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span>. In this chapter we first have the kingdom and <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> then the subduing of rebellion. From God’s point of view, the kingdom is the development of God Himself as the seed of life. But from the point of view of God’s enemy, the kingdom is the subduing of rebellion. </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHme_C5tniWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> Immediately after the Slave-Savior spoke a strong word on the kingdom of God, He said to His disciples, “Let us pass over to the other side. And leaving the crowd, they take Him along, as He was, in the boat, and the other boats were with Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65779" data-verses="Mark 4:35-36">vv. 35-36</span>). The rebel, Satan, then used his angels in the air and his demons in the water to stir up rebellion. Because of this “a great windstorm came, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65780" data-verses="Mark 4:37">v. 37</span>). This storm made it very difficult for the boat carrying the Lord and His disciples to cross the sea. </p>

And they awake Him and say to Him, Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” The Slave-Savior was sleeping and resting in the boat beaten by the windstorm, but at the same time the disciples were threatened by the storm. This indicates that He was above the threatening windstorm and was not bothered by it. As long as the disciples had Him with them in their boat they should, by faith in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65782" data-verses="Mark 4:40">v. 40</span>), share His rest and enjoy His peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="uamxl0odSMwfSIWjlRlAsdwo-fcQoDK5WNy2WFyi0oYKbOAd76mwgMMv-zAcUryim"> The Lord was resting peacefully, but the disciples were frightened. Because of their fear, they awakened the sleeping Slave-Savior and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” </p>

Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.” While the disciples were following Him, the Slave-Savior, as a Man with divine authority, controlled the storm that threatened them. </p>
<p data-content-id="IgKBIj9xvn3kVySf7xYlLiQZB-WDTQgX3dkNC5dvPZxfKOYTZm1eWOeBjrXPL5gF0"> Why did the Lord rebuke the wind and speak to the sea? A rebuke is not given to things without life, but to things with personality. The Slave-Savior rebuked the wind and commanded the sea to be still because in the wind were the <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> fallen angels of Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65784" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>), and in the sea were the demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65785" data-verses="Matthew 8:32">Matt. 8:32</span>). The fallen angels in the air and the demons in the water collaborated to frustrate the Slave-Savior from going to the other side of the sea because they knew that He would cast out the demons there (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65786" data-verses="Mark 5:1-20">Mark 5:1-20</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Hfo6mxQWhV9UNGGlzULbWJzqFlUtfJf1FVddN1W7drZ0yu-2uolKPKUU_XXH9aAsf">The Lord Rebuking the Wind</h2><p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudJ8YhKeSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> The Lord rebuked the wind and commanded the sea to be silent because of the rebellious angels and demons that were behind the scene. The Lord knew that the storm was instigated by these angels and demons in order to frustrate Him from going to the other side of the sea to cast out the legion of demons. When the Lord cast out those demons, that was the coming of the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-WtZvqDpYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> Now we can see that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65787" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span> the Lord spoke concerning the kingdom, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65788" data-verses="Mark 5:1">chapter five</span> He carried out the kingdom through the casting out of demons. Between the word concerning the kingdom and the carrying out of the kingdom, there is the incident of the stormy sea. After the Lord rebuked the wind and spoke to the sea, the wind ceased and there was a great calm, for the rebellion of the evil angels in the air and the demons in the water was subdued. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65789" data-verses="Mark 4:35-41">4:35-41</span> we see the kingdom as the power to subdue rebellion. </p>
<p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1JawgoYxH-0dVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> The sequence in this chapter is significant. Immediately after the unveiling of the kingdom, we have the subduing of rebellion. This is for the carrying out of the kingdom of God. </p>

The record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65794" data-verses="Mark 5:1-20">5:1-20</span> is much more detailed than that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65795" data-verses="Matthew 8:28-34">Matthew 8:28-34</span>. This is strong evidence that Mark’s Gospel, as a biography of the Slave of God, emphasizes His work instead of His word and gives more details than the other Gospels. </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNBtPvGQE0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65796" data-verses="Mark 5:2">Mark 5:2</span> says, “And when He came out of the boat, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit.” Concerning this man, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65797" data-verses="Mark 5:7">verse 7</span> says, “And crying out with a loud voice, he says, What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me!” This indicates that the possessed man was usurped by the possessing spirit to such an extent that he was used by the evil spirit to be as that spirit himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6w289y4JSYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> As soon as the Lord Jesus came into the country of the Gerasenes, the situation there was exposed to Him and His disciples. There was a man possessed by a legion of demons, and the people in that country were in the business of raising hogs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65798" data-verses="Mark 5:11-14">vv. 11-14</span>). What a terrible industry! </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocZrXGEsqNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> In His wisdom, the Slave-Savior took care of two problems at the same time. He cast out the demons from the possessed man, and He cleared up the unclean industry of hog raising. Before He went to the country of the Gerasenes, that place was full of demons and hogs. Would you like to make a home for your family in such a place? To be sure, no normal person would want to settle down in such a country. Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus went there for the purpose of casting out demons and of clearing up the unclean industry. The disciples did not know the Lord’s purpose for telling them to pass over to the other side (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65799" data-verses="Mark 4:35">4:35</span>). The Lord, of course, knew why He wanted to go to the country of the Gerasenes. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8dZo-UJoRkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> God’s people should not be in the business of raising hogs. Instead, they should raise sheep. By raising sheep, they would then have the proper sacrifices to offer to God. However, those in the country of the Gerasenes were in the unclean business of raising hogs. <span class="pg" data-page-id="155" id="155">[155]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6seqj1iEPHl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> The principle is the same among unbelievers today as it was with those in the land of the Gerasenes. Whenever human beings are occupied by demons, they will be engaged in some form of unclean business or industry. They need the Lord Jesus to come to cast out the demons and clear up all their unclean activities. </p>

In this section of the Gospel of Mark we have four matters: the Slave-Savior being despised by the Nazarenes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65824" data-verses="Mark 6:1-6">vv. 1-6</span>), the sending forth of the twelve to preach (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65825" data-verses="Mark 6:7-13">vv. 7-13</span>), the martyrdom of the forerunner of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65826" data-verses="Mark 6:14-29">6:14-29</span>), and the feeding of the five thousand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65827" data-verses="Mark 6:30-44">vv. 30-44</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPFrSF3GLFN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65828" data-verses="Mark 6:1-44">6:1-44</span>, it may appear that this section is not impressive concerning the matter of life. It may seem to us that the four incidents recorded here are merely stories. However, we believe that this record is part of the holy Scriptures breathed out by God. Of course, this chapter was written by Mark. Nevertheless, it is an inspired portion of the Word of God. Therefore, we need to look to the Lord for insight in order that we may get into the depths of such a record. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eW1-pGBoAGH7gOu2HgBWTgR2iEuzXGZKhHTHlippcE-tSBQA2AEb8Btsa6mr5pa6x">A PICTURE OF REJECTION</h2><p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4eg9QRxFcuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> First, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65829" data-verses="Mark 6:1-6">6:1-6</span> the Lord was despised and rejected by the Nazarenes. Actually, this rejection did not disturb Him or disappoint Him. Even though He left them because of their rejection of Him, this does not mean that He was disappointed or that He gave them up. The Slave-Savior wanted to do something for the Nazarenes, but they would not open to Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65830" data-verses="Mark 6:5">Mark 6:5</span> says, “And He could not do any work of power there, except to lay His hands upon a few sick people <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> and heal them.” The unbelief of the Nazarenes kept the Lord from doing many works of power among them. </p>
<p data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DaL7DHSfI3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ"> Instead of being discouraged and disappointed by the rejection of the Nazarenes, the Lord was encouraged. This is proved by the fact that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65831" data-verses="Mark 6:7-13">6:7-13</span> He sent out the twelve to do the same thing He was doing. In particular, “He gave them authority over the unclean spirits” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65832" data-verses="Mark 6:7">v. 7</span>). The Lord appointed the twelve to do what He was doing. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPFrSFxU7FN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65833" data-verses="Mark 6:14-29">6:14-29</span> we have the martyrdom of the forerunner of the gospel, John the Baptist. Humanly speaking, this must have been very disappointing. Actually, the Lord Jesus was not disappointed even by the martyrdom of John the Baptist. Following John’s martyrdom, we have the case of the Lord’s feeding and satisfying the five thousand. The rejection of the Jews in His country did not disappoint Him; rather, that rejection encouraged Him to send out His disciples. Likewise, the martyrdom of His forerunner did not disappoint Him; instead, it encouraged Him to feed more people. </p>
<p data-content-id="eW1-pGBoAGH7gOu2HgBWayR2iEuzXGZKhHTHlippcE-tSBQA2AEb8Btsa6mr5pa6x"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65834" data-verses="Mark 4:35">4:35—5:43</span> we saw how the kingdom of God meets the need of the human condition. As we pointed out, the situation of human society is portrayed in this section of the Gospel of Mark. Human society, and every individual human being as well, is full of “storms” of rebellion, demons, unclean industry (hog raising), death-sickness, and death. This is the actual situation of mankind. But the Slave-Savior has brought the kingdom to us, and the kingdom is the answer to the condition of fallen man. The kingdom subdues rebellion, the kingdom casts out demons, the kingdom clears up the unclean industry, the kingdom heals the sick, and the kingdom raises the dead. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65835" data-verses="Mark 4:35">4:35—5:43</span> we see a demonstration of the kingdom of God meeting the needs of human society. What a wonderful picture this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4eg9QZjVcuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65836" data-verses="Mark 6:1-44">6:1-44</span> Mark presents a different picture. In this picture we see rejection, hatred, and martyrdom. No matter how much blessing is brought in by the kingdom and the preaching of the gospel, the world still hates and rejects the Slave-Savior and those who work together with Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65837" data-verses="Mark 6:1-44">6:1-44</span>, therefore, we see the attitude of the worldly people <span class="pg" data-page-id="163" id="163">[163]</span> toward the gospel. What shall we do in the face of such an attitude? What should we do when we are despised, rejected, and hated, and when some are even killed? Should we be disappointed? Should we stop preaching the glad tidings and cease from our work for the kingdom? Certainly not! Instead of being disappointed, we should be encouraged by the negative attitude shown by the worldly people toward the gospel. </p>

And what wisdom is given to this man! And such works of power take place through His hands! Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?

Those who rejected Him asked, “Is not this the carpenter?” They used the word “carpenter” in a despising manner. They were astounded by His teaching, by His wisdom, and by His works of power. But they regarded Him as a person of low status. In today’s terms, they might have wondered what qualifications He had, what kind of degree He had. </p>

Why were they stumbled in Him? They were stumbled in Him because, on the one hand, they heard wonderful words out of His mouth and saw some of His marvelous deeds, and yet, on the other hand, they considered that He did not have a high status or degree. They saw Him as one who was merely a carpenter. Therefore, they were stumbled in Him, and they despised Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgAe2szpVdGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> The principle is the same today. Many Christians care about status or the degrees of others and are eager to look into such things. Some years ago I had a talk with a certain preacher who was promoting himself very much. He asked me how many among us have a doctoral degree. I did not say anything in answer to this question. My silence was an indication that we are not concerned about how many of the church members have a doctoral degree. This man went on to boast of the number of people in his group who had a <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> Ph.D. This is an illustration of the concern of today’s Christians for status and degrees. </p>

We pointed out that just as the twelve preached, cast out demons, and anointed the sick, we today need to preach the gospel, present the truth in order to cast out demons, and minister life to others by anointing them with our testimonies of the experience of Christ. In this message we shall go on to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65863" data-verses="Mark 6:14-56">6:14-56</span>, a portion of the Gospel of Mark that covers four matters: the martyrdom of the forerunner of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65864" data-verses="Mark 6:14-29">vv. 14-29</span>), the feeding of the five thousand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65865" data-verses="Mark 6:30-44">vv. 30-44</span>), the Lord’s walking on the sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65866" data-verses="Mark 6:45-52">vv. 45-52</span>), and the Slave-Savior’s healing everywhere (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65867" data-verses="Mark 6:53-56">vv. 53-56</span>). </p>

Then after the sending out of the twelve, John the Baptist, the forerunner of the gospel, was martyred. The martyrdom of John the Baptist indicates Satan’s hatred, expressed by the darkness and injustice of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> worldly people in power, toward the faithful forerunner of the Slave-Savior. </p>
<p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudJ_4hKcSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> How did it come to pass that John the Baptist was executed? This execution was carried out at the request of Herodias. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65868" data-verses="Mark 6:17-19">Mark 6:17-19</span> tells us that Herod “had sent and seized John and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her. For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have the wife of your brother. And Herodias had it in for him and wanted to kill him, and could not.” John was murdered by the darkness of politics, by the darkness of those who were in power. With Herod there was no justice. Herod had committed fornication with Herodias, the wife of his brother, and this woman hated John the Baptist. </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-Wu5vqBpYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> Herod knew that John was a righteous and holy man, and to a certain extent he had regard for him. “Herod feared John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And hearing him he was much perplexed, and heard him gladly” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65869" data-verses="Mark 6:20">v. 20</span>). It certainly was unjust for this righteous and holy man to be bound in prison. </p>
<p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1Jawgr4xE-UdVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65870" data-verses="Mark 6:21">Verse 21</span> says that “an opportune day came, when Herod on his birthday made a banquet for his great men and the captains and leading men of Galilee.” During this banquet, the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, pleasing Herod and his guests. Drugged and deceived by her dancing, Herod said to her, “Ask of me whatever you want, and I will give it to you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65871" data-verses="Mark 6:22">v. 22</span>). Following the instructions of her mother, Herodias, she asked for the head of John the Baptist. Therefore, as a result of hatred, darkness, and the indulgence in lust, the righteous and holy forerunner of the gospel was put to death. This is a vivid picture of the rejection by the world of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="zbCxXV8yEF3E20gheRKyl1tKDAYoqh_2u6LkS3jfEW09yxoZ1BBUaNJDdc2JggHVC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65872" data-verses="Mark 4:35">4:35—5:43</span> we have a picture of today’s human society.

Since this is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> situation, we should not expect to be welcomed by the world. We should never expect to be honored or highly regarded. There can be no such thing for those who serve the Lord in the gospel. If we are faithful to the Lord in His ministry, we shall be despised, and we shall suffer rejection, injustice, hatred, and perhaps even martyrdom. However, we should not be disappointed by the world’s rejection and hatred. On the contrary, we should be encouraged by it. </p>

In order to rest, “they went away in the boat to a place in the wilderness privately.” Nevertheless, a great crowd followed them. On the one hand, in this chapter we have rejection, hatred, and injustice. On the other hand, the crowd was still following the Lord. </p>

<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocZo3GHvKNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> When the disciples suggested to the Lord that He send the crowd away, He answered, “You give them something to eat” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65876" data-verses="Mark 6:35-37">vv. 35-37</span>). The Slave-Savior had compassion on the people and wanted to feed them. </p>

In figure, barley typifies the resurrected Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65879" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10">Lev. 23:10</span>). Thus the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us. The loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ’s life, but the fishes are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ’s life. To satisfy our spiritual <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> hunger, we need Christ’s generating life as well as His redeeming life. Both of these aspects are signified by small items—loaves and fishes. </p>

<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QBAF53aRyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> We should not look down on our experience and say, “We don’t have much of the Lord. We have not experienced much of Him.” Look at what the Lord can do with five loaves and two fishes. The Lord does not require more than we have. If we give Him what we have, He will bless it. When we present what we have to Him, He will pour out the blessing, bestowing His unlimited blessing on what we present to Him. </p>

We should not be bothered or disappointed by the fact that the number of those in the Lord’s recovery in this country is still rather small. It is our destiny to be despised and rejected. We may even say that God has predestinated us for this. Even the God-man was despised and rejected. If He was rejected, then we should not expect anything different. Furthermore, the Lord’s forerunner, John the Baptist, who was a landmark in history, was imprisoned and martyred. If such a thing could happen to John the Baptist, then we should not expect something better. </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPf3DRRIFXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> We should not be frightened by the fact that it is our destiny to be rejected, hated, imprisoned, and even martyred. Instead of discouraging us from taking the Lord’s way in His recovery, this should encourage us to present what we have <span class="pg" data-page-id="175" id="175">[175]</span> to the Lord. We may have only five loaves and two fishes, but we can give this to Him for His blessing. If we give the Lord what we have, He will bestow His blessing on what we offer to Him. The result will be that others will be fed and satisfied, and there will be twelve baskets left over. </p>

These learned ones, leaders in the Jewish religion, came to the Lord purposely to spy Him out. Jerusalem was far to the south, and the Lord Jesus was in the north, in Galilee. Nevertheless, the Pharisees and scribes came all this way in order to observe what the Lord Jesus was doing. </p>

In this portion we are told how the Lord Jesus passed through the stormy sea, how He healed many people, and how He was questioned by the Pharisees and scribes. However, if we look to the Lord for His enlightenment concerning this section of Mark, we shall realize that, by the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65910" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span>, there was the need for the Lord to deal with man’s inward condition. The things that took place before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65911" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> are related to man’s outward situation, not to his inward condition. The gospel, however, is for our entire being. The problem of man’s inward condition is much more serious than that of his outward situation. Actually, our inward condition is the root of all problems. </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgDc2swo1dGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> In the first six chapters of the Gospel of Mark many things are covered. But thus far nothing has touched the inward condition of fallen mankind. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65912" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> the questioning of the Lord by the Pharisees and scribes gave Him the opportunity to speak concerning man’s inward situation. The intention of the Pharisees and scribes was to condemn the Slave-Savior. But they were used by God in His sovereignty. Without them, the Lord may not have had the opportunity to talk about man’s inward condition. <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="j5IxdItcgq7F7cFXG2D0jZViV23tF5HpwfjHaCnXDkXrkH_o8CLFY2KxyNHpzRRlL"> The Pharisees and scribes certainly did not have any intention to touch the inward situation of man. They were concerned with outward formality, with outward washing and cleansing. They were not interested in anything of the inward condition of man. Nevertheless, they gave the Lord an excellent opportunity and even opened the way for Him to unveil man’s inward condition. The Lord Jesus exposed man’s inward situation not only to the Pharisees and scribes, but also to the crowd and especially to His disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65913" data-verses="Mark 7:17">v. 17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDzvvU_pZgNUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65914" data-verses="Mark 7:1-23">7:1-23</span> we have three groups of people: the entire crowd, including the Pharisees and scribes; a portion of the crowd (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65915" data-verses="Mark 7:14">v. 14</span>), and the Lord’s disciples, His intimate followers. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65916" data-verses="Mark 7:17">Verse 17</span> says, “And when He entered into a house from the crowd, His disciples questioned Him.” Then the Lord unveiled to them in a full way man’s inward condition. Eventually it was the Lord’s intimate followers who received the benefit. They came to see clearly not only man’s outward situation, but also man’s inward condition. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoURCRidzfrq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm"> As a divine-human Person, the Lord Jesus heals man’s situation. This healing takes care not only of our outward sickness, but especially of our inward sickness. Concerning this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65917" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> of the Gospel of Mark we have an important step in the Slave-Savior’s gospel service. As we have seen, before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65918" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> the Lord’s gospel service was concerned with man’s outward situation. But the Pharisees and scribes, as opposers, provided the Lord an excellent opportunity to touch the inward condition of fallen man. </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UZRprfbQaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65919" data-verses="Mark 6:1">chapter six</span> we see opposition and rejection. This chapter records the martyrdom of John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Slave-Savior, a martyrdom that was motivated by the hatred of Herodias for John. At the end of this chapter, the Lord crossed the sea and then came into a country where the people received His healing. The Lord’s disciples must have been happy and excited over what was happening. Wherever the Lord went, He was welcomed and people were healed. If we had been among the followers of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> Slave-Savior at that time, we certainly would have been happy about the situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxcOWQoV74uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr"> We may say that the Pharisees and scribes in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65920" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> were professional opposers. Probably before they came down from Jerusalem to the place where the Lord Jesus was, they were trained to spy on Him in order to have some ground to arrest Him and put Him to death. The Pharisees and scribes may have said to one another, “This one is a devil, and we must get rid of him. We must find something to convince the Roman government to put this man to death.” These trained, professional spies thought they had ground to accuse the Lord Jesus in the matter of eating with unwashed hands. Actually, they simply opened up the way for Him to speak concerning the condition of man’s heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxMZ5r62sS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> We may compare the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65921" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> to a surgeon operating on a patient. We may also say that the professional opposers prepared the “surgery room” for the Lord’s “operation.” Then He opened up man’s heart and exposed its inward condition. </p>

Here the Lord seemed to be saying, “You hypocrites only take care of the outward situation. You do not take care of man’s inward condition. Whether you wash your hands or not before eating does not mean anything. What matters is your inward condition. Let me open your heart and expose its condition.” In this chapter the Lord goes on to expose the evil condition of the heart of fallen man. </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TF72s5Z8c8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> The Pharisees and scribes came for the purpose of finding fault with the Lord Jesus.

On the one hand, He is kind and has compassion on <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> the seeking ones. But on the other hand, as indicated by the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65923" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span>, He was frank with the professional opposers, calling them hypocrites. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65924" data-verses="Mark 7:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span> the Lord went on to say to them, “Leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men....You nicely set aside the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65925" data-verses="Mark 7:13">verse 13</span> He said that they were “invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have delivered; and many such similar things you do.” </p>

Then the Lord went on to say, “Are you also in the same manner without understanding? Do you not perceive that everything from outside entering into a man cannot defile him, because it does not enter into his heart, but into the stomach, and goes out into the drain, making all foods clean?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65940" data-verses="Mark 7:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65941" data-verses="Mark 7:19">verse 19</span> the Lord refers to the heart. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65942" data-verses="Mark 7:20">verse 20</span> He continues, “That which goes out of a man, that defiles a man.” Following this, the Lord gives a list of some of the evil things that proceed out of man’s heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65943" data-verses="Mark 7:21-22">vv. 21-22</span>). </p>

Man’s heart is rotten, corrupt. <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> The heart of fallen man is corrupt to such an extent that it is incurable (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65945" data-verses="Jeremiah 17:9">Jer. 17:9</span>). Therefore, we should not think that we are good in our heart. Perhaps you are good outwardly, but there is nothing good in your heart. For this reason, Paul could confess that nothing good dwelt within him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65946" data-verses="Romans 7:18">Rom. 7:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocaq3GHtKNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> In this chapter the depth of man’s condition is exposed by the Slave-Savior. In our preaching of the gospel we also should touch the condition of man’s heart. However, much of today’s gospel preaching fails to do this. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8dapeUKpxkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> We need to see from the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65947" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> of the Gospel of Mark what our inward condition really is. The actual condition of our heart is that it is a constitution of evils. Because our heart is corrupt, we should never think that it is good. To believe that our heart is good is to be deceived and to believe a lie. Anyone who thinks that he has a good heart is deceived. Our heart is corrupt, and we should not have any trust in it. </p>
<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6sepiViHNnl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65948" data-verses="Mark 7:21">verse 21</span> the Lord Jesus uses the word “proceed.” According to this verse, evil reasonings, fornications, thefts, and murders proceed out of the heart of men. The word “proceed” implies continuation. Not only do evil things come out of man’s heart; they continually proceed out from his heart, coming forth one after another. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-GbY29YvWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD">Evil Reasonings</h2><p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaSHqNEzjU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> The first item listed by the Slave-Savior as proceeding out of man’s heart is evil reasonings. Reasonings, of course, come from the mind. The New Testament tells us that the mind of fallen man is reprobate, disapproved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65949" data-verses="Romans 1:28">Rom. 1:28</span>). Because man’s mind is reprobate, nothing that comes out of it can be accepted by God or justified by Him. Rather, the reasonings of the fallen mind of man are condemned and rejected by God. Because our fallen mind is reprobate, our reasonings are evil, no matter how good they may seem to be. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QCCF50bxyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo">Fornications and Thefts</h2><p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8CkSJtnf3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> After evil reasonings, the Lord lists fornications. We need <span class="pg" data-page-id="189" id="189">[189]</span> to be impressed with the fact that the Lord did not speak of these things in a careless way. On the contrary, knowing man’s inward situation, He speaks in a careful way of what proceeds out of man’s heart. First come the evil reasonings and then fornications. This indicates that the evil reasonings are related to fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYl3eU0iQ6xklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> The third item in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65950" data-verses="Mark 7:21">verse 21</span> is “thefts.” Some may claim that they have never stolen anything. In fact, everyone has committed theft in one way or other. Actually, fornication itself is a kind of theft, for it is a matter of obtaining something improperly. To steal is to take something illegally. In principle, fornication is in this category. Fornication is a matter of following an illegal course, a course not ordained by God. Anything that is taken illegally is a matter not only of theft but also in the principle of fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPc1DRSLlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> Although we are saved ones, children of God, our fallen nature, including our old heart, is still with us. In particular, the two evil things—fornication and theft—are crouching behind us, waiting for an opportunity to ruin us. Throughout the centuries, many Christians, including pastors and ministers, have fallen into the snare of fornication. Even many of those who love the Lord Jesus have been caught in this way. Many have disregarded the fact that their heart is evil. As a result, they failed to keep a proper distance from the opposite sex and fell into fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEbThTpPZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> In a real sense, the church life is a social life. Males and females often have contact with one another. Because of the danger of fornication, we need to keep ourselves at a proper distance from the opposite sex. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w_ZREm-5S764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> I wish to emphasize the fact that even though we have been regenerated, according to the teaching of the New Testament, our old nature remains with us. We should never forget this fact. Until our body has been redeemed, transfigured, our fallen nature will be with us. No matter how holy you may be, you need to realize that you still have your fallen nature. This is the reason I advise the saints not to be in a room alone with a member of the opposite sex. <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="O8UhUNYqCBnM85L86w3fIC06jIJZsoKJvEqYZJW8OEAFLWMdG4aWhxw5QHfd9cISQ"> I appreciate and respect this country very much. Nevertheless, I am bothered by the fact that males and females are too free in their contact with one another. Many women are not aware of the danger of being defiled. If they had such a consciousness, they would keep themselves at a proper distance from the opposite sex. </p>
<p data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-7wCJGM8n6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF"> As we have indicated, in our preaching of the gospel we need to touch the condition of man’s heart. In particular, we need to expose the fact that in principle all fallen people are fornicators and thieves. When I was preaching the gospel in China, I often used to say, “You ladies and gentlemen appear to be very nice. But suppose I could take an x-ray picture of what you are inside. If I did this, you would not have the boldness to remain here. You know that you are evil inside and unclean. Perhaps even as you are listening to this message, you are reasoning concerning evil things. You have the appearance of a lady or gentleman, but in your inward condition you are filthy.” It is a fact that evil reasonings proceed out of man’s heart, and these reasonings are related to fornication and theft. </p>
<p data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9Y6nABVRB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m"> It is very significant that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65951" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> of Mark the Slave-Savior in His gospel service touches the inward condition of man. We should remember that the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65952" data-verses="Mark 7:21-23">7:21-23</span> is a word uttered not to the crowd but to His intimate followers. It seems that here the Lord is saying, “Peter, John, James—you all need to realize that out from your hearts proceed evil reasonings, fornications, and thefts.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAelRzyp_6qrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj">Murders and Adulteries</h2><p data-content-id="GoWRQTh2JAOfaAt9wQAaubauFozX66HQ3Rw0vb4ArxIVsvkriGZ32FGW746MXwzF2"> The next item mentioned by the Lord as proceeding out of man’s heart is murder. Many murders are committed for the sake of fornication or theft. Fornication and theft often issue in murder. </p>
<p data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XIDnfC5MWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv"> Next, the Lord goes on to speak of adulteries. There is a difference between adultery and fornication. If a married person commits sin with another married person, that is adultery. But if an unmarried person commits sin with <span class="pg" data-page-id="191" id="191">[191]</span> another unmarried one, that is fornication. Here the Lord speaks concerning both fornication and adultery. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="YsklwMzN513qLhmk6BEqYYXz79rzoaz16RIy_1aceu91KDfDQgSH1KFDyFgXuTwem">Covetousness</h2><p data-content-id="EcbL8VFfQ-Sr2--Cus04Zc9C5Af8VjbkN252A17whu13YIvULldJsUdlfmPvVHC1u"> The Lord goes on to speak of covetousness. Paul tells us that he could overcome other things, but he could not overcome covetousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65953" data-verses="Romans 7:7-8">Rom. 7:7-8</span>). He could keep all of the Ten Commandments except the commandment concerning covetousness. “For I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet. But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, wrought in me coveting of every kind” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65954" data-verses="Romans 7:7-8">Rom. 7:7-8</span>). The reason Paul could not fulfill the commandment about covetousness is that this commandment is related to man’s inward condition, whereas the other commandments are concerned with outward conduct. Covetousness, like the other evil things mentioned by the Lord, proceeds out of the corruption of man’s heart. </p>

We have also seen that, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65981" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span>, the Lord Jesus gave a strong word concerning the intrinsic element of the kingdom of God. Following this, He exercised His authority, the authority of the kingdom, to deal with man’s outward situation. Concerning this, we have in Mark a picture of human society. We also have a picture showing the attitude of the worldly people toward the Lord’s gospel. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65982" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> there is a turn from the dealing with man’s outward situation to the dealing with the inward condition of man’s heart. </p>

What made her a Greek—religion, marriage, or something else—is difficult to discover. In the New Testament the word “Greek” is used to signify the Gentile world. This woman was a typical Gentile. We may say that she was manifoldly a Gentile, for she was a Greek, a Syrophoenician, and a Canaanite. Nevertheless, she came to ask the Lord to do something for her. She wanted Him to cast a demon out of her daughter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65988" data-verses="Mark 7:26">v. 26</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UZRJrfZQaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> Because this Syrophoenician woman was such a Gentile, the Lord Jesus said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65989" data-verses="Mark 7:27">v. 27</span>). Here the Lord seemed to be saying to her, “As a Gentile, you are a little dog, and I cannot throw the children’s bread to you. You are not qualified to be one of the children. You are qualified only to be a Gentile. Because I must satisfy the children first, I should not take the children’s bread and throw it to you.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxcO2QoX74uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65990" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> of the Gospel of John the Lord clearly told the Jews that He is the bread of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65991" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>). He indicated to them that He is the bread of God, the One who “comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="65992" data-verses="John 6:33">John 6:33</span>). He came down from heaven to be the bread of life to satisfy the hunger of the world. Although a word concerning this was clearly given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65993" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span>, there is not such a word in the synoptic Gospels, in Matthew, Mark, or Luke. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65994" data-verses="Mark 7:27">Mark 7:27</span> the Lord Jesus used the word “bread.” He said that the bread should first be given to the children. </p>
<p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxMZZr52MS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> What the Lord says concerning the children’s bread in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65995" data-verses="Mark 7:27">verse 27</span> indicates that He did not come simply to do miracles. The Lord Jesus came to feed the hungry children. The Lord’s word here definitely indicates that in the previous chapters the Lord was feeding the people. </p>

In my study of the Greek word for “dispensation” (<em>oikonomia</em>), I have learned <span class="pg" data-page-id="199" id="199">[199]</span> that this word comes from a root that means to distribute food. An example of a person distributing food is Joseph in Egypt. As one who distributed food to the people, he was a good steward carrying out a stewardship. That stewardship was an <em>oikonomia,</em> a dispensing of the supply of food. </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TF7Ws6Ycc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> We may say that the real Joseph is the Lord Jesus, the Slave-Savior. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65996" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> of the Gospel of Mark we see Him dispensing Himself as bread, as nourishing food. He is dispensing Himself as the element of the life supply to satisfy the hungry ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPBAonvNyBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> When a Syrophoenician, a typical Gentile, came to Him and asked Him to cast a demon out of her daughter, He opened Himself to let her know what He was. He revealed Himself to her as bread. He caused her to realize that He was bread for the feeding of the hungry children, that He was distributing Himself to people as their life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTSH4MyAqm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> Many of those who received benefit from the Lord’s ministry did not realize that, as He was ministering to them, He was feeding them. In a similar way, many of today’s Christians do not realize that the Lord desires to distribute Himself as bread. Some Christians appreciate healings and miracles. But have you ever heard that genuine healings and miracles are for the Lord’s feeding of hungry people? Nevertheless, this is the very matter revealed by the Lord Jesus to the Syrophoenician woman. </p>
<p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxiy2ileWnJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> In His conversation with this woman, the Lord revealed that what He was doing was not merely the performing of miracles—it was a feeding. Actually, He was not doing miracles; He was dispensing Himself as bread, as the supply of food. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkqyl2yID1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> In the preceding sections of the Gospel of Mark, we have the contents of the gospel service, the ways to carry out the gospel service, actions that are helpful in the gospel service, the word concerning the intrinsic element of the kingdom, a picture of human society, a picture of the attitude of worldly people toward the gospel, and the exposure of the condition of man’s heart. Having seen all this, now we need to see in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65997" data-verses="Mark 7:24-30">7:24-30</span> that the Lord is distributing Himself as the food <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> supply needed by us all. Actually, we do not need a miracle, and we do not even need healing. Our real need is for bread, for the life supply. Therefore, the Lord Jesus is dispensing Himself to us as food. </p>

We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="65999" data-verses="Mark 7:1-23">7:1-23</span> the Lord uses the Ten Commandments to expose the condition of man’s heart. That also was a further step in His gospel service. After taking that step, the Lord goes on to indicate that in His gospel service He was not merely doing miracles. That was not the inner significance of His gospel service. The inner significance of this service is that He was distributing Himself as food. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZWTZVDjA_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to the Syrophoenician woman, “You think that you need Me to heal your daughter. Actually, your need is for Me to be your bread. Also, I must let you know what your position is. Your position is that of a little Gentile dog. Since you are such a dog, you do not have the right to enjoy the children’s portion. I am the children’s portion, and the children are the Israelites, the chosen people. I came from the Father to feed His children.” </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHlfvC6tHiWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> Have you ever realized that the Gospel of Mark unveils the Lord Jesus as our bread? As the record of this Gospel progresses, going on step by step and going up level by level, it eventually brings us to the crucial matter of the Lord Jesus being our bread. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl8xVT6KsbDYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> If we did not have the Lord’s word about Himself as the children’s bread, we would not realize that in His gospel service He was distributing Himself as our bread. It is not very difficult for us to understand how the Lord is the Physician, the Bridegroom, and the Emancipator. It is easy for us to know Him in these ways. But who would ever imagine that the Lord is bread? Yes, as the God-man, He is the Physician, the Bridegroom, and the Emancipator. But now we see, <span class="pg" data-page-id="201" id="201">[201]</span> through His answer to the Syrophoenician woman, that He is the children’s bread. How marvelous! </p>

In this section of the Gospel of Mark five matters are covered: the healing of a deaf and dumb man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66012" data-verses="Mark 7:31-37">7:31-37</span>), the feeding of four thousand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66013" data-verses="Mark 8:1-9">8:1-9</span>), not giving a sign to the Pharisees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66014" data-verses="Mark 8:10-13">8:10-13</span>), warning the disciples concerning the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66015" data-verses="Mark 8:14-21">8:14-21</span>), and the healing of a blind man in Bethsaida (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66016" data-verses="Mark 8:22-26">8:22-26</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYl3e00kDqxklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0">THE HEALING OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN</h2><p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPc1jRbbFXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66017" data-verses="Mark 7:31-37">7:31-37</span> we have the healing of a deaf and dumb man. Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66018" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span>, most of the healings in the Gospel of Mark were healings of a complete person. For instance, Peter’s mother-in-law was sick of a fever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66019" data-verses="Mark 1:30-31">1:30-31</span>). She was healed, and that was the healing of a complete person. Another example of this kind of healing is the healing of the paralytic (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66020" data-verses="Mark 2:3-12">2:3-12</span>). When the paralytic was healed, the complete person was healed. The same is true of the cleansing of the leper (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66021" data-verses="Mark 1:40-45">1:40-45</span>). But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66022" data-verses="Mark 7:31-37">7:31-37</span> we do not have the healing of a complete person; instead, we have the healing of specific organs. In fact, all the healings after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66023" data-verses="Mark 7:1">Mark 7</span> involve particular organs, not complete persons. Mainly these healings are of three organs: the eyes, the ears, and the tongue. </p>
<p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEbTBThfpuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> We may say that in the Gospel of Mark we have the following sequence related to healing: general healings, the exposure of the condition of man’s heart, the Lord as bread, as the supply of life, and the healing of specific organs. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> also is the sequence in our spiritual experience. When we were saved, we experienced healing in a general way. Later the condition of our heart was exposed. Then, probably after coming into the church life, we learned to enjoy the Lord inwardly as our bread, as our life supply. Following this, we have the healing of our ears, tongue, and eyes. Some who have been in the church life for years still need the specific healing of these organs. </p>

His dumbness was due to his deafness. The Slave-Savior’s healing salvation is fully able to heal such a one’s deafness and dumbness by dealing with his ears first and then touching his tongue. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w_ZxEl-ZS764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66027" data-verses="Mark 7:33-34">Verses 33 and 34</span> say, “And taking him away from the crowd privately, He put His fingers into his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue; and looking up into heaven, He groaned and said to him, Ephphatha! that is, Be opened!” The Greek word rendered “put” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66028" data-verses="Mark 7:33">verse 33</span> may also be translated “thrust.” The Slave-Savior’s thrusting His fingers into the deaf one’s ears signifies His dealing with his hearing organ (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66029" data-verses="Isaiah 50:4-5">Isa. 50:4-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66030" data-verses="Job 33:14-16">Job 33:14-16</span>), and His touching of his tongue with His spittle signifies His anointing the dumb one’s speaking organ with the word that proceeds out of His mouth. This was a healing. </p>

The reason for this is that speaking is based on hearing. A child learns to talk by listening to others speak. Eventually, a child speaks what he hears. By this we see that a child learns to speak by listening. We may say that his hearing becomes his speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAelRTyq_aqrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj"> Do you know why we speak with difficulty in the meetings? We speak with difficulty because we are careless in listening to the Lord’s speaking. If we were more careful in our hearing, we would speak spontaneously. </p>
<p data-content-id="GoWRQTh2JAOfaAt9wQgatb6uFozX66HQ3Rw0vb4ArxIVsvkriGZ32FGW746MXwzF2"> We need to practice listening to the Lord’s speaking. As we listen to the Word, it will penetrate our being.

Many of us can testify that before we enjoyed the Lord’s feeding in the church life, it was difficult for us to pray publicly in a meeting. Not only did we not have the proper hearing, the hearing that becomes our speaking; we did not enjoy the Lord as our food. But since coming into the church life, we have been enjoying Him as our bread. The feeding follows the exposure of our heart and is followed by the healing of our deafness and dumbness. According to the sequence in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66034" data-verses="Mark 7:1">Mark 7</span>, after the case of the Syrophoenician woman, we have the case of the healing of a deaf and dumb person. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPGpiFyUbFN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> We have emphasized the fact that speaking depends on hearing. We should not try to speak without listening. If we speak without listening, we shall speak in a nonsensical way. First we must have the proper hearing, and then we shall be able to speak. We need to listen with the intention of speaking, with the intention of repeating what we have heard. If we all listen this way, many of us will be able to speak without difficulty in the church meetings. Because we are no longer deaf, we shall no longer have difficulty in speaking. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="eW1-pGBoAGH7gOu2EixWZzx2iEuzXGZKhHTHlippcE-tSBQA2AEb8Btsa6mr5pa6x">Experiencing the Healing of Our Ears and Tongue</h2><p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4diNQai1cuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> It is rather easy to have our person healed in a general way. To experience such a healing it may not be necessary for the Lord Jesus to touch us. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66035" data-verses="Mark 5:1">chapter five</span> the woman was healed simply by touching the hem of the Lord’s garment. However, if we would receive the particular healing of our ears and tongue, we need the Lord to touch us in a definite way. </p>
<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GT7G6l3-MeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66036" data-verses="Mark 7:33">verse 33</span>, the Lord took the deaf and dumb man away from the crowd privately, thrust His fingers into his ears, and then touched his tongue. This indicates that if we want our ears to be healed, we need the Lord to take us away to a private place. Then, in private, He will thrust His fingers into our ears and touch our tongue with His spittle. </p>
<p data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_sRrLpK5EraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV"> The healing of the ears requires only the thrusting of the Lord’s fingers into them. But for the healing of our tongue <span class="pg" data-page-id="209" id="209">[209]</span> we need something that proceeds out of the Lord’s mouth to be applied to our tongue. This signifies that we need the anointing of our speaking organ with the word that proceeds out of the Lord’s mouth. </p>

This portion of the Gospel of Mark may be considered the highlight of the Lord’s contact with His disciples. </p>

We may take Peter as an example. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66062" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> of the Gospel of Mark, Peter was called by the Lord and began to follow Him. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66063" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66064" data-verses="Mark 8:1">chapter eight</span>, Peter and the other faithful followers passed through a number of different steps. They went on step by step, higher and higher, until they were brought to a place called Caesarea Philippi. </p>
<p data-content-id="DioGnuR0sUvA-HjioOIZ0BpkDeFgdlHkYsKOva-5So8_5JX330ghXt3Lqsjs98JZo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66065" data-verses="Mark 8:27">Mark 8:27</span> says, “And Jesus went out and His disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?” Caesarea Philippi was in the northern part of the Holy Land, close to the border, at the foot of Mount Hermon, the mountain on which the Lord was transfigured. Caesarea Philippi was far from the holy city with the holy temple, where the atmosphere of the old Jewish religion filled every man’s thought, leaving no room for Christ, the Slave-Savior. The Lord brought His disciples purposely to such a place where there was a clear atmosphere so that their thought could be released from the effects of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> religious surroundings in the holy city and the holy temple and that He might reveal to them something new concerning Himself. It was here that the vision concerning Him as the Christ was given to Peter. </p>
<p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxizWilcWnJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> I wish to emphasize the fact that the Lord Jesus brought His disciples to Caesarea Philippi so that they would be in a clear atmosphere, an atmosphere without clouds or fog. He knew that in such an atmosphere their understanding and spiritual sight would be clear. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkqzF2yKD1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> The Lord brought His followers from the river Jordan and the Sea of Galilee to Caesarea Philippi. It took Him at least two years to bring His followers through all the steps that enabled them to come to this point. These steps are recorded in the preceding chapters of the Gospel of Mark. Especially three of the Lord’s disciples—Peter, John, and James—were fully qualified to see something which no other human beings had been able to see. They were able to see a wonderful Person, a Person who is the secret of the universe and a mystery to all mankind. This One is also the secret of God’s eternal economy. Although He was a man, even a man in the form of a slave, He was an excellent, wonderful, mysterious Person. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pu9555BwdXseDKhVFcTfqZEuIg4gGqssN05hXWqG5AOWLMiJFHRYC9yb9EUElWhG0"> In order to see the vision concerning this Person, the disciples had to pass through the steps recorded in the preceding chapters. They had to be healed in a general way and then in a particular way. Every function of their being—hearing, sight, and speech—needed to be healed. As the result of experiencing both the general and specific healings, they were qualified and enabled to receive the vision concerning who the Lord is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-5AXIggToD6uMh3UGveeDF5fYbf5HiOdJu1FrqXNWLmcCgTAMm7L2e-ug40_gpPOy">THE REVELATION CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZWS5VAig_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66066" data-verses="Mark 8:27">verse 27</span> the Lord asked His disciples, “Who do men say that I am?” As a man, Christ was a mystery not only to that generation, but also to people today. To the Lord’s question the disciples replied, “John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, one of the prophets” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66067" data-verses="Mark 8:28">v. 28</span>). This indicates that, at most, without revelation, people can realize only <span class="pg" data-page-id="215" id="215">[215]</span> that Jesus is the greatest among the prophets. Without heavenly revelation, no one can know that He is truly the Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHlePC5sniWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66068" data-verses="Mark 8:29">Verse 29</span> says, “And He questioned them, But you, who do you say that I am? Peter answering says to Him, You are the Christ!” Here we see that Peter took the lead to declare that Jesus is the Christ. Peter did not speak of the Lord simply in a general way as Christ, as an anointed One. Rather, he said, “You are <em>the</em> Christ.” This term may not be as striking to us today as it was during the time of the disciples. Peter was declaring that Jesus is the Christ, the anointed One, the Messiah. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl8xUz6Js7DYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> When Peter made the declaration that Jesus is the Christ, he may not have been very clear concerning this point. Nevertheless, he saw that this One was not common, that He was not an ordinary person. He realized something that is very particular concerning the Lord, that He is the Christ, God’s anointed One, the Messiah. As we have pointed out, in order for Peter to see this vision, it was necessary for him and the other disciples to pass through all the steps in the preceding chapters to be brought to the stage of seeing the vision concerning Christ’s Person. </p>

Then “He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66070" data-verses="Mark 8:31">v. 31</span>). Here we see that after the revelation of the mystery concerning Christ, we have the revelation of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. In order for Him to fulfill God’s purpose, Christ had to go to the religious center, pass through crucifixion, and enter into resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7AaY3GImdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66071" data-verses="Mark 8:31">verse 31</span> the Lord opened up some of the mysteries of God’s economy concerning Himself as the Christ, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="216" id="216">[216]</span> anointed One of God. In this verse the Lord refers to Himself as the Son of Man. After Peter saw the vision concerning Jesus the Nazarene being the Christ, the Lord went on to unveil the fact that He, God’s anointed One, is the Son of Man. It is a great matter to see that the Messiah is the Son of Man. </p>
<p data-content-id="IgKBIj9xvn3kVySf4xolIjwZB-WDTQgX3dkNC5dvPZxfKOYTZm1eWOeBjrXPL5gF0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66072" data-verses="Mark 8:31">verse 31</span> the Lord went on to reveal that the Messiah, who is the Son of Man, must suffer and be rejected. Instead of being honored, respected, and exalted, He would be dishonored, despised, and rejected. The Lord said that He would suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and even be killed. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Hfo6mxQWhV9UNGGlwU7bVITqFlUtfJf1FVddN1W7drZ0yu-2uolKPKUU_XXH9aAsf">PETER REBUKING THE LORD<br/>AND THE LORD REBUKING PETER</h2><p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudK8ohJcyZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> The unveiling of Christ’s rejection, suffering, and death must have come as a great surprise to Peter. He may have been shocked by such an unveiling. To be sure, Peter never imagined that the Messiah would be persecuted and even executed. From his youth among the Jews, Peter had heard many things concerning the Messiah. He surely expected the coming Messiah to be honored and exalted, regarded in the highest way. He had never before heard that the Messiah would suffer and be put to death. </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-VtpvpBJYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66073" data-verses="Mark 8:31">verse 31</span>, the Lord Jesus clearly indicated that He, the Christ, would rise after three days. Thus, in a brief way He spoke concerning His resurrection. It is doubtful, however, that this word concerning the Lord’s rising from among the dead made an impression on Peter. He had no understanding at all about what it meant for the Lord to rise after three days. Peter either did not hear this word or he had no realization concerning it. </p>
<p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1JawjooxH_0dVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> We are told in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66074" data-verses="Mark 8:32">8:32</span> that the Lord “spoke the word openly.” This verse also says, “Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.” Peter actually began to rebuke the Lord Jesus! To rebuke someone implies that he is wrong and needs to be adjusted. If someone is not wrong, there is no need to rebuke him and thereby correct him. The fact that Peter was <span class="pg" data-page-id="217" id="217">[217]</span> rebuking the Lord indicates that Peter thought the Lord was wrong in saying that the Messiah would be despised, suffer persecution, and be killed. Here Peter seems to be saying, “Lord, what are You talking about? You are the Messiah. Certainly You are wrong in telling us that the Messiah will be despised, rejected, and killed. I must correct You concerning this matter.” </p>
<p data-content-id="zbCxXV8yEF3E20ghdSaym0NKDAYoqh_2u6LkS3jfEW09yxoZ1BBUaNJDdc2JggHVC"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66075" data-verses="Mark 8:32">verse 32</span>, Peter even took the Lord aside in order to rebuke Him. Apparently Peter was endeavoring to train the Lord, to teach Him, to open His eyes to see what Peter saw. Only the Gospel of Mark, neither Matthew nor Luke, gives us this detail concerning Peter’s taking the Lord aside. Mark received the report concerning this from Peter himself. Peter, then, must have told Mark that he took the Lord aside and began to rebuke Him. </p>

If we would come after the Lord in this way, we need to deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow Him. Let us now consider what it means for us to take up our cross. </p>

<p data-content-id="VWxmQv7W4uiwj768F2AdbInWheU0GEWYtKu8tNXSAC0wKB8UNji7nnTh2Yra9R3z7"> Many Christians have a misunderstanding concerning the cross. They think that to take up the cross is to suffer hardship. This was my concept more than forty years ago. I told others that the difficulties in their environment were a cross to them. For example, if your husband or wife is troubling you, that is a cross. But when the Lord Jesus speaks of taking up the cross, He does not mean this. He means that we should apply the cross to our living. The real significance of the cross is not suffering—it is termination. In ancient times, crucifixion was not used merely to cause suffering; it was meant to cause death. Crucifixion, therefore, equals death, termination. </p>
<p data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XICnfB4sWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv"> For us to take up the cross is for us to be terminated. I wish to emphasize the fact that the cross is for termination, not for suffering. Sometimes believers are not helped by <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> suffering. I have known certain persons who suffered a great deal with the result that they became strongly self-willed. The more a person suffers in himself, the more his self-will is strengthened. Those who have passed through hardships in life and have become strong in their will are extremely difficult to touch. Eventually, when such a person reaches the age of sixty or seventy, he may have become so strong in his will that he cannot be changed. </p>
<p data-content-id="YsklwMzN513qLhmk6AEqbZ3z79rzoaz16RIy_1aceu91KDfDQgSH1KFDyFgXuTwem"> The concept that the cross is a matter of suffering is contrary to the revelation of the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66088" data-verses="Mark 8:34">8:34</span>. In this verse He says, “If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.” Here the Lord speaks of denying the self. To deny the self is to give it up; it is not to keep the self so that it may suffer. </p>

Instead, it is a matter of applying to our life what Christ has done on the cross to terminate us. Therefore, to take up the cross is to apply this termination to ourselves. Day by day we need to apply such a termination. If we do this, we shall realize not that we are suffering, but that we are terminated, finished, put to an end. </p>
<p data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DZIrDHTfI3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ"> Suppose a brother says, “I thank God that, in His sovereignty, He has given me a wife who causes me to suffer and bear the cross. My wife is a cross given to me by God, and now I must bear this cross.” This is a serious misunderstanding of what it means to bear the cross. In fact, this understanding is related to that found in Catholicism. To some extent at least, this misunderstanding of the cross has been promoted by a famous book entitled <em>The Imitation of Christ.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPGoCFxV7FN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> A married brother does not need to learn how to suffer. Rather, he needs to realize that, as a husband, he has already been terminated in Christ and that now he should live as a terminated husband, simply enjoying Christ’s termination. Then he may say to his wife, “Dear, I am <span class="pg" data-page-id="223" id="223">[223]</span> not trying to be a good husband, to be a kind and gentle husband. I am here as a terminated husband. The more I am willing to experience Christ’s termination, the better I shall be as a husband, for then Christ will live in me. As He lives in me, He will be your husband through me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="eW1-pGBoAGH7gOu2EjRWazR2iEuzXGZKhHTHlippcE-tSBQA2AEb8Btsa6mr5pa6x"> To come after the Lord is to partake of Him, enjoy Him, experience Him, and let Him become our very being. In order to come after the Lord in this way, we need to deny ourselves. We need to apply to ourselves the termination Christ has accomplished on the cross. This means that to bear our cross is to apply Christ’s termination to ourselves. When we do this, we become a crossed-out person, not a suffering person. Then we can testify, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4djtQZiVcuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> Christ’s word concerning taking up the cross is a mystery. If we had only <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66089" data-verses="Mark 8:34">8:34</span>, we would not be able to understand Christ’s word about the cross. In order to understand this word properly, we need the fourteen Epistles of Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GT6m6m0eMeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> The cross is not merely a suffering; it is also a killing. The cross kills and terminates the criminal. Christ first bore the cross and then was crucified. We, His believers, have first been crucified with Him and then bear the cross day by day. To us, bearing the cross is to remain under the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, our natural life, and our old man. In so doing we deny our self that we may follow the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_sQLLqJZEraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV"> Before the Lord’s crucifixion, the disciples followed Him in an outward way. But since His resurrection, we follow Him in an inward way. Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66090" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>) dwelling in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66091" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>), we follow Him in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66092" data-verses="Galatians 5:16-25">Gal. 5:16-25</span>). </p>

Actually, these terms, the soul life and the self, are synonymous. Our soul life is our self, and our self is our soul life. We ourselves are a soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="MM4hI37Bq0acKu7uYdryGSOfA5Jn_2rlWqgP_ZCAOT51o90taGoOAfheGhkXDu6gu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66094" data-verses="Mark 8:33-35">8:33-35</span> three matters are related to one another: mind, self, and soul life. Our mind is the expression of our self, and our self is the embodiment of our soul life. Our soul life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, thought, concept, opinion. When we set our mind, not on the things of God, but on the things of man, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself. This was what happened with Peter. Therefore, the Lord said that we must deny the self and not save our soul life. Instead of saving the soul life, we should lose it. To lose the soul life is the reality of denying the self. This is to take up the cross. </p>

We may say that to save the soul life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and not to suffer. To lose the soul life is to cause the soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment. If the followers of the Slave-Savior allow their soul to have its enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the sake of the Lord and the gospel, they will cause their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. </p>

The phrase <span class="pg" data-page-id="225" id="225">[225]</span> ‘for the gospel’s’ must mean for the sake of the preaching of the gospel, for the sake of the effectiveness and result of the gospel. For the sake of the Lord’s glory and for the sake of preaching the gospel, I must behave myself in a proper way.” This concept is wrong.

We may say that what is recorded here is the highlight of the Gospel of Mark. Here the account in this Gospel reaches its peak. </p>
<p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxMYZrwkMS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66122" data-verses="Mark 8:1">chapter eight</span> the Slave-Savior healed a blind man at Bethsaida. The Lord did more in this case of healing than in any of the other cases. For example, the first instance of healing in the Gospel of Mark is the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law. This healing was easily carried out. The Lord simply came to her and raised her up, holding her hand. Then the fever left her, and she served them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66123" data-verses="Mark 1:31">1:31</span>). From that initial healing, this book progresses step by step until we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66124" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> the exposure of man’s heart, the exposure of man’s inward condition. </p>
<p data-content-id="wpXywTj2q7bZ6nRb5ngXnkL46v2MilKq_Qrlx_oVfo-DxccuXUCSfxlA5gn9T8oHg"> After exposing the condition of man’s heart, the Lord Jesus revealed that He is bread, our life supply. He is not only the forgiving God, but our Physician, the Bridegroom, today’s David, and the Emancipator. He is also both the Feeder and the bread. </p>
<p data-content-id="uamxl0odSMwfSIWjmR1Ascwo-fcQoDK5WNy2WFyi0oYKbOAd76mwgMMv-zAcUryim"> After the Lord’s unveiling of Himself as the bread to nourish us inwardly, we have the record of healings that are carried out in a particular way. We have the healing of the ears and the tongue of a deaf and dumb man and also the healing of the eyes of a blind man. After these particular <span class="pg" data-page-id="232" id="232">[232]</span> healings, we may say that we have a complete person whose organs have been healed in a particular way. Now this one is prepared and qualified to receive the revelation of Christ’s Person and His death and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7Aa43GKmdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_"> For the purpose of revealing His Person, death, and resurrection, the Lord Jesus brought His disciples away from the religious region to Caesarea Philippi. While on the way, He questioned His disciples, saying, “Who do men say that I am?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66125" data-verses="Mark 8:27">8:27</span>). After they responded, the Lord further questioned them, “But you, who do you say that I am?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66126" data-verses="Mark 8:29">v. 29</span>). At this point Peter saw the vision that Jesus is the Christ, and he declared, “You are the Christ!” </p>
<p data-content-id="IgKBIj9xvn3kVySf4xIlLjQZB-WDTQgX3dkNC5dvPZxfKOYTZm1eWOeBjrXPL5gF0"> The revelation given at Caesarea Philippi is the highest step, the peak, in the book of Mark. Before the disciples were brought by the Lord to Caesarea Philippi, their eyes were healed. Therefore, they had the sight to see not common things or material things, but to see mysterious, divine things. In particular, their eyes were opened to see Christ, His all-inclusive death, and His marvelous resurrection. In the realm of mysterious, divine things, the revelation concerning Christ and His death and resurrection is foremost. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Hfo6mxQWhV9UNGGlwUbbWIzqFlUtfJf1FVddN1W7drZ0yu-2uolKPKUU_XXH9aAsf">A MYSTERY TO THE NATURAL MAN</h2><p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudK8IhKdSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> The realm of mysterious, divine things is altogether hidden from the natural man. As Paul tells us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66127" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:1">1 Corinthians 2</span>, the natural man cannot apprehend the things in this realm: “A soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66128" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:14">v. 14</span>). A soulish man is a natural man, one living in his soul, not in his spirit. Such a man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God. Rather, he rejects them. </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-VtJvqApYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> The Lord Jesus is a mystery to the natural man and the natural mind. Even today, certain Jewish scholars are studying who Jesus was. They are also studying His crucifixion. Because the Person of Christ and His death and resurrection are the topmost matters in the realm of mysterious, divine things, even some Christian professors of theology, as <span class="pg" data-page-id="233" id="233">[233]</span> well as Jewish scholars, have not seen the vision concerning them. </p>

This Gospel is a record showing us how the Lord Jesus as the Slave-Savior serves sinners. This service begins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66129" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> and continues into <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66130" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span>, where the Lord exposes the condition of man’s heart. We may say that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66131" data-verses="Mark 7:1">Mark 7</span> the Slave-Savior conducts Himself as a surgeon, for He opens our heart and exposes its condition. </p>
<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJe0C_2VqJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66132" data-verses="Mark 7:1">chapter seven</span> we see the Lord not only as the divine Surgeon but also as the One who feeds us with Himself as bread. This indicates that our basic need is for bread, for the supply of life. The Slave-Savior not only heals us, recovers us, and brings us back into fellowship with God; He also feeds us, and He feeds us with Himself as bread. He Himself is our life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQuvQxuu5ZSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> First we experience the Lord’s feeding us with Himself as bread. As the result of being fed by Him, spontaneously we experience His healing in a particular way: He heals our deaf ears, our dumb tongue, and our blind eyes. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNCtfvGRE0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW">CHRIST AND HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6w18ty4ISYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> We need to fit together various portions of the Gospel of Mark like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. When the individual pieces have been fitted together, we see a picture. In the Gospel of Mark we see a portrait of certain ones chosen by God. These ones are healed not only in a general way, like Peter’s mother-in-law, the leper, and the paralytic, but also in a particular way in the organs of hearing, speech, and sight. These specific healings involve the Lord’s anointing, as signified by His spittle. Once these chosen ones were nourished by receiving the life supply—the Lord as their bread—their organs were healed. As a result, they could hear, speak, and see. Their organs were functioning properly. Therefore, at this point the Slave-Savior brought them to <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> Caesarea Philippi, to a place where the spiritual atmosphere was clear. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocarHGEtqNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> We have pointed out that in Caesarea Philippi the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples concerning Himself. As He talked with them, He opened to them the realm of mysterious, divine things. At least one of His disciples came to see that He is the Christ. However, this one saw the Person of Christ only within certain limits. He did not see anything concerning Christ’s death and resurrection. For this reason, the Lord went on to tell His disciples that He would be crucified and that after His death, He would rise up. In speaking about His death and resurrection, the Lord further opened the realm of mysterious, divine things. He showed His disciples not only His Person; He also revealed to them His wonderful death and His marvelous resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8daouUJpRkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE REPLACEMENT</h2><p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6sepjliEMHl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> Now we come to a crucial matter. We need to see that, in the sight of God, everything in the universe except Himself needs to be replaced. Christ with His death and resurrection is the unique replacement in the universe. He is the entire, all-inclusive replacement. Christ with His death and resurrection replaces everyone and everything that is not God Himself. He replaces Moses, He replaces Elijah, and He replaces us. He replaces our self, He replaces our soul, and He replaces our mind. This One replaces everyone else, everything, and every matter in the entire universe. This is the reason we say that He is the entire and all-inclusive replacement. </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-Gao2-ZPWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> When the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples the matters of His death and resurrection, they may have been confused. Peter, in particular, did not understand, and he went so far as to rebuke the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66133" data-verses="Mark 8:32">v. 32</span>). Then the Lord rebuked Peter, saying, “Go away, behind Me, Satan, because you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66134" data-verses="Mark 8:33">v. 33</span>). The Lord went on to say, “If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66135" data-verses="Mark 8:34">v. 34</span>). Do you know <span class="pg" data-page-id="235" id="235">[235]</span> what it means to deny ourselves? To deny ourselves is to be replaced by Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaSGaNHzDU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> Here the Lord seems to be saying, especially to Peter, “Since you have seen Christ, you need to be replaced by Him. You must be put aside and allow Christ to become you. You need to deny yourself and be replaced by Christ.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QCD153bRyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo">REPLACED BY CHRIST<br/>THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8CliJuk_3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> How is it possible for us to be replaced by Christ? We can be replaced by Him only through His death and resurrection. Apart from His death and resurrection, Christ Himself would not be able to replace us. Also, it would not be possible for us to be replaced by Him. This replacement can be carried out only through Christ’s death and resurrection. </p>

This took place immediately after the Lord and three of His disciples came down from the mount of transfiguration. “And coming to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes disputing with them. And immediately all the crowd seeing Him were amazed, and running to Him, greeted Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66147" data-verses="Mark 9:14-15">vv. 14-15</span>). When the Lord Jesus questioned them about the dispute, “one of the crowd answered Him, Teacher, I brought my son to You, having a dumb spirit; and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth, and he is wasting away; and I told Your disciples that they might cast it out, and they were not able” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66148" data-verses="Mark 9:17-18">vv. 17-18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GT6G6m2eMeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> Here we see that the case involved a dumb spirit; it was not a matter of the entire person needing to be healed. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="240" id="240">[240]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66149" data-verses="Mark 9:25">verse 25</span> we see that it was a dumb and deaf spirit that was cast out of the child.

As learners, they should have been able to cast out this demon. But because they were not able to do it, there was a serious dispute. When the Lord came down from the mountain of transfiguration, He came into that situation. He then proceeded to cast out the dumb and deaf spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="URtKIt0L_s2x9jmmjHfxz0xxo9XCdhKgCltl2BQUyoJ1J6-naGmt6MTZtNA2Ufk2K"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66150" data-verses="Mark 9:28">Mark 9:28</span> says, “And when He entered into a house, His disciples questioned Him privately, Why were we not able to cast it out?” The disciples seemed to be saying to the Lord, “We have been following You and learning of You for a long period of time. It was easy for You to cast out the demon. But why were we not able to do it?” </p>
<p data-content-id="MM4hI37Bq0acKu7uYdLyFTufA5Jn_2rlWqgP_ZCAOT51o90taGoOAfheGhkXDu6gu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66151" data-verses="Mark 9:29">verse 29</span> we have the Lord’s answer to the disciples’ question: “This kind cannot come out by anything, except by prayer.” The Lord’s word here indicates that the disciples failed to pray, and that was the reason they could not cast out the demon. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="VWxmQv7W4uiwj768F2gdTbXWheU0GEWYtKu8tNXSAC0wKB8UNji7nnTh2Yra9R3z7">Prayer and the Denial of the Self</h2><p data-content-id="isH1YhKLP27GpYb1j_kH6B3jpPE3d1Q-bGo8ZH-xoo3romA6yrPL5uOuCKtIgHwLz"> Do you know what it means to pray? To pray means that we realize that we are nothing and that we can do nothing. This implies that prayer is the real denial of the self. To pray, therefore, is to deny ourselves, knowing that we are nothing and are not able to do anything. Furthermore, to pray is actually to declare, “Not I, but Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="1YZgJVvfR7nEdPyggj3BGuLFC4vhwTC01Dl5_a_Qjw4LWip4gb95cZHsWchz2v1DI"> Instead of praying, the disciples tried to cast out the demon. Perhaps they said to themselves, “We have been watching the Lord cast out demons for more than two years, and we have learned of Him. We should be able to cast the demon out of this child.” But although they attempted to cast out the demon, they were not successful. We may say <span class="pg" data-page-id="241" id="241">[241]</span> that they tried to cast out the demon without the necessary power, energy, divine electricity. </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgDdGswr1dGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> I wish to emphasize the fact that the word “prayer” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66152" data-verses="Mark 9:29">9:29</span> actually indicates “no longer I, but Christ.” Concerning this matter, we need to understand why this case immediately follows the revelation of Christ as our replacement and the Lord’s word about denying ourselves. We need to deny ourselves so that Christ may be our replacement and become everything to us. Although the disciples saw this revelation, they did not practice it or live according to it. To see the revelation is one thing; but to live it is another. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="j5IxdItcgq7F7cFXG3z0jaViV23tF5HpwfjHaCnXDkXrkH_o8CLFY2KxyNHpzRRlL">Applying the Revelation concerning Christ<br/>as Our Replacement</h2><p data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDzvuk_qYANUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66153" data-verses="Mark 9:14-50">Mark 9:14-50</span> is actually a practicing of the revelation of Christ as our replacement. It had been revealed to the disciples that Christ is the entire replacement through His death and resurrection. Death terminates us, and resurrection brings Christ to us. The result is “no longer I, but Christ.” But how can this revelation be applied? According to the case of the casting of the dumb spirit out of the man’s son, this vision is applied by prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoURDhiey_rq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm"> As human beings, we all have a problem with our temper. Thus, we may use the matter of temper, especially in married life, as an illustration of the fact that certain “demons” can be cast out only through prayer. In married life it is easy for a husband or wife to have a problem with temper. Surely every husband has a problem with his temper, and every wife has trouble with her temper. Temper is a serious problem in married life and is a cause of separation and divorce. If a husband and wife never exchange words and are never troubled by their temper, most problems in married life would be eliminated. But temper is a problem. Therefore, we certainly need Christ in our married life. I would say in no aspect of our human living do we need Him more than in our married life. </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UZQZrcZwaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> Do you know how to have the best married life? The way is to practice “not I, but Christ.” But how can we practice <span class="pg" data-page-id="242" id="242">[242]</span> this? The way to practice is to pray. For example, you should not try to subdue your temper. If you try in yourself to subdue your temper, you will eventually have a more serious problem with it. The more you strive to subdue your temper, the more you will make a “deposit” in the “temper bank.” Sooner or later, you will lose your temper in a more serious way. This is to try to cast out the “demon” of temper by your self-effort instead of by prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxcPmQrXb4uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr"> Instead of trying to subdue your temper, you should pray. If you ask the Lord why you are not able to cast out the demon of your temper, He may say, “This kind cannot be cast out except by prayer. You need to pray.” </p>

It is sufficient simply to call, “O Lord Jesus!” Even such a short prayer indicates “no longer I, but Christ.” Your prayer testifies that you do not exercise your self-effort to deal with the situation. Instead, you apply Christ. This is to practice the vision concerning Christ with His death and resurrection being our replacement. </p>

As we have pointed out, prayer means “no longer I, but Christ.” Hence, the case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66154" data-verses="Mark 9:14-29">9:14-29</span> points out that if we would be replaced by Christ, we need to pray instead of trying in ourselves to cast out demons. </p>

In order to be replaced by Him, we need to pray that the Lord will come in and be everything to us. However, we cannot be trained to practice this only by one instance, for a particular case is limited in what it can accomplish. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66158" data-verses="Mark 9:33-37">9:33-37</span> we have another case—the teaching concerning humility—in which the same point is emphasized. </p>

This act was against the virtue of the Slave-Savior whom he accompanied. This is proved by the Lord’s response in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66175" data-verses="Mark 9:39">verse 39</span>: “Do not forbid him, for there is no one who shall do a work of power in My name and be able soon to speak evil of Me.” Here we see the Slave-Savior’s tolerance, in the practice of the gospel service, toward His believers who were different from those closer to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="zbCxXV8yEF3E20ghdRaytn9KDAYoqh_2u6LkS3jfEW09yxoZ1BBUaNJDdc2JggHVC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66176" data-verses="Mark 9:40-50">verses 40 through 50</span> there are many puzzling things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66177" data-verses="Mark 9:40">verse 40</span> the Lord Jesus says, “For he who is not against us is for us.” For years I was bothered by this verse and had trouble understanding it, because I thought that it contradicted the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66178" data-verses="Matthew 12:30">Matthew 12:30</span>. Actually there is no contradiction between these verses. Both issued from the Slave-Savior’s mouth and may be considered maxims. The maxim in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66179" data-verses="Mark 9:40">9:40</span> speaks of the outward formality in practice regarding those who are not against the Slave-Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66180" data-verses="Mark 9:39">v. 39</span>). The maxim in Matthew speaks of inward unity for purpose regarding those who are against Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66181" data-verses="Matthew 12:24">Matt. 12:24</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> To maintain inward unity we need to practice the word in Matthew, and for the outward formality we should practice the word here and tolerate believers who are different from us. </p>
<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJe3i_2XqJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66182" data-verses="Mark 9:41">9:41</span> the Lord goes on to say, “For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name because you are Christ’s, truly I say to you that he shall by no means lose his reward.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66183" data-verses="Mark 9:38">verse 38</span> we see how John behaved as one who dealt with others. The Slave-Savior’s wise word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66184" data-verses="Mark 9:40">verse 40</span> turned him and the other disciples to be those cared for by others. This implied that whether it was they or other believers—all were under the Lord’s care because all were His. Whether it was their treatment of the other believers or other believers’ treatment of them, if it was in the Lord’s name, even the giving of a cup of water would be rewarded by Him. </p>

Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66188" data-verses="Ephesians 2:8-9">Eph. 2:8-9</span>), whereas reward is for our work after we are saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66189" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:8">1 Cor. 3:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66190" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:14">14</span>).

This may be regarded as a warning to John and the other disciples not to cause to stumble any one of His believers who differed from them in following Him. </p>

The believers should not cause one another to stumble; neither should they be caused to stumble by their own fleshly members. This indicates how precious the believers are in the eyes of the Slave-Savior. They should all be fully preserved for Him.

However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66258" data-verses="Mark 9:33-37">9:33-37</span> we see that they were arguing with one another over the matter of who was greater.

Furthermore, when we forbid others, thinking ourselves to be greater, we also cause others to stumble. While we are causing others to stumble, we are also causing ourselves to stumble. The evil one may use the members of our body—the hand, the foot, or the eye—to express lust and cause us to stumble. We need to be very careful regarding this. </p>
<p data-content-id="j5IxdItcgq7F7cFXG0T0jYViV23tF5HpwfjHaCnXDkXrkH_o8CLFY2KxyNHpzRRlL"> We should not consider ourselves great. Instead, we need to realize that we are nobody and nothing.

Concerning this, the Lord Jesus said, “Everyone shall be salted with fire” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66263" data-verses="Mark 9:49">v. 49</span>). Here we have the “fire-salt,” or fire as salt. In the coming age, some may be put into fire to be salted. This salting by fire will purge them. In a sense, this purging is a discipline, a chastisement, a punishment. But in another sense this purging causes the believers to be preserved. Hence, this purging is not merely a punishment but also a preserving that keeps the purged one from perishing, from being eternally lost. </p>
<p data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98pSBBHnY0xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB"> As we have pointed out, the fire in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66264" data-verses="Mark 9:49">9:49</span> is a refining fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66265" data-verses="Malachi 3:2">Mal. 3:2</span>), a purifying, purging fire. As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66266" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66267" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:15">15</span>, this fire will purge, in the kingdom age, those believers who commit sin and are unrepentant in this age. Therefore, this refining by fire will be a dispensational punishment. We have seen that even in this age God purges the believers through trials as by fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66268" data-verses="1Peter 1:7">1 Pet. 1:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66269" data-verses="1Peter 4:12">4:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66270" data-verses="1Peter 4:17">17</span>). Dispensational punishment by fire in the coming age is in the same principle as God’s chastisement through sufferings as by fire in this age. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TF5ms6bcc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl">AT PEACE WITH ONE ANOTHER</h2><p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPBCYnsMSBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66271" data-verses="Mark 9:50">9:50</span>, which is the Lord’s concluding word in this section, we see the real significance of this portion of Mark. In this verse the Lord says, “Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltness, with what will you restore its saltness? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.” Here we see that the underlying meaning of this portion is that we should be at peace with one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTSFIMxBKm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> We have emphasized the fact that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66272" data-verses="Mark 9:38-40">9:38-40</span> begins with John’s word about forbidding someone to cast out demons in the Lord’s name, because he did not follow the disciples. In response to John’s word, the Lord seems to be saying in these verses, “That one who cast out demons in My name did not follow you. But he is nevertheless one of My believers, and you should be at peace with him. However, you were not at peace with him because you regarded yourselves as <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> greater than he. You also considered that you are closer to Me than he is. You think that you are better than he. This kind of thought causes him to stumble and also opens the door for the enemy to come in to cause you to stumble by using your lustful members.” </p>
<p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxiwGimc2nJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> Actually, this portion of the Gospel of Mark is profound. Here we see the real cause of the divisions among today’s Christians. Christians certainly are not at peace with one another. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66273" data-verses="Mark 9:50">9:50</span> the Lord says, “Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.” But the entire situation among believers today is the opposite. We cannot say that the believers are at peace with one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkqwV2xKj1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> The reason the believers are not at peace with one another is that so many consider themselves to be somebody and think of themselves as greater than others. The result is that others are caused to stumble, and the door is open for the enemy to utilize the lustful members of the believers’ body to cause them to stumble. Therefore, eventually the vast majority of Christians today have been caused to stumble. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pu9555BwdXseDKhVFfDfpYkuIg4gGqssN05hXWqG5AOWLMiJFHRYC9yb9EUElWhG0"> Where are those Christians who have not been caused to stumble either by others or by their own doing? The situation is that the believers cause others to stumble, and then Satan comes in to utilize their hands, feet, and eyes to cause them to stumble. Hence, the believers cause one another to stumble, and each one causes himself to stumble. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-5AXIggToD6uMh3UGsOeAEZfYbf5HiOdJu1FrqXNWLmcCgTAMm7L2e-ug40_gpPOy">SALT AND GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZWRpVDiA_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> Because of the situation among believers, a situation full of stumbling, we urgently need the vision of Christ that the disciples saw on the mountain of transfiguration. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66274" data-verses="Mark 9:7">Mark 9:7</span> says, “And a cloud came overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him!” We also need to hear Christ, God’s Beloved. We should not hear ourselves or anyone else. </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHldfC6sHiWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> We need a vision in which we see not only Christ but also His all-inclusive death and His resurrection. We need to be replaced by Christ through His death and resurrection. This means that we need to apply His death to ourselves and <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> then receive His rich supply in His wonderful resurrection. If we are replaced by Christ in this way, we shall be healed of the “germs” within us. We shall be salted even in this age. There will be no need for us to wait for the coming age in order to be salted. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl8xXj6KvbDYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> To be salted in this age is to be salted by grace through the death and resurrection of Christ. But if we wait to be salted in the coming age, we shall be salted by fire. If we salt ourselves today through the death and resurrection of Christ, we shall have grace. </p>

As the Lamb of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66315" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>), it was necessary for Him to be offered to God at Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac and enjoyed God’s provision of a ram as a substitute for his son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66316" data-verses="Genesis 22:2">Gen. 22:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66317" data-verses="Genesis 22:9-14">9-14</span>) and where the temple was built in Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66318" data-verses="2Chronicles 3:1">2 Chron. 3:1</span>). It must be there that He would be delivered, according to the counsel determined by the Trinity of the Godhead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66319" data-verses="Acts 2:23">Acts 2:23</span>), to the Jewish leaders (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66320" data-verses="Mark 9:31">Mark 9:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66321" data-verses="Mark 10:33">10:33</span>), and there be rejected by them as the builders of God’s building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66322" data-verses="Mark 8:31">8:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66323" data-verses="Acts 4:11">Acts 4:11</span>). It should also be there that He would be crucified according to the Roman style of capital punishment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66324" data-verses="John 18:31-32">John 18:31-32</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66325" data-verses="John 19:6">19:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66326" data-verses="John 19:14-15">14-15</span>) to fulfill the type concerning the kind of death He would die (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66327" data-verses="Numbers 21:8-9">Num. 21:8-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66328" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>). Moreover, that very year was the year that Messiah (Christ) would be cut off (killed) according to Daniel’s prophecy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66329" data-verses="Daniel 9:24-26">Dan. 9:24-26</span>). Furthermore, as the Passover Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66330" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">1 Cor. 5:7</span>) He had to be killed in the month of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66331" data-verses="Exodus 12:1-11">Exo. 12:1-11</span>). Hence, He had to go to Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66332" data-verses="Mark 10:33">Mark 10:33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66333" data-verses="Mark 11:1">11:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66334" data-verses="Mark 11:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66335" data-verses="Mark 11:15">15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66336" data-verses="Mark 11:27">27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66337" data-verses="John 12:12">John 12:12</span>) before the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66338" data-verses="John 12:1">John 12:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66339" data-verses="Mark 14:1">Mark 14:1</span>), so that He might die there on the day of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66340" data-verses="Mark 14:12-17">14:12-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66341" data-verses="John 18:28">John 18:28</span>) at both the place and the time foreordained by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="GoWRQTh2JAOfaAt9xQQauaauFozX66HQ3Rw0vb4ArxIVsvkriGZ32FGW746MXwzF2"> The gospel service was initiated by the ministry of John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Slave-Savior, in Judea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66342" data-verses="Mark 1:1-11">Mark 1:1-11</span>), the region of honor. But it was continued by the ministry of the Slave-Savior in Galilee, a despised region, for a period of approximately three years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66343" data-verses="Mark 1:14">1:14—9:50</span>). Unlike John in his Gospel, Mark does not narrate anything <span class="pg" data-page-id="269" id="269">[269]</span> of the Slave-Savior’s ministry in Jerusalem and Judea during this time, until He left Galilee for Jerusalem the last time, to accomplish His redemptive work. Then the gospel service was continued by His ministry on the way to Jerusalem and in Jerusalem and its vicinity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66344" data-verses="Mark 10:1">10:1—14:42</span>). It was concluded with His redeeming death, His life-imparting resurrection, His ascension for exaltation, and the continuation of His gospel service by His disciples’ preaching to all the creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66345" data-verses="Mark 14:43">14:43—16:20</span>). </p>

In this portion of the Gospel of Mark we have four matters: the Lord’s coming to Judea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66370" data-verses="Mark 10:1">v. 1</span>), the teaching against divorce (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66371" data-verses="Mark 10:2-12">vv. 2-12</span>), the blessing of young children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66372" data-verses="Mark 10:13-16">vv. 13-16</span>), and the teaching concerning the rich and the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66373" data-verses="Mark 10:17-31">vv. 17-31</span>). In the foregoing message we pointed out that three matters that may frustrate our entering into the kingdom of God are marriage, oldness, and riches. We have seen that if we are replaced by Christ, we surely shall have the way to handle these matters properly. Let us now consider in more detail what the Lord says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66374" data-verses="Mark 10:2-31">10:2-31</span> concerning marriage, oldness, and riches. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4citQfxFcuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF">TEACHING AGAINST DIVORCE</h2><p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GS7m6vk-MeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> When God created man, He did not create all the people He needed for His purpose at the same time. If God had wanted to create a great number of people at the same time, He certainly could have done so. He could have created billions of people. However, this was not God’s way. Instead, God created a couple and charged them to multiply and replenish the earth. According to God’s ordination, the propagation of mankind takes place through marriage. Marriage, therefore, is second only to God’s creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_tRLLiZpEraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV"> We should never despise marriage. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66375" data-verses="Hebrews 13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span> says, “Let marriage be held in honor among all.” Marriage is holy, and we must honor it. <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98oQBBHlY0xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB"> Mankind was brought into existence through God’s creation, and God ordained that mankind be propagated through marriage. </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TE7ms6Zcc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> We need to see that marriage is honorable and holy, for it is ordained for the propagation of mankind for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Apart from the creation of man and the propagation of mankind through marriage, there cannot be the fulfillment of God’s purpose. We need to look at marriage from this point of view. If we consider marriage in this way, we shall honor it. We shall realize that marriage is for the propagation of mankind so that God’s eternal purpose may be fulfilled. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPAAYnvMyBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> In our marriage life we need to be honest, faithful, and pure. If we are not honest, faithful, and pure, we shall offend God in a very serious way. According to the Bible, God condemns fornication and adultery. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66376" data-verses="Hebrews 13:4">Hebrews 13:4b</span> says, “Fornicators and adulterers God will judge.” Fornication and adultery are second only to idol worship as sins that are most offensive to God. Therefore, we need to care for marriage in a proper way before God. We need to see that fornication and adultery damage the proper propagation of mankind. This is the reason that God does not allow divorce. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTTHIMyBqm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> Because marriage is such a serious matter, I would caution the young people against entering into it in a hasty way. Young people, before you get married, you need to have much prayer and consideration. Do not simply consider marriage from your point of view. You need to consider marriage especially from God’s point of view. Do not get married in haste, for once you are married, you no longer have any alternative. Divorce is highly offensive to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxjyGildWnJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> Since we are on our way to enter into the kingdom of God, we especially need to be firm in our standing regarding marriage. We need to realize that once we are married there should not be any divorce. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkryV2yLD1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> All married people should be “blind” to the shortcomings of their mate. They should not try to learn the faults of their spouse. All the investigating concerning the other party should be done before the time of engagement. After <span class="pg" data-page-id="277" id="277">[277]</span> you are engaged, and especially after you are married, you should close your eyes to the defects of the other party and be blind. Unless you are willing to be blind in this way, you will not have a proper married life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pu9555BwdXseDKhVEdDfqYEuIg4gGqssN05hXWqG5AOWLMiJFHRYC9yb9EUElWhG0"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66377" data-verses="Mark 10:2">10:2</span>, the Pharisees questioned the Lord Jesus “whether it is lawful for a man to put away a wife.” When He asked what Moses commanded them, they replied, “Moses permitted us to write a certificate of divorce and put her away” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66378" data-verses="Mark 10:4">v. 4</span>). This commandment was not a part of the basic law, but a supplement to the law. It was given by Moses, not according to God’s ordination from the beginning, but temporarily because of the hardness of man’s heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="-5AXIggToD6uMh3UHuOeDE5fYbf5HiOdJu1FrqXNWLmcCgTAMm7L2e-ug40_gpPOy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66379" data-verses="Mark 10:5-8">10:5-8</span> the Lord goes on to say, “In view of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you. But from the beginning of creation, He made them male and female. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. And the two shall be one flesh; so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.” Here the Lord’s word not only recognizes God’s creation of man, but also confirms God’s ordination of man’s marriage, that is, one male and one female to be joined and yoked together as one flesh, inseparable by man. The commandment concerning divorce given by Moses was a deviation from God’s original ordination. But Christ takes us back to God’s ordination in the beginning. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZXTpVAhg_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66380" data-verses="Mark 10:9">10:9</span> the Lord says, “What therefore God has yoked together, do not let man separate.” Here we see that divorce is not merely against the law of God; divorce is against God Himself. What God has yoked together man should not separate. </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHkffC5vniWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> On the one hand, marriage is a necessity. On the other hand, married life is difficult. Nevertheless, we must learn to love this difficulty and even care for it with affection. This means that we should love our marriage and take good care of it. Otherwise, we shall be hindered in entering into the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl8wVj6KtbDYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> We believe that God is true, and we also believe that His Word, the Bible, is true. Hence, we must honor what God <span class="pg" data-page-id="278" id="278">[278]</span> says in His Word concerning marriage. It is a serious matter not to handle our married life properly. Failure to take care of our married life according to God will keep us from entering into the kingdom. Yes, we now are on our way to the kingdom. But whether we shall actually enter into the kingdom in the coming age is still pending. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66381" data-verses="Mark 10:1">chapter ten</span> of Mark, whether we shall enter the kingdom in the coming age depends in the first place on the way we handle our married life. </p>

As a result of my consideration, the Lord enlightened me to see that this indicates that those who are on their way to enter into the kingdom of God should not become old. Instead, they should be young, even as young children. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7BbI3FKGdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_"> Perhaps the most difficult thing for Christians to deal with regarding entering into God’s kingdom is their oldness. Much of the teaching, doctrine, and theology among today’s Christians is old. If we would enter into the kingdom of God, we need to be young and fresh. </p>
<p data-content-id="IgKBIj9xvn3kVySf5w4lIiwZB-WDTQgX3dkNC5dvPZxfKOYTZm1eWOeBjrXPL5gF0"> I am very concerned whenever I see the saints in the Lord’s recovery becoming old in their spiritual life. Thirty years ago, you may have been young and fresh, but now you may be old. Today Christians are held back from going on with the Lord by their oldness and also by their old teachings. These teachings may be fundamental and even scriptural and correct, but they are old. </p>
<p data-content-id="Hfo6mxQWhV9UNGGlxVrbVJTqFlUtfJf1FVddN1W7drZ0yu-2uolKPKUU_XXH9aAsf"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66384" data-verses="Mark 10:14-15">10:14-15</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Allow the young children to come to Me; do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God. Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a young child shall by no means enter into it.” Having said this, the Lord took the young children in His arms and blessed them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66385" data-verses="Mark 10:16">v. 16</span>). We see from this that the Lord Jesus treasured the young children and embraced them. By taking the young children in His arms and blessing <span class="pg" data-page-id="279" id="279">[279]</span> them, the Lord was indicating to His followers that they should not become old, that they all should be as young children in order to enter into the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudL94hJdyZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66386" data-verses="Mark 9:38">9:38</span> John, one of the sons of thunder, said to the Lord, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name who does not follow us, and we forbade him, because he was not following us.” The fact that John forbade someone from casting out demons in the Lord’s name was an indication that John had become old, spiritually speaking. </p>

We have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66394" data-verses="Mark 10:1">10:1</span> the Lord Jesus rose up from Galilee and came into the district of Judea. The Lord made this move deliberately so that He might die in Jerusalem for the accomplishment of God’s eternal plan. Therefore, to be on the way to Jerusalem is to be on the way to enter into the death of Christ. Then through death, we enter into His resurrection. Hence, the way to Jerusalem is the way into Christ’s death and resurrection. </p>

After that healing, the Lord and His followers came into Jerusalem. Their purpose in entering into Jerusalem was to enter into death, resurrection, and even ascension. The last six chapters of the Gospel of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66397" data-verses="Mark 11:1">Mark, chapters eleven through sixteen</span>, unveil how Christ with His followers entered into an all-inclusive death, a wonderful resurrection, and a marvelous ascension. <span class="pg" data-page-id="284" id="284">[284]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-7xC5GP8H6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF"> As we have pointed out in foregoing messages, as the Lord and His disciples were on the way to Jerusalem, He taught His followers how to handle the matters of marriage, oldness, and money. Each of these matters is closely related to our entering into the kingdom of God. The incidents in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66398" data-verses="Mark 10:32-52">10:32-52</span> also take place on the way to Jerusalem. </p>

Walking in front of the disciples, He took the lead to go up to Jerusalem with eagerness. The Lord’s followers were greatly surprised, perhaps even shocked, by His boldness. This verse says that those who followed were afraid. </p>
<p data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAekRDyq-aqrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj"> Why was the Lord Jesus so bold in going up to Jerusalem?

At this point, there was approximately one week remaining before He would be put to death. The Lord was not willing to be stopped, frustrated, or hindered in any way from going up to Jerusalem. If He were hindered, He would miss the day of the Passover, the day for Him to die as the Lamb of God. This was the reason the Lord was so bold to walk in front of all the disciples on the way to Jerusalem. </p>

The second time was in Galilee, after His transfiguration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66403" data-verses="Mark 9:31">9:31</span>). Now we need to see that the third unveiling took place on the way to Jerusalem. This revelation was a prophecy, altogether strange to the natural concept of the disciples, yet literally fulfilled in every detail. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YsklwMzN513qLhmk7B0qbY3z79rzoaz16RIy_1aceu91KDfDQgSH1KFDyFgXuTwem">INCLUDED IN THE LORD’S DEATH</h2><p data-content-id="EcbL8VFfQ-Sr2--CvsE4afdC5Af8VjbkN252A17whu13YIvULldJsUdlfmPvVHC1u"> Because the time for the Slave-Savior’s death had come, He was willing to go to Jerusalem. He went before His followers with a speed and boldness that amazed them. This was His obedience to God unto death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66404" data-verses="Philippians 2:8">Phil. 2:8</span>), according to the counsel of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66405" data-verses="Acts 2:23">Acts 2:23</span>), for the fulfillment of His redemptive plan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66406" data-verses="Isaiah 53:10">Isa. 53:10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="DioGnuR0sUvA-HjipPoZ8S5kDeFgdlHkYsKOva-5So8_5JX330ghXt3Lqsjs98JZo"> The Lord Jesus knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66407" data-verses="Luke 24:25-26">Luke 24:25-26</span>) and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66408" data-verses="John 12:23-24">John 12:23-24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66409" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). For the joy set before Him, He despised the shame (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66410" data-verses="Hebrews 12:2">Heb. 12:2</span>) and volunteered to be delivered to the Satan-usurped leaders of the Jews and condemned by them to death. Therefore, God exalted Him to the heavens, seated Him at His right hand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66411" data-verses="Mark 16:19">Mark 16:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66412" data-verses="Acts 2:33-35">Acts 2:33-35</span>), gave Him the name which is above every name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66413" data-verses="Philippians 2:9-10">Phil 2:9-10</span>), made Him both Lord and Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66414" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>), and crowned Him with glory and honor (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66415" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9">Heb. 2:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DYJbDHQfI3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ"> The death of the Lord Jesus in Jerusalem included not only the Lord Himself, but also His followers. In fact, we also were included in His death. When the Lord entered into His all-inclusive death, He brought His followers into that death with Him. It is important for us to have this view as we consider the remainder of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66416" data-verses="Mark 10:1">chapter ten</span> and then the last six chapters of the Gospel of Mark. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPHpyFxW7FN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, all His believers died with Him. According to the record of Mark, we can see that Peter, John, and James in particular were put to death <span class="pg" data-page-id="286" id="286">[286]</span> with the Lord Jesus. He brought them and the other disciples purposely with Him into death. As a result, they could share in His resurrection and even be witnesses of His ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="eW1-pGBoAGH7gOu2FihWZyx2iEuzXGZKhHTHlippcE-tSBQA2AEb8Btsa6mr5pa6x"> On the day of Pentecost, ten days after the Lord’s ascension, the Spirit, who is actually the Lord Himself, was poured out upon all those who entered into Christ’s death, participated in His resurrection, and saw His ascension. With Christ as the life-giving Spirit poured upon them, they could realize in their experience that truly they were in the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. Furthermore, they could apply the Lord’s crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to their living. Therefore, on the day of Pentecost Peter and the one hundred twenty were people in Christ’s death, resurrection, and ascension. They were one with Christ, and they were actually His embodiment. On that day they were living Christ. We all need to see such a marvelous picture. </p>
<p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4cidQaj1cuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> It was not an accident that on the day of Pentecost the one hundred twenty were witnesses of the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ. They all had followed Him and had passed with Him through death and into resurrection. They also saw His ascension. On the day of Pentecost they were in the reality of the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GS7W6l2-MeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO">THE BLINDNESS OF THE LORD’S FOLLOWERS</h2><p data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_tR7LpL5EraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV"> As the Lord Jesus and His disciples were on the way to Jerusalem, He wanted to impress them with the matters of His all-inclusive death and His wonderful resurrection. Hence, for the third time, He spoke to them about His death and resurrection. However, the disciples did not have eyes to see. Even after the Lord had repeated this word the third time, His followers still were not able to see it. </p>
<p data-content-id="hx_zzSpG4rVvnFzTT3v6iVo79ejIThvBxQ7OaGa7mOy9TYjUhbSqG4WclLusd8YDB"> The incidents recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66417" data-verses="Mark 10:35-45">10:35-45</span> prove that the Slave-Savior’s disciples were blind with respect to the vision of His death and resurrection. Immediately after the Lord’s unveiling of His death and resurrection for the third time, James <span class="pg" data-page-id="287" id="287">[287]</span> and John came to Him and said, “Teacher, we desire that whatever we ask You, You will do for us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66418" data-verses="Mark 10:35">v. 35</span>). The Lord replied, “What do you want Me to do for you? And they said to Him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on Your right, and one on Your left, in Your glory” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66419" data-verses="Mark 10:36-37">vv. 36-37</span>). This request exposes the fact that John and James were still natural sons of thunder. They certainly had not been replaced by Christ, and they had not been crucified and brought into the Lord’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="URtKIt0L_s2x9jmmiGPxw1Rxo9XCdhKgCltl2BQUyoJ1J6-naGmt6MTZtNA2Ufk2K"> According to the account in the Gospel of Matthew, it was the mother of the sons of Zebedee who made this request (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66420" data-verses="Matthew 20:20-21">Matt. 20:20-21</span>). She was a sister of Mary, the Lord’s mother, and was therefore His aunt. From this we see that James and John were the Lord’s cousins. It may have been based upon the fact that they thought they had a close natural relationship with Him that they asked for a favor—sitting at the Lord’s right and left in His glory. </p>

<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkry126Yz1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> These two brothers had been following the Lord from the very beginning. They were the next ones after Peter and Andrew to be called by Him. But, although they had followed the Lord for more than three years, they were still in their blindness and needed a further healing, a particular healing of their seeing organ. John and James were not able to see Christ and His death and resurrection. The Lord had spoken to them three times concerning His death, but because they were blind they were not able to understand what He was saying. <span class="pg" data-page-id="292" id="292">[292]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZXTJVAjg_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66439" data-verses="Mark 10:46">10:46</span> we are told that the Lord and His disciples came to Jericho, a place of curse. It was according to God’s sovereignty that they came to Jericho. </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHkf_C5tniWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66440" data-verses="Mark 10:32">Mark 10:32</span> says, “Now they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid.” The Lord was walking boldly in front of the disciples, and they were amazed and even frightened. While on the way, the Lord told them that He was going to Jerusalem in order to carry out an all-inclusive death, a death that would terminate the disciples and bring them into resurrection. As we have pointed out, because the disciples were blind, they could not understand the Lord’s word concerning His death, even after He had revealed it the third time. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl8wVD6Jt7DYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> Before they arrived at Jerusalem, a city of peace, they came to Jericho, a city of curse. It is very significant that near Jericho they met a blind man: “As He was going out from Jericho, and His disciples and a large crowd, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, sat by the road” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66441" data-verses="Mark 10:46">10:46</span>). This blind man, like the one in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66442" data-verses="Mark 8:22">8:22</span>, signifies one who has lost his inner sight, one spiritually blind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66443" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66444" data-verses="2Peter 1:9">2 Pet. 1:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="2biGa_BPHwBMmqGIr_3aCdS4wtrRfcU4sHxDfRZzyMIzlPqgeTUisrY2QHdBIBzZK"> We may say that blindness is the worst kind of curse. When someone is blind, he is cursed. Furthermore, blindness is a matter of darkness, and darkness is the issue of sin and death. Therefore, blindness indicates darkness, which is a composition of sin and death. Where there is blindness, there is darkness, and where there is darkness, there is sin and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="uamxl0odSMwfSIWjnQlAsdwo-fcQoDK5WNy2WFyi0oYKbOAd76mwgMMv-zAcUryim"> Even though the Lord’s disciples had been following Him for more than three years, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66445" data-verses="Mark 10:1">chapter ten</span> they were still blind. This means that, being in blindness, they were under darkness, and sin and death were present. Hence, they needed a clear vision of what the Lord Jesus would do in Jerusalem, a vision that He would enter into death in order to terminate the accursed situation. His death would eliminate blindness, darkness, sin, and death, and it would bring people into resurrection. Therefore, it was of God’s sovereignty that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="293" id="293">[293]</span> Lord and His disciples came to Jericho, into a place where there was a blind man. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7Bbo3GLmdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_"> The case of Bartimaeus, the blind beggar, indicates that all the disciples were blind. Their ambition for position was a sign of their blindness. Their ambition was also an indication that they were still under the curse. It is truly significant that immediately after John and James made their request to sit at the Lord’s right and left in His glory, they all came to Jericho, a city of curse. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IgKBIj9xvn3kVySf5wYlLiQZB-WDTQgX3dkNC5dvPZxfKOYTZm1eWOeBjrXPL5gF0">DEATH AS A PORTION AND A PROCESS</h2><p data-content-id="Hfo6mxQWhV9UNGGlxVLbWJzqFlUtfJf1FVddN1W7drZ0yu-2uolKPKUU_XXH9aAsf"> When James and John asked to sit at the Lord’s right and left, He said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66446" data-verses="Mark 10:38">v. 38</span>). We have seen that both the cup and the baptism refer to the death of the Slave-Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66447" data-verses="John 18:11">John 18:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66448" data-verses="Luke 12:50">Luke 12:50</span>). The cup signifies that His death was the God-given portion for Him to take for the sinners whom He would redeem for God. Baptism signifies that His death was the God-ordained way for Him to pass through for the accomplishment of redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudL9YhKeSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66449" data-verses="Mark 10:40">10:40</span> the Lord went on to say to John and James, “To sit on My right or on My left is not Mine to give, but for those for whom it has been prepared.” Here the Lord seems to be saying, “You ask to sit at My right and left. But I have no position to give you such a place, for I Myself am a slave. You should ask My Master concerning this. Don’t come to Me with such a request. As a slave I cannot do anything about it.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-UsZvqDpYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> In His answer to John and James the Lord Jesus exposed their ambition and independence. At the same time, His answer implied that He was altogether dependent on the Father as His Master. Because He was not independent of the Father, He did not have the standing to give a position to anyone. Being a slave, He knew that only the Father could assign a position to anyone. Moreover, the Lord’s wise answer implied that the disciples were in darkness, that <span class="pg" data-page-id="294" id="294">[294]</span> they did not know what they were asking. By making such a request, they went beyond their limit; they went too far. </p>
<p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1JawipYxH-0dVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66450" data-verses="Mark 10:38">verse 38</span> the Lord asked James and John if they were able to drink the cup that He would drink and be baptized with the baptism with which He would be baptized. When they told Him that they were able, He went on to say, “The cup which I drink you shall drink; and the baptism with which I am baptized, you shall be baptized” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66451" data-verses="Mark 10:39">v. 39</span>). Here the Lord seems to be saying, “Do you know what the cup indicates? It indicates death. Baptism also signifies death. Do you know what your portion is? Your portion is not a position—your portion is death. You want a position, but a position is not what you need. You need to realize that a portion, not a position, has been prepared for you, and this portion is My death. I must die, and you must die with Me. This death is also a baptism, a process through which I must pass. You will go through this process with Me. I do not have a position for you, for it is not My right to give you this. Your need is to take your portion and to pass through this process, both of which refer to death.” </p>
<p data-content-id="zbCxXV8yEF3E20ghcTqym1NKDAYoqh_2u6LkS3jfEW09yxoZ1BBUaNJDdc2JggHVC"> What is your portion in the church life today? Is your portion a certain position? Is it your portion to be an elder or a leader in a service group? We all need to realize that our portion in the church life is death. We need to drink the cup of crucifixion, of termination. Our portion in the church life is not position; our portion is termination. Do you want to be an elder? If so, you need to be terminated. Do you want to be a leader in a service group? If so, you need to be terminated. Our portion in the church life is termination, not position. </p>
<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJf1S_1XKJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> In the church we have death not only as a portion for us to drink, but also as a process through which we must pass. As those who are in the church life, we are in the baptism of the Lord’s death. We are passing through the lengthy process of death. </p>

The answer to this question is that the disciples could not participate in the enjoyment of the Lord otherwise. Furthermore, if they did not enjoy the Lord by being brought into His death and resurrection, they would not be able to enter into the kingdom of God or have anything to do with the kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DYI7DHSfI3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ"> We enter into the kingdom through the enjoyment of the Lord, through the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the universal replacement. In order to enjoy Him in this way, we need to pass through His death and resurrection. Therefore, the Lord worked on the disciples to make them ready to be brought into the process of His death and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPHoSFxU7FN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> We have seen that the Lord was proceeding onward to Jerusalem in order to die there. But we also need to realize that the Lord was not going to Jerusalem alone. Rather, He was bringing with Him a number of His faithful followers. These followers were not clear about what was happening. They may have felt only that the Lord was very lovable and that they wanted to go wherever He went. Actually, the Lord’s purpose was to bring all of them into His death and resurrection. Once the Lord’s followers were brought into His death and resurrection, they could participate in the enjoyment of Him in an actual and practical way. It is through death and resurrection that the Lord becomes our portion and our replacement. <span class="pg" data-page-id="301" id="301">[301]</span> </p>

From their point of view, they were following the Lord. But from the Lord’s point of view, He was preparing them to be brought into His death and resurrection. By the time they came to Jericho, they were fully prepared for this. </p>
<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GS626m3eMeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> By entering into the Lord’s death and resurrection, the disciples could have the enjoyment of the Lord and experience Him as their replacement. As a result, on the day of Pentecost the one hundred twenty were those who had been replaced by the Lord and who were enjoying Him. They all had been brought into the Lord’s death and resurrection. Through His death and resurrection they were participating in Him, a living, all-inclusive Person, as their replacement. </p>
<p data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_tQbLqKZEraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV"> Through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the disciples also had a rich entrance into the kingdom of God. Hence, on the day of Pentecost we see a picture of the kingdom of God. With Peter and the one hundred twenty on the day of Pentecost, we have a manifestation of the kingdom of God. This manifestation includes the full enjoyment of Christ as the universal, all-inclusive replacement through His death and resurrection. How was it possible for the one hundred twenty to be in the kingdom of God on the day of Pentecost? This was possible only through their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="hx_zzSpG4rVvnFzTT2P6hVI79ejIThvBxQ7OaGa7mOy9TYjUhbSqG4WclLusd8YDB"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66499" data-verses="Acts 1:1">chapter one</span> of Acts, the one hundred twenty were Galileans. Although they were from Galilee, the Lord Jesus brought them through many things to Jerusalem, where they entered into His death and resurrection. When the Lord was crucified, these Galileans were there and witnessed His death. Actually, they passed through crucifixion with Him. Eventually, they were brought into the Lord’s resurrection and saw His ascension. Then on the day of Pentecost the Lord as the Spirit was poured upon them. All that they had seen and passed through became a reality to them. They had seen the Lord’s death, they had entered into <span class="pg" data-page-id="302" id="302">[302]</span> His resurrection, and they had witnessed His ascension. But when the Lord as the Spirit was poured upon them, all these matters became a reality to them. This means that they were in the Lord’s death, resurrection, and ascension. They were participating in the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the universal replacement. </p>
<p data-content-id="URtKIt0L_s2x9jmmiHvxz1xxo9XCdhKgCltl2BQUyoJ1J6-naGmt6MTZtNA2Ufk2K"> We all need to have such a vision when we read the Gospel of Mark. If we do not have this vision, we shall not be able to get into the depths of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="MM4hI37Bq0acKu7uZd7yFQufA5Jn_2rlWqgP_ZCAOT51o90taGoOAfheGhkXDu6gu"> Apparently, Mark is a book of stories. Actually, it is not a book of stories but a book containing a wonderful vision. As we read the chapters of this Gospel, it is as if we are watching a heavenly television, and scene after scene is “telecast” into our spirit. Praise the Lord for such a vision! </p>
<p data-content-id="VWxmQv7W4uiwj768E2QdTYXWheU0GEWYtKu8tNXSAC0wKB8UNji7nnTh2Yra9R3z7"> We thank the Lord for showing us how His intimate followers are qualified, perfected, equipped, and made ready to enter into His death and resurrection. The lengthy section from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66500" data-verses="Mark 4:35">4:35 through 10:52</span> presents a clear picture of how Galileans who once were very natural could be prepared to enter into the death and resurrection of Christ. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66501" data-verses="Mark 10:1">chapter ten</span>, they are fully made ready to come to Jerusalem, that is, to enter into the death and resurrection of Christ. </p>

Only the Person of Christ Himself is greater than these. Apart from Christ Himself, nothing is as great as His death and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgCd2szpVdGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> We have seen that actually the Lord Jesus in going toward Jerusalem was proceeding toward His death. Then through His death He entered into His resurrection. The Lord Jesus walked boldly from Capernaum to Jerusalem in order to enter into death. God and the entire creation were waiting for this. Jesus knew that He was going to Jerusalem to carry out a great, all-inclusive death. Knowing the appointed time, the date of His death, He walked boldly to Jerusalem. <span class="pg" data-page-id="303" id="303">[303]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="j5IxdItcgq7F7cFXH3D0gY1iV23tF5HpwfjHaCnXDkXrkH_o8CLFY2KxyNHpzRRlL"> We may say that the greatest miracle in the universe was the Lord’s entering into and accomplishing His all-inclusive death. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66502" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1">Hebrews 12</span>, the Lord was happy with what lay before Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66503" data-verses="Hebrews 12:2">v. 2</span>). He knew that there was a joy set before Him. Therefore, He went up to Jerusalem that He might accomplish God’s purpose through His death. What a great step that was in God’s economy! </p>
<p data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDzuuU_qZANUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44"> It is a very significant matter that in carrying out His all-inclusive death, the Lord brought all of us into death with Him. If we see this, we shall not regard the Gospel of Mark merely as a book of stories. Instead, we shall see that this book conveys a great revelation. </p>

The Lord saw the fig tree with nothing on it except leaves, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66523" data-verses="Mark 11:14">verse 14</span> He said to it, “May no one eat fruit of you forever!” After cursing the fig tree, He entered into the temple and “began to cast out those who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who were selling the doves” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66524" data-verses="Mark 11:15">v. 15</span>). Then He said, “Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66525" data-verses="Mark 11:17">v. 17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8dboeUC7BkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> These two actions—the cursing of the fig tree and cleansing of the temple—indicate that the entire nation of Israel, which had been chosen by God for His purpose, had become fruitless and corrupt. The fig tree cursed by the Lord had leaves, but no fruit. It had outward glorification, but it did not have any fruit. It did not have any reality. It had nothing that could satisfy God’s desire. <span class="pg" data-page-id="308" id="308">[308]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudL84hKcSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> The temple, which should have been a house of prayer for all nations, the Gentiles as well as the Jews, had become a den of robbers. In the sight of God, those worshipping in the temple were robbers. God’s house on earth actually had become a den of robbers. Therefore, after cursing the fig tree to end its life, the Lord cleansed the temple in order to eliminate the corruption. </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-Ut5vqBpYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> As the Lord was doing these things, no one dared to oppose Him outwardly, for He had already received the people’s approval. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66526" data-verses="Mark 11:18">verse 18</span> says, “And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and they sought how they might destroy Him, for they feared Him, for all the crowd was astounded at His teaching.” </p>
<p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1Jawio4xE-UdVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> The cursing of the fig tree signifies the terminating of the life of Israel as a nation. From that time onward, the nation of Israel was finished with God’s New Testament economy. In addition to cursing the fig tree, the Lord also cleansed the corruption from the house of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="zbCxXV8yEF3E20ghcSKyl1tKDAYoqh_2u6LkS3jfEW09yxoZ1BBUaNJDdc2JggHVC"> In the first ten chapters of the Gospel of Mark the Lord was kind, merciful, and compassionate. But here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66527" data-verses="Mark 11:12-26">11:12-26</span> it seems that He is very different, first cursing the fig tree and then cleansing the temple, even overturning the tables of the moneychangers. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66528" data-verses="Mark 11:16">verse 16</span>, “He did not permit anyone to carry a vessel through the temple.” The Lord was very bold, strong, and even severe. He seemed to show no mercy at all. </p>
<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJf0y_2WqJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> We need to see that the cursing of the fig tree and the cleansing of the temple were part of the Slave-Savior’s preparation for His redemptive death. He prepared the way for the Pharisees and scribes to put Him to death. </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQuuQBuu6ZSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> It was late in the day when the Lord cleansed the temple. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66529" data-verses="Mark 11:19">Verse 19</span> says, “And when it became late, they went outside the city.” It is likely that during the night He lodged in Bethany. </p>

The Lord answered by saying, “Have faith in God. Truly I tell you, that whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says happens, it shall be to him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66532" data-verses="Mark 11:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>). Then the Lord went on to speak about prayer. In particular He pointed out our need to forgive others: “And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, that your Father who is in the heavens may also forgive you your offenses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66533" data-verses="Mark 11:25">v. 25</span>). Here we see that to forgive the offenses of others is the ground for our heavenly Father to forgive us. This is especially true in our prayer time. Strictly speaking, we cannot pray with a heart that holds anything against anyone, that is, with a heart that feels offended by anyone or remembers another’s offense. </p>

The church is composed of those who have been brought into the death and resurrection of Christ in order to participate in the full enjoyment of Christ. This people includes both Jews and Gentiles. </p>
<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6seojViENHl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66534" data-verses="Mark 11:12">Mark 11:12</span> says that the Lord was hungry. This signifies that He was hungry for fruit from the children of Israel that God might be satisfied. The fig tree, however, did not have any fruit. We have seen that this fig tree is a symbol of the nation of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66535" data-verses="Jeremiah 24:2">Jer. 24:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66536" data-verses="Jeremiah 24:5">5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66537" data-verses="Jeremiah 24:8">8</span>). The fact that it was full of leaves but fruitless signifies that at that time the nation of Israel was full of outward show, but had nothing that could satisfy God. </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-HaY2-YPWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66538" data-verses="Mark 11:12-26">11:12-26</span> the Slave-Savior’s cursing of the fig tree and His cleansing of the temple are merged. This indicates His dealing with the corrupted and rebellious nation of Israel in different aspects at the same time. The fig tree was a symbol <span class="pg" data-page-id="310" id="310">[310]</span> of the nation of Israel, and the temple was its center in its relationship with God. As a fig tree planted by God, it did not bear fruit for Him, and as the center of its relationship with God, the temple was filled with corruption. Hence, the Slave-Savior cursed the fruitless fig tree and cleansed the contaminated temple. Such a dealing may be considered a harbinger of the destruction foretold in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66539" data-verses="Mark 12:9">12:9</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66540" data-verses="Mark 13:2">13:2</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaTGqNHyDU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu">THE LORD’S HUMAN DIGNITY AND GENUINENESS<br/>AND HIS DIVINE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY</h2><p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QDDF53aRyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> In His ministry for the spread of the gospel in Galilee in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66541" data-verses="Mark 1:14">1:14—10:52</span>, the Slave-Savior’s work was to preach the gospel, teach the truth, cast out demons, and heal the sick. In that work, His human virtues with His divine attributes were expressed as His qualification for, and beauty in, His divine service rendered to sinners for God. In His preparation in Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66542" data-verses="Mark 11:15">11:15—14:42</span>) for His redemptive work, His major work was to confront the opposing Jewish leaders, who were supposed to be the builders of God’s building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66543" data-verses="Mark 12:9-10">12:9-10</span>), but actually had been usurped by God’s enemy Satan and instigated by him to plot to kill the Slave-Savior. In this confrontation, under their subtle and evil questioning, testing, and examining, His human dignity was expressed in His human genuineness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66544" data-verses="Mark 11:15-18">11:15-18</span>), and His divine wisdom and authority were expressed in His human conduct and perfection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66545" data-verses="Mark 11:27">11:27—12:37</span>), so that eventually His fault-finders became His quality-provers. This paved the way for Him to point out to these blind opposers that He, the Christ, as the Son of David was the Lord of David, the very God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66546" data-verses="Mark 12:35-37">12:35-37</span>), so that they might know His deity in His humanity, that they might know that He was God living in man. </p>
<p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8DlSJun_3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> In dealing with the opposers, the Lord’s human dignity certainly was expressed in His human genuineness. While He was being examined by them, He expressed His dignity in His genuineness. Furthermore, at the same time, His divine wisdom and authority were expressed in His human conduct and perfection. As a result, those who came with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="311" id="311">[311]</span> intention of finding fault with Him had to become those who could prove His qualities. </p>

Peter, John, and James represented all the intimate followers of the Lord. From the very beginning, these three followed the Lord closely. As we read the Gospel of Mark, we see that Peter, John, and James followed the Lord Jesus step by step. Eventually, the Lord brought them into His all-inclusive death. Of course, they did not actually suffer death with the Lord; nevertheless, they went through the process of His death. They saw how the Lord prepared Himself to die. They also saw how He prepared the environment for His death and even prepared His opposers, who put Him to death. Moreover, they saw how the Lord was arrested, judged according to Jewish law, and judged by the Roman governor according to Gentile law. They saw how He was mocked, persecuted, and led as a lamb to the slaughter. They saw how the Lord was put on the cross and how He remained there for six hours. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w-YhEssZS764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> The Lord passed through death, and the disciples passed through death with Him. The only difference was that they did not actually suffer death. The Lord Himself personally <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> suffered death, whereas the disciples passed through the process of death. Of course, they were not placed in the tomb nor did they go into Hades. However, we may say that the days between the Lord’s death and resurrection were a “tomb” to the disciples. We may also say that, in a sense, they passed through Hades. Then on the morning of the Lord’s resurrection, certain of the disciples discovered the empty tomb and learned that the crucified Jesus had been resurrected from among the dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="O8UhUNYqCBnM85L87xHfDQE6jIJZsoKJvEqYZJW8OEAFLWMdG4aWhxw5QHfd9cISQ"> We should not read the Gospel of Mark merely as a book of stories. Neither should we read this Gospel only to learn doctrine. On the contrary, as we read this Gospel, we need to see vision after vision. As we read the Gospel of Mark, we should have the sense that we are watching a heavenly television. </p>
<p data-content-id="MM4hI37Bq0acKu7uZdbyFSufA5Jn_2rlWqgP_ZCAOT51o90taGoOAfheGhkXDu6gu"> On the day of Pentecost the Spirit was poured out upon the one hundred twenty. Through death and resurrection, the very Slave-Savior revealed in Mark became the life-giving Spirit, who was poured out upon the disciples. This means that the Lord poured Himself out upon those who had seen the visions recorded in the Gospel of Mark. Through this outpouring of the Spirit, the one hundred twenty received the reality of all the visions they had seen. </p>
<p data-content-id="VWxmQv7W4uiwj768E2wdTaXWheU0GEWYtKu8tNXSAC0wKB8UNji7nnTh2Yra9R3z7"> I hope that these messages in the Life-study of Mark will help you to see the visions contained in this Gospel. Eventually, the resurrected Christ as the living Spirit will pour out Himself upon you to make whatever you see a reality to you. Then in reality you will be in the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. Truly you will be enjoying Him as the entire, universal replacement. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="isH1YhKLP27GpYb1i_0H6A3jpPE3d1Q-bGo8ZH-xoo3romA6yrPL5uOuCKtIgHwLz">SIX DAYS FOR THE NEW CREATION</h2><p data-content-id="1YZgJVvfR7nEdPyghjnBGvLFC4vhwTC01Dl5_a_Qjw4LWip4gb95cZHsWchz2v1DI"> In this message we shall go on to consider the last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66559" data-verses="Mark 11:1">chapter eleven</span> of Mark. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66560" data-verses="Mark 11:1">Mark 11</span> describes events that took place during the last six days of the Lord’s earthly life. These six days were for the new creation. According to the book of Genesis, within a period of six days God completed the old creation. Then on the seventh day, the Sabbath, God <span class="pg" data-page-id="319" id="319">[319]</span> rested. In a similar way, the Lord took six days to bring forth God’s new creation. After these six days had been completed, there was another Sabbath. The Lord was crucified on a Friday, and the next day was a Sabbath. From this we see that it took the Lord six days to complete the preparation and bring the new creation into being. In the six days that concluded with His death, the Lord did everything necessary to bring the new creation into existence for God. Then after these six days, He rested on the seventh day, the Sabbath. In these messages we are seeking to understand what took place during these six days. </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgCdWswo1dGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> On the first of these six days the Lord Jesus triumphantly entered into Jerusalem, riding on a colt. The people cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66561" data-verses="Mark 11:9">v. 9</span>). Here we see that the Lord received the approval of the people. After making such an entrance into Jerusalem, He entered into the temple “and having looked around at all things, the hour being already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66562" data-verses="Mark 11:11">v. 11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="j5IxdItcgq7F7cFXH3j0jZViV23tF5HpwfjHaCnXDkXrkH_o8CLFY2KxyNHpzRRlL"> Returning to the city the next day, He cursed the fig tree and cleansed the temple. In order to be impressed with the seriousness of these matters, we may compare them to someone going into the capital city of a country, burning the flag, and then entering one of the main government buildings and causing a great disturbance. Certainly such deeds would be written about in the newspapers. </p>
<p data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDzuu0_pZgNUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44"> After cursing the fig tree, the symbol of the Jewish nation, the Lord entered into the temple and turned over the tables of the moneychangers. Because He had already received the approval of the people, no one dared to stop Him. At the time, all the leaders were silenced. However, they plotted secretly how to destroy the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoUQDxidzfrq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66563" data-verses="Mark 11:19">11:19</span>, “When it became late, they went outside the city.” This took place on the evening of the second day. No doubt, that evening the disciples must have talked with one another about what the Lord had done in Jerusalem. Probably throughout the city of Jerusalem many were talking about what the Lord did in cleansing the temple. <span class="pg" data-page-id="320" id="320">[320]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UYQJrfbQaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> On the morning of the third day, the disciples saw the fig tree withered from the roots (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66564" data-verses="Mark 11:20">v. 20</span>). Then they came again to Jerusalem. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66565" data-verses="Mark 11:27">Verse 27</span> says, “As He walked in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him.” If the Lord had not received the approval of the people, He could not have walked in the temple in such a way. Instead, He would immediately have been arrested and put to death. But because He had been received by the people, He was free to walk about in the temple. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxdP2QoV74uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr">QUESTIONED BY THE CHIEF PRIESTS,<br/>SCRIBES, AND ELDERS</h2><p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxNYZr62sS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> The chief priests, the scribes, and the elders—the three categories of those who made up the Sanhedrin—came to the Lord and said to Him, “By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority that you may do these things?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66566" data-verses="Mark 11:28">v. 28</span>). Here the chief priests, scribes, and elders seemed to be saying, “You cursed the fig tree, and then you overturned the tables in the temple. By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you authority to do these things? What you have done is extremely serious. Therefore, we want to know about your origin and authority.” </p>
<p data-content-id="wpXywTj2q7bZ6nRb4ngXs2746v2MilKq_Qrlx_oVfo-DxccuXUCSfxlA5gn9T8oHg"> In dealing with the chief priests, scribes, and elders, the Lord Jesus was very dignified. He was not afraid as He was confronting this situation, but answered their questions with boldness. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98oRxBEl40xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB">The Lord’s Question</h2><p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TE6Ws5Z8c8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> The Lord Jesus said to them, “I will question you about one thing, and answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things: The baptism of John, was it of heaven or of men? Answer Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66567" data-verses="Mark 11:29-30">vv. 29-30</span>). On the one hand, the Lord Jesus was not afraid of being questioned by the chief priests, scribes, and elders. On the other hand, He counter-questioned them with dignity. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPABonsNSBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> Before answering the Lord’s question, the chief priests, scribes, and elders held counsel among themselves. “They <span class="pg" data-page-id="321" id="321">[321]</span> reasoned with themselves saying, If we say, Of heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him? But should we say, Of men—they feared the crowd, for all held that John was really a prophet” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66568" data-verses="Mark 11:31-32">vv. 31-32</span>). Realizing that there was no way for them to answer the Lord’s question without losing the case, they decided to lie. Therefore, they said to the Lord Jesus, “We do not know” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66569" data-verses="Mark 11:33">v. 33</span>). The Lord knew what was in their hearts. He knew that they were lying to Him. </p>

Jews from many different places had come to Jerusalem for this feast. The Lord’s cleansing of the temple aroused the attention of the people. First, the chief priests, scribes, and elders came to the Lord Jesus with a question concerning His authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66580" data-verses="Mark 11:27-33">11:27-33</span>). After the chief priests, scribes, and elders were defeated by Him, the Pharisees and Herodians tried to catch Him in His speech (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66581" data-verses="Mark 12:13-17">12:13-17</span>). However, they also were defeated by the Slave-Savior. </p>

The Sadducees were a sect among the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66583" data-verses="Acts 5:17">Acts 5:17</span>). They did not believe in the resurrection, nor in angels, nor in spirits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66584" data-verses="Acts 23:8">Acts 23:8</span>). Both the Pharisees and the Sadducees were denounced by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus as a brood of vipers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66585" data-verses="Matthew 3:7">Matt. 3:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66586" data-verses="Matthew 12:34">12:34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66587" data-verses="Matthew 23:33">23:33</span>). The Lord warned His disciples against their doctrines (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66588" data-verses="Matthew 16:6">Matt. 16:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66589" data-verses="Matthew 16:12">12</span>). While the Pharisees were supposed to be orthodox, the Sadducees may be considered ancient modernists. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPHoiF5GLFN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66590" data-verses="Mark 12:18-27">Mark 12:18-27</span> the Sadducees thought that they could defeat the Lord Jesus regarding the matter of resurrection. They questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if anyone’s brother should die and leave behind a wife, <span class="pg" data-page-id="326" id="326">[326]</span> and leave no child, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed to his brother. There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying, left no seed; and the second took her, and died, leaving behind no seed; and the third similarly; and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died. In the resurrection, when they rise, which one’s wife will she be, for the seven had her as wife?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66591" data-verses="Mark 12:19-23">vv. 19-23</span>). The Sadducees thought that they were very clever in asking the Lord such a question. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocbrXGHtKNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> The Lord Jesus said to them, “Are you not deceived because of this—not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66592" data-verses="Mark 12:24">v. 24</span>). Knowing the Scriptures is one thing, and knowing the power of God is another. We need to know both. Here “the Scriptures” refer to the verses of the Old Testament concerning resurrection, and “the power of God” refers to the power of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8dbo-UKpxkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> The Lord went on to say that in the resurrection there will not be any marriage: “For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66593" data-verses="Mark 12:25">v. 25</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6seoj1iHNnl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> The Lord Jesus, however, did not stop here. He continued by saying, “But concerning the dead, that they are raised, did you not read in the book of Moses, at the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are greatly deceived” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66594" data-verses="Mark 12:26-27">vv. 26-27</span>). Since God is the God of the living and is called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, therefore these three who had died, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, will be resurrected. This is the way the Lord Jesus expounded the Scriptures—not only by the letter, but by the life and power implied within them. </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-Ha429YvWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> In His word to the Sadducees in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66595" data-verses="Mark 12:26">verse 26</span>, the Lord Jesus was actually referring to Himself, for He, as the Angel of Jehovah, was the One who spoke to Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66596" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>. Here the Lord seems to be saying, “I was the One speaking to Moses. I, your God, was the Angel who spoke to him from within the bush. Furthermore, Jehovah is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If they will not be resurrected, how <span class="pg" data-page-id="327" id="327">[327]</span> could God be called their God? He would never be known as the God of the dead—He is the God of the living. Therefore, this title indicates resurrection.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaTGKNEzjU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu">RECEIVING LIGHT FROM THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QDDl50bxyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> We should not think that to understand the Bible it is sufficient to know the original languages of the Bible, Hebrew and Greek. The ancient scribes knew the Old Testament in Hebrew. But although they had the knowledge of the language, they did not have any light. The Lord Jesus, on the contrary, had the divine light. For this reason, He was able to point out how the matter of resurrection is implied in the title of God as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. Without divine light, no one would be able to see that this divine title involves resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8DlyJtnf3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> I encourage the saints to learn Hebrew and Greek. But you may have a doctoral degree in Hebrew or Greek and still be blind. You need light from God. In order to receive light, you should not trust in your knowledge of biblical languages or in the expositions of the great teachers, but you need to kneel down before the Lord and open to Him. You may need to say, “Lord Jesus, although I know Hebrew and Greek, without You I cannot see any light. Lord, I need Your enlightenment. Light does not come from my study or analysis. Light comes, Lord, through Your mercy. O Lord, how I need to receive light from You.” </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYl2f00iQ6xklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> If we do not receive light from the Lord, we may read the Gospel of Mark again and again without seeing anything. We need the visions contained in this book to be “telecast” into our being. I can testify that, by the Lord’s mercy, I have seen the visions in this book. Sometimes the light comes while I am speaking. For example, it was during the course of one of the messages that I saw the comparison of the six days for the old creation with the six days of preparation for the new creation. Such light does not come from knowing the biblical languages or the writings of expositors. It comes from the Lord through His mercy as we open ourselves to Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="328" id="328">[328]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPd0jRSLlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF">QUESTIONED BY A SCRIBE</h2><p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEaSBTpPZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66597" data-verses="Mark 12:28-34">12:28-34</span> the Slave-Savior was questioned by a scribe. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66598" data-verses="Matthew 22:35">Matthew 22:35</span> this one is called a lawyer. “Scribe” is a wider term that includes the lawyers, who were Mosaic jurists. The lawyers were versed in the law of Moses; they were professional interpreters of the law of the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w-YxEm-5S764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> This scribe, who knew the law in a thorough way, boldly came to the Lord Jesus. Knowing that He had answered well those who were disputing with Him, the scribe asked the Lord, “Which is the first commandment of all?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66599" data-verses="Mark 12:28">v. 28</span>). The Lord answered, “The first is, Hear, Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart, and from your whole soul, and from your whole mind, and from your whole strength” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66600" data-verses="Mark 12:29-30">vv. 29-30</span>). To love the Lord in this way is to love Him with every part of our being, with our spirit, soul, and body. </p>
<p data-content-id="O8UhUNYqCBnM85L87xXfIC06jIJZsoKJvEqYZJW8OEAFLWMdG4aWhxw5QHfd9cISQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66601" data-verses="Mark 12:31">verse 31</span> the Lord continued His answer: “The second is this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.” </p>
<p data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-7xDpGM8n6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF"> These two commandments are both a matter of love, either loving God or loving man. Love is the spirit of God’s commandments. The greatest commandments, therefore, are altogether a matter of love, a love toward God and toward man. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9Z7HABVRB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m">THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE LORD’S FOLLOWERS</h2><p data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAekQTyp_6qrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66602" data-verses="Mark 12:34">Verse 34</span> ends like this: “And no one dared to question Him anymore.” The Lord Jesus answered all the questions and gained a full victory. No doubt, Peter, John, James, and all the other close followers of the Lord Jesus saw these confrontations and were impressed with the way the Lord handled them. Do you not believe that they were deeply impressed with how the Lord answered the questions raised by the opposers, with how He passed through an insidious test and examination? Certainly, the Lord’s followers must have been very impressed with Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="329" id="329">[329]</span> </p>

These questions represent different aspects of man’s culture. The first question (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66629" data-verses="Mark 11:27-33">11:27-33</span>) concerned religion. The chief priests, scribes, and elders asked the Slave-Savior a question related to typical, bona fide religion. In particular, they questioned the Lord Jesus concerning His authority. The chief priests, scribes, and elders thought they were serving God and that they knew the law of Moses. We may say that they had a typical religion. Now they wanted to know the origin of the things the Lord Jesus was doing. Therefore, the first question asked of the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66630" data-verses="Mark 11:27-33">11:27-33</span> was related to bona fide religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="isH1YhKLP27GpYb1i8UHzS3jpPE3d1Q-bGo8ZH-xoo3romA6yrPL5uOuCKtIgHwLz"> The second question was raised by the Pharisees and Herodians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66631" data-verses="Mark 12:13-17">12:13-17</span>). They came to Him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are true, and you do not care about anyone; for you do not regard the face of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Should we give, or should we not give?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66632" data-verses="Mark 12:14">v. 14</span>). This question was related to politics. </p>
<p data-content-id="1YZgJVvfR7nEdPyghgHBO9bFC4vhwTC01Dl5_a_Qjw4LWip4gb95cZHsWchz2v1DI"> The third question, asked by the Sadducees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66633" data-verses="Mark 12:18-27">12:18-27</span>), was related to belief. In particular, the Sadducees wanted to know what the Lord believed concerning resurrection. As we have pointed out, the Sadducees, who may be considered <span class="pg" data-page-id="332" id="332">[332]</span> ancient modernists, did not believe in resurrection. The third question, therefore, concerns belief. </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UYTprfZQaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> The fourth question (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66634" data-verses="Mark 12:28-34">12:28-34</span>) was asked by a scribe. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66635" data-verses="Mark 12:28">Mark 12:28</span> says, “And one of the scribes who had approached and heard them disputing, knowing that He answered them well, questioned Him, Which is the first commandment of all?” This question is related to the interpretation of the Bible. The scribe was asking the Slave-Savior how He interpreted the Bible with respect to which commandment was first. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxdMWQoX74uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr">CHRIST AS THE SON OF DAVID<br/>AND THE LORD OF DAVID</h2><p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxNb5r52MS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> The matters covered by these four kinds of questions include the components of the highest human culture. However, each kind of question neglects Christ, the One who is the entire, universal replacement. Because His questioners did not pay attention to Christ, the Lord Himself made up the lack when He counter-questioned them, saying, “How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet. David himself calls Him Lord, and how can He be his son?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66636" data-verses="Mark 12:35-37">12:35-37</span>). Here the Lord was asking how the scribes can say that Christ is the son of David when David himself calls Him Lord. Here the Lord was indicating that the scribes knew Christ only as a man. They did not realize that Christ, the Messiah, is also God Himself and hence, a God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="wpXywTj2q7bZ6nRb4kAXv2b46v2MilKq_Qrlx_oVfo-DxccuXUCSfxlA5gn9T8oHg"> The Lord seemed to be saying to all those who were testing and examining Him, “You know Me only as a Nazarene. You do not know Me as God. Although I am frank and honest with you, I am also merciful. Even though I am the almighty God, your Creator, I have the patience to be examined and tested by you. If I were not merciful to you and if I manifested Myself in My divine essence, you would all be slain. But I am compassionate. Nevertheless, I am the very God whom David addressed as Lord.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="333" id="333">[333]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98oSRBHkY0xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB"> We need to realize that Peter, John, James, and all the other close followers of the Lord Jesus were standing nearby observing what the Lord did and hearing what He said. No doubt, they were deeply impressed with the Slave-Savior. They must have talked with one another. Perhaps Peter said to John and James, “On the one hand, our Teacher is the son of David. But on the other hand, He is the Lord. Have you ever realized this? Did you know that our Teacher is not only a man but also God the Lord?” I believe that the disciples spoke with one another in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TE52s6Ycc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> If you had been one of the Lord’s disciples observing how He handled the opposers, would you not have spoken to the others about it? Would you not have been impressed with the fact that your Teacher revealed to the opposers that He was not only the son of David but also the Lord of David? No doubt, the Lord’s close followers received a deep impression concerning Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPACInvNyBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> We have seen that the Lord Jesus brought His followers into Jerusalem with Him for a purpose. He did not intend to go into death alone. Rather, He brought a group of His followers into death with Him. Those followers are our representatives. When they were with the Lord in Jerusalem, we all were there. Hallelujah, we today are the Lord’s close followers! As His followers, we are seeing from the Gospel of Mark a series of heavenly visions, visions that are being “telecast” into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTTFYMyAqm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66637" data-verses="Mark 12:37">12:37</span> the Slave-Savior had gained a full victory. He had not only received the approval of the people; He had also subdued His opposers. The chief priests, scribes, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees all were subdued. Jesus the Nazarene was manifested as being a marvelous Person. To be sure, His disciples were very pleased with the situation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxjwWileWnJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB">A WARNING CONCERNING THE SCRIBES</h2><p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkrwF2yID1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> Immediately after the Lord had subdued all the opposers and had spoken to them concerning Christ, He went on to give them a warning concerning the scribes. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66638" data-verses="Mark 12:38-40">Mark 12:38-40</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="334" id="334">[334]</span> says, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and like greetings in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at the dinners; who devour the widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater judgment.” Elsewhere the Lord had told His disciples to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66639" data-verses="Mark 8:15">8:15</span>). The leaven of the Pharisees was their hypocrisy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66640" data-verses="Luke 12:1">Luke 12:1</span>), and the leaven of Herod was his corruption and injustice in politics. With the scribes there was the matter of vain knowledge, even a vain knowledge of the Bible. The scribes taught theology or doctrine in a way that was vain. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pu9555BwdXseDKhVEfTfpZkuIg4gGqssN05hXWqG5AOWLMiJFHRYC9yb9EUElWhG0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66641" data-verses="Mark 11:1">chapters eleven and twelve</span> of the Gospel of Mark the scribes are mentioned a number of times. The scribes were among those who questioned the Lord concerning His authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66642" data-verses="Mark 11:27-28">11:27-28</span>). It was a scribe who asked the Lord a question concerning the interpretation of the Bible (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66643" data-verses="Mark 12:28">12:28</span>). Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66644" data-verses="Mark 12:35">12:35</span> the Lord inquired, “How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?” Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66645" data-verses="Mark 12:38">12:38</span> the Lord specifically issues a warning against the scribes. </p>
<p data-content-id="-5AXIggToD6uMh3UHseeAFZfYbf5HiOdJu1FrqXNWLmcCgTAMm7L2e-ug40_gpPOy"> The scribes thought they knew the Bible and also doctrine and theology. Although they may have known the Scriptures in letters, they certainly did not know Christ. Therefore, in His teaching the Lord asked how it is that the scribes say that Christ is the son of David. The scribes taught vain theology, a theology without Christ as reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZXR5VDjA_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> It is possible that we may be today’s scribes. Our teaching may be right, but it may be empty, that is, without Christ. The ancient scribes taught people according to the Old Testament, but they did not have the light concerning Christ. They did not have any understanding of Him as the God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHkdPC6tHiWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> We need to discern whether a particular message or teaching has Christ as its center, reality, and living essence. Certain preachers and teachers are naturally eloquent and can present doctrine to others in a way that pleases the itching ears. Such teaching, preaching, or expounding of <span class="pg" data-page-id="335" id="335">[335]</span> the Bible is according to man’s knowledge with human eloquence. We need to be able to discern whether Christ is the center, reality, and essence of each message. If Christ is not the center, then that message is empty. In principle, it belongs to the teaching of the scribes, and we should beware of it. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl8wXz6KsbDYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> We should not think that as long as a teaching is scriptural, there is no problem with it. There is a means for us to discern all kinds of teaching, and that is to discern whether or not Christ is the center, reality, and essence of every teaching. In the Lord’s recovery Christ must be the center, reality, and essence of every message. A message or teaching may be scholarly, academic, scriptural, and eloquent, providing a great deal of Bible knowledge. Nevertheless, it is possible for such a teaching to be a teaching of today’s scribes. We need to follow this as a basic principle in discerning the teaching in the Lord’s recovery. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wpXywTj2q7bZ6nRb4kQXpkL46v2MilKq_Qrlx_oVfo-DxccuXUCSfxlA5gn9T8oHg">A WARNING CONCERNING THE SCRIBES</h2><p data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98oSBBO340xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66657" data-verses="Mark 12:35">12:35</span> the Lord Jesus, teaching in the temple, says, “How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?” Then the Lord Jesus went on to ask how the Christ could be the son of David when David himself called Him Lord. The Lord’s question concerning Christ silenced the opposers. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66658" data-verses="Mark 12:37">Verse 37</span> says, “And the great crowd heard Him gladly.” </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TE5msyLsc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> As the immediate continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66659" data-verses="Mark 12:35-37">12:35-37</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66660" data-verses="Mark 12:38">verse 38</span> says, “And in His teaching He said, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and like greetings in the marketplaces.” This word, no doubt, is spoken in relation to the fact that, though the scribes supposedly knew the Bible, they knew very little concerning Christ. They knew something of Christ’s humanity; however, they did not know anything at all regarding His deity. Hence, they were devoid of the proper knowledge of the reality of Christ. Because of this shortage, the Lord Jesus warned the people to beware of the scribes. </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPd3DRSJlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> According to the Lord’s word, the scribes not only liked to walk around in long robes and liked the greetings in marketplaces, but they also liked the chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at dinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66661" data-verses="Mark 12:39">v. 39</span>). Furthermore, the scribes “devour the widows’ houses, and for a pretense make <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> long prayers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66662" data-verses="Mark 12:40">v. 40</span>). This indicates that the scribes had only an appearance; they did not have reality. The fact that the scribes liked to walk around in long robes indicates that they cared for position, honor, and glory. They also enjoyed receiving the people’s respect and regard. This indicates strongly that they were empty, vain teachers of the Bible, altogether lacking the reality of Christ. In their living there was no reality. Instead, they were seeking position, respect, honor, and glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEaRhTpNZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> We all need to heed the Lord’s warning regarding the scribes. There is the possibility that even among us in the Lord’s recovery some may be like the scribes in principle. They may have some knowledge of the Bible and the eloquence to speak in a way that attracts others. However, they may not have the reality of the God-man, the One who is both God and man, the all-inclusive Christ as our universal replacement. We should be warned concerning those who lack the inward reality of Christ and yet are seeking position, respect, honor, and glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w-bREl-ZS764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66663" data-verses="Mark 12:41-44">12:41-44</span> the Lord Jesus appraised a poor widow in her loyalty. This widow probably did not have much knowledge of the Bible. Nevertheless, she had reality, for her heart was sincere, honest, and faithful to God. There was inward reality in her daily life. This widow is presented in contrast to the scribes with their empty knowledge. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66665" data-verses="Mark 13:1">13:1—14:42</span> the Lord Jesus prepared the disciples for His death. We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66666" data-verses="Mark 11:1">11:1—12:44</span> the preparation of the Slave-Savior for His redemptive work included three matters: entering into Jerusalem and lodging in Bethany (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66667" data-verses="Mark 11:1-11">11:1-11</span>), cursing the fig tree and cleansing the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66668" data-verses="Mark 11:12-26">11:12-26</span>), and being tested and examined (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66669" data-verses="Mark 11:27">11:27—12:44</span>).

Therefore, the persecutions described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66737" data-verses="Mark 13:9">verse 9</span> will come from two sources, from both Jews and Gentiles. <span class="pg" data-page-id="350" id="350">[350]</span> </p>

The gospel of the kingdom includes the gospel of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66740" data-verses="Acts 20:24">Acts 20:24</span>). However, the gospel of the kingdom brings people not only into God’s salvation but also into God’s kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66741" data-verses="Revelation 1:9">Rev. 1:9</span>). The emphasis of the gospel of grace is on forgiveness of sin, God’s redemption, and eternal life; the emphasis of the gospel of the kingdom is on the ruling of God and the authority of the Lord. The gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all nations before the end of the age comes. This testimony must spread throughout the earth before the end of this age, before the time of the great tribulation. </p>

This word is brief, yet all-inclusive. The persecution will come from Jews, from Gentiles, and even from the members of one’s own family.

Here “saved” may mean to be saved from those who hate and persecute. But eventually this word means to be saved into the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age, a manifestation that will be a reward to the overcoming believers.

Many readers of the New Testament regard <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66816" data-verses="Mark 13:1">Mark 13</span> merely as a prophecy. Actually, this chapter is not merely a prophecy; it is also a word of preparation given by the Lord Jesus to His followers. Two indications of this are the word “temple” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66817" data-verses="Mark 13:1">verse 1</span> and the expression “birth pangs” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66818" data-verses="Mark 13:8">verse 8</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zbCxXV8yEF3E20ghbTKyjn9KDAYoqh_2u6LkS3jfEW09yxoZ1BBUaNJDdc2JggHVC">CHRIST AS THE UNIVERSAL REPLACEMENT</h2><p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJY1y__FKJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66819" data-verses="Mark 11:1">chapter eleven</span> the Lord Jesus cleansed the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66820" data-verses="Mark 11:15-17">11:15-17</span>). In a very real sense, the Lord condemned the temple. After cleansing the temple, the Lord Jesus dealt with the leaders of Judaism, those who were especially concerned for the temple. The disciples heard all that the Lord said to those leaders. After such a thorough dealing with the temple and with the Jewish leaders, the Lord went out of the temple. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66821" data-verses="Mark 13:1">Mark 13:1</span> says, “And as He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples says to Him, Teacher, behold, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!” This is a strong indication that the Lord’s disciples were still occupied with the traditional concept of the temple, which was a sign or symbol of the Jewish religion. For the disciples to still have such a regard for the temple meant that they were fully occupied with their old religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQupRBumppSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> When the Lord Jesus was on earth, God’s intention in His <span class="pg" data-page-id="358" id="358">[358]</span> economy was to change the dispensation from the old things to Christ. It was God’s desire that Christ would replace the things of the former dispensation. This is the reason we say that Christ, who is both God and man, is the universal replacement. Christ as the universal replacement was first revealed on the Mount of Transfiguration. The Lord brought three of His disciples to the top of this mountain in order to show them that God in His economy intended to replace everything with Christ. There would be no place for Moses or Elijah, and no place for the natural man. Everything and everyone must be replaced by Christ, the all-inclusive One. </p>
<p data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XODnfB4sWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv"> When the Lord Jesus cleansed the temple, He was preparing to replace the old things with Himself. He was canceling, annulling, the things of the old dispensation in order to prepare the way for His disciples to take Him as their replacement. He was preparing them to be brought into His death and resurrection so that He might be their all-inclusive replacement. </p>

God’s economy is first to produce the old creation, and then to bring forth the new creation out of the old. </p>
<p data-content-id="DioGnuR0sUvA-HjiuPYZ8T5kDeFgdlHkYsKOva-5So8_5JX330ghXt3Lqsjs98JZo"> God’s new creation is mainly the new man. The producing of the new man out of the old creation involves the process of birth. The expression “birth pangs” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66822" data-verses="Mark 13:8">13:8</span> refers to the travail involved in the birth of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DfJrDHTfI3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ"> The period of time between Christ’s resurrection and ascension and His coming back is for the delivery of the new man. We believe that we are living toward the end of that period of time in which the new man is being delivered. Looking back upon more than nineteen centuries of history since the Lord’s ascension, it is easy for us to realize that throughout the centuries many have experienced the birth pangs for the delivery of the new man. The Jews, the Gentiles, and all the cultures and civilizations of the world have <span class="pg" data-page-id="359" id="359">[359]</span> been part of these birth pangs. Even the wars that have taken place have been part of the birth pangs. These birth pangs are for one thing—the bringing forth of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPApCFxV7FN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> Today’s world situation with its birth pangs is for the birth of the new man. This is the reason I watch the world situation. </p>

The centuries from the first century until the twentieth have witnessed the delivery of the new man through the preaching of the gospel and the suffering of persecution. </p>
<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GV7m6m0eMeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> We need to understand why the new man is brought forth by the preaching of the gospel amid persecution. From the time of man’s fall, the old creation has been under the usurping hand of Satan, God’s enemy. God is now working to produce a new man out of His old creation. The enemy, however, is not willing to allow such a thing, and he is instigating everything and every matter to oppose God’s economy in order to frustrate the birth of the new man. This is the reason for persecutions. From the time Peter stood up to preach the gospel on the day of Pentecost, this persecution has been taking place. Persecution first came from the Jews with their religion and then from the Gentiles, including the Roman rulers in their politics. Throughout all the centuries this persecution of those who preach the gospel has not ceased. </p>
<p data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_qRLLqJZEraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV"> During the past nineteen hundred years, two things have been going on continually: the preaching of the gospel and persecution. It is sovereign of the Lord that these things have not ceased. Century after century, the Lord’s faithful ones have preached the gospel at any cost, even at the risk of their lives. Meanwhile, Satan, having usurped the old creation with the old man and his society and culture, has instigated a great deal of persecution. </p>
<p data-content-id="hx_zzSpG4rVvnFzTU3f6iUo79ejIThvBxQ7OaGa7mOy9TYjUhbSqG4WclLusd8YDB"> What will be the outcome of Satan’s opposition to God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="360" id="360">[360]</span> economy? The outcome will be that neither Satan nor the world will gain anything. Ultimately, the outcome will be the full delivery of the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="URtKIt0L_s2x9jmmlG_xw0Rxo9XCdhKgCltl2BQUyoJ1J6-naGmt6MTZtNA2Ufk2K"> After the lengthy process for the birth of the new man, the Lord Jesus will come back to receive the new man at the time of the saints’ rapture. This means that when the Lord Jesus comes back, there will be a rapture, and this rapture will be the final delivery of the new man. If we see this and then read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66823" data-verses="Mark 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> of Mark again, we shall receive fresh light from the Word. In this chapter the Lord was bringing His close followers into such an understanding of God’s economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MM4hI37Bq0acKu7uecryGSOfA5Jn_2rlWqgP_ZCAOT51o90taGoOAfheGhkXDu6gu">THE CENTRAL POINT OF GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="VWxmQv7W4uiwj768D3AdQa3WheU0GEWYtKu8tNXSAC0wKB8UNji7nnTh2Yra9R3z7"> The central point of God’s economy is the producing of the new man through Christ’s death and resurrection. The death of Christ has terminated the old creation, and His resurrection has germinated the new creation. Therefore, to be brought into Christ’s death and resurrection is to be brought into the termination of the old creation and the germination of the new creation. In this germination we enjoy the all-inclusive, universal replacement, who is the living, wonderful, marvelous Person of Christ, the God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="isH1YhKLP27GpYb1l-EH5BXjpPE3d1Q-bGo8ZH-xoo3romA6yrPL5uOuCKtIgHwLz"> When we enjoy Christ as the universal replacement, He will become everything to us, for He will replace everything with Himself. This is the reason Paul says that in the new man “there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66824" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">Col. 3:10-11</span>). In the new man there are no racial differences. In the new man there is no culture or social rank. Instead, Christ, the universal replacement, is all and is in all. </p>
<p data-content-id="1YZgJVvfR7nEdPygmiXBFurFC4vhwTC01Dl5_a_Qjw4LWip4gb95cZHsWchz2v1DI"> Christ will replace the entire old creation, and He will be the whole new creation. How can this take place? It can take place only through Christ’s death and resurrection. Hence, it is necessary for us to be brought into the death and resurrection of Christ. In His resurrection we enjoy Him as the all-inclusive, processed, indwelling, life-giving Spirit. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="361" id="361">[361]</span> Person who is this universal replacement is the One with both divinity and humanity. Today this wonderful Person is the compound Spirit to be our enjoyment so that God may have the new man for His expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgFcmszoVdGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> I hope that we shall all be enlightened to see the vision related to the words “birth pangs” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66825" data-verses="Mark 13:8">13:8</span>. These birth pangs are required for the delivery of the new man. The delivery takes place through the gospel, and the preaching of the gospel is always accompanied by persecution. </p>

While “the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to seize Him by craftiness and kill Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66836" data-verses="Mark 14:1">v. 1</span>), the Lord’s followers were showing their love for Him.

Before His crucifixion, Christ came to Jerusalem the last time, six days before the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66844" data-verses="John 12:1">John 12:1</span>), and was examined by the Jewish leaders.

This One had left the temple. He had condemned the temple to be destroyed. However, the disciples were still occupied with their religious concept of the temple. According to their understanding, God was in the temple, for it was His house. I doubt that the disciples realized that God had left that house when the Lord Jesus walked out of the temple in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66846" data-verses="Mark 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. Since Christ Jesus is God, when He left the condemned temple and forsook it, God forsook it as well. Going to the Mount of Olives with some of His disciples, He prophesied to them that the temple they admired would be destroyed. Furthermore, that temple would be replaced by Christ Himself. </p>

A leper signifies a sinner. Simon, as a leper, must have been healed by the Lord. Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence. A saved sinner would always do this. <span class="pg" data-page-id="367" id="367">[367]</span> </p>

Those who were indignant regarded the woman’s love offering to the Lord a waste. Throughout the past nineteen centuries, thousands of precious lives, heart treasures, high positions, and golden futures have been “wasted” upon the Lord Jesus.

For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want you can do them good; but you do not always have Me.” The Lord’s word, “You do not always have Me,” indicates that we must love the Lord and seize the opportunity to love Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="368" id="368">[368]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6wz9ty4ISYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> Today many Christians care more for works of charity than for Christ. A charitable concern for the poor often replaces Christ. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66852" data-verses="Mark 14:1">Mark 14</span> the Lord Jesus would not allow the concern for the poor to be a replacement of Himself. Here it seems that He does not care for the poor, but cares only for Himself. He seems to be saying, “Do not trouble this one who loves Me. She has done a good work on Me. If you want to take care of the poor, wait for another time and go to another place. The poor are always with you. But this is the unique time for you to take Me as your replacement and to pour out everything upon Me.” </p>

This indicates that she received the revelation of the Lord’s death by the Lord’s words. Hence, she seized the opportunity to pour the best she had upon the Lord. To love the Lord with our best requires a revelation concerning Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6seviliEMHl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66854" data-verses="Mark 14:9">verse 9</span> the Lord continues, “And truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, that also which she did shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.” In the foregoing verse the Lord referred to His burial. The word “burial” implies His death and resurrection for our redemption. Hence, the gospel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66855" data-verses="Mark 14:9">verse 9</span> should refer to the gospel of Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66856" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:1-4">1 Cor. 15:1-4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-Abo2-ZPWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of the woman who anointed the Lord is that she loved Him. We must preach both—the Lord loving us and our loving the Lord. One is for our salvation, and the other is for our consecration. </p>
<p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaUHaNHzDU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> In foregoing messages we have seen that when the Lord Jesus was on the Mount of Olives with four of His disciples, He spoke to them concerning the beginning of birth pangs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66857" data-verses="Mark 13:8">13:8</span>). These birth pangs are for the delivery of the new man, a delivery that involves a long process. How can this <span class="pg" data-page-id="369" id="369">[369]</span> man be delivered, be brought forth? We have seen that the new man can be brought forth only through the death and resurrection of Christ. Through His death and resurrection He becomes everything in the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QEC153bRyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> After the Lord spoke to His disciples concerning things to come, especially concerning the birth pangs, he entered into Simon’s home in Bethany, where a feast had been prepared for Him. While He was feasting, a woman who loved Him poured out the best thing she had upon Him. This indicates that He was everything to her. The Lord said that this woman had done what she could, anointing His body beforehand for burial. </p>

The Lord charged two of His disciples to prepare what was needed for the feast of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66870" data-verses="Mark 14:12-16">vv. 12-16</span>). In the history of God’s economy, that was the last feast of Passover, for from that time the feast of Passover was replaced by the Lord’s table. This indicates that the old dispensation has been replaced by a new dispensation. Therefore, we today do not have the feast of Passover; instead, we have the Lord’s table, the Lord’s supper. </p>

However, it is much more difficult to get into the depths of the significance of the Lord’s table. This matter is very profound, far beyond the ability of the human mind to understand. </p>
<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJY0i_2XqJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> The significance of the feast prepared for the Lord by certain of His disciples is shallow compared to the significance of the Lord’s table. In the feast prepared by the Lord’s disciples, we have the matter of appreciation of the Lord’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="382" id="382">[382]</span> preciousness, worthiness, and loveliness. Simon, the leper, having been cleansed by the Lord, prepared this feast as an expression of his appreciation of the Lord’s mercy, grace, and preciousness. The anointing of the Lord Jesus was also an expression of appreciation of the Lord’s loveliness and worthiness. However, in these matters there is little that could be regarded as deep. It seems that nothing initiated by us has much depth. </p>

This feast is a sign, a symbol, of the entire New Testament economy of God. God’s economy in the New Testament age is involved with the Lord’s table. </p>

Hence, the Lord’s table includes a loaf of bread and a cup. </p>
<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6sevjFiHMnl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> According to biblical usage, bread signifies life. The Lord Jesus said, “I am the bread of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66945" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>). This indicates that in the Bible bread is a matter of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-AaI29ZvWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> Furthermore, according to biblical usage, a cup signifies a portion of blessing. Hence, the cup is called the cup of blessing. The bread is of life, and the cup is of blessing. </p>

It is not a simple matter for something to become our life. For example, the food we eat and digest becomes our life supply. In order for anything to be our life or life supply, that thing must be organic. If you swallow a stone, that stone cannot become your life supply, because a stone is not living and organic. Only something organic can be digested by us and then assimilated into us to become our life supply. In a similar way, in order for the Triune God to be our life supply and even our life, He must come into us to be digested and assimilated by us. To be sure, the Triune God is living and organic. </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYlxfE0hRaxklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66946" data-verses="John 6:1">chapter six</span> of the Gospel of John, Christ is a loaf, the bread of life, for us to eat. The Lord Jesus said, “I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever,” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66947" data-verses="Mark 14:51">v. 51</span>).

Any believer who eats the Lord Jesus as the bread of life will live by Him. When we eat this bread of life, He comes into us to be digested by us and to be assimilated into us organically. This is the only way the Triune God can become our life. The Triune God becomes our life supply and our life by entering into us organically to be assimilated into the very fibers of our spiritual being. </p>

Whenever we come to the Lord’s table, we see a loaf. That loaf is not merely for display; it is for us to eat. When the Lord Jesus instituted His supper, “He took bread, <span class="pg" data-page-id="384" id="384">[384]</span> and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66949" data-verses="Mark 14:22">Mark 14:22</span>). </p>

For years, I remembered the Lord at His table merely by concentrating on His incarnation, His life of suffering, His death, and His resurrection. I had not been told that the proper way to remember the Lord Jesus is to eat Him. The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66951" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:24">1 Cor. 11:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66952" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:26">26</span>), that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death. To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing. This is to remember Him in a genuine way. </p>

As I considered the bread and read the verses in the New Testament concerning it, light came to me regarding what it means to remember the Lord at His table. I saw that to remember the Lord is not merely to think about Him, not merely to recall what He experienced. Rather, to remember the Lord is to eat Him. The Lord clearly said, “This is My body which is given for you; do this unto the remembrance of Me.” By this we see that the proper remembrance of the Lord is to eat Him, to take Him in as our life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9e73ABURB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m"> The bread on the table is not for us to analyze or merely think about; the bread is for us to take in, to eat, as our life supply.

We may say not only that the food becomes us, but even that we <span class="pg" data-page-id="385" id="385">[385]</span> become the food. Not only is there an organic union between us and the food we eat, digest, and assimilate; we are mingled with the food we assimilate into us. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66960" data-verses="Mark 14:27">verse 27</span> He said to them, “You will all be stumbled, because it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.” Then the Lord told them that after He was raised, He would go before them into Galilee (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66961" data-verses="Mark 14:28">v. 28</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UfQ5rWLwaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> When Peter heard the Lord’s word concerning the disciples being stumbled, he said to Him, “Even if all shall be stumbled, yet I will not!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66962" data-verses="Mark 14:29">v. 29</span>). Then, also as part of His preparation of His disciples for His death, the Lord went on to say to Peter, “Truly I tell you, that you today, in this night, before a cock crows twice, will deny Me three times.” The Greek verb rendered “deny” is a compound that signifies utterly deny, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66963" data-verses="Mark 14:31">verses 31</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66964" data-verses="Mark 14:72">72</span>.

Regarding “awestruck,” C. E. B. Cranfield says that the Lord was “in the grip of a shuddering horror in the face of the dreadful prospect before Him.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDzpuE_pYgNUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44"> The Lord said to Peter, James, and John, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death; remain here and watch. And going forward a little, He fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from Him.” The Slave-Savior’s sorrow and His prayer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66968" data-verses="Mark 14:35">verse 35</span> are the same as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66969" data-verses="John 12:27">John 12:27</span>.

Hence, the Second of the divine Trinity was ordained to be the Lamb of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66972" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>) before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66973" data-verses="1Peter 1:19-20">1 Pet. 1:19-20</span>); and in the eyes of God, as the Lamb of God, He was slain from the foundation of the world, that is, from the existence of God’s fallen creatures (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66974" data-verses="Revelation 13:8">Rev. 13:8</span>). From the time of man’s fall, lambs, sheep, calves, and bulls were sacrificed by God’s chosen people as types (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66975" data-verses="Genesis 3:21">Gen. 3:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66976" data-verses="Genesis 4:4">4:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66977" data-verses="Genesis 8:20">8:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66978" data-verses="Genesis 22:13">22:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66979" data-verses="Exodus 12:3-8">Exo. 12:3-8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66980" data-verses="Leviticus 1:2">Lev. 1:2</span>), pointing to Him who was to come as the real Lamb foreordained by God. In the fullness of time, the Triune God sent the Second of the divine Trinity, the Son of God to come in incarnation to take a human body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66981" data-verses="Hebrews 10:5">Heb. 10:5</span>) that He might be offered to God on the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66982" data-verses="Hebrews 9:14">Heb. 9:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66983" data-verses="Hebrews 10:12">10:12</span>) to do the will of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66984" data-verses="Hebrews 10:7">Heb. 10:7</span>), that is, to replace the sacrifices and offerings, which were types, with Himself in His humanity as the unique sacrifice and offering for the sanctification of God’s chosen people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66985" data-verses="Hebrews 10:9-10">Heb. 10:9-10</span>).

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxaPGQoW74uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr">EXPOSING OUR SITUATION</h2><p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxKYpr53MS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> Why is it that after the Lord Jesus instituted His supper, He warned the disciples of their stumbling and charged them to watch and pray? The reason is that whenever the Lord reveals something concerning Himself in God’s economy, He exposes our real situation. Consider the case of Peter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66989" data-verses="Mark 8:1">chapter eight</span>. Peter received the revelation that Jesus is the Christ. After Peter received this revelation, the Lord exposed him as being Satan. Furthermore, the Lord went on to expose Peter’s self, his soul life. </p>
<p data-content-id="wpXywTj2q7bZ6nRb_nQXv3b46v2MilKq_Qrlx_oVfo-DxccuXUCSfxlA5gn9T8oHg"> The institution of the Lord’s table reveals the Lord’s death, His resurrection, the Lord Himself, and His enlargement, His mystical Body. Immediately after this revelation, Peter and the other disciples were exposed. Their natural man, self, self-will, mind, and thought were all exposed. Although they experienced the Lord’s institution of His table, they did not realize how much they were in themselves and how much they were according to the natural concept. Therefore, the Lord Jesus exposed them. This exposure is the practicality of being brought into the Lord’s death. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98vRBBHnY0xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB">BROUGHT INTO<br/>THE LORD’S DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TD6ms6bcc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="66990" data-verses="Mark 14:1">chapters fourteen and fifteen</span> of the Gospel of Mark, we see that Peter was brought into the Lord’s crucifixion. When Peter boasted that he would never deny the Lord Jesus, he had not yet been crucified. He claimed that <span class="pg" data-page-id="392" id="392">[392]</span> even if all the others were stumbled, he would not be stumbled. He went on to say, “If I must die with You, I will by no means deny You” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66991" data-verses="Mark 14:31">14:31</span>). However, very shortly after making this boast, he fully denied the Lord Jesus. After denying Him, “Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him, Before a cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times. And thinking upon it, he wept” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66992" data-verses="Mark 14:72">14:72</span>). In a very real sense, this was Peter’s crucifixion. He wept because he had been crucified. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPHBYnsMSBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> Although Peter denied the Lord, he did not give up. Rather, he went on to enter into the Lord’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTUGIMxBKm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> Perhaps you are wondering what indication there is in the Gospel of Mark that Peter entered into Christ’s resurrection. Consider the word of the angel to the women who came to the tomb early in the morning on the day of the Lord’s resurrection: “Do not be amazed; you are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He was raised! He is not here! Behold, the place where they laid Him. But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, even as He told you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="66993" data-verses="Mark 16:6-7">16:6-7</span>). Here we see that the angel specifically names Peter. This indicates that Peter was brought into the resurrection of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxkzGimc2nJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB"> We should not read the Gospel of Mark merely as a book of stories. We need to see the revelation in this book. The Gospel of Mark reveals that the Lord Jesus did not intend to go through death and resurrection alone. Instead, it was the Lord’s intention to bring His followers with Him into death and resurrection. If we see this revelation, we shall be assured that, as those who love the Lord Jesus, He will bring us through His death and into His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkszV2xKj1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> When we come to the end of the Gospel of Mark, we see that all the Lord’s followers were brought not only into His death and resurrection but also into His ascension. In His ascension they were sent out to preach the gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth. Praise the Lord that His disciples were brought into His death, resurrection, and ascension! <span class="pg" data-page-id="393" id="393">[393]</span> </p>

Immediately after the supper, the Lord warned His disciples about being stumbled. This warning was an indication that the disciples were still in the flesh. Even though the Lord had instituted the supper and they had all partaken of it, they were nevertheless in the flesh.

Before Judas came with those who arrested the Lord Jesus, the Lord was praying in Gethsemane concerning His death. As we have pointed out, the Lord came purposely to Judea from Galilee to be crucified. Therefore, actually He was not delivered by Judas; instead, He delivered Himself to those who came to arrest Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="-5AXIggToD6uMh3UAv-eLXpfYbf5HiOdJu1FrqXNWLmcCgTAMm7L2e-ug40_gpPOy"> While the Lord was still in Galilee, He knew that it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem in order to be put to death on the day of the Passover. After coming to Jerusalem, He prepared the environment, His disciples, and even His opposers for His death. The opposers plotted to kill Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67006" data-verses="Mark 14:1">Mark 14:1</span> says that the chief priests and scribes were seeking how to seize Him by craftiness and kill Him. They said, “Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67007" data-verses="Mark 14:2">14:2</span>). However, in order to fulfill the type of the Passover lamb, the Lord was crucified on the day of the Passover, even though His opposers sought to avoid this. The Lord Himself <span class="pg" data-page-id="398" id="398">[398]</span> prepared what was necessary for Him to be put to death at the proper time. </p>
<p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaUGaNEyjU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> During the last feast of the Passover, the Lord Jesus told His disciples that one of them would betray Him: “Truly I tell you that one of you will deliver Me up, one who is eating with Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67008" data-verses="Mark 14:18">14:18</span>). Then Judas was exposed. No matter how evil Judas was, because he was still a human being, he was ashamed to remain with the Lord and His disciples. After Judas left, he went to the high priest and led a company to the place where they arrested the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QED150axyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> Once Judas had left, the Lord instituted His supper. He knew that in a few hours He would be arrested, judged, sentenced to death, and crucified. </p>
<p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8EliJtmf3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> After instituting His supper, the Lord brought His disciples to a garden. He went to the best place for Him to be arrested. This indicates that He presented Himself to those who arrested Him. </p>

Throughout the centuries, many Bible teachers have spoken concerning the Lord’s prayer about God’s will. But not many have seen what specifically God’s will is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67010" data-verses="Mark 14:36">14:36</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEdSRTpMZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> If we would know what the will of God is in this verse, we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67011" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">Hebrews 10</span>, where we are told that the Lord Jesus came to do God’s will. It is commonly thought that this means that the Lord Jesus came to do everything according to God’s will in a general way. But from the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67012" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">Hebrews 10</span> we see that God’s will specifically denotes the replacing of the offerings. God’s will was to send Christ to earth to carry out the replacement of the offerings with Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w5YhEl_ZS764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> In the Old Testament there were many offerings or sacrifices. God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to replace all these. It was God’s will that Christ should die as the replacement for all the offerings. The Lord Jesus knew that it was God’s will <span class="pg" data-page-id="399" id="399">[399]</span> for Him to die as the replacement of the offerings. This was the reason He prayed, “Not what I will, but what You will.” </p>
<p data-content-id="O8UhUNYqCBnM85L88xHfLDU6jIJZsoKJvEqYZJW8OEAFLWMdG4aWhxw5QHfd9cISQ"> After His prayer in Gethsemane, the Lord Jesus was ready to be arrested, tried, sentenced, and put to death. Everything and everyone had been prepared, and He had had thorough prayer with the Father. By means of that prayer, He had the confirmation that it was God’s will for Him to die to replace all the offerings. Therefore, after that prayer, He was ready to be arrested by the chief priests, elders, and scribes. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67014" data-verses="Mark 14:49">verse 49</span> He said to those who came to seize Him, “Daily I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me—but that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.” The God-forsaking and God-offending opposers, afraid of the people who had warmly welcomed the Slave-Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67015" data-verses="Mark 11:7-11">11:7-11</span>) and who were gladdened by His speaking (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67016" data-verses="Mark 12:37">12:37</span>), dared not arrest Him in the daytime or in a public place like the temple. Instead, these opposers arrested Him subtly in the deep night (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67017" data-verses="Mark 14:1">14:1</span>), as though arresting a robber (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67018" data-verses="Mark 14:48">14:48</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAejQDyp-6qrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67019" data-verses="Mark 14:53">Mark 14:53—15:15</span> describes how the Slave-Savior was judged. First He was judged by the Jewish leaders representing the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67020" data-verses="Mark 14:53-64">14:53-64</span>). Then He was judged by the Roman government representing the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67021" data-verses="Mark 15:1-15">15:1-15</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XOCXfC4MWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67025" data-verses="Mark 14:55-60">14:55-60</span> we see that the Lord Jesus said nothing in answer to those who were falsely testifying against Him. “He was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned Him and said to Him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67026" data-verses="Mark 14:61">v. 61</span>). The befuddled high priest of the traditional, God-forsaking and God-forsaken religion called God “the Blessed” in order to show how much he <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> revered and honored God. Although concerning His behavior the Slave-Savior would not answer His faultfinders’ false accusation, yet concerning His divine Person, His deity, He was not silent. Rather, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67027" data-verses="Mark 14:62">verse 62</span> He answered strongly and definitely, affirming His deity in His humanity by stating that as the Son of Man He will sit at the right hand of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="YsklwMzN513qLhmk8A0qYZXz79rzoaz16RIy_1aceu91KDfDQgSH1KFDyFgXuTwem"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67028" data-verses="Mark 14:63-64">Verses 63 and 64</span> say, “And the high priest, having torn his garments, says, What further need do we have of witnesses? You heard the blasphemy! How does it appear to you? And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.” The blind opposers condemned the Slave-Savior for being blasphemous in affirming His deity, not realizing that they themselves were blaspheming God, who was right then the very One whom they were slandering and mocking. </p>

The Lord was crucified beginning from the third hour, our nine o’clock. He was suffering on the cross for six hours. In the first three hours, He was persecuted by men for doing God’s will; in the last three hours, He was judged by God for the accomplishment of our redemption.

This darkness was a sign of God’s judgment of sin. Whereas man persecuted the Slave-Savior during the first three hours of His crucifixion, God came in during the second three hours to judge Christ as our Substitute. It was in these hours that God put all our sins upon Him and considered Him a sinner as our Substitute. Therefore, during the first three hours of His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus was a martyr.

This signifies that the separation between God and man was abolished because the flesh (signified by the veil) of sin taken by Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67102" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Rom. 8:3</span>) had been crucified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67103" data-verses="Hebrews 10:20">Heb. 10:20</span>). The fact that the veil was torn from the top to the bottom indicates that the rending of the veil was God’s doing from above. </p>

<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJY0S_0XqJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> The veil in the temple was a sign of the flesh Christ had put upon Himself. The tearing of the veil signifies that the humanity taken on by Christ had been crucified. If we study the Bible carefully, we shall realize that cherubim were embroidered on the veil, and cherubim are signs of God’s creatures (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67104" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:4-14">Ezek. 1:4-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67105" data-verses="Revelation 4:6-9">Rev. 4:6-9</span>). Hence, the cherubim on the veil signify that the creatures were related to the humanity of Jesus. When the Lord put on our humanity, He put on a humanity that bore the creatures. This gives us a strong basis to say that when Christ crucified His humanity, He terminated the creatures. </p>

The Lord said that God forsook Him, and to forsake means to leave. Therefore, in some way God left Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-AZI21K_WEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> The Lord Jesus said in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67125" data-verses="John 5:43">John 5:43</span> that He came in the name of the Father: “I have come in the name of My Father.” Furthermore, the Father was always with Him: “And He who sent Me is with Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67126" data-verses="John 8:29">John 8:29</span>). Shortly before He died the Lord again said, “I am not alone, because the Father is with Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67127" data-verses="John 16:32">John 16:32</span>). The Father was not only with the Lord Jesus, but was also in Him, and the Lord was in the Father: <span class="pg" data-page-id="414" id="414">[414]</span> “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?...Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67128" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67129" data-verses="John 14:11">11a</span>). Regarding His relationship with the Father, the Lord also said, “I and the Father are one” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67130" data-verses="John 10:30">John 10:30</span>). The Lord Jesus and the Father were always one. Furthermore, whenever someone saw the Lord, he saw the Father. This was the reason the Lord Jesus could say, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67131" data-verses="John 14:9">John 14:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-72AZGP8H6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF"> From these verses we see that the Lord came in the name of the Father, that the Father was with Him, that He was in the Father and the Father in Him, that He and the Father are one, and that when anyone saw Him, he saw the Father. These verses prove that the Lord was never separated from God the Father. Nevertheless, at the ninth hour the Lord Jesus cried out, “My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?” No doubt, this indicates that God left Him. But in what sense did God leave the Lord Jesus? How are we to understand this matter, inasmuch as it involves a major problem related to the Trinity? </p>
<p data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9e43ACVxB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m"> Does God’s forsaking of Christ mean that the One who remained on the cross was merely a man and no longer had the divine nature? If this were the situation, then the Lord’s redeeming power would not be eternal, for there would not be the divine, eternal element in it. We must be very careful, therefore, in answering the question concerning what it meant for God to forsake the crucified Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAejTjyq-aqrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj"> It is very difficult to explain God’s forsaking of the Lord Jesus. If we would understand this properly, we need a thorough consideration of what the Scriptures reveal concerning the Trinity. </p>

His conception was divine, for it was of the Holy Spirit, that is, of God. His wonderful conception was a conception of God in man. This conception involved both divinity and humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="YsklwMzN513qLhmk8DUqbY3z79rzoaz16RIy_1aceu91KDfDQgSH1KFDyFgXuTwem"> Unlike the Lord Jesus, we all were conceived of our <span class="pg" data-page-id="415" id="415">[415]</span> father with our mother. What was involved in our conception was merely and solely humanity. But the conception of the Lord Jesus was the conception of God in a human virgin, a conception that involved both divinity and humanity. Therefore, the Lord Jesus was born as a man with two natures: the human nature and the divine nature. This gives us the basis to say that He was a God-man. He was born of God in man. From God He received the divine element, and from Mary He received the human element. These two elements—divinity and humanity—constitute Jesus a God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="EcbL8VFfQ-Sr2--Couk4afdC5Af8VjbkN252A17whu13YIvULldJsUdlfmPvVHC1u"> At the age of thirty the Lord Jesus was baptized.

At the same time the Spirit of God descended as a dove and came upon Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67134" data-verses="Matthew 3:16">Matt. 3:16</span>). Was the Lord not born of the Spirit? Was the Spirit not one of the essences of His being? Before the Lord Jesus was baptized, did He not already have the Holy Spirit within Him? The answer to all these questions is yes. The Lord had been born of the Spirit, the Spirit was one of the essences of His being, and He did have the Holy Spirit within Him. Because He had been conceived of the Holy Spirit in a virgin, His being was constituted of two essences, divinity and humanity. Why then, since He already had the Holy Spirit within Him, was it necessary for the Holy Spirit to descend upon Him? This is a crucial question. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DioGnuR0sUvA-HjiuNIZ8S5kDeFgdlHkYsKOva-5So8_5JX330ghXt3Lqsjs98JZo">THE SPIRIT DESCENDING UPON THE LORD JESUS</h2><p data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DfL7DHQfI3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67135" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> of Matthew we see that the Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus as a clear, distinct unit.

Therefore, we need a way to reconcile two important facts: first, that the Lord Jesus had the Holy Spirit within Him as one of His essences; second, that the Holy Spirit descended upon Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="416" id="416">[416]</span> after He was baptized. Since the Holy Spirit was already a part of His being, why was it that the Spirit of God descended upon Him? </p>
<p data-content-id="gUd4LPGw5bYIk3PPArSFxW7FN5ovYbcgBLAV3urQauilu8IsITGeSwOJbfAGOGdSY"> Throughout the history of Christianity there has been a shortage of the proper understanding of the Trinity. In the art gallery of the Vatican there is a painting that is supposed to portray the Trinity. In this painting an old man with a beard signifies God the Father; a young man signifies the Son; and a dove soaring in the air signifies the Holy Spirit. That painting may be based on the concept of the Trinity expressed in the Nicene Creed. This understanding is partially right, for to some extent it may have been based on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67137" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew chapter three</span>. In this chapter we have the Son standing, the Father speaking from the heavens, and the Holy Spirit descending as a dove. These three—the Son, the Father, and the Spirit—as presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67138" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3</span>, are not only distinct but seem to be at some distance from one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="eW1-pGBoAGH7gOu2CgBWZyx2iEuzXGZKhHTHlippcE-tSBQA2AEb8Btsa6mr5pa6x"> As we consider the Trinity as depicted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67139" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3</span>, we need to realize what is said concerning the Holy Spirit and the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67140" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span>. We have emphasized the fact that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67141" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">Matthew 1:20</span> tells us that the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67142" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> is a balance to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67143" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3</span>. If we had only the revelation of the Trinity in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67144" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3</span>, we may think that the Trinity is a matter of tritheism, of three Gods: one in the heavens, one on the earth, and one in the air. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67145" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> of Matthew comes out of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67146" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">chapter one</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67147" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> the emphasis is not on the three but on the one. Hence, when we put <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67148" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">chapters one</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67149" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">three</span> of Matthew together, we see that God is triune, three-one. </p>
<p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4bg9Qaj1cuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> Actually, it is not possible for us fully to reconcile the two aspects of the Trinity, the aspect of the one in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67150" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> and the aspect of the three in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67151" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3</span>. The reason we cannot reconcile these aspects is that the Trinity is a mystery. If we could understand the Triune God fully, He would no longer be a mystery. Furthermore, in the words of Martin Luther, if <span class="pg" data-page-id="417" id="417">[417]</span> we could fully understand the Triune God, this would mean that we are the teachers of God. </p>

This corresponds to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67165" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, a verse that tells us that the Word became flesh. According to the Gospel of John, the Word is the Son of God. When the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Spirit in Mary’s womb, that was the incarnation of the Son of God, the Word becoming flesh. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67166" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span> speaks of the greatness of the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh. </p>

When we put these verses together, we have the Holy Spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="422" id="422">[422]</span> for the conception of Jesus, the Son for the incarnation, and God for the manifestation.

The name “Jesus” denotes the Lord’s humanity, which was needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title “His Son” denotes the Lord’s divinity, which was needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man for redeeming God’s fallen creatures, with divine surety as to its eternal efficacy, an efficacy which is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7GZI3GLmdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_"> Man’s sin needs human blood for its cleansing. The blood of Jesus is the blood of a genuine man. However, the very Jesus who shed His blood for our redemption is the Son of God. He has both humanity and divinity. His humanity qualified Him to die for us. Because He was a man, He had the blood to shed for the cleansing of our sins. Nevertheless, He is also the Son of God. His divinity insures the eternal effectiveness of His redeeming blood. Therefore, His humanity qualifies Him to be our Redeemer and our Substitute; His divinity gives eternal power to this qualification. If Christ were not a man, He could not be qualified to be our Substitute. Praise the Lord that He was qualified by His humanity to be our Substitute and that His genuine human blood has the qualification to cleanse our sins! This <span class="pg" data-page-id="423" id="423">[423]</span> qualification needs something to insure its effectiveness, and this assurance is the Lord’s divinity.

<p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1Jawlr4xH-0dVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> Let us now consider what the death of Christ accomplished. First, Christ’s death solved the problem of our sins, the problem of our offenses, transgressions, and sinful deeds. His death has solved the problem of our sins, and it has solved this problem eternally. Concerning this, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67173" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span>, “For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.” Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67174" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span> says that Christ “Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree.” </p>

Although it is easy to explain what sins are, it is difficult to define sin. Sins refer to deeds, offenses, trespasses, and transgressions. But what is sin? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67175" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> says that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin and condemned sin in the flesh. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="424" id="424">[424]</span> order to condemn sin, Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67176" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span> says, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQupTBut75Si2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> According to the Bible and also according to our experience, we have seen that sin is actually the sinful nature of Satan. Satan is the source of sin. Sin is Satan’s invention, and Satan himself is the element of sin. Actually, in the sight of God, sin is Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNEuvvGQE0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> According to the book of Romans, sin is something living, something that can make us do things that we do not want to do, something that can dwell in us, deceive us, and even kill us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67177" data-verses="Romans 6:14">Rom. 6:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67178" data-verses="Romans 7:8">7:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67179" data-verses="Romans 7:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67180" data-verses="Romans 7:17">17</span>). What is this thing living within us that does all these things? It is Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6wz_dy4JSYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> At the time of man’s fall, Satan’s sinful nature was injected into mankind. This means that when man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he took into him the sinful nature of Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocco3GEsqNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> In the universe there is something that is called sin in the Scriptures. Sin is not merely objective, outside of us; it is also subjective, within us, in our flesh. Therefore, outwardly we have sins, offenses, trespasses, and transgressions. Inwardly we have the basic problem of sin. Praise the Lord that Christ’s all-inclusive death has not only solved the problem of our sins, but has also judged and condemned sin! </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8dcreUJoRkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67181" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> reveals that when Christ was dying on the cross, sin in the flesh was condemned. We may use the condemnation of an unsafe building as an illustration. When a building is in such pitiful condition that it must be torn down, the government may condemn that building. In a similar way, sin in the flesh has been condemned through Christ’s all-inclusive death. By His eternal death, the death of a God-man, sin has been condemned. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6sevgViEPHl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC">Our Old Man</h2><p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-AZY2-aPWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> The third matter dealt with by Christ’s death is our old man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67182" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Romans 6:6</span> says, “Our old man has been crucified with Him.” Similarly, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67183" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> says, “I have been crucified with Christ.” Because the marvelous death of the God-man <span class="pg" data-page-id="425" id="425">[425]</span> was all-inclusive, it included us. We were put into Christ by God, and we were in Him when He was crucified. Hence, we are included in His all-inclusive eternal death. </p>

Peter testified that Christ could not be held by death. Since Christ Himself is resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67213" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>), it was impossible for Him to be held by death.

Regarding the Lord’s resurrection, he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67215" data-verses="Acts 2:32">verse 32</span>, “This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.” Here Peter seems to be saying, “We were present when the Lord Jesus was crucified, and we saw Him after His resurrection.

It is not possible to divide the Lord’s ascension from His resurrection. Both resurrection and ascension are very much involved with the Spirit. Today the Spirit is the reality of the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ. When we have this Spirit, we have Christ. In particular, we have the pneumatic Christ. Having this pneumatic Christ, we also have the reality of His resurrection and ascension. </p>

This God-man went to the cross and died a marvelous all-inclusive death. That event was greater than the event of God’s creation. The Lord’s all-inclusive death took away our sins, condemned sin, crucified our old man, terminated the old creation, destroyed the Devil, Satan, judged the satanic cosmos, and abolished the ordinances among the different races and social classes. By this we see that the Lord’s death has taken care of every negative thing in the universe once for all. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxbOWQrWb4uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr"> In the sight of God, all negative things have been cleared up for eternity. Of course, in our experience we still face the matters of sins, sin, the old man, the old creation, Satan, the world, and the ordinances. Nevertheless, the day is coming when in our sight, as well as in God’s, these things will be no more. </p>
<p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxLZ5r60sS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> Praise the Lord for what has been accomplished by the all-inclusive death of Christ! As we read the account of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="433" id="433">[433]</span> Lord’s crucifixion in the Gospel of Mark, we need to realize that His death was all-inclusive, terminating all negative things. As we have seen, the Lord’s death also released the divine life from within Him. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67233" data-verses="Mark 16:6">verse 6</span> an angel said to them, “Do not be amazed; you are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He was raised! He is not here! Behold, the place where they laid Him.” The Slave-Savior’s resurrection is proof that God is satisfied with what He accomplished through His death. It is also a confirmation of the effectiveness of His redeeming and life-imparting death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67234" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67235" data-verses="Acts 3:15">3:15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgEcms57VdGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67236" data-verses="Mark 16:7">verse 7</span>, the angel said to the women, “But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, even as He told you.” In the angel’s message to the three women who discovered the resurrection of the Slave-Savior, the phrase “and Peter” is inserted only in Mark’s record. This is probably due to Peter’s influence on the contents of this Gospel. In any case, this phrase indicates that Peter’s intimate relationship with <span class="pg" data-page-id="438" id="438">[438]</span> the Slave-Savior was particular, so that it was emphasized even by the angel. </p>

Just as the Slave-Savior began His ministry from Galilee of the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67238" data-verses="Matthew 4:12-17">Matt. 4:12-17</span>), not from Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jewish religion, so also after His resurrection He would still go to Galilee, not to Jerusalem. This strongly indicates that the resurrected Slave-Savior abandoned Judaism and was initiating a new era for God’s economy of the New Testament. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67242" data-verses="Mark 16:15">verse 15</span> He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation.” This reveals that the redemption of God accomplished by the Slave-Savior through His death and resurrection is not only for man, the leading one in God’s creation, but for all the creation. Hence, all things, whether on earth or in the heavens, were reconciled to God, and the gospel should be proclaimed to all creation under heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67243" data-verses="Colossians 1:20">Col. 1:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67244" data-verses="Colossians 1:23">23</span>).

To be baptized is to affirm this, by being buried to terminate the <span class="pg" data-page-id="439" id="439">[439]</span> old creation through the death of the Slave-Savior and by being raised up to be the new creation of God through the Slave-Savior’s resurrection. Such a baptism is much more advanced than the baptism of repentance by John (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67254" data-verses="Mark 1:4">Mark 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67255" data-verses="Acts 19:3-5">Acts 19:3-5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQuoRBuu6ZSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> To believe and to be so baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving the full salvation of God. To be baptized without believing is merely an empty ritual; to believe without being baptized is to be saved only inwardly without an outward affirmation of the inward salvation. These two should go together. Moreover, water baptism should be accompanied by the Spirit baptism, even as the children of Israel were baptized in the sea (water) and in the cloud (Spirit)—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67256" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:2">1 Corinthians 10:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67257" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">12:13</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNFsvvFQk0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67258" data-verses="Mark 16:16">Mark 16:16</span> does not say “who does not believe and is not baptized shall be condemned.” This indicates that condemnation is related only to not believing; it is not related to not being baptized. Believing itself is sufficient for one to receive salvation from condemnation; yet it needs baptism as an outward affirmation for the completion of one’s inward salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6wy9dy7JyYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67259" data-verses="Mark 16:17-18">16:17 and 18</span> the Lord Jesus continues, “And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.” Here we see that speaking with new tongues is only one of the five signs that accompany saved believers. It is not the unique sign, as stressed by some believers. According to the divine revelation in the Acts and in the Epistles, what the Lord says here does not mean that every saved believer should have all five signs. It means that each saved believer may have some of these signs, not necessarily all. </p>

In this exaltation God crowned Him with glory and honor (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67262" data-verses="Hebrews 2:9">Heb. 2:9</span>), gave Him the name that is above all names (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67263" data-verses="Philippians 2:9">Phil. 2:9</span>), and made Him the Lord of all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67264" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>) and the Head over all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67265" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22">Eph. 1:22</span>), that He may have all authority in heaven and on earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67266" data-verses="Matthew 28:18">Matt. 28:18</span>) to rule over the heavens, the earth, and the nations so that they may work together for the universal spreading of His gospel. </p>

In the Spirit we experience the resurrected Christ as the Lord, the anointed One, and the Head of everything to the church and the Head directly of the church. In the reality of resurrection, that is, in the all-inclusive Spirit, we realize that this Christ has been crowned with glory and honor, that He has been enthroned, and that He has received the name that is above all names. When we are in such a Spirit, all these aspects of Christ’s ascension are not merely doctrines to us—they are realities. </p>

These messages will be concerned with the life of the Slave-Savior as a life that is fully according to and for God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TC7Ws8Lsc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> In the Gospel of Mark we see a Person, the God-man, who lived a life that was fully according to and for God’s New Testament economy. If we would understand this life, we need to know what God’s New Testament economy is. In other words, it takes the entire New Testament to explain the life the Lord Jesus lived. This means that it takes all the other twenty-six books of the New Testament to define the Gospel of Mark. If we make a thorough study of the New Testament with respect to God’s economy, we shall see that there is no defect, deficiency, or shortcoming in the life of the Lord Jesus. The life He lived was absolutely according to and for God’s economy. In His life there is nothing contrary to this economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPGAonmeyBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> Although we may love the Gospel of John and the Gospel of Matthew, in these Gospels we do not have a complete biography of the Lord’s life. This complete biography, presented in its historical sequence, is found in Mark. In this Gospel we have a complete record of a life, the life of the Lord Jesus, that is according to and for God’s New Testament economy. In this life there is no deficiency with respect to God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTVH4M6T6m9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> Mark is the base of Matthew, John, and even Luke, <span class="pg" data-page-id="446" id="446">[446]</span> because Mark is a biography of the life of the Lord Jesus arranged according to historical sequence.

In this chart we can see how in the Gospel of Mark the record of the Lord’s life progresses step by step until we come to the highlight. Then we are brought into the Lord’s all-inclusive death and wonderful resurrection so that we may enjoy Him as our replacement. The result of taking Christ as our replacement is the new man. The new man is the reality of the kingdom of God, which issues first in the church, then in the millennium, and ultimately in the New Jerusalem. </p>

John the Baptist was born a typical Old Testament priest, yet he lived in the wilderness in a way that was uncultured. His appearance and his food were very different from that of the priests. John’s work and his way of speaking were also uncultured. Whenever a person repented, John put that one into the water, baptizing him. All this was an indication that the old dispensation had been terminated. This was the situation and atmosphere when the Lord Jesus began His ministry. This indicates that His ministry was fully in the New Testament dispensation. Therefore, with His life we cannot find anything of the old dispensation. </p>

The term “God’s New Testament economy” is familiar to most of us. However, in order to be refreshed in our understanding, let us consider, in a simple, basic way, what God’s New Testament economy is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2biGa_BPHwBMmqGIt_3aEPC4wtrRfcU4sHxDfRZzyMIzlPqgeTUisrY2QHdBIBzZK">GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="uamxl0odSMwfSIWjhQlAlOQo-fcQoDK5WNy2WFyi0oYKbOAd76mwgMMv-zAcUryim"> God’s New Testament economy is to work Himself into His chosen people to make them members of Christ so that Christ may have a Body for His expression. In this description of God’s economy we see a few important matters: that God wants to work Himself into His chosen people; that God wants to make His people members of the Body of Christ, the church; and that the Body of Christ is for Christ’s expression. In the Gospel of Mark we see a life that is fully according to and for this New Testament economy of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7Hbo3OYWdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_">TWO KINDS OF LIVES</h2><p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocdqXGHtKNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> As we have pointed out, if we compare the Epistle of James and the Gospel of Mark, we shall see that these books present two kinds of lives. In the Epistle of James we see something of the life of James, and in the Gospel of Mark we see the life of the Lord Jesus. Each of these books helps us to understand the other. Without Mark we might not be clear concerning the Epistle of James. Likewise, without James <span class="pg" data-page-id="456" id="456">[456]</span> we might not have such a clear understanding of the Gospel of Mark. It is when we compare these two books and see the two lives revealed in them that we have the proper understanding of both the Epistle of James and the Gospel of Mark. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8ddp-UKpxkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn">THE REPUTATION AND INFLUENCE OF JAMES</h2><p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6seui1iHNnl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> Because the Epistle of James emphasizes practical Christian perfection, many Christians have a deep appreciation of this book. As we have pointed out in the Life-study of James, James does emphasize Christian perfection, and he emphasizes this in practice, not in doctrine. Therefore, many godly, devoted, and pious believers love the book of James. James tells us to pray for wisdom so that we may behave properly. He also encourages us to restrict our speaking, to bridle our tongue, so that we may live a godly life. In every chapter of his Epistle, he brings forth certain matters related to godliness. </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-Bb429YvWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> In church history as well as in the Bible James was known for his godliness. He spent much time in prayer, and he was highly regarded among Christian Jews in ancient times. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67311" data-verses="Acts 15:1">chapters fifteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67312" data-verses="Acts 21:1">twenty-one</span> of Acts and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67313" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">chapter two</span> of Galatians, James was highly regarded by the saints. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67314" data-verses="Galatians 2:12">Galatians 2:12</span> refers to some who “came from James.” According to this verse, when these came to Antioch, Peter “shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.” This is an illustration of the influence of James. Even Peter, the leading apostle, was under his influence. </p>
<p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaVHKNEzjU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> Geographically, Jerusalem was in the south, and Antioch was in the north. Many Bible teachers regard these two cities as two great centers. There was a church in Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67315" data-verses="Acts 8:1">Acts 8:1</span>), and also one in Antioch (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67316" data-verses="Acts 13:1">Acts 13:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QFCl50bxyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> From reading the book of Acts it may seem that the church in Jerusalem had a Jewish appearance and the church in Antioch had a Gentile appearance. Some may think that since Jerusalem was in Judea and Antioch was in the Gentile world, it was necessary for the church in <span class="pg" data-page-id="457" id="457">[457]</span> Jerusalem to have a Jewish appearance and the church in Antioch to have a Gentile appearance. Perhaps you would say, “How could the church in Jerusalem, a city of the Jews, not be Jewish in its appearance? And how could the church in Antioch not be Gentile in its atmosphere? Surely, the churches in Japan have a Japanese appearance and the churches in America, an American appearance.” This may be logical from the human point of view. But the New Testament reveals that the church is neither Jewish nor Gentile. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67317" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:32">First Corinthians 10:32</span> speaks of three categories of people: the Jews, the Gentiles (Greeks), and the church. This indicates clearly that the church is something apart from both the Jews and the Gentiles. God has called His chosen ones out from both the Jews and the Gentiles to be the church. Therefore, the church should be neither Jewish nor Gentile. If the church has either a Jewish or a Gentile appearance, then to some extent the church has lost its character or at least some of its characteristics. </p>
<p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8FkyJtnf3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> If we read carefully <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67318" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67319" data-verses="Acts 21:1">21</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67320" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span>, we shall see that at the time of Peter, Paul, and James, Jerusalem exerted a considerable influence over Antioch. This means that the church in Jerusalem exercised influence over the churches in the Gentile world. James might have been concerned that the churches in the Gentile world did not practice the Mosaic law. This might have been the reason that he sent certain brothers from Jerusalem to Antioch. Those brothers might have gone to Antioch to observe the situation among the believers there. </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYlwe00iQ6xklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> Before certain ones went to Antioch from James, Peter was behaving himself properly as a brother and a member of the Body of Christ. In particular, he ate with the Gentiles. As Paul says of Peter, “before some came from James, he ate with those of the nations” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67321" data-verses="Galatians 2:12">Gal. 2:12</span>). However, when the brothers came from James, Peter was frightened and took the lead to pretend, that is, to behave as a Jew once again. Paul’s word for this pretending was hypocrisy: “And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67322" data-verses="Galatians 2:13">Gal. 2:13</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="458" id="458">[458]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPb1jRSLlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> Some may question what was wrong with Peter’s behavior. It may appear that there was nothing wrong. But to those who know God’s New Testament economy it is clear that Peter made a serious mistake. His behavior in shrinking back and separating himself from the Gentile believers involved a mixture that was damaging to God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEcTBTpPZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY">TAKING GOD AS LIFE AND LIVING HIM</h2><p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w4ZxEm-5S764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> God’s New Testament economy is not a matter of keeping the law or practicing rituals. Neither is God’s economy a matter merely of doing good according to human ethics or philosophy. God’s New Testament economy is a matter of God working Himself into His chosen people so that they may have Him, the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—as their life. When God’s people have His life, they are automatically able to live this life. To live God’s life simply means to live by God and even to live God Himself. Hence, the economy of God is neither a matter of keeping the Jewish law nor of doing good according to human philosophy; it is a matter of having God as life and then living Him. It is extremely important that we all see this. </p>
<p data-content-id="O8UhUNYqCBnM85L89wXfIC06jIJZsoKJvEqYZJW8OEAFLWMdG4aWhxw5QHfd9cISQ"> From the time of the apostles until today, there has been much debate concerning biblical teachings and theology. Much of this debate has been the result of one thing—missing the mark of God’s New Testament economy. Throughout the centuries, Christian teachers have been fighting over doctrines and practices, but the focus of God’s New Testament economy has been neglected. What a great loss it is to miss God’s New Testament economy! </p>
<p data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-73CpGM8n6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF"> Certain Christians, especially so-called holiness people, argue about the proper style of dress. For example, they may debate about the length of the sisters’ skirts or sleeves. This is a very simple illustration of how the saints have been distracted from God’s New Testament economy. We believe that if the saints see that in His economy God desires to work Himself into His chosen people so that they may have Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="459" id="459">[459]</span> as their life and live Him, there will be no need to argue concerning anyone’s manner of dress. </p>
<p data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9f6HABVRB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m"> We have seen that the New Testament economy of God is not a matter of keeping laws or observing rituals. Neither is it merely a matter of doing good in an ethical way. God’s New Testament economy is that we take Him as our life and live Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAeiRTyp_6qrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj"> If we read carefully <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67323" data-verses="Galatians 2:11-21">Galatians 2:11-21</span>, we shall see that the atmosphere in Antioch changed after certain ones came from James. Before those brothers came, Peter and the other believers in Antioch were in a particular kind of atmosphere, the atmosphere of enjoying God’s New Testament economy. But then, due to the influence of James, the spiritual atmosphere changed, and the spiritual sky became cloudy. Something had come in to obscure God’s New Testament economy. </p>

In James we see something of a life that is not fully according to and for God’s New Testament economy. In Mark we see a life that is fully according to and for God’s New Testament economy. In fact, the life presented in the Gospel of Mark is the reality, substance, and pattern of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNFt_vMDk0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> Perhaps you are wondering what our reason is for saying that in the Gospel of Mark we see a life that is the substance of God’s New Testament economy. We say this because the life the Lord Jesus lived was the expression of God. According to the Gospel of Mark, there is no indication that the Lord Jesus was living merely in a way to keep the law, that He did certain things simply because they were required by the law. Furthermore, the Gospel of Mark does not indicate that the Lord Jesus only lived a good life. How, then, did the Lord live? The Lord Jesus lived God, and He expressed God. Whatever He did was God’s doing from within Him and through Him. This means that all that the Lord Jesus did was not merely the keeping of the law or the doing of good in an ethical sense. The Lord Jesus was a Person who lived God and expressed Him in all that He said and did. <span class="pg" data-page-id="464" id="464">[464]</span> </p>

The biographies of other people may indicate that they were good or that they tried to keep the law of God. But the Lord Jesus is the only One who lived God and expressed Him in a full way. Of course, the Lord never broke the law, and He never did anything wrong. Nevertheless, the crucial matter regarding His life was not that He kept the law or that He did good. The crucial point is that He lived God and expressed Him. The Lord’s living was not in the kingdom of law-keeping or of doing good. He lived altogether in another kingdom, the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxbPWQoX74uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr"> Do you live in the kingdom of God? We may say that we live in the kingdom of God, but we may live in another realm in a practical way day by day. Instead of living in the kingdom of God, we may live in the kingdoms of law, ethics, or morality. Throughout the centuries, many saints have lived in these kingdoms and not in the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxLY5r52MS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> Especially since the time of John Wesley, there has been much talk among Christians concerning holiness. Some regard holiness as a matter of so-called sinless perfection. Others think that holiness is related to regulations concerning such matters as the style of dress. Regulations such as these are not in the kingdom of God. They belong to another kingdom, perhaps the kingdom of good. </p>
<p data-content-id="wpXywTj2q7bZ6nRb-nAXv2b46v2MilKq_Qrlx_oVfo-DxccuXUCSfxlA5gn9T8oHg"> Those who live in the kingdom of God have God as their life, and they live Him. God lives in them, through them, and out of them. As a result, they live a life that expresses nothing other than God Himself. God is the real holiness, morality, and ethics. Therefore, to have God as life and to live Him is to live in a way that is higher than human morality or ethics. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98uRRBHkY0xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB">THE LIFE THAT PRODUCES THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TC62s6Ycc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> Only the kind of life that lives God and expresses Him produces the Body of Christ. Any other way of living always damages the Body. Throughout its history the church has been divided not mainly by evil things, but primarily by <span class="pg" data-page-id="465" id="465">[465]</span> good things that are not God Himself. If all Christians would care only for God Himself and for having Him as life and living Him, there would not be any divisions among believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPGBInvNyBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> The reason there would be no divisions if we all cared only for God Himself is that God is one. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67337" data-verses="Ephesians 4:4-6">Ephesians 4:4-6</span> Paul speaks of the one Body, the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father. If we see the oneness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67338" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span>, we shall know how to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ, a oneness that is actually the Triune God Himself. If we all have God as our holiness, righteousness, and everything to us, there will not be any divisions among us. However, if we have something other than God, there will be divisions. Anything that we have other than God Himself is a factor of division. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTVGYMyAqm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> It is God’s intention in His recovery to bring us back to His New Testament economy. The pattern for God’s New Testament economy is found in the life of the Lord Jesus, as presented in the Gospel of Mark. Not even the writings of Paul present us a complete pattern, because at least once Paul himself was distracted from the New Testament economy of God. Hence, not even Paul is a complete pattern of God’s economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FNguAioG2aTgtRoxlzWileWnJs9C9MoRpXAnpDnuj0wsk0cRqTrc9GXJykGLfzabB">JAMES AND CHRISTIAN PERFECTION</h2><p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLktzF2yID1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67339" data-verses="Acts 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> of Acts we see a situation in which Paul was distracted from God’s New Testament economy. He was convinced by some in Jerusalem to return to the law and fulfill certain of its requirements. This took place after Paul had written the Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians. In those Epistles Paul spoke strongly against continuing to keep the law in the Old Testament manner. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pu9555BwdXseDKhVCcTfpZkuIg4gGqssN05hXWqG5AOWLMiJFHRYC9yb9EUElWhG0"> After writing those books, Paul went to Jerusalem for the last time. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67340" data-verses="Acts 21:18">Acts 21:18</span> says that Paul went in “to James, and all the elders were present.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67341" data-verses="Acts 21:20">verse 20</span>, they pointed out to Paul “how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and are all zealous for the law.” They had been instructed concerning Paul that he was <span class="pg" data-page-id="466" id="466">[466]</span> “teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67342" data-verses="Acts 21:21">v. 21</span>). Then James and the others went on to give Paul this advice: “Therefore do what we tell you: Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67343" data-verses="Acts 21:23-24">vv. 23-24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="-5AXIggToD6uMh3UBveeAFZfYbf5HiOdJu1FrqXNWLmcCgTAMm7L2e-ug40_gpPOy"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67344" data-verses="Acts 21:18">Acts 21:18</span> does not say that Paul went in to see the elders and James was present. This verse says that Paul went in to James and the elders were present. This indicates that James was the central figure in the church in Jerusalem and that he exercised a strong influence. </p>
<p data-content-id="p1Fm1LE2ZGYIIWZZRS5VDjA_I6Au6Ubrbfb0Fqq-UynzHdQPf-sZR4YAqIMD8cnle"> How could James have become such a strong and central influence among the believers? It probably was because he was so godly and pious, and he emphasized practical Christian perfection. Nothing attracts people more than one’s perfection. Even one as spiritual as Paul was not as attractive as James in this regard. If James were with us today, no doubt we would be attracted by his Christian perfection. </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHiePC6tHiWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> As an illustration of how people are attracted to what they consider perfect, let me relate something Brother Nee told me in 1932. Brother Nee wore his hair a little longer than was customary among the Chinese at that time. One day he said to me, “Brother Lee, if I were to cut my hair shorter, more of the people would receive my ministry.” Because the Chinese people at the time were very conservative, they were not willing to accept anything they regarded as modern. To them, a gentleman should wear his hair quite short. Certain ones would have been open to receive Brother Nee’s ministry if he met their standard of perfection in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl82Uz6KsbDYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> Christians are easily attracted to those who seem to practice Christian perfection. For example, suppose a certain brother is gentle, humble, and meek, and always speaks in a kind, loving way. Would you not be attracted to him? <span class="pg" data-page-id="467" id="467">[467]</span> Would it not be easy for you to be influenced by him? I use this as an illustration to point out how people are attracted by perfection. </p>
<p data-content-id="2biGa_BPHwBMmqGIt-HaBcy4wtrRfcU4sHxDfRZzyMIzlPqgeTUisrY2QHdBIBzZK"> If we see that perfection attracts people, we shall be able to understand the nature of James’ influence in Jerusalem. James was godly, righteous, and, in a certain sense, holy. He certainly had a measure of practical Christian perfection. Nevertheless, with James we do not see the life of someone living in the kingdom of God. </p>

Because we may be led astray in understanding this book, it is quite difficult to study it. In the past many of us were misled in our efforts to understand this Gospel. Some regard the Gospel of Mark merely as a biography of the Lord Jesus. Others consider this Gospel simply a book of stories concerning Jesus. Of course, it is not wrong to say that the Gospel of Mark is a biography or a book of stories. This book is a biography of the Lord, and it does contain many stories concerning His life. But if we get into the depths of the Gospel of Mark, we shall see that this Gospel is more than a biography or a book of stories. The Gospel of Mark presents a life that lives fully according to God’s New Testament economy. </p>

<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPb0DRSJlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> The word “gospel” is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67350" data-verses="Mark 1:1">1:1</span> in a new way, in a way not employed previously. From Adam until Jesus Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="470" id="470">[470]</span> there was nothing in man’s culture or civilization to correspond to what is denoted by the word “gospel” in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEcShTpNZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY"> Both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67351" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67352" data-verses="Mark 1:1">Mark 1:1</span> use the word “beginning.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67353" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Here “beginning” denotes eternity past. John’s use of this word is very mysterious. Mark, on the contrary, speaks of the beginning of the gospel. The Gospel of Mark is unique among the four Gospels in opening with the clear expression “the beginning of the gospel.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w4YREl-ZS764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> We need to be deeply impressed with the opening word of the Gospel of Mark. The phrase “the beginning of the gospel” indicates that this book is not merely a biography of a Nazarene named Jesus Christ. Neither is this merely a book of stories. Rather, this book speaks concerning the beginning of the gospel. At least to a certain extent or in a certain sense, we may regard the entire book of Mark as the beginning of the gospel. </p>

The continuation of the gospel is seen on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the chosen and prepared disciples. Peter, James, John, and the other disciples had been chosen by God and personally called by Jesus Christ. After they had been called, they were prepared by the Lord. During the ten days before Pentecost, the one hundred and twenty were praying. Do you know where they were in those days? They were in the heavens, in the Lord’s ascension. They had been brought into the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. On the day of Pentecost they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, on that day there was the continuation of the gospel. Hence, Mark is the beginning of the gospel, and Acts is the continuation of the gospel. This continuation has not yet ended. This means that we today are still in the continuation of the gospel. <span class="pg" data-page-id="471" id="471">[471]</span> </p>

Consider what was present at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67355" data-verses="Mark 1:1">1:1</span>: culture, the Gentile nations, the chosen people of God, the promise, the law, the Old Testament, the temple, the system of priestly service, the proper way to worship God according to His ordinances. By this we see that there were many good, positive things, even a number of things that had been ordained by God. The Old Testament was given by God. All the laws, ordinances, rituals, forms, practices, regulations, and services in the Old Testament had been ordained by God. The temple, the priesthood, and the system of worship certainly were sanctioned by God. Now, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67356" data-verses="Mark 1:1">1:1</span>, among all these good, positive things, we read of the beginning of something else—the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="GoWRQTh2JAOfaAt93RAatb6uFozX66HQ3Rw0vb4ArxIVsvkriGZ32FGW746MXwzF2"> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ implies the termination of many things that had been in existence for thousands of years. In fact, this beginning implies the termination of everything other than God Himself. Certain things had been going on for hundreds, even thousands, of years. Now suddenly there was a new beginning, a beginning that terminated all things other than God. </p>
<p data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XPCnfB6sWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv"> There has been a difference of opinion among Bible expositors concerning the time of the beginning of the gospel. Some say that the time of the beginning of the gospel was when John the Baptist came out to minister. Others say that the time of this beginning was when Jesus began to preach. Still others claim that the time was the day of Pentecost. </p>
<p data-content-id="YsklwMzN513qLhmk9AEqbb3z79rzoaz16RIy_1aceu91KDfDQgSH1KFDyFgXuTwem"> It is a difficult matter for readers of the New Testament to understand that the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ involves the absolute termination of the old things. As we consider this matter, we need to remember that the Gospel of Mark reveals Jesus Christ as the entire, universal, all-inclusive replacement. </p>
<p data-content-id="EcbL8VFfQ-Sr2--Cpt04Ze9C5Af8VjbkN252A17whu13YIvULldJsUdlfmPvVHC1u"> Consider what happened on the Mount of Transfiguration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67357" data-verses="Mark 9:2-13">9:2-13</span>). The Lord Jesus took Peter, James, and John <span class="pg" data-page-id="472" id="472">[472]</span> and brought them up into a high mountain. Then “He was transformed before them; and His garments became brilliant, exceedingly white, such as no fuller on earth could whiten them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67358" data-verses="Mark 9:2-3">9:2-3</span>). Then Elijah and Moses appeared to them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67359" data-verses="Mark 9:4">v. 4</span>). Being very excited, even beside himself, Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles—one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67360" data-verses="Mark 9:5">v. 5</span>). In a way, Peter’s word was somewhat reasonable, for the Lord Jesus and two great persons from the Old Testament were present on the mountain. Actually, what Peter spoke was nonsensical. Suddenly “a cloud came overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67361" data-verses="Mark 9:7">v. 7</span>). When the disciples looked around, “they no longer saw anyone with them, except Jesus only” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67362" data-verses="Mark 9:8">v. 8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="DioGnuR0sUvA-HjivOYZ_TZkDeFgdlHkYsKOva-5So8_5JX330ghXt3Lqsjs98JZo"> We may say that both Moses, who represents the law of the Old Testament, and Elijah, who represents the Old Testament prophets, were replaced by Christ. According to Jewish custom, God’s people considered the Old Testament as having two major sections: the Law and the Prophets. Hence, for Moses and Elijah, the representatives of the Old Testament, to be replaced actually means that all Old Testament things have been replaced by Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DeIrDES_I3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ"> On the negative side, the beginning of the gospel means a termination, and this termination includes us. This all-inclusive termination includes culture, the nations, Israel, the law, the prophets, the Old Testament practices and way of worship, the temple, the altar, the priesthood, and the system of offerings. Now when we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67363" data-verses="Mark 1:1">Mark 1:1</span> we need to have the understanding that the beginning of the gospel means the termination of the old things. </p>

However, in the more than nineteen centuries from the time the Lord Jesus was on earth, the situation among Christians has been full <span class="pg" data-page-id="473" id="473">[473]</span> of culture, religion, ethics, and the endeavor to be holy, scriptural, and victorious.

<p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4ajtQai1cuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> We cannot deny that the Epistle of James is a good book. This Epistle helps us to be long-suffering and to have endurance. James speaks of the long-suffering of the prophets and of the endurance of Job. In his Epistle he teaches us how to pray as Elijah did. James’ writing contains a wisdom similar to that found in the proverbs of Solomon. All this is very good. Nevertheless, for God’s New Testament economy all such matters need to be terminated and replaced by Christ. As we have emphasized in this message, the beginning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67365" data-verses="Mark 1:1">Mark 1:1</span> implies such a termination. </p>

Why, then, does the Gospel of John not say that the Word became man? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67378" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> clearly says not that the Word became a man, but that the Word became flesh.

<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHievC5sniWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> Concerning this matter, Paul was very careful.

Because He had nothing of which to repent, there was no need for Him to repent. The Lord did not have sin, and He never sinned. Because He had neither sin nor sins, He did not need to repent. Nevertheless, He had a humanity that was related to the old creation, and for this reason He needed to be baptized. In His baptism the Lord was willing to have Himself put aside. </p>

After His baptism, God the Spirit descended upon Him. Therefore, within Him the Lord Jesus had the divine essence, and upon Him He had the Spirit of God. As the One with the Father within Him as His essence and the Spirit upon Him as the power for His move and work, He began to minister. In His move, His work, the Lord Jesus was not a person merely of morality or ethics, and He was not a person of religion. Rather, the Lord Jesus was a person absolutely of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4ajNQZiVcuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67419" data-verses="Mark 4:1">4:1</span>, after ministering in the three foregoing chapters, the Lord Jesus got into a boat and taught the people “many things in parables” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67420" data-verses="Mark 4:2">v. 2</span>). The first parable was the parable of the sower (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67421" data-verses="Mark 4:1-20">4:1-20</span>), which opens with the words, “Behold, the sower went out to sow” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67422" data-verses="Mark 4:3">v. 3</span>). This indicates that in the first three chapters of the Gospel of Mark whatever the Lord did was a sowing of the seed. For example in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67423" data-verses="Mark 1:14-20">1:14-20</span> the Lord Jesus preached the gospel, saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent and believe in the gospel!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67424" data-verses="Mark 4:15">v. 15</span>). Since He preached the gospel, we may regard the Lord merely as a preacher. But the parable of the sower indicates that the Lord was a Sower. This means that in preaching the gospel He was not merely a preacher but also a Sower. There is a great difference between a sower and a preacher. Apparently the Lord Jesus was a preacher; actually He was a Sower. </p>
<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GU6G6m0eMeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> The situation is the same regarding teaching the truth, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the <span class="pg" data-page-id="488" id="488">[488]</span> leper. Apparently the Lord was a teacher; actually He was a Sower. Likewise, apparently He was One casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper. But in doing all these things, He was actually a Sower. When He preached the gospel, taught the truth, cast out demons, healed the sick, and cleansed the leper, He was a Sower sowing the seed. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_rQrLqJZEraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV">A SOWING LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="hx_zzSpG4rVvnFzTV2_6iUo79ejIThvBxQ7OaGa7mOy9TYjUhbSqG4WclLusd8YDB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67425" data-verses="Mark 4:1">Mark 4</span> reveals that the life that lives according to God’s New Testament economy is a sowing life. The Lord Jesus as the Sower sowed Himself as a seed into the people who were touched by Him. We may take the case of the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law as an illustration. When the Lord Jesus came to Peter’s mother-in-law, He healed her. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67426" data-verses="Mark 1:31">1:31</span> says, “And coming to her, He raised her up, holding her hand; and the fever left her, and she served them.” Do you think that here the Lord was doing nothing more than healing? To be sure, He was doing much more. That healing was actually a sowing. When the Lord healed Peter’s mother-in-law, something of Himself was sown into her. Of course, at the time she probably was not conscious of anything being sown into her. Nevertheless, it is a fact, a reality, that something out from the sowing Savior had been imparted to her. </p>
<p data-content-id="URtKIt0L_s2x9jmmkHfxw0Rxo9XCdhKgCltl2BQUyoJ1J6-naGmt6MTZtNA2Ufk2K"> The Lord was also sowing the seed when He touched the leper and cleansed him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67427" data-verses="Mark 1:40-45">1:40-45</span>). The leper said to the Lord, “If You are willing, You can cleanse me!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67428" data-verses="Mark 1:40">v. 40</span>). Moved with compassion, the Lord touched him and said to him, “I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67429" data-verses="Mark 1:41-42">vv. 41-42</span>). When the Lord Jesus touched the leper and cleansed him, do you not believe that something from Him was sown into the one who was cleansed? As the Lord was cleansing the leper, He was sowing Himself into him. </p>

These ten items cover the thoughts, ideas, and concepts of all people, including Gentiles, Jews, and Christians. People everywhere have their minds occupied with culture, religion, ethics, morality, the improvement of character, and philosophy. In addition, Christians may be occupied with being scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious. Many books have been written by Christian teachers on how to be scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious. </p>

As we pointed out in a foregoing message, the Lord Jesus did not live in the kingdom of law or that of ethics; He lived altogether in another realm—the kingdom of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="494" id="494">[494]</span> </p>

What did He do? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67452" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span> of Mark we see that the Lord was a Sower and that He sowed Himself as the seed into people. In particular, He sowed Himself into Peter and the other disciples. </p>
<p data-content-id="IgKBIj9xvn3kVySf_yolLjQZB-WDTQgX3dkNC5dvPZxfKOYTZm1eWOeBjrXPL5gF0"> It was not an easy matter for the Lord Jesus to sow Himself as a seed into human beings. To sow seed into soil is easy, but for the Lord to sow living seed into people was difficult. This difficulty can be illustrated by the problem parents sometimes face in getting medicine into a sick child. Because a child may strongly resist, the parents may have to hold him down and open his mouth in order to put the medicine into him. In a similar way, the Lord Jesus may have had to use angels as helpers in sowing Himself as the seed into us. It may have been necessary for us to be put into a difficult situation before we opened to the Lord to receive Him as the divine seed. Praise Him that in spite of the difficulty, He has been sown into us! </p>
<p data-content-id="Hfo6mxQWhV9UNGGl3X7bWIzqFlUtfJf1FVddN1W7drZ0yu-2uolKPKUU_XXH9aAsf"> The Gospel of Mark shows the Lord Jesus living and working in such a way as to sow Himself as seed into people. Mark is not a book of culture, religion, ethics, morality, improvement of character, or philosophy. Neither is it a book teaching us to be scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious. Instead, the Gospel of Mark is a book presenting the Sower sowing Himself into us as the seed of a life that lives according to God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudN_ohKdSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> It is possible that the thoughts even of the saints in the Lord’s recovery may be occupied with the matters of how to be scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious. Do you not want to be holy? Do you not want to be spiritual and victorious? Books written by Christians emphasizing the need to be holy, spiritual, and victorious may quote verses from the Bible to support their teachings. However, the Gospel of Mark does not touch this field at all. This Gospel does not teach us how to be holy, spiritual, and victorious. Instead, the Gospel of Mark presents the Lord as the One sowing Himself into the disciples. <span class="pg" data-page-id="495" id="495">[495]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-SupvqApYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> The Lord’s close followers spent three and a half years with Him. During those years, He must have taught them many things. It is surprising that in the Gospel of Mark we do not find a hint concerning this. In this book we see that the Lord Jesus was continually sowing Himself into Peter and the other disciples. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67453" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> the Lord saw Peter and his brother Andrew fishing. The Lord called them and, attracted by Him, they left all and followed Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67454" data-verses="Mark 1:16-18">vv. 16-18</span>). It may be that the Lord’s sowing of the seed into Peter began at that time. </p>

This is a difficult question to answer. Was Peter saved when he was called in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67455" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> of Mark? If you say that he was not saved then, I would ask, “How could Peter have been called without being saved? The Bible reveals that once we are called, we are saved.” However, if we say that Peter was saved when he was called in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67456" data-verses="Mark 1:1">Mark 1</span>, we may wonder why he did not show any signs of being a saved one. Peter was selfish and natural. He was always in himself, not giving any indication that he had been saved. </p>
<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJZ3i_2VqJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> Perhaps Peter was saved when his mother-in-law was healed, or when he declared that Jesus is the Christ, or when he saw the Lord Jesus transfigured on the mountain. But in none of these situations does Peter give any indication of being saved. </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQuoTRuu5ZSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> Peter told the Lord Jesus that even if the others would deny Him, he would never deny Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67457" data-verses="Mark 14:29">14:29</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67458" data-verses="Mark 14:31">31</span>). This might be a sign that Peter was saved by that time. However, soon afterward Peter denied the Lord Jesus three times. Then he went out and wept (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67459" data-verses="Mark 14:72">14:72</span>). Perhaps that was when he was saved. It certainly is difficult to determine the time Peter was saved. </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNFu_vGRE0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67460" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> of Mark until the time the Lord Jesus in resurrection came to the disciples, breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67461" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>) was a long time of sowing. I believe that the Lord’s sowing of <span class="pg" data-page-id="496" id="496">[496]</span> Himself into Peter began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67462" data-verses="Mark 1:1">Mark 1</span> when the Lord called him and he followed the Lord. This sowing continued until the resurrected Christ breathed on the disciples who had come together in a closed room. I believe that the Lord’s sowing was complete at that time. One proof of this is that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67463" data-verses="Acts 1:1">chapter one</span> of Acts Peter is a different person. No longer is he natural. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67464" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> Peter truly bears the signs of having been saved by the Lord. My point here is that the Lord Jesus as the Sower went through a lengthy process to sow Himself into Peter and the other disciples. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6wy_Ny4ISYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> In your experience has it not taken the Lord time to sow Himself into you? In asking this question I am not referring to salvation, regeneration, justification, or reconciliation in a doctrinal way. I am speaking concerning our enjoyment of God’s salvation experientially. Some may think that for the Lord to take three and a half years to accomplish the sowing of Himself into Peter was too long. However, to the Lord this is not long at all, for to Him a thousand years are as one day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67465" data-verses="2Peter 3:8">2 Pet. 3:8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocdonGEtqNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> Instead of emphasizing the Lord’s teaching and training of the disciples, the Gospel of Mark gives us a clear view of how the Lord was doing the work of sowing Himself into them.

Neither is the New Testament economy of God merely a matter of helping us to improve in being more scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious. God’s New Testament economy is to sow Himself into us so that we may live a life according to His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-BZI2-ZPWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD"> Is it merely a doctrine to you that God in His economy is sowing a wonderful Person, Jesus Christ the Son of God, into you? Is the Lord not a real and living Person within you? <span class="pg" data-page-id="497" id="497">[497]</span> Some Christians oppose the fact that Jesus Christ actually dwells in the believers. They claim that He is in the heavens and is represented in us by the Holy Spirit. But from the Word of God and our experience we know that Jesus Christ is not only in the heavens but is also in us. He dwells in us as the life that lives according to God’s New Testament economy. </p>

The significance of the Lord’s living is that He is the Sower sowing Himself as a seed into people. The Lord sowed Himself into those who were touched by Him.

These four cases describe our spiritual condition before we were saved. We were those who were sick of a fever, those whose “temperature” was abnormally high. Today every fallen human being is sick with a fever. Before we were saved, we also were lepers; we were unclean, defiled, and contaminated to the uttermost. Furthermore, as unsaved persons, we were paralytics. With respect to God, we were altogether paralyzed. Because we were absolutely paralyzed, we were not able to do anything for God. As paralyzed ones, we could not walk. We also were those with a withered hand. Therefore, we were sick with a fever, we were contaminated lepers, we were paralytics unable to walk, and we were those with a withered hand, unable to work. Although these are separate cases in the Gospel of Mark, spiritually speaking, they describe the condition of every human being. Thus, these cases portray the situation of a particular person. <span class="pg" data-page-id="503" id="503">[503]</span> </p>

The one who represents us is Peter. According to the record in Mark, Peter was the first to be called by the Lord. After he was called, he was always taking the lead. He even took the lead to deny the Lord Jesus. We may even say that, in a sense, Peter was crucified before the Lord Jesus was. Then after the Lord’s resurrection Peter’s name was mentioned by the angel: “But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67485" data-verses="Mark 16:7">16:7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="MM4hI37Bq0acKu7uferyFTufA5Jn_2rlWqgP_ZCAOT51o90taGoOAfheGhkXDu6gu"> Because in the Gospel of Mark Peter is our representative, all the cases described in this book may be taken as an aggregate and given the name of Peter. It is significant that the first case of healing in this Gospel was the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law. In a spiritual sense, all the cases in this book are related to Peter. This means that Peter was sick of a fever and that Peter was the blind Bartimaeus at the gate of Jericho. Peter needed to be healed of his fever and of his blindness. </p>

After <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67487" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span> the Lord Jesus goes on to carry out further healings. But these healings are of particular organs: the hearing organ, the speaking organ, and the seeing organ. In order to contact others, we must have these organs. If we are deaf, dumb, and blind, what contact can we have with others? We could not have any contact at all since we would not be able to hear, speak, or see. As our representative, Peter was healed of his fever, leprosy, paralysis, and withered condition; however, still he could not hear, speak, or see. </p>
<p data-content-id="1YZgJVvfR7nEdPygngXBGuLFC4vhwTC01Dl5_a_Qjw4LWip4gb95cZHsWchz2v1DI"> After the four cases of general healing, we have in Mark four cases of the healing of specific organs.

When they came to Bethsaida, a blind man was brought to the Lord Jesus. “Taking hold of the hand of the blind man, He led him forth outside the village; and having spit in his eyes and laid His hands on him, He asked him, Do you see anything?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67492" data-verses="Mark 8:23">8:23</span>). The man looked up and said, “I behold men; I see them as trees walking” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67493" data-verses="Mark 8:24">v. 24</span>). Then the Lord laid His hands upon the man’s eyes again, and “he looked intently and was restored, and he saw all things clearly.” Is this not a picture of our spiritual condition? When we first saw the Lord, we did not see Him clearly. We did not see spiritual things exactly as they are. Then after further contact with the Lord, we began to see all things clearly. </p>
<p data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDzotE_qYANUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44"> The second case of the healing of blindness is the healing of blind Bartimaeus. When the Lord Jesus asked Bartimaeus what he wanted Him to do for him, the blind man said, “Rabboni, that I may recover my sight!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67494" data-verses="Mark 10:51">10:51</span>). Then Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has healed you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67495" data-verses="Mark 10:52">v. 52</span>), and immediately Bartimaeus recovered his sight and followed the Lord on the road (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67496" data-verses="Mark 10:52">v. 52</span>). This is the last case of healing recorded in the Gospel of Mark. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoUWABiey_rq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm">OUR NEED FOR PARTICULAR HEALING</h2><p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UeT5rcZwaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> Spiritually speaking, our relationship with God depends upon the hearing organ, the speaking organ, and the seeing organ. If we cannot hear God’s word, if we cannot talk to God, and if we cannot see God’s vision, we cannot have any relationship with Him. If such were our situation, we would be like a dumb idol standing before God. Therefore, we need the healing of our hearing, speaking, and seeing organs. <span class="pg" data-page-id="505" id="505">[505]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxbMGQrXb4uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr"> The New Testament reveals that, spiritually speaking, we were dead, but the Lord Jesus has made us alive. When He came to us and sowed Himself into us, we were enlivened. We were then healed of our fever, leprosy, paralysis, and withered condition. </p>
<p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxLbpr63sS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> Praise the Lord that we have been made alive, that we have been regenerated! However, after being regenerated, we may still be deaf, dumb, and blind, in need of the Lord’s particular healing. Was this not your experience with the Lord? I can testify that it was my experience. I was regenerated in 1925, but it was not until 1932 that my ears began to hear God’s voice, my eyes began to see His vision, and my mouth was opened to speak for God. I praise Him that today, through His mercy, I can hear, speak, and see. </p>

It is very significant that this unveiling comes immediately after the healing of a blind man in Bethsaida (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67526" data-verses="Mark 8:22-26">8:22-26</span>). Before the Lord Jesus unveiled Himself, He healed a blind man. This indicates that in order to see Christ and His death and resurrection, we need to be healed of our blindness. </p>

First, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67529" data-verses="Mark 8:29">8:29</span> Peter says, “You are the Christ!” But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67530" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">Matthew 16:16</span> he says, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” Mark does not include here the matter of Jesus being the Son of the living God. Second, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67531" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> the Lord Jesus says, “I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.” Mark does not record anything about the Lord’s building the church upon this rock. Third, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67532" data-verses="Matthew 16:19">Matthew 16:19</span> says, “I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in the heavens.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="510" id="510">[510]</span> Mark has no record of this. The reason for the differences is that Mark simply gives us a full biography of the Lord. Mark is not concerned with so many doctrinal points. </p>

What is the meaning of the title “the Christ”? What is the significance of this anglicized Greek word? We know that in Greek <em>Christos</em> means the anointed one. According to the types in the Old Testament, a person was always anointed for a particular purpose. What, then, is the purpose of the Lord’s being the Christ, the anointed One? For what purpose was He anointed? </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQurRRuu7ZSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> Some may say that the Lord was anointed to accomplish God’s purpose, to be a King, and to be a Priest. When I was young, I was taught by the Brethren that the title Christ means that the Lord Jesus was anointed by God to carry out God’s commission. The Lord was anointed to accomplish God’s purpose and to achieve His goal. This is true, and I certainly believe it. Nevertheless, there is still something lacking in this understanding of the significance of the title Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNGs_vFRk0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> The Lord Jesus was anointed by God to fulfill God’s commission. A crucial part of this commission is to impart the Triune God into God’s chosen people. Therefore, as the anointed One Christ had the commission to impart the Triune God into His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6wx9Ny7IyYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> The Gospel of Mark does not emphasize the Lord’s being anointed to be the King, the Priest, or the Prophet. Rather, in this Gospel we see that the Lord Jesus was anointed by God to fulfill the commission to sow God into His people. Hence, the Lord is the Christ, the anointed One to do the work of sowing. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSoceqnGHsKNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> Concerning Christ, the anointed One, Paul says, “But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, who has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67534" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:21-22">2 Cor. 1:21-22</span>). Here we <span class="pg" data-page-id="511" id="511">[511]</span> see that God has attached us all to Christ, the anointed One. Here we do not have any indication that the commission of this anointed One is to be a king or a prophet. The commission of Christ, God’s anointed, is to anoint us with God as the element that seals us with Him and becomes a pledge of God as our portion. This commission is not related to the kingship or the priesthood. This commission is to sow the Triune God into our being and thereby to impart the divine life into us. Have you ever realized that the title Christ is for the carrying out of such a commission? </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8depOUKoxkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> Probably you have heard the teachings that emphasize the fact that, as God’s anointed One, Christ was anointed to carry out God’s commission, to establish God’s kingdom, and to be a King, a Priest, and a Prophet. Probably you have never heard before that Christ was anointed by God with the particular commission of imparting the divine life to us by sowing Himself into our being. Christ was anointed to sow the Triune God as the seed of life into us. According to the New Testament revelation, this is the first aspect of Christ’s commission, and we all need to see it. The first aspect of the commission Christ received from the Father was not to be a king or a prophet; it was to be a Sower, the One sowing the Triune God into us. </p>

I could not understand why <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67536" data-verses="John 20:31">John 20:31</span> spoke not only of the Son of God but also of the Christ. I had been taught that Christ was God’s anointed One to carry out God’s commission to establish the kingdom. Why was it necessary to believe that Jesus is the Christ in order to have eternal life? I thought that as long as I believed in the Son of God, this was sufficient for having eternal life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67537" data-verses="John 20:31">John 20:31</span> is a strong verse telling us that we must believe in Christ in order to have eternal life. The New Testament says that we have eternal life by believing in the Son of God <span class="pg" data-page-id="512" id="512">[512]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67538" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>). Eventually, I came to understand that the Son of God refers to the Lord’s Person and that Christ refers to His commission. We need to believe that Jesus is the Son of God because His Person as the Son of God is a matter of eternal life. But in order for the Son of God to carry out His commission to impart Himself into us as life, He must be God’s anointed One. It is by being the Christ that the Lord Jesus imparts Himself into us as the Son of God so that we may have eternal life. </p>

Instead, He brings them with Him wherever He goes so that they may observe His living. They heard what the Lord said, and they saw what He did. They observed how He dealt with many different cases. At the time, the interpretation of these cases was not given. They were amazed when He went before them to Jerusalem: “Now they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67539" data-verses="Mark 10:32">10:32</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8GkCJum_3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> Wherever the Lord Jesus went in the Gospel of Mark, He brought the disciples with Him. They were with Him when He entered Jerusalem, they were with Him when He cleansed the temple, they were with Him when He lodged in Bethany, they were with Him when He ate the Passover feast and established His table, and they were with Him when He was betrayed and arrested. </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYlzeE0hRaxklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> After the Lord’s death, resurrection, and ascension, the disciples came to understand the significance of all that had happened according to the record in the Gospel of Mark.

In his Epistles Paul indicates clearly that Christ is all-inclusive. For example, Paul tells us not only that Christ is the Head of the universal new man; He also says that Christ is the Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67557" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">1 Cor. 12:12</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67558" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Colossians 3:11</span> Paul says that in the new man Christ is all the members and is in all the members.

<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QGCF58IByr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> Paul also reveals clearly that Christ’s death is all-inclusive.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67560" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Romans 6:6</span> Paul declares that our old man was crucified with Christ. These verses indicate that Christ’s death on the cross was not merely the death of an individual. Because Christ is all-inclusive, His death was also all-inclusive. How could such an all-inclusive One die only as an individual and not experience an all-inclusive death? There is no indication in the Gospel of Mark that Christ died an all-inclusive death. But in the Epistles as a God-inspired definition and explanation of Christ with His death and resurrection we see that His death certainly was all-inclusive. </p>
<p data-content-id="9oKgTLAkdlklLhjgHcmswp1dGn6eaolqd4CZe4MLILizbsHxaTMzwZX1JbHYJ3MwK"> In the Epistles of Paul we also see that we were included in Christ’s resurrection and ascension. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67561" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span> Paul says that God “raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.” Therefore, in the sight of God, we are seated with Christ in the heavenlies. As God’s chosen people, we all have been put into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67562" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>). Since Christ is in the heavenlies, we also are in the heavenlies. We all need to see from the Epistles that Christ and His death, resurrection, and ascension are all-inclusive. </p>

He included them in all that He was doing. Judas was the only disciple who did not continue with the Lord until the end. After the Passover feast, the Lord Jesus exposed Judas, and then Judas left. As a Jew, he had the right to enjoy the Passover feast. But because he had not been chosen by God to remain with the Lord, he had no share in the Lord’s supper. All the other disciples experienced the supper and were included in the Lord’s death and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoUVCBidyfrq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm"> When the Lord Jesus was arrested in the garden of Gethsemane, His disciples were with Him. Peter was even so bold as to take out his sword and cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67564" data-verses="Mark 14:47">14:47</span>). In his boldness Peter caused trouble for the Lord and made it necessary for Him to heal <span class="pg" data-page-id="519" id="519">[519]</span> the servant’s ear. In a sense, Peter was crucified before the Lord Jesus was. The Lord was crucified at Golgotha, but Peter was crucified in the courtyard of the Praetorium. </p>
<p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UdR5rfYQaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> The point we are emphasizing here is that the Lord Jesus brought His disciples through all the steps that led to His death and resurrection, and then He included them in His death and resurrection. If we understand the narration of the Gospel of Mark according to what is revealed in the Epistles of Paul, we shall see that not only those disciples but we also were included in the death and resurrection of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxYOGQoW74uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr"> When some hear that we were included in Christ’s death and resurrection, they may say, “How is it possible that we were included in the Lord’s death and resurrection? We were not even born when these events took place.” According to man’s way of thinking, we could not have been included. But God’s way of thinking, which is according to His eternal view, is different. According to God’s understanding, we were crucified and resurrected with Christ even before we were born. Although we cannot understand this according to our natural mind, it is nevertheless a fact. </p>

This means that the biography of Jesus is also our biography. In the words of a hymn, “He is my history,” and “His life is my experience” (<em>Hymns,</em> #949). Therefore, the biography narrated in Mark is not only a biography of the individual Jesus but also a biography of the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98tQBBHnY0xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB"> In particular, the Gospel of Mark is a biography of Peter, our representative. Peter is present in the first chapter of Mark, and his name is specifically mentioned in the last chapter: “But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67565" data-verses="Mark 16:7">16:7</span>). Furthermore, the cases in this book are a composite portrait of us as represented by Peter. For example, on the Mount of Transfiguration Peter said, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> three tabernacles—one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67566" data-verses="Mark 9:5">9:5</span>). Because Peter is our representative, his speaking here is also our speaking. Likewise, when Peter denied the Lord three times, that was also our threefold denial of the Lord. The angel’s word concerning Peter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67567" data-verses="Mark 16:7">16:7</span> is also a word concerning us. As we read this verse, it is correct to insert our name in the place of Peter’s name, since we are represented by him. </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TB7ms6bcc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> From the time Peter was called by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67568" data-verses="Mark 1:16-17">1:16 and 17</span>, he was captured by Him and was always with Him. Along with James and John, he was with the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration. This indicates that wherever the Lord Jesus went, Peter went with Him, for the Lord brought Peter with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPFAYnsMSBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> Do you believe that when the Lord Jesus was crucified, He left Peter and the other disciples? No, when the Lord Jesus was crucified and buried, Peter, the representative of us all, was crucified with Him. Moreover, the Lord Jesus was not resurrected alone. According to God’s point of view, which is beyond the elements of space and time, we all were included in Christ’s resurrection. </p>

Therefore, we were put into Christ by God when He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkuyV2xKj1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> One day the Christ in whom we were chosen by God in eternity came to us and called us.

Here the Lord seems to be saying, “Peter, I am the Christ in whom you were chosen by God the Father. Now I come to you to carry out the Father’s choice. He has already put you into Me. Why do you remain here fishing? Come, follow Me.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="521" id="521">[521]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-70C5GIun6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF"> Many Christians do not realize that the Gospel of Mark gives us a biography of a life that is fully according to and for God’s New Testament economy. The New Testament economy of God is for God to dispense Himself into His chosen people to make them sons of God and members of Christ for the formation of the Body of Christ to express the Triune God. This is a simple definition of the wonderful matter of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9c6XAEHBB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m"> In order to have a proper understanding of God’s New Testament economy, we need the entire New Testament. The Gospel of Mark by itself is not sufficient for this. As we have pointed out, in the Epistles we have the explanation and definition of the life presented in Mark. Therefore, in the light revealed in the Epistles we can see that the life recorded in the Gospel of Mark is a life fully according to and for God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAehRDyjsaqrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj">THE SIMPLICITY OF THE GOSPEL OF MARK</h2><p data-content-id="GoWRQTh2JAOfaAt90QwalIquFozX66HQ3Rw0vb4ArxIVsvkriGZ32FGW746MXwzF2"> When I was young, Mark was not as precious to me as Matthew, John, and Luke were. My impression of the Gospel of Mark was that it was too simple. Matthew, on the contrary, presents wonderful teachings and parables concerning the kingdom of the heavens. I spent much time to study the Gospel of Matthew, and, as early as 1939, I put out a series of messages on the kingdom of the heavens based on the Lord’s teaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67581" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67582" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67583" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67584" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">thirteen</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67585" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">twenty-four</span>, <span class="pg" data-page-id="526" id="526">[526]</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67586" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span>. I have also given many messages on the Gospel of John. Although I have not given as many messages on Luke as on Matthew and John, in the book entitled <em>Gospel Outlines</em> there are a good number of outlines of subjects taken from the Gospel of Luke. Those outlines are based on the different gospel stories and parables in Luke. </p>
<p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaWHaNEyjU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> In the past, I appreciated Matthew, John, and Luke, but I did not have nearly as much appreciation for Mark. It seemed to me that this Gospel could be compared to a cup of plain water that had no particular color or flavor. However, recently, while I was preparing the Life-study Messages on Mark, the light began to shine from this Gospel. Now I see that in the Gospel of Mark we have a record of a life that is absolutely according to and for God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QGC150axyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> I believe that the Gospel of Mark is the most simple book in the New Testament. But the simplicity of Mark is very striking, and we need to consider it. We need to ask why the Gospel of Mark was written in such a simple way. We need to ask why, apparently, this Gospel has no particular taste or color. I can testify that this kind of questioning opened the door for the light to shine in. The simplicity of the Gospel of Mark is very meaningful. </p>
<p data-content-id="rYx_fg7BaG8M4Ci8GkiJtmf3UOkNAhJgY4QVv4uyYgO2fPv9ZbPo7yBGNJY4E8l6l"> The more we read the Gospel of Mark, the more we are impressed with its simplicity. Compared to Mark, the Gospel of Matthew is quite complicated. Consider how many names are included in the first sixteen verses of Matthew. Mark, however, begins in a very simple way: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67587" data-verses="Mark 1:1">1:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="d6grKYlitExUXdYlzek0iR6xklSWFOudD1auESbBunR_qohvhmWiOvd49Bxy8Yz-0"> Like Matthew, the Gospel of Luke is also rather complicated. Consider, for example, the lengthy account of the conception and birth of John the Baptist and the conception and birth of the Lord Jesus. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67588" data-verses="Luke 1:1">Luke 1</span> includes the praises of Mary, Elizabeth, and Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67589" data-verses="Luke 3:1">chapter three</span> Luke presents a genealogy that is more complicated than that found in Matthew. Matthew speaks only of forty-two generations, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="527" id="527">[527]</span> in Luke we have seventy-seven generations. To be sure, whereas Mark is simple, Luke is complicated. </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPY1zRSIlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> In the Gospel of John we have many deep mysteries. John’s Gospel opens in a mysterious way: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67590" data-verses="John 1:1">1:1</span>). We are told that in Him was life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67591" data-verses="John 1:4">1:4</span>), and then that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67592" data-verses="John 1:14">v. 14</span>). The Gospel of John, therefore, has a distinct color and flavor. When we read the Gospel of John, we can taste the flavor of this Gospel. But what kind of flavor do you taste when you read the Gospel of Mark? It seems that the only taste in Mark is the taste of plain water. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KNWn1FqbaqbPGMpEfTRTpMZuwGDroKWYmH4c7pMQPw86yNTY07mMUUBQ2D3aSJDrY">THE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL<br/>AND THE TERMINATION OF THE OLD THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="lxgK9rxeK60g1X3w7ZhEl_ZS764y98gFqFHVVc7q25EHs2S9_YhB9ow9WzlY9ZHm5"> We have seen that Mark opens with a word concerning the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67593" data-verses="Mark 1:4-8">1:4-8</span> John the Baptist preached the baptism of repentance and also introduced the Slave-Savior. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67594" data-verses="Mark 1:9">1:9</span> we are told that “Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.” After the Lord Jesus was baptized, He was anointed by the Spirit. Then He began His ministry. As we have pointed out, with the Lord Jesus life, work, and ministry were all one. With Him there was no distinction between life and work. </p>
<p data-content-id="O8UhUNYqCBnM85L8-wHfLDU6jIJZsoKJvEqYZJW8OEAFLWMdG4aWhxw5QHfd9cISQ"> As we have seen, the word “beginning” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67595" data-verses="Mark 1:1">1:1</span> implies a new start, and this new start involves the termination of the old things. In previous messages we have listed ten items of these old things: culture, religion, ethics, morality, improvement of character, human philosophy, and trying to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious. All these things were in existence when John the Baptist came forth to preach the baptism of repentance. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67596" data-verses="Mark 1:1">Mark 1</span> these things were terminated. By what were the old things terminated? They were terminated by the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Furthermore, these old things were buried when the Lord Jesus was baptized. </p>
<p data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-70C5GP-H6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF"> When the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea, <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> Pharaoh and the armies of Egypt were buried. We may say that the children of Israel brought Pharaoh and his armies with them into the sea. In a similar way, when the Lord Jesus stepped into the waters of baptism, He brought with Him all ten items of the old things. Hence, these old things were terminated and buried. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9c6XACXxB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m">LIVING IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAehRDyp-6qrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj"> The life the Lord Jesus lived was not a life according to culture or religion. It was not even according to ethics, morality, philosophy, or improvement of character. The Lord Jesus did not live a life of trying to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious. Instead of living according to these ten items, He lived a life that was fully according to and for God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="GoWRQTh2JAOfaAt90QwauaauFozX66HQ3Rw0vb4ArxIVsvkriGZ32FGW746MXwzF2"> We need to be deeply impressed with the matter of a life fully according to and for God’s New Testament economy. If we are impressed with this thought and expression as we read the Gospel of Mark, we shall be enlightened through what is recorded in this Gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XMDXfC4MWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv"> The Lord Jesus, as portrayed in the Gospel of Mark, was different from any other man who had ever lived. In the Old Testament we see the living of those who came before the Lord Jesus. Many of those who lived before the time of Christ were men of culture, religion, ethics, and morality. Some cared for philosophy, and others were for the improvement of character. Some sought to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious. But in Mark we see a Man who is in an altogether different category. This One—the Lord Jesus—lives in the kingdom of God. Actually, He Himself is the kingdom. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YsklwMzN513qLhmk-B0qYZXz79rzoaz16RIy_1aceu91KDfDQgSH1KFDyFgXuTwem">THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LORD<br/>AS THE SEED OF THE KINGDOM</h2><p data-content-id="EcbL8VFfQ-Sr2--CqsE4Zf9C5Af8VjbkN252A17whu13YIvULldJsUdlfmPvVHC1u"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67597" data-verses="Mark 1:1">1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67598" data-verses="Mark 1:14">14</span> we read of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the gospel of God. This gospel is also the gospel of the kingdom of God. Not many Christians have realized that the kingdom of God is a person. The kingdom eventually <span class="pg" data-page-id="529" id="529">[529]</span> becomes a corporate person. The seed of the kingdom is an individual, the Lord Jesus. As the Sower, He came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into His disciples. Now this seed is developing into the corporate kingdom of God. This kingdom is actually the Body of Christ. The development of the Lord as the seed of the kingdom is His Body, and His Body is His increase, His enlargement. </p>
<p data-content-id="DioGnuR0sUvA-HjisPoZ_SZkDeFgdlHkYsKOva-5So8_5JX330ghXt3Lqsjs98JZo"> This understanding of the kingdom of God is certainly different from the traditional concept of the kingdom. According to the New Testament, the kingdom of God is the enlargement of the Person of Christ. The kingdom is the development of the seed, which is Jesus Christ. Today this development of Christ is the church. Hence, the church as Christ’s Body is the kingdom of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_oRrLiZpEraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV"> As we read the Gospel of Mark, we need to see that the Lord Jesus was living a life of sowing the Triune God into His believers as the soil. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67608" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> He began to collect the soil. Peter, the first one to be called by the Lord Jesus, is our representative. He took the lead in things both good and bad. He took the lead to recognize that Jesus is the Christ and also to deny the Lord. Peter even took the lead to be crucified. In a foregoing message we pointed out that, in a sense, Peter was crucified even before the Lord Jesus was. Furthermore, after the Lord’s resurrection, the angel <span class="pg" data-page-id="532" id="532">[532]</span> specifically mentioned Peter’s name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67609" data-verses="Mark 16:7">16:7</span>). This indicates that Peter was known by the angels. He certainly was our representative. </p>

The cases recorded in this Gospel indicate that the soil was not in a healthy condition. In Mark we have twelve cases involving thirteen people. (One case involves two people, a woman and a young girl.) Four of these twelve cases are cases of people possessed by demons. This indicates that the soil gathered by the Lord Jesus was possessed, occupied, by demons. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPFA4nvMyBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> Were you not occupied by some kind of “demon” before you were saved? Many today are possessed by the demon of drugs or the demon of gambling. As we consider today’s situation in the world, we see that all the unsaved people are occupied by demons. Therefore, when the Lord Jesus comes to select a person and gather that one to be His soil, the first thing He does is cast out the demon from that person. From our experience we know that when we were called by the Lord, He cast out our demons. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTWHoMyBqm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> The twelve cases recorded in the Gospel of Mark may be regarded as depicting the condition of an individual. In other words, these cases are a composite picture of a single person. In the eyes of the Lord Jesus, everyone who becomes His soil is the one portrayed by these twelve cases. Hence, the case of Peter’s mother-in-law, who was sick with a fever, indicates that, spiritually speaking, we all have a fever. Because our spiritual temperature is not normal, it is easy for us to be angry. Was this not your condition before you were saved? We all were once sick with a high fever. Furthermore, we were lepers, those unclean, contaminated, in relation to both God and man. We also were paralyzed and withered, unable to walk before God or work for Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="533" id="533">[533]</span> </p>

The person portrayed by these cases has been healed and is no longer abnormal in temperature and is no longer unclean, paralyzed, and withered. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pu9555BwdXseDKhVBdjfqYEuIg4gGqssN05hXWqG5AOWLMiJFHRYC9yb9EUElWhG0"> According to the sequence of the Gospel of Mark, after the cases that portray general healing, we have three cases that depict the healing of specific organs, namely, the hearing organ, the speaking organ, and the seeing organ. Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67610" data-verses="Mark 8:1">chapter eight</span>, the soil was collected, and the disciples were healed in a general way. However, spiritually speaking, they still could not see, hear, or speak. Therefore, the Lord began to practice the healing of specific organs, the organs of sight, hearing, and speech. </p>

The first case is that of the healing of the blind man in Bethsaida (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67611" data-verses="Mark 8:22-26">8:22-26</span>). After the Lord spit in the blind man’s eyes and laid His hands on him, He asked him, “Do you see anything?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67612" data-verses="Mark 8:23">v. 23</span>). The man replied, “I behold men; I see them as trees walking.” Then the Lord laid His hands upon his eyes, and the man “looked intently and was restored, and he saw all things clearly” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67613" data-verses="Mark 8:25">v. 25</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="vqGMTIE3QGhCC9cHhf_C5vniWTiWNFjPEqBSwVh7IondvhyT4DLuOriTCWybQmq65"> Immediately after the healing of the blind man in Bethsaida, the Lord Jesus went with His disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, “Who do men say that I am?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67614" data-verses="Mark 8:27">8:27</span>). They answered, “John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, one of the prophets” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67615" data-verses="Mark 8:28">v. 28</span>). Then the Lord questioned the disciples further: “But you, who do you say that I am?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67616" data-verses="Mark 8:29">v. 29</span>). This question indicates that the Lord was healing His disciples’ seeing organ. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl81VD6KtbDYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> The second case of the healing of blindness recorded in Mark is the case of blind Bartimaeus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67617" data-verses="Mark 10:46-52">10:46-52</span>). It is significant that this case comes immediately after the Lord’s dealing with the request of James and John to sit at His <span class="pg" data-page-id="534" id="534">[534]</span> right and left in His glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67618" data-verses="Mark 10:35-45">10:35-45</span>). The fact that they could make such a request proves that they were blind and in need of the Lord’s specific healing. The disciples needed the healing of their seeing, hearing, and speaking organs. </p>

Three times He spoke to them concerning His death and resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67620" data-verses="Mark 8:31">8:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67621" data-verses="Mark 9:30-32">9:30-32</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67622" data-verses="Mark 10:33-34">10:33-34</span>). </p>

On the mountain “there appeared to them Elijah together with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67624" data-verses="Mark 9:4">v. 4</span>). Not knowing what to say, Peter took the lead to say to the Lord Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles—one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67625" data-verses="Mark 9:5">v. 5</span>). What Peter spoke was according to the Old Testament. He did not realize that the Old Testament things had been buried with the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67626" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span>. From the human point of view, there was nothing wrong with Peter’s suggestion. Moses and Elijah were both great men. Moses represented the law, and Elijah represented the prophets. Nevertheless, from the point of view of God’s New Testament economy, Peter spoke in a nonsensical way. </p>

He should replace the old things, which were terminated and buried in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67628" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67629" data-verses="Mark 9:1">Chapter nine</span> of the Gospel of Mark indicates that Christ is the universal replacement. <span class="pg" data-page-id="535" id="535">[535]</span> </p>

Man’s culture had been in existence for over four thousand years. One aspect of this culture was the religion of the Jews, a strong, typical religion formed according to God’s holy Word. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, the devout Jews were very much attached to this religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="Tw5kh5yfAcYkacDzruU_gKgNUV6ruu2-77ynZ90oPI_Y8ohIq_JFo9fkCKfxadM44"> With this as the background, the Lord Jesus came forth in His ministry to sow Himself as a seed into God’s chosen people. Actually, the Lord Jesus lived and ministered in the center of the world’s population. Both geographically and culturally, the Jewish nation was the center of the inhabited earth. It was to that center that the Lord Jesus came to sow Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEyaoo7rVj3C9UoUVDRiVgPrq53Wy4QgbngIN5r6-6KXQx9oVpJ-ZjeYltCrUSbSm"> Have you ever realized that the Lord Jesus came to the center of the inhabited earth to sow Himself as a seed into God’s chosen people? I do not know of any Christian writings that speak of the Lord’s sowing Himself into people. If you would ask Christians what the Lord Jesus came to do, some would probably reply that He came to save sinners, or that He came to die for our salvation. Of course, the New Testament says that Jesus Christ came to save sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67649" data-verses="1Timothy 1:15">1 Tim. 1:15</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="540" id="540">[540]</span>). However, in the Gospel of Mark we see that the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67650" data-verses="Mark 1:14">1:14</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4j_PgJJGYD0ezD-70DZGP8H6hSUnerr72EQlzUT696uOp39F7ff05JtP82oh2jarF">THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="oCQ46NpLHQEU99i9c73ACVxB8keCZbl5f908KnpvgfILK-HC_Pw7iQCor1NLc9t0m"> The phrase “the gospel of God” does not simply mean that the gospel is of God in the sense of belonging to God. The main thought is that the gospel is something of God Himself. In the New Testament, expressions such as the life of God, the love of God, and the righteousness of God mean that life, love, and righteousness are actually God Himself. In the same principle, the expression “the gospel of God” indicates that the gospel is God Himself. Therefore, to preach the gospel of God actually means to preach God. </p>
<p data-content-id="33WDrLq5vJqc6qAehQjyq-aqrZ3pegql2qqvMAfJy_q51zlBmAyP1iF_xtXS0CZRj"> The gospel preached by the Lord Jesus was the gospel of the kingdom of God. What is the kingdom of God? The kingdom of God is God Himself. Then what is the gospel of the kingdom of God? We may answer this question by saying that the gospel is the kingdom, and the kingdom is God. The gospel, the kingdom, and God are not separate; on the contrary, these three are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="GoWRQTh2JAOfaAt90RQata6uFozX66HQ3Rw0vb4ArxIVsvkriGZ32FGW746MXwzF2"> It is of vital importance for us to see that the gospel, the kingdom, and God are one. The gospel is God, and God is the kingdom. Likewise, the gospel is the kingdom, and the kingdom is God. Therefore, according to the New Testament, the gospel of the kingdom of God actually refers to the very God Himself. Here we have God as the kingdom, and the kingdom as the gospel. What should we be preaching today? We should preach God as the kingdom, and the kingdom of God as the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XMC3fB5sWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv"> We should not think that besides the kingdom of God or in addition to the kingdom of God, there is something called the gospel. No, the gospel is the kingdom of God. Neither should we think that besides God there is something called the kingdom. No, the kingdom is actually God Himself. Hence, the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel of God, which is the gospel of the kingdom of God. Now we must go on to consider how the Lord Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="541" id="541">[541]</span> </p>

We should not understand any word in the Scriptures in a natural way. The problem among Christians is that, for the most part, they read the Bible according to their natural understanding. Our need is for spiritual understanding. This was the reason Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67651" data-verses="Colossians 1:9">Colossians 1:9</span> that he asked on behalf of the saints that they would be “filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.” This was also the reason Paul prayed, “that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67652" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17">Eph. 1:17</span>). Paul knew that in this Epistle spiritual mysteries would be unveiled, and he knew that he had to use human language. He was concerned that the receivers of this Epistle might understand his writing merely in a natural way according to the letters in black and white. Therefore, Paul prayed that the Father would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation. This prayer indicates strongly that we should not try to understand the Bible in letter merely according to our natural mentality. </p>
<p data-content-id="DioGnuR0sUvA-HjisOIZ8S5kDeFgdlHkYsKOva-5So8_5JX330ghXt3Lqsjs98JZo"> No doubt, since the Bible is something written, we need a proper understanding of the words written. However, the interpretation of what is written should not be according to our natural understanding. Instead, the interpretation must be according to spiritual wisdom and revelation. In particular, we need a spiritual understanding of how the Lord Jesus preached the gospel. </p>

Repent and believe in the gospel!” The Lord’s word here is brief. There is no record in this chapter of a lengthy message <span class="pg" data-page-id="542" id="542">[542]</span> given by Him. When He came to Galilee to preach the gospel, He did not say, “You all must realize that you are sinners. You became fallen in Adam. Now you need to repent and believe in Me as the One who has come to die for your sins. If you do not repent and believe, you will go to hell.” In Mark there is not such a message given by the Lord. </p>

The central thought is that the Lord is the Sower sowing Himself into us as a seed. He opened His preaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67660" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span> with these words: “Behold, the sower went out to sow.” Later, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67661" data-verses="Mark 4:26">4:26</span>, He said, “So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth.” Here we have the Lord as the Sower sowing Himself as the seed into God’s chosen people. </p>
<p data-content-id="tEKnxZ_VjGZ3GrT_oQbLpL5EraJfzZSdZDU358XZfZuSzz-xAfRzRAeDTjLq3AWTV"> Some may question why we say that the Lord Jesus came to sow Himself into people. They may wonder why we do not say that Jesus came to preach the gospel. The reason we emphasize the Lord’s sowing is that the proper understanding of preaching the gospel has been spoiled. Yes, the New Testament says that the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel. However, He did not preach the gospel according to our understanding of the way the gospel is preached. On the contrary, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67662" data-verses="Mark 4:1">Mark 4</span> we see that the Lord preached the gospel by sowing Himself as a seed into people. </p>
<p data-content-id="hx_zzSpG4rVvnFzTW2P6iVo79ejIThvBxQ7OaGa7mOy9TYjUhbSqG4WclLusd8YDB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67663" data-verses="Mark 1:1">Mark 1</span> we are told that the Lord Jesus came to Galilee preaching the gospel of God.

We should not understand either the gospel itself or the <span class="pg" data-page-id="543" id="543">[543]</span> preaching of the gospel in a natural way. Concerning this, many Christians are covered by a thick veil of tradition. They take for granted that they know what it means, according to the New Testament, to preach the gospel. As we have seen, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67664" data-verses="Mark 4:1">chapter four</span> of Mark reveals that to preach the gospel is to sow the seed. As we have pointed out in previous messages, the seed sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67665" data-verses="Mark 4:1">Mark 4</span> is the seed of the kingdom. </p>

We saw that in His baptism He terminated the things of religion and culture. Then in His ministry He sowed Himself as the seed of the kingdom into God’s chosen people. This seed develops into the kingdom of God. On the one hand, the kingdom of God is for the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose; on the other hand, the kingdom of God is for our enjoyment. Let us now go on to see how God’s chosen people are the “soil” into which Christ as the seed of the kingdom is sown to develop into the kingdom of God. </p>

However, God’s people have become fallen. According to the picture portrayed by the cases recorded in Mark, they were sick, contaminated, paralyzed, withered, corrupt, deaf, dumb, blind, and even spiritually dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="CsKQsAdVLBFmIiLkuzV26Yz1G4lRTD0qYoIoSzKeEobPK4EoMU0-9QbeDZT2q9uhm"> God’s people had been destined by Him to be the soil in which Christ would be sown as a seed and in which He would grow for the development of the kingdom of God. But this “soil” became sick, contaminated, paralyzed, and withered. The soil was corrupt, blind, deaf, dumb, and even demon-possessed. Before we were saved, we all were this kind of soil. <span class="pg" data-page-id="548" id="548">[548]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67690" data-verses="Mark 1:14-15">1:14 and 15</span> we are told that Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent and believe in the gospel!” Immediately after this we have the record of the Lord’s calling four of His disciples: Simon, Andrew, James, and John (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67691" data-verses="Mark 1:16-20">1:16-20</span>). In the foregoing message we pointed out that the Lord preached the gospel by sowing Himself as the seed into people. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67692" data-verses="Mark 1:16-20">1:16-20</span> we see four of those whom the Lord gathered to be the soil into which He sowed Himself as the seed of the kingdom. </p>

Immediately, they left their nets and followed Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67696" data-verses="Mark 1:18">v. 18</span>). Going on a little further, the Lord Jesus saw James and John in a boat mending the nets. He called them, and “leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went after Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67697" data-verses="Mark 1:20">v. 20</span>). Here we see that these four disciples left their nets, their boat, their father, and even the sea. They left everything to follow Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="2biGa_BPHwBMmqGIu-XaCdS4wtrRfcU4sHxDfRZzyMIzlPqgeTUisrY2QHdBIBzZK"> When I read the Gospels as a youth, I wondered what it meant to follow Jesus. I was very impressed with the Lord’s words, “Follow Me.” Later I was taught that to follow Jesus meant to do whatever Jesus did. For example, Jesus loved people, and we also should love others. Jesus was gentle and kind, and we also should be gentle and kind. At first I agreed with this understanding of the meaning of following the Lord Jesus. But eventually I discovered that to follow Jesus in this way can be compared to teaching a monkey to act like a man. A monkey may be trained to sit, stand, and walk like a man. However, this is nothing more than mere imitation. Nevertheless, many Christians try to follow <span class="pg" data-page-id="549" id="549">[549]</span> Christ in the way of imitating Him. This understanding of following Jesus is mistaken, and we should repudiate it. But we are still left with the question concerning what it means to follow the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="uamxl0odSMwfSIWjiRFAsdwo-fcQoDK5WNy2WFyi0oYKbOAd76mwgMMv-zAcUryim"> We have emphasized the fact that when the Lord Jesus called the disciples, He gathered them to be the soil into which He would sow Himself as the seed. Therefore, we may say that to follow Jesus is to be put in His “pocket” for the purpose of His sowing Himself into us. </p>

<p data-content-id="Hfo6mxQWhV9UNGGl0UrbWJzqFlUtfJf1FVddN1W7drZ0yu-2uolKPKUU_XXH9aAsf"> We have seen that in Mark the Lord Jesus gathered the soil and put it into His pocket in order to sow Himself into it. But according to the cases recorded in the Gospel of Mark, this soil was in a pitiful condition. How could the Lord use soil that is sick, contaminated, and corrupt? Some may think that He should cast such useless soil away. But the Lord cannot cast away those who were chosen by God and predestinated before the foundation of the world. In a very real sense, the Lord Jesus did not have a choice. The disciples had been marked out, predestinated. How could He reject them? The Father had chosen them before the foundation of the world, and the Lord had come to do the will of God the Father. Therefore, He could not cast aside the disciples, even though as soil they were in such a pitiful condition. What, then, could the Lord do about the soil? As the Gospel of Mark indicates, it was necessary for Him to heal this soil and turn it into good soil. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudO84hKeSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37">Through Death and Resurrection</h2><p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-Rt5vqDpYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> We have seen that, according to the Gospel of Mark, the soil was in a pitiful condition. How could it be healed? The proper way to heal the soil is for it to pass through a process of death and resurrection. In principle, this is the way healing takes place in our physical bodies. We thank the Lord that in His creation of man’s body He ordained such a principle. Otherwise, once a person became ill, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="550" id="550">[550]</span> would not be able to recover. However, in our bodies there is the principle of death and resurrection, the principle of the dying out of what is old and the rising up of something new. Diseases are healed in man’s body through this basic life principle in which old things die out and new things are produced. </p>
<p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1Jawno4xH-0dVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> If we understand this principle, we shall see how the Lord Jesus heals the soil into which He sows Himself as the seed of the kingdom. The human soil that had been chosen by God became contaminated and useless. But because God the Father had chosen this soil, the Lord Jesus could not cast it away. This soil had even been predestinated, marked out, by the Father. The Lord must have some way to heal this soil. </p>
<p data-content-id="zbCxXV8yEF3E20ghZSKym1NKDAYoqh_2u6LkS3jfEW09yxoZ1BBUaNJDdc2JggHVC"> As we have seen, to follow the Lord Jesus is to be put in His “pocket.” But how does the Lord heal the soil that is in His pocket? He heals the soil by bringing it to the cross and causing it to die out and then bringing it into resurrection. In the Lord’s death we died out; that is, in His death we were made dead. Then in His resurrection we were resurrected. Therefore, we died in the Lord’s death and rose in His resurrection. In this way the soil is healed. </p>
<p data-content-id="aPPE8EO5juyBuYTJa0y_1XKJdLKjIntIp8ifOM4uOyRhu13IFc5IBOT4bXs6YIjS1"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67698" data-verses="Mark 1:1">chapter one</span> of Mark, the Lord Jesus called Peter, Andrew, James, and John, and they began to follow Him. Actually, they followed the Lord blindly, not knowing where they were going or what they were doing. The fact that Peter made many blunders indicates that he did not know what was happening. The Lord Jesus, however, knew what He intended to do with the disciples. </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQurQBut75Si2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> After gathering the disciples as the soil, the Lord presented Himself to them as a pattern. For more than three years, Peter and the other disciples observed what the Lord said and did. Eventually, the Lord Jesus brought the disciples, and all those chosen by God, to the cross. After He brought them through death and resurrection, they were healed. This is the reason we say that in Christ’s death and resurrection His followers, as the soil chosen by God, were healed. All the healings in the Gospel of Mark are signs <span class="pg" data-page-id="551" id="551">[551]</span> pointing to this real healing, the healing that takes place through Christ’s death and resurrection. </p>

They were no longer sick with a fever, contaminated, paralyzed, withered, blind, deaf, or dumb. They all had been healed through the Lord’s death and resurrection. </p>

We saw that through this healing the one hundred twenty became the good ground for the Lord’s sowing. However, we saw that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67716" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67717" data-verses="Acts 21:1">21</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67718" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span> there are strong indications that the “weeds” of things that replace Christ had begun to grow again. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjvCPrIhrNudFjA7Ea43AYWdPQIftb3PxeyoJA7lV8LZU1cG_8XpCTB8EQ9irp2I_"> We concluded the last message with a word concerning the kingdom of God. We pointed out that, according to the New Testament, the kingdom of God is a Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, sown into us in order to be developed. In His ministry, the Lord came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into God’s chosen people so that this seed might develop into God’s kingdom. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67720" data-verses="Mark 9:1">9:1</span> the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I tell you, there are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God come in power.” This verse is immediately followed by the record of the Lord’s transfiguration on the mount. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67721" data-verses="Mark 9:2-3">Verses 2 and 3</span> go on <span class="pg" data-page-id="556" id="556">[556]</span> to say, “And after six days Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John, and brings them up into a high mountain by themselves alone.

<p data-content-id="S39wAUT6U7VYi81DdIbDHSfI3CR4zzLdRsFzm-npixk8PeKbp-gIbGMGyLxvTddhZ"> When we put these verses together, we see that the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus was the coming of the kingdom. This proves that the kingdom is not a material realm. Rather, these verses indicate that the kingdom is a Person transfigured. When the Lord Jesus was transfigured, that was the coming of the kingdom. What, then, is the kingdom of God? The kingdom of God is the Lord Jesus Himself transfigured. </p>

<p data-content-id="5lu_Erx4sP2unFd4ZjdQZjVcuelZOcQJaX83TB9ApY4vVEVo17MHelamYeuyxNhAF"> We need to consider this understanding of the kingdom as the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus in the light of our experience. When you believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him, you received a Jesus who was not transfigured. Just as the seed received by the soil is a seed that has not yet been transfigured, so in our experience the Christ we received was a Christ not transfigured. The transfiguration of a seed requires the growth of that seed into a mature plant and the blossoming of that plant. Therefore, we may say that the transfiguration of a seed requires growth and blossoming. In a similar way, the Lord Jesus we received needs to grow in us until He blossoms from within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="NLlYLMAY-CYoyc1GX6W6m3eMeDKsQ_qfPNY0JdtAJNcsfC7wsatDPhfF0D7qinWfO"> We are the soil, and the Lord Jesus is the seed of the kingdom. When we received Him into us, we received Him as the One who had not yet been transfigured in our experience. Have you received the Lord Jesus, and is He now in you? We all can testify strongly that we have received the Lord and that He is in us. But has the Lord been transfigured in you? If the Lord who is in you has not yet been transfigured, others will not be able to see the kingdom of God in you. Since we have not yet experienced this kind of transfiguration, we need the Lord to grow in us until He <span class="pg" data-page-id="557" id="557">[557]</span> blossoms. That blossoming will be the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus in us in a practical way. Such a transfiguration is the kingdom of God. </p>

Later, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67724" data-verses="Mark 9:1">9:1</span>, the Lord told His disciples that some standing there would not taste death until they saw the kingdom of God come in power. Immediately after speaking this word concerning the kingdom, the Lord Jesus was transfigured on the mountaintop before Peter, James, and John. His transfiguration was the coming of the kingdom of God in power. This is a strong indication that the kingdom of God is actually the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus. </p>

The reason is that among these Christians there is the lack of the transfiguration of Christ. The Christ who lives in so many believers is still a seed; He has not yet been transfigured. This may also be our situation. Yes, we have the Lord Jesus living within us, but we may not have given Him the opportunity to be transfigured in us. Therefore, with us there may be only the seed of the kingdom, but not the appearing of the kingdom. </p>

In order to accomplish His plan, He was incarnated, becoming a man named Jesus. When this man came out to preach, He began to sow Himself into God’s chosen people. However, as the soil for the Lord’s sowing, His chosen people had become fallen, damaged, and corrupt. Therefore, the Lord Jesus brought this soil to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="559" id="559">[559]</span> cross and crucified it. Then He brought God’s chosen people as the soil with Him into His resurrection. Through His death and resurrection, the Lord not only healed the soil, but also became the replacement for God’s people. By replacing them with Himself, He made them His reproduction; that is, He made them the same as He. </p>
<p data-content-id="LdG0WOa0m4IcaA98tRxBFlY0xjqa27rOJd-_g4X5tauQBTM7XzVMTmZYJthwdxRvB"> When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a life of God for the kingdom of God. He did not live a life of culture, religion, or ethics. Now His followers should live the same kind of life. This means that His followers should live a life of God for the development of God’s kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TB6Ws4Zcc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl"> It is crucial for us to see that as God’s people, as those who have been replaced by Christ and with Christ, we need to live a life that is absolutely of God. We should not live a life that is of something other than the Triune God. </p>

This One is both the Sower and the seed. He sowed Himself as the seed into His disciples. The Lord gathered the disciples, the chosen ones of God, as His “soil” in which He sowed Himself so that He might grow in them and that they might grow Him. The Lord also brought His disciples with Him to the cross and terminated them. After this, He brought them into His resurrection. Having seen all this in the foregoing messages, let us now go on to see how the disciples are the continuation of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6wx89y9aiYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx"> The Gospel of Mark ends with the Lord’s ascension. What is the Lord Jesus doing now that He has resurrected and ascended? In order to find out what the Lord is doing after His ascension, we need the book of Acts. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67767" data-verses="Acts 1:8">verse 8</span> He went on to say, “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.” Here we see that <span class="pg" data-page-id="566" id="566">[566]</span> the baptism in the Holy Spirit is a matter of the Spirit descending upon the disciples. </p>
<p data-content-id="XOGa8foX7gJHxJudO8YhKcSZII_U89GPAmdxMK10GVSVVnqvhr6iVJ0HB-7B7Su37"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67768" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> the Lord talks about the disciples experiencing the Holy Spirit coming upon them. But had the disciples not received the Holy Spirit already? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67769" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, in the evening of His resurrection day, the Lord appeared to His disciples, breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67770" data-verses="John 20:22">v. 22</span>). In this verse the Holy Spirit is likened to breath. Breath is something inward, something related to the life within us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67771" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>, therefore, the disciples received the Holy Spirit as breath for life. </p>
<p data-content-id="ktkHnsXQevHe98t-RtZvqBpYhc-rTCw8Ge713mqSaoz-iPDwDuuS72YEVSBiu89rQ"> Forty days after His resurrection, the Lord commanded the disciples to remain in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit to descend upon them. That descending of the Spirit upon the disciples was for power, not for life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67772" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> we have the Spirit inwardly for life; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67773" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> we have the Spirit outwardly for power, for baptism. When a person is baptized, he does not drink the water; instead, he is immersed in the water. In a similar way, the baptism in the Holy Spirit is a matter of the Spirit coming upon us outwardly so that we may have power. </p>
<p data-content-id="J7mvuBWEFzOt1JawnoYxE-UdVrLsGa2I73QrWz5V6wMAodR1mDJ9FNCVV4tG3ol2-"> The Lord’s word to the disciples concerning the Holy Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67774" data-verses="Acts 1:1">chapter one</span> of Acts was fulfilled in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67775" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapter two</span>. On the day of Pentecost “suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind,” and it filled the house where the disciples were sitting. Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67776" data-verses="Acts 2:1-4">Acts 2:1-4</span>). On the day of the Lord’s resurrection the disciples received the Holy Spirit as breath for life. Then fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples as a rushing mighty wind. We can easily see the difference between breath and wind. Breath is for life, and wind is for power. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67777" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67778" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> we have two symbols of the Holy Spirit: the breath for life inwardly and the wind for power outwardly. </p>

First, the Lord was conceived of the Holy Spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="567" id="567">[567]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67779" data-verses="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67780" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matt. 1:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67781" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">20</span>). Then at the age of thirty, when He came forth to minister, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and He was baptized in the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67782" data-verses="Luke 3:21-22">Luke 3:21-22</span>). The Lord’s being conceived of the Spirit was a matter of the Spirit essentially, but His being baptized in the Holy Spirit was a matter of the Spirit descending upon Him economically. Hence, the Holy Spirit for the Lord’s conception was essential, whereas the Holy Spirit for His ministry was economical. </p>
<p data-content-id="bzOoBm9jEPwhdeQurQhuu6ZSi2XY9yWS-dKSIpis4NBosgN3d0OFLz3TdD6GeX6Xr"> Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit essentially, the Spirit became the essence of His being. The Lord had the divine essence of the conceiving Holy Spirit. He also received the human essence from the virgin Mary. Because He was conceived of the divine essence and born with the human essence, He was born a God-man. This means that for His being as the God-man He had two essences—the divine essence and the human essence. Therefore, the Lord was both God and man, the complete God and a perfect man. This is a matter of His being, His existence. </p>
<p data-content-id="qnPeSV6CJ7wZYlnNGtPvFQk0KpvV_XIUjL7WVYuiQazG-p-PxTIKH4519ec9AyaaW"> For thirty years the Lord Jesus lived on earth as the God-man. At the age of thirty He began to minister. For His ministry He needed the Spirit of God to descend upon Him not essentially but economically. This descending of the Spirit upon the Lord Jesus was for God’s economy; it was not for the Lord’s existence. For His existence He needed the Holy Spirit essentially to be His divine essence. But for the carrying out of God’s economy, He needed the Holy Spirit to descend on Him economically. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="yTTP4jUlI-gy5K6wx89y7JyYLecrcDyIOgv4Nt2mU9ec72fLgZ2S1AbCIK3z7lNjx">In the Experience of the Disciples</h2><p data-content-id="8Bt1NeXScU8VUSocerXGHvKNscH6KGbNU4wVmiaM6kx6BOwzVNNgCL_mV6ksT8x0A"> The disciples also received the Holy Spirit both essentially and economically. They received the Spirit essentially in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67783" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>. The receiving of the essential Spirit was for their spiritual existence, their spiritual being. When the disciples received the Holy Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67784" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, they received the divine essence. After receiving the Spirit in this aspect for their spiritual existence, it was still necessary for them to <span class="pg" data-page-id="568" id="568">[568]</span> receive the Spirit economically so that they could carry out God’s economy as the continuation of the Lord Jesus. The disciples had to carry out God’s economy in the same way the Lord Jesus carried it out. Since the Lord carried out God’s economy by the economical Spirit, the disciples had to carry out God’s economy by the economical Spirit. Therefore, after receiving the Spirit essentially, the disciples needed to receive the Spirit economically. They received the economical Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67785" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapter two</span> of Acts. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Q7OhFMbvJkSGu8deo-UKrxkJJqNIIk1nCtkGCjv2P7UiTfIqiM8F9pFiiumdXaHn"> We have emphasized that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67786" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span> the disciples received the Holy Spirit essentially for their spiritual being and existence. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67787" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> we see the disciples living in this spiritual being. Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67788" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, that is, before the Lord’s death and resurrection, the disciples had not been made alive in their spiritual being for their spiritual existence. Instead, they had a fallen natural, fleshly being. Even after the Lord had revealed to them His death and resurrection the third time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67789" data-verses="Mark 10:32-34">Mark 10:32-34</span>), the disciples were still disputing concerning who was greater (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67790" data-verses="Mark 10:35-45">Mark 10:35-45</span>). In addition, Peter certainly was in his natural being when he denied the Lord. But after Christ’s death and resurrection, the disciples received the essential Spirit as the source of their spiritual being. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67791" data-verses="Acts 1:1">chapter one</span> of Acts, although the disciples had not yet received the Holy Spirit descending upon them economically, they had experienced the Spirit essentially for their spiritual existence. Therefore, in their being they became spiritual. </p>
<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6setj1iENHl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> The disciples had the essential Spirit for their spiritual being, but they still needed the Holy Spirit to descend upon them economically. This took place on the day of Pentecost. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67792" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> the Spirit was fully consummated for the experience of the believers. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_JljcFND_zfBz2T-Ca42-YPWEZupdpm8qToPklkDk67DhjRV4Y8WysIGm1jNgmqpD">In Our Experience Today</h2><p data-content-id="BMhoD_2Uu2K1HJfaWGKNHyDU2em_VcIv1BPa_b-hF8imMdXsyi9ZG1Yv1ht8ZLqBu"> When did you receive the Holy Spirit essentially and economically? Some may say that they received the Holy Spirit essentially when they were regenerated and economically at a time after their regeneration. According to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="569" id="569">[569]</span> biblical way of understanding this matter, we received the Holy Spirit essentially and economically more than nineteen hundred years ago. We all received the Holy Spirit essentially in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67793" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>. Then the Jewish believers in Christ received the Holy Spirit economically in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67794" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>, and the Gentile believers received the Spirit economically in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67795" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="x_28QRIEx_QEVv2QGDl53aRyr4pMEn6BzVqtxhXbcWWPnmmwmZTiLYUERlIAdQHeo"> We may use purchasing a house as an illustration of receiving the Holy Spirit. Suppose a certain brother buys a house before he is married. Later he gets married and has children. When did this brother’s wife and children buy the house? The correct answer is that they bought it when he bought it. The principle is the same with our receiving the Holy Spirit. When did we receive the Holy Spirit? We received the Spirit when the disciples as our representatives received the Spirit. </p>

And when they had come down to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.” The interchangeable use <span class="pg" data-page-id="574" id="574">[574]</span> of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit in the preceding verse reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament. The Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God. This expression refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God, but also the human element of Jesus, and the element of His human living and His suffering of death as well. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67841" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> Paul says, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.” Adam became a living soul through creation with a soulish body. Christ became a life-giving Spirit through resurrection with a spiritual body. Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected. First, in incarnation, Christ became flesh for redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67842" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67843" data-verses="John 1:29">29</span>). Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67844" data-verses="John 10:10">John 10:10</span>). As the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, He is ready to be received by those who believe in Him. When we believe in Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit. Hence, we become one spirit with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67845" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). </p>

If you were to tell them that Christ is the Spirit today, they would say, “This teaching is against the doctrine of the Trinity and is heretical. To say that Christ is the Spirit is to confuse the three Persons of the Trinity.” We, however, do not follow the traditional doctrine of the Trinity. Instead, we follow the Word of God. God’s Word says clearly that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="575" id="575">[575]</span> </p>

According to the context, the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67848" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span> refers to Christ the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67849" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:12">2 Cor. 2:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67850" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:14-15">14-15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67851" data-verses="2Corinthians 2:17">17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67852" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:3-4">3:3-4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67853" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:14">14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67854" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:16">16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67855" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:5">4:5</span>).

The same is true in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67858" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span>, where the Spirit of the Lord refers to the Lord as the Spirit.

The expression “the Lord Spirit” again proves that the Lord Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord Christ. Because the Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord, He is called the Lord Spirit. This is the pneumatic Christ. </p>

To be sure, the last Adam is Jesus, the very Jesus presented in the Gospel of Mark. Paul says that this last Adam has become a life-giving Spirit.

Therefore, we may say that the life-giving Spirit is <span class="pg" data-page-id="576" id="576">[576]</span> the blossoming of the Lord as the seed that passed through death and resurrection. Let us use a carnation seed as an illustration. Both the seed and the blossom are a carnation. The difference is that the seed is the carnation in seed form, whereas the blossom is the carnation in blossom form. In a similar way, we may say that the seed in Mark is Jesus, and the “blossom” in Acts is the Spirit of Jesus. </p>

The Spirit of God, who is now the Spirit of Jesus and even the Spirit of Jesus Christ, is both essential and economical. The essential Spirit is for our spiritual being, and the economical Spirit is for our work. As believers, we have a spiritual being, a spiritual person, and this is of the essential Spirit.

<p data-content-id="72S-lt-BcIgIv6setgViHNnl0RTBb5FY-yp-Aw6VQXJHGY0J06Y03FeRT64nqf5RC"> Many Christians would arrange the twenty-seven books of the New Testament into three sections: the books of history—the four Gospels and the book of Acts; the Epistles, from Romans through Jude; and the book of Revelation. However, recently, through the Life-study of Mark, we saw that there is another way to divide the New Testament into sections. This way of dividing the books of the New Testament is related to the living Person of the Lord Jesus, because the entire New Testament is concerned with this living Person, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. According to this way of arranging the New Testament into sections, we also have three sections: the four Gospels, the book of Acts through the Epistle of Jude, and the book of Revelation. </p>

When the Son came, He did not come alone; rather, He came with the Father. The Gospel of John in particular tells us that when the Son came to earth, He came with the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67896" data-verses="John 8:29">John 8:29</span>). This was the reason that the Son said that He was not alone, for the Father was always with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67897" data-verses="John 16:32">John 16:32</span>). The <span class="pg" data-page-id="583" id="583">[583]</span> Son even said that He was in the Father and that the Father was in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67898" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span>). This is a matter not only of the coexistence of the Father and the Son, but of the coinherence of the Father and the Son. </p>

He was conceived and born of the Spirit essentially. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67899" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matthew 1:18</span> says that Mary was “with child of the Holy Spirit.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67900" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">Matthew 1:20</span> goes on to record the word of the angel of the Lord to Joseph: “Fear not to take Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67901" data-verses="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</span> the angel said to Mary, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; wherefore also the holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God.” At the age of thirty, the Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus economically, and He was anointed with the Spirit for His ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67902" data-verses="Luke 3:21-23">Luke 3:21-23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="QAgZQNlSJnYms2qPY3DRSLlXmiC6-p3nVZ9eWe4mASv1i8jbKF0yj585u6YPEaLJF"> The Lord Jesus was conceived of the Spirit and born of the Spirit essentially. For this reason, He had the divine essence, which He received from the Holy Spirit, and the human essence, which He received from the virgin Mary. Hence, He was born the God-man, the One who was the complete God and a perfect man. When at the age of thirty He came forth to minister, the Spirit of God descended upon Him not essentially but economically. Therefore, as the Lord Jesus was ministering on earth, He lived by the essential Spirit and ministered by the economical Spirit. This is the reason we say that in the Gospels the Son came by the Spirit. He came by the Spirit who is both the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit. </p>

No, the Son came with the Father, and He came by the Spirit. Actually, in Jesus Christ, the Son, we have the embodiment of the Triune God.

<p data-content-id="GoWRQTh2JAOfaAt90SAaubauFozX66HQ3Rw0vb4ArxIVsvkriGZ32FGW746MXwzF2"> According to the revelation in the four Gospels, the issue of the living of this wonderful One is the kingdom of God. Because the kingdom of God is the development of the life of God, the Lord Jesus preached not only the gospel of God but also the gospel of the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67909" data-verses="Mark 1:14">Mark 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67910" data-verses="Luke 4:43">Luke 4:43</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67911" data-verses="Luke 8:1">8:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="czZrHUs5SUQOmH6XMBnfC5MWDApg6EgkjKJoQnB0vsjZLHipEw_HNPEUxtY92PhIv"> I hope that we all shall be able to comprehend this brief outline of the four Gospels. In the Gospels we see that the Son came with the Father and by the Spirit to be the embodiment of the Triune God in Jesus Christ. This One, <span class="pg" data-page-id="585" id="585">[585]</span> the embodiment of the Triune God, is God’s tabernacle and God’s temple as His dwelling place. This One lived a life of God, a life that developed into the kingdom of God. </p>

These books are also the revelation of a Person. Here we have the Spirit as the Son with the Father to be the consummation of the Triune God in the church. </p>

According to this chart, the entire New Testament may be divided into three sections: the four Gospels as the initiation, Acts through Jude as the development, and the book of Revelation as the finalization. In the first section we see the Son with the Father and by the Spirit to be the embodiment of the Triune God in Jesus Christ as God’s tabernacle and God’s temple, living the life of God to develop into the kingdom of God. In the second section we see the Spirit as the Son with the Father to be the consummation of the Triune God in the church as the Body of Christ, the temple of God, the kingdom of God, and house of God, living Christ unto the fullness of God. In the third section we have the seven Spirits out from the eternal One and of the Redeemer to be the intensification of the Triune God in the overcoming church, consummating in the golden lampstands and the New Jerusalem. In this message, the last message in this Life-study of Mark, let us consider the intensification of the Triune God consummating in the golden lampstands and the New Jerusalem. <span class="pg" data-page-id="592" id="592">[592]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="isH1YhKLP27GpYb1m-UHzS3jpPE3d1Q-bGo8ZH-xoo3romA6yrPL5uOuCKtIgHwLz"> According to the record of the Gospel of Mark, the disciples followed the Lord Jesus in the way of being brought into Him. They were carried on by the Lord, the all-inclusive One, wherever He went. Hence, He brought the disciples into Himself. He brought them into His all-inclusive death, the death that terminated all the old things, and also into His all-inclusive resurrection, in which they were germinated to be His reproduction and continuation. In the book of Acts we can see that the disciples participated in Christ and enjoyed Him through His all-inclusive death and resurrection. Furthermore, through the disciples the church came into existence. The twenty-one Epistles from Romans through Jude are needed to define what is presented in summary in the book of Acts. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1YZgJVvfR7nEdPygliHBO9bFC4vhwTC01Dl5_a_Qjw4LWip4gb95cZHsWchz2v1DI">THE GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS</h2><p data-content-id="60v3pLp8xfImJZ6UcRprfZQaVUm3en4LrAvuErhmckPesmhJpP2tyZ58lMY08uxOK"> After the detailed definition in the Epistles, we have the consummation of God’s New Testament economy in the book of Revelation. In this consummation the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God, play a major role. Through, by, and with the intensified Spirit the church becomes a pure golden lampstand. This is a great matter. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ROWdW9yIzUu9-fCxZOWQoX74uaq3v8oXLqu1uo7LoQS_CDsSxaBom-gpVLQMKg2Pr">A Symbol of the Triune God</h2><p data-content-id="shARd-wuigWh-LpxJZ5r52MS2a0UvLuYNTULrtvzcAvRG_UkZKylBHrPoqtphdzuZ"> The golden lampstand is a symbol of the Triune God. The gold of the lampstand signifies the divine nature, the nature of God the Father. The shape or form of the lampstand signifies the Son of God as the embodiment of the Father. The seven lamps of the lampstand signify the Spirit of God as the expression. Therefore, in the lampstand we see God the Father as the nature, God the Son as the form, and God the Spirit as the expression. </p>

But how can a church full of saved sinners be a lampstand of pure gold? Yes, we all are saved, but we are still too natural, too much in the flesh, the self, <span class="pg" data-page-id="593" id="593">[593]</span> and the old creation. How can people such as we become a golden lampstand? </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mJ_VGw8A9-qsmj2TA72s6Ycc8XlHw8XV41zUFcmTgmfOFgYozvHRlq70yUGVrUGAl">A Word of Encouragement</h2><p data-content-id="ZvRGpqh2vkgHSLuPEAInvNyBWa3tpbofJWTuYXJ5GYkHfqzypy5E37CKkzH1V2NAs"> Some saints have told me that they are discouraged and even disappointed with the condition of the church. Some have said, “Years ago the situation was hopeful, but now the condition of the church is disappointing.” If you feel this way, it is an indication that you do not see the sevenfold intensified Spirit. The New Testament does not end in disappointment. On the contrary, the New Testament consummates with a full hope, with the seven Spirits transforming a seemingly hopeless church into a pure golden lampstand. </p>
<p data-content-id="AGXqOlbykdq3lOkTXHYMyAqm9hsVZG-2G0ATxH8VFNL51Lb4nAh-suHr-jR3U139t"> In 1961 I wrote a number of hymns on the church and the New Jerusalem. I was especially happy to sing the hymns on the overcoming church. One day a brother said to me, “Do you mean that we can have the New Jerusalem today?” I replied, “Brother, I do not say that we can have the New Jerusalem today. But according to the book of Revelation, the churches in this age should be a miniature of the New Jerusalem.” I went on to tell him that I definitely believe that the church can be a miniature of the New Jerusalem. I hope that you all will believe the same thing. The New Testament ends with a word of encouragement. Praise the Lord for the sevenfold intensified Spirit in the overcoming church, consummating in the golden lampstands! </p>

Do you prefer to stay with the Spirit in the book of Acts, or do you prefer the seven Spirits in the book of Revelation? Where are you today, in Acts or in Revelation? We all should be able to testify that we are in the book of Revelation. Since we are in the book of Revelation, all the churches should realize that now is not a time of discouragement or disappointment. Rather, today is a day of intensification, a day full of hope and encouragement. </p>

The condition of the church is not our salvation. Instead, the church’s condition may be a discouragement to us.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67961" data-verses="Revelation 1:4">1:4</span> we read of the seven Spirits who are before the throne of God. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67962" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">chapters two and three</span> the Spirit is stressed repeatedly. Seven times the following word is spoken: “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="67963" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">2:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67964" data-verses="Revelation 2:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67965" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67966" data-verses="Revelation 2:29">29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67967" data-verses="Revelation 3:6">3:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67968" data-verses="Revelation 3:13">13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67969" data-verses="Revelation 3:22">22</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67970" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">Revelation 4:5</span> says, “And seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67971" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">Revelation 5:6</span> speaks of a “Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.” Here we see that the Spirit is intensified to be the seven Spirits who are the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Redeemer. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67972" data-verses="Revelation 14:13">Revelation 14:13</span> we have this word: “Yes, says the Spirit.” Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="67973" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">22:17</span> the Spirit and the bride are mentioned together: “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!” Here we see that at the <span class="pg" data-page-id="595" id="595">[595]</span> very end of the book of Revelation, the bride, which is the church, becomes one with the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="WBnd51ae7mS3Zwl80Vz6KsbDYBFGzEDdZQDPI_Aurih4pQ4WFWPoWKrQpE25boPp8"> In the book of Revelation the titles “the Spirit of God” and “the Holy Spirit” are not used. Instead, we have the Spirit and the seven Spirits. We need to appreciate the seven Spirits. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is able to transform a hopeless church into a lampstand of pure gold. </p>
<p data-content-id="2biGa_BPHwBMmqGIv_HaBcy4wtrRfcU4sHxDfRZzyMIzlPqgeTUisrY2QHdBIBzZK"> Concerning the church, we should not be discouraged or disappointed. Let us be encouraged with the golden lampstand and the New Jerusalem. The Bible ends with strong encouragement. Look at the golden lampstands shining in this dark age, shining in this perverted generation. In eternity the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the intensification of the Triune God. This surely indicates that our God cannot be defeated by Satan. Even today God is not defeated, His church is not defeated, and we are not defeated. However, if you think you are defeated, you will be defeated. Instead of thinking like this, we should say, “Hallelujah, in Christ I am not defeated! Through the sevenfold intensified Spirit, I shall never be defeated!” </p>
