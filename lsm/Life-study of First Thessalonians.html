Thessalonica was a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia. After the Macedonian call, which Paul received on his second journey of ministry, he and his co-worker Silvanus visited first Philippi and then Thessalonica (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93714" data-verses="Acts 16:9-12">Acts 16:9-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93715" data-verses="Acts 17:1-4">17:1-4</span>). The apostle stayed and worked there for only a short time, probably less than one month (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93716" data-verses="Acts 17:2">Acts 17:2</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wlGQFARrTrj_EDLb1Z5NJFsBCV39AzrRFKxb5piBPg1lcHFyW_sieswfArCE66mXm">WRITTEN TO NEW BELIEVERS</h2><p data-content-id="LPYR-Rf_6uFcNnPhzwX_Lnd5SjvP79sa03VUdkYrIXE4rNinniEkq_ZS-2ehIt9XO"> The two Epistles to the Thessalonians were written in the early days, while Paul was still on his second journey of ministry. In the course of this journey, Paul stayed in Thessalonica for less than a month. According to Acts, Paul worked there for three Sabbaths, for about three weeks, not long after his visit to Philippi. The Epistle to the Philippians, a wonderful book, was written much later, during Paul’s imprisonment. </p>
<p data-content-id="mtikvaKTaj-1XMvs8wpwa1Oma0heVqReLgo8FpcsCjc2daQbfu4sMgo80mpCCHIbe"> No doubt, when Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, the church in Thessalonica was still very young. I doubt that the believers there had been in the church life for even a full year when these two Epistles were written. Thus, in 1 and 2 Thessalonians we see certain points that are not covered in Paul’s other Epistles. Because the church in Thessalonica was so young, Paul’s Epistles to the Thessalonians are more or less to those in a childhood stage. Some of what Paul says to the Thessalonians is different from what he says to other <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> churches that were more experienced. It is worthwhile for us to study 1 and 2 Thessalonians in order to know the situation and condition of a young church. By reading these two books we can know the young Christian life and the young church life. If we keep in mind this aspect of the background, we shall be helped in our reading of these Epistles. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuckyEAbPF6VFdsnFbUF-tBPLZIVPWdjTLoxrM4Q7PMmqdNkVSwlWS9383SPgzgIH"> The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians were not written to experienced Christians. They were written to young believers, to those who had been saved for less than a year. Most of them had been typical Gentiles. Therefore, in writing to them, Paul surely viewed them as young believers. These Epistles are very precious, for they render us particular help concerning the young Christian life and church life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RoDIchE9_Iy0jaepjOKGXQjPSYEYGyxjE73qIxz9fOqbO3oRIuXM4GqsmQt1FITKE">THE ORGANIC UNION</h2><p data-content-id="sxDbeBfxVsm3l4Hj5KloIsHIPS5yFuh-xvJH-4afaeZNshQy_rbupcQFuR1kJCcVN"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93717" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">First Thessalonians 1:1</span> says, “Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.” This Epistle and the second were both addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, composed of all the believers in Christ in that city. Such a local church is of the believers and is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that such a local church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is united with the Lord Jesus Christ organically in all He is and has done. Hence, it is of men (such as the Thessalonians), yet in God and in the Lord organically. Such an organic union in the divine life and nature is the vital base for the believers to live a holy life for the church life, which is the theme of the two Epistles. </p>
<p data-content-id="wlGQFARrTrj_EDLb1Z5NJFsBCV39AzrRFKxb5picHg1lcHFyW_sieswfArCE66mXm"> In his opening word to the Thessalonians Paul speaks in a plain manner. He does not say, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93718" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Romans 1:1</span>, that he is “a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God”; neither does he say, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93719" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span>, that he is an “apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God.” The opening of Romans and Ephesians is more complicated than that of 1 Thessalonians. Because this Epistle was written to young believers, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93720" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> Paul simply says, “Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LPYR-Rf_6uFcNnPhzwX_Lnd5SjvP79sa03VUdkYyBXE4rNinniEkq_ZS-2ehIt9XO"> It is a particular characteristic of Paul’s writing to emphasize the organic union of the believers with the Triune God. In fact, the emphasis on the organic union with Christ is an outstanding feature of Paul’s writings. In his Epistles Paul again and again speaks of being in Christ, in the Triune God. Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93721" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> is written in a simple way, it nevertheless includes Paul’s characteristic reference to the organic union. In this verse Paul speaks of the church of the Thessalonians <em>in</em> God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. The preposition “in” here is very important; it indicates that the church is in the Triune God. The church is composed of human beings, but they, the believers, are in the Triune God. On the one hand, the church in Thessalonica was of the Thessalonians; on the other hand, this church was in God the Father. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mtikvaKTaj-1XMvs8wpwa1Oma0heVqReLgo8FpcJMjc2daQbfu4sMgo80mpCCHIbe">A LIFE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD THE FATHER</h2><p data-content-id="ZuckyEAbPF6VFdsnFbUF-tBPLZIVPWdjTLoxrM4x0PMmqdNkVSwlWS9383SPgzgIH"> Paul does not merely say that the church is in God; he says that the church is in God the Father. Unless God is our Father, we cannot be in Him. We were not created in God; however, we were regenerated, born again, in Him. We were created outside of God. This means that in creation we did not have any organic union with God or any life relationship with Him. Instead, there was only the relationship between the creature and the Creator. As a result of creation, we are God’s creatures, and He is our Creator. Hence, there is a relationship of creation, but no relationship in life. God’s life was not created into our natural being. As God’s creatures, we did not have the life of God. We had only our created life, our natural human life. </p>
<p data-content-id="A30ALPHLFGvAMumzxAGPf44wSNTKVEUhqYWC-thsV3IRzNKRYjXg5WMZZcE10A7Am"> When we were regenerated, born of God, our life relationship with God began. This rebirth brought us into the organic union with the Triune God. At the time of our regeneration, our rebirth, we obtained God’s life. Now God is not merely our Creator, our God; He is our Father, the One who has begotten us. God is no longer merely our Creator—He is also our Begetter, for He has begotten us with His life. Therefore, He is God our Father. <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv1q8OEYZLgUTrPLhjVLTrfinBl18iPKNKFtS8RCSEqI1drJPDZEpy7Rp8GKMtNDB"> Through regeneration the Thessalonian believers had become sons of God. According to the book of Romans, the church is a composition of sons of God. It is impossible for sinners to be components of the church. Sinners can be members of a secular organization, but they cannot be components of the church of the living God. Such a church is composed only of sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="CA2ne1_5bfKAMoAUV7_pxOD6zXt-CnOOBbMo-dsjURn80uZ_MrLT0dvo5cer3i9d6"> We have been predestinated by the Father to be His sons. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93722" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span> says, we have been predestinated unto sonship. At a certain time, God called us and moved us inwardly. Then we repented, believed in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and received Him. By receiving Christ, we were reborn and became sons of God. Now that we are sons of God, we are the components of the church, the Body of Christ. Because we, as sons of God, are the members of Christ, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93723" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> says not only that the church is in God the Father, but also that the church is in the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PvlzyEwtbfaE7dcp1AZigMEHhz2b1bu7w6GCINtclncXXzvbopCUAjv2qRcFWs_cL">CALLING ON THE LORD JESUS</h2><p data-content-id="--A9tOzHYDUrCmdOWAIFncdoMx0RF9eVBJ7vxqYwwYooQV8XhK1-u2ercsLhu_HQs"> It is very significant that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93724" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> Paul inserts the title Father after God and the title Lord before Jesus Christ. It is not sufficient to speak either of God or of Jesus Christ. Rather, we need to say that God is our Father and that Jesus Christ is our Lord. If Jesus Christ is not our Lord, then we have nothing to do with Him in a practical way. But when Jesus Christ becomes our Lord, this means that we are in Him, organically united to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="pMhYsahJI5wFpPZMEaVCaMpl2TYpBLhnqkBmeANDFXI-dH8RBwNQcL5f-_s9o8t-w"> When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we should not just say “Jesus”; we should say “Lord Jesus.” To call on Him only by saying “Jesus” is to call somewhat ignorantly. The Lord, however, is merciful, and He sympathizes with us. He still responds when we call “Jesus” instead of “Lord Jesus,” for He realizes that actually we are calling on Him as Lord. Nevertheless, we need the proper knowledge of calling on the Lord. Instead of saying, “Jesus, I love You,” it is better to say, “Lord Jesus, I love You.” How sweet it is to call on the Lord in this way! <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> </p>

The apostles knew that the brothers beloved by God were chosen in such a manner by God for the fulfillment of His heart’s desire. The apostles knew that the Thessalonians were included among God’s selected people, His chosen ones. Their selection had been made manifest to such an extent that the apostles had the assurance that the Thessalonian believers had been selected by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="29QWdTPpMvTbx_XydjI08GzrM52i-IyY4Xd3ZrxHTsCWPo4MIopoZWdZpF38viLRZ"> The fact that the Thessalonians had been selected by God was manifested by their reaction to the gospel. How do we know that we have been selected? We know this by the way we respond to the gospel. If a person rejects the gospel, that is a sign that he has not been selected by God. But if he accepts the gospel willingly in a positive way, that acceptance is a sign, an indicator, that he surely has been selected by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="u-g9qgMW48a3gevz6gKGANrLlYAwxd4vvKQX8IWso3SP4Kl1OX_cJaKP_X5TKbjyP"> God selected us in eternity, before the foundation of the world. But in time He comes to us in the preaching of the gospel. Now it is a matter of our reaction. If our reaction is positive, that is a positive sign, a sign that we have been selected. But if our reaction is negative, that is a negative sign, a sign <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> that we have not been selected. The apostles knew that the Thessalonians had been selected by God because of their ready and willing acceptance of the gospel in a very positive way. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kv_-aIQvobBgJbFzV1nXpXo0GOSod5yAWetoK0Kc4D0LrnoyctbAikhOp590DzbxS"> No doubt, Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93739" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:4">1:4</span> concerning selection is directed to young believers. New Christians need to be helped to know that they have been selected by God. The foundation of our salvation was not laid in this age; rather, it was laid in eternity past. Based upon His selection, God saves us. Furthermore, with God’s selection as the foundation, the Spirit moves us to believe in Christ. The move of the Spirit in this way is based upon the foundation of selection laid in eternity. We should try to help new believers realize God’s selection as the eternal foundation of their salvation. We all need to see that in eternity past we were selected by God and that our being in the church today is a sign of this eternal selection. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93740" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:4">1:4</span> Paul could say, “Knowing, brothers beloved by God, your selection.” </p>

Their ministering of the gospel was not only by word, but also by a life which displays the power of God, a life in the Holy Spirit and in the assurance of their faith. They were the model of the glad tidings they spread. </p>
<p data-content-id="4EXbfaQJqUx_CzAJxU-ff2J1S9n7f9MwwAxmn39v5HzRv3fRDkWotHsE_dbBH8bvI"> We all should learn that to preach the gospel we must preach in power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance. As we preach the gospel, we need to have the assurance that it is a saving gospel. The gospel we preach is able to save others. Before sinners can believe in the gospel, we ourselves must believe it. We must believe that the gospel is able to save sinners. When we preach the gospel, we should look away from those in the audience who may be opposing our <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> message. Looking at them may cause our faith to diminish. Instead of looking at the faces of opposers, look at the gospel. The expression on the faces of the opposing ones is a lie. We must have the assurance that the gospel we are preaching can save even these opposers. </p>

This verse reveals that if we would preach the gospel in power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, we must have a life to match this kind of gospel preaching. Our manner of life must match the power, the Holy Spirit, and the assurance. </p>
<p data-content-id="3rdNAYtVwEyij9wG-6AfQj2JV6iHrXR6556dzE4davqsljBTWTcHI_Ft3DQrOhyqI"> A careless person, one who does not live Christ, cannot preach the gospel in power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance. To preach the gospel in this way, we must first live Christ and have a manner of life to match the power, the Holy Spirit, and the assurance. In other words, the power, the Holy Spirit, and the assurance require a certain manner of life. If we do not have the proper living, we shall not have the power, the Holy Spirit, and the assurance in our gospel preaching, for our manner of life will not match these characteristics. </p>

This indicates that we need to be a pattern, a model, for others. The believers do not see the Lord first; they see us first.

Because we are the <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> Lord’s representatives, we need to be a proper pattern. Then others can imitate the Lord by imitating us.

This may be the case in reading 1 and 2 Thessalonians. We have pointed out that these Epistles were written by Paul in an elementary way to new believers, to those who had been in the Lord probably for less than a year. When I was very young, I was told that the books to the Thessalonians are very precious, and I began to pay close attention to them. However, my understanding of these Epistles was natural.

Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians begin in almost exactly the same way: “Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” Of the many Epistles written by Paul, only these two have this expression, the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Instead of taking this expression for granted, we should seek to find out what it means. If we check in this way, we shall learn that it is a very profound matter to say that the church is in God. This thought cannot be found in the Old Testament. God never told His people, the children of Israel, that they were in God. But in the New Testament there are two Epistles that tell us <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> that the church is in God. We need to learn the real significance of the church being in God. What a great matter that the church is in God! </p>
<p data-content-id="bIitKE5sCdBDyj_cAMJWW_--FIZ8b1WOJNT9yap_0xXfGWaEAipyX08YSJ99K9EgQ"> In 1 Corinthians Paul says that the church is in Corinth. He also speaks of the churches in Macedonia. Both in 1 and 2 Thessalonians the location of the church is not a city—it is God. Furthermore, the church is in the Triune God. This is indicated by the fact that Paul says “in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” The object of the preposition “in” is both God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. The Father and the Son are two and yet are one. For the church to be in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ means that the church is in the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="qLQhpzpBKjIYPlHN1GLuFvpSAobcW8RgLDaQPpUPML6ei6jyMLDEgEMAfFcGoZtsQ"> The God revealed in the New Testament is not merely God the Creator; He is God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. The name Jesus indicates incarnation, and the title Christ, resurrection. If God had not become incarnate, how could He be Jesus? If He did not enter into resurrection, how could He be Christ? The God who has passed through incarnation and resurrection is now in our spirit to be our life. The church is an entity in such a God, even the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="CA2ne1_5bfKAMoAUV7_pxOD6zXt-CnOOBbMo8dsjcRn80uZ_MrLT0dvo5cer3i9d6"> Although the church in Thessalonica was a new church, the Thessalonians nevertheless had to realize that the church is in God. Those in this young church needed to see that the church is in the Triune God, in the very God who is our Father and our Lord. The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians were written not to individuals, but to the church in the Triune God. This is the reason we speak of a holy life for the church life. These two Epistles are addressed to the church, and the church is in the processed Triune God. </p>

However, we may take for granted that we understand what the work of faith is. Actually, we may not be able to give an adequate definition of faith. What is faith, and what is the work of faith? Some would say, “The Thessalonians believed in God, and because of their faith they did a work for God. This is the work of faith.” However, this is a natural understanding of the work of faith. The actual meaning of this expression is different from what is in our natural way of understanding. </p>

However, a child would not be able to tell you what it means to say that the church is the house of the living God or the pillar and base of the truth. Neither could a child say what is the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh. A child may sing of such profound things without having any understanding of them. In principle, we may be exactly the same in our reading of the Bible. We may say the words “the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” without having any understanding of what they mean. Likewise, we may have only a natural understanding of the structure of the holy life for the church life, a structure consisting of the three elements of the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope. We may know these matters in a natural way, not according to the way Paul used them. </p>

We may read this verse again and again thinking that we understand it, when actually we may not understand it at all. </p>

Once we know the writer’s spirit, we can learn his purpose, intention, goal, and aim. In order to learn what was the burden in Paul’s spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93769" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1</span>, we need to consider some basic matters in this chapter as indicated by the words Paul uses and by the way this chapter is constructed. This means that Paul’s spirit here is related to certain basic words he uses. Any chapter of the Bible is constructed of specific words that refer to basic elements. Let us now consider some basic matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93770" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1</span> expressed in the words chosen by the apostle Paul. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="x-5TzPFIe1rIQs4lj3UuDgHej2EVbVpf4cTxkc6dJGETSeJOeoTmYx_rQmwxTdPcU">THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="rX-pp2YZBRZeApP_hIf0dxnsF4yO--IEe2yEeFfheQeF6OL59cEoE8YtMK_ljJiwr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93771" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">chapter one</span> of 1 Thessalonians the Triune God is revealed. First, we have the Father. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93772" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> Paul says that the church is in God the Father, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93773" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:3">verse 3</span> he again refers to “our God and Father.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93774" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:10">verse 10</span> Paul speaks concerning the Son: “And to wait for His Son from the heavens.” Furthermore, Paul mentions the Holy Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93775" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:5">verse 5</span>, where he says that the gospel came to the Thessalonians in the Holy Spirit, and also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93776" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:6">verse 6</span>, where he says that the Thessalonians accepted the word with joy of the Holy Spirit. In this chapter we have the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRDmgjXjfWKDT94A3PP3I3d56B_w2TzxjmuKsA8rhmsqkzwL5vgteeA7WnGZqA_b-"> At the time of Paul, any typical Jew would have been offended by the expression “His Son.” This was offensive to Jews because they believed in the true God, but did not realize that He has a Son. To a certain extent, the Jews believed <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> that God has a Spirit. However, they did not have the understanding that the Spirit is the same in rank as God Himself. Rather, they believed only that God has a Spirit and that this Spirit is subordinate to Him. According to Jewish belief concerning God, God is unique and yet this unique God has a Spirit. The Jews certainly did not believe that God has a Son; neither did they believe that both the Son of God and the Spirit of God are on the same rank as God. This is altogether contrary to the Jewish concept. Hence, for Paul to speak of the Father, His Son, and the Holy Spirit is to utter something very basic. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qi-xjcnIifom2ZX0YUSajXc_A60S7buDkml1hAMn0LRGtVI6n1Ur9wktSKyeMiSC_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93777" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">chapter one</span> Paul not only speaks of the Son of God, but also speaks of Jesus Christ. The Son of God is Jesus, and this Jesus is Christ. The name Jesus refers basically to the manhood of the Son of God, to the Son of God as a man. Through incarnation the Son of God became a man named Jesus. This name is an equivalent to the Hebrew word for Joshua, a name which means either Jehovah our Savior or Jehovah our salvation. The name of Jesus, therefore, is rich in its implications. </p>
<p data-content-id="YaG_U9sLIYg2lh7K7i_iFyTDyxJwzL1IY2e3WS6etTyZKGoGENj8o4nF0O2U5vS5_"> Like everyone else, Jesus, the Son of God, has a history. We know that He was born in Jewish territory, lived in that region for thirty-three and a half years, and eventually died on the cross. Now when we speak of Jesus, we need to recall His history, His biography. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkqXZ3ZGPbg7a6upPVuGEy7UjjwDYYSw0r2l3750igjHbIaeg4iiigj7VuGmRNXxT"> The Lord Jesus is also the Christ. For the most part, the title Christ denotes that aspect of the Lord’s history related to resurrection, whereas the name Jesus denotes that part of His history related to incarnation and human living.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93779" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:4">verse 4</span> Paul speaks concerning selection: “Knowing, brothers beloved by God, your <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> selection.” Who selected us? Surely selection was not accomplished by the Son. The Father is the One who selected us. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93780" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:10">verse 10</span>, the Son delivers us. This verse says that the Son “delivers us from the wrath which is coming.” I would call your attention to the fact that in this verse the word “delivers” is in the present tense, whereas wrath is spoken of as something which is coming. The deliverance is taking place right now, but the wrath is coming. The point here is that the Son accomplishes the work of deliverance. </p>
<p data-content-id="gIBX5-uTu_oOuD9VXih65CFcautNKByF3-U75bgDLxjWZ8mTMrKtHaztQ6rUNJWaU"> Selection is of the Father, and deliverance is of the Son, but what is the work of the Spirit? According to this chapter, the Spirit is for propagating, for imparting. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93781" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:5">verse 5</span> Paul points out to the Thessalonians that the gospel came to them not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93782" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:6">verse 6</span> he reminds them that they accepted the word with joy of the Holy Spirit.

<p data-content-id="eh6cQ09n6Bw__Z5JeWH33mLs7ZISWSbNLSjGSYroHly0wqOih9W9Ju3nQ77suk8at"> As Paul was writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93783" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1</span>, deep within he was exercised concerning the Triune God. He was burdened concerning the Father’s selection, the Son’s deliverance, and the Spirit’s transmission. It is very important for us to see this. </p>

No doubt in Paul’s concept the Triune God today is fully embodied in the Word. The Word may be compared to a battery that contains electricity. As a battery is the embodiment of electricity, so in the spiritual realm the Word of God, a divine battery, is the embodiment of the Triune God. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all embodied in the Word. Thus, when we preach the Word, God is conveyed to others. Through the Word the Triune God is transmitted to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="txBalsTbbqEKrVM3p-c1G9OUksUoYsdc6sZgdY6ALPHNx17wBBecEbrNOZVZJyB5w"> Paul had spent about three weeks with the Thessalonians. I believe that during those weeks Paul told the Thessalonians how God had selected them in eternity past. <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> He must also have told them how one day God the Son became incarnate, how He was born in a manger and given the name Jesus. Surely Paul also told the Thessalonian believers how Jesus lived on earth, was crucified, and was resurrected to be the Lord, the Head, and the Christ, how He is now in the heavens, and how He has become the life-giving Spirit. Paul, therefore, preached the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This was his gospel, the word accepted by the Thessalonians. </p>

The word they received was the gospel preached to them. By accepting this word and thereby accepting the Triune God, they were born of God and put into Christ. On the negative side, this was a turning to God from idols. On the positive side, it was being born of God and also believing into the Son of God. In this way an organic union took place, and the Thessalonians came to be in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="MBsqlst5P700_JKz99q2Pe_WZyx9Xuj_n-NKlndC4YomzL0r_uPjVsyMNLxxCJBTm"> The new believers at Thessalonica were all in the Triune God.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93786" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> the phrase “in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” not only qualifies the church, but also qualifies the Thessalonians.

Although the expression “the church life” cannot be found in these Epistles, the church is mentioned emphatically at the beginning of each book. First Thessalonians opens with these words: “Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” Second Thessalonians opens in almost exactly the same way. The only difference is that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93799" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span> says “the Father” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93800" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:1">2 Thessalonians 1:1</span> says “our Father.” Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians were addressed to the church. </p>

The beginning of every Epistle matches the contents of that particular Epistle. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93801" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Romans 1:1</span> says, “Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God.” First Corinthians begins in a somewhat different way: “Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93802" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Cor. 1:1</span>). In contrast, the opening of both 1 and 2 Thessalonians is quite simple. Paul does not use any titles to refer to himself; he does not speak of himself as a slave of Christ or as an apostle. Instead, he simply says, “Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="EkqXZ3ZGPbg7a6upPVuGEy7UjjwDYYSw0r2l275VpgjHbIaeg4iiigj7VuGmRNXxT"> The expression, “the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,” is unique. On the one hand, the church is of certain persons; on the other hand, it is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. This way of referring to the church is very different from that found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93803" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>. There Paul says, “To the church of God which is in Corinth,” describing the church as being in a particular place. But in 1 and 2 Thessalonians Paul speaks of the church not as being in a certain place, but as being of certain persons, the Thessalonians, who are in God. In these Epistles the church is of the Thessalonians and in the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="f3WRsn_4HmsY4ysIv3pgmsK7x6r6blTBiwmoEJuN6YX3yM8V-_ljmsty6t_55ZLjG"> According to history, Thessalonica was an immoral place. For the most part, the people of that city were not moral. Nevertheless, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93804" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span>, the church in that city was “of the Thessalonians.” It does not seem possible that a church could be composed of people who lived in a city like Thessalonica. </p>
<p data-content-id="IvdR47VB3n-7XenDM8GyPmro0fRsfGUv39v5N3vtO2c5aajRe2M8b3uAW-zmkz0lt"> It is very positive to say that the church is in God the Father, but it is not positive to say that the church is of the Thessalonians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93805" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> we have the church of the Thessalonians in God. The prepositions “of” and “in” here are very important. The church in Thessalonica was of people from an evil city, but it was in God the Father. This is similar to speaking of the church in San Francisco as being the church of the San Franciscans in God the Father. San Francisco has a world-wide reputation for being an evil, immoral city. Nevertheless, there is a church in San Francisco today, the church of the San Franciscans in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

From the content of these books we know that the church life depends on a holy life. Many San Franciscans may be evil, but those San <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> Franciscans who compose the church in San Francisco are holy. Praise the Lord that among today’s San Franciscans there are a number of holy people living a holy life! The same is true of the church in Los Angeles. The Lord can boast to the demons and the evil angels that in such an immoral city as Los Angeles, the home of Hollywood, the Lord has a church composed of holy people living a holy life. In the local churches today, we are living a holy life for the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="kL4P7lF_dG0EBtyXit3fRPQxmUzvXShCcniUgVc5JxX0krir36lsXW32wZgnsRp5k"> We all need to see that 1 and 2 Thessalonians are on the church life. Not long ago, while I was working on these two Epistles, I was looking to the Lord that he would show me the main subject of these books. Eventually, I became impressed with the matter of the church life in these Epistles. I believe that impression came from the Lord. Apparently 1 and 2 Thessalonians are not related to the church. However, if you touch the depths of the truth in these books, you will see that they truly are concerned with the practice of the church life through the living of a holy life. Now we must go on to see how it was possible for people from an immoral city such as Thessalonica to become a holy people living a holy life for the church life. If we would understand this, we need to ask a very important question: What is the source of a holy life for the church life? </p>

Furthermore, such careful readers may wonder how we can speak, again from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93807" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1</span>, of the Triune God embodied in the Word. This chapter clearly mentions the word, but what about the Triune God and the embodiment of the Triune God in the Word? Let us consider this matter carefully. </p>

Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93813" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1</span> is a chapter on the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="bIitKE5sCdBDyj_cAMJWW_--FIZ8b1WOJNT90apa2xXfGWaEAipyX08YSJ99K9EgQ"> Actually, the entire New Testament is related to the Triune God. The Triune God is the element for the construction of the New Testament. In preparing meals, sisters use various groceries as the elements of their cooking. Likewise, certain elements are the “ingredients” used in the composition of the New Testament. What are the elements found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93814" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1</span>? The most basic element is the Triune God. Just as meat is an important element in the diet of many Americans, so the Triune God is the most important element in Paul’s spiritual cooking. Hence, it is not surprising that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93815" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1</span> we can clearly see the Triune God. In this chapter Paul explicitly speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="qLQhpzpBKjIYPlHN1GLuFvpSAobcW8RgLDaQJpUuPL6ei6jyMLDEgEMAfFcGoZtsQ"> Both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93816" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1-2">1 Thessalonians 1:1 and 2</span> Thessalonians <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93817" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> speak of the church of the Thessalonians. This indicates that the church is composed of saved and regenerated sinners. From history we know that the cities of ancient Macedonia, where Thessalonica was located, and Achaia, where Corinth was situated, were evil and immoral. Those cities may have been worse than today’s San Francisco. The Thessalonians in particular did not have a good name; instead, they had a reputation for sinfulness, uncleanness, and immorality. But some of these Thessalonians were saved and regenerated, born of God, through believing in Christ. As a result, in that evil city there came to be a church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93833" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span>, the church of the Thessalonians was in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

In this message we shall go on to consider, also from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93834" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1</span>, how this Triune God is ministered to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hIMylAEwtWdVBwRfQUfRLKMW4rJjKHx0Mp-EQA98oN_SE_mZhrV2-nZ1eLy43FCkv">THE WORD OF THE LORD<br/>AND FAITH TOWARD GOD</h2><p data-content-id="U_qUQ9eLDgIohGSw9aRXtqLUH_FRVtIT3LC8CCaegNOVW9gcCaYHbfyn6DN6SS12s"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93835" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:5-6">verses 5 and 6</span> Paul says, “Because our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake. And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having accepted the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit.” According to these verses, to preach the gospel is to preach the word. The gospel preached by the apostles was the word accepted by the Thessalonians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93836" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:8">verse 8</span> Paul goes on to say, “For from you the word of the Lord has sounded out, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we have no need to speak anything.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> First the Thessalonians accepted the word, and then they sounded it out. </p>

This verse says that from the Thessalonians the word of the Lord sounded out and that their faith toward God went out. Thus, the word that is sounded out is the faith that goes out. </p>
<p data-content-id="txBalsTbbqEKrVM3p-c1G9OUksUoYsdc6sZgfY6ADPHNx17wBBecEbrNOZVZJyB5w"> What is faith? Hardly anyone can give a satisfactory definition. It is very difficult to say what faith is. However, by considering these verses carefully, we can have a proper understanding of faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="hIMylAEwtWdVBwRfQUfRLKMW4rJjKHx0Mp-EQA9ljN_SE_mZhrV2-nZ1eLy43FCkv"> First, faith is a matter of having the word preached to us. Next, faith includes our accepting of the word and our sounding it out. This kind of word is faith. The word of the gospel is preached, accepted, and declared. In this way the word becomes faith within us. In the speaking of the preacher, the word is the gospel. But when we accept the word, and especially when we sound out the word, it becomes faith within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="U_qUQ9eLDgIohGSw9aRXtqLUH_FRVtIT3LC8CCa7oNOVW9gcCaYHbfyn6DN6SS12s"> Suppose a preacher of the gospel speaks to an unbeliever concerning man’s fall and God’s salvation. The one who preaches the gospel tells the unbeliever that in Christ God was incarnate, that He was crucified for our sins, that He was resurrected from among the dead, and that He has become the life-giving Spirit in order to dwell in us. When this unbeliever receives the word of the gospel and declares it, it becomes faith. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MBsqlst5P700_JKz99q2Pe_WZyx9Xuj_n-NKnndO6YomzL0r_uPjVsyMNLxxCJBTm">THE CONTENT OF THE WORD<br/>PREACHED BY PAUL</h2><p data-content-id="V47gZ_dXfuuIX5rvOaHiq3ko1XLh4Vg8gDLzvGU03CRAbwE18cUk5AJ5tvMsJdAip"> Now we need to study the content of the word, the gospel, preached by Paul. No doubt, Paul preached the Triune God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93838" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:4">verse 4</span> he says, “Knowing, brothers beloved by God, your selection.” Selection refers to the Father’s work in eternity past. That was when God selected us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93839" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:10">verse 10</span> Paul speaks about the Son as the One who delivers us. The Son is the Savior, the Deliverer. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93840" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:5">verse 5</span> Paul says that the gospel they preached came in power and in the Holy Spirit; <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93841" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:6">verse 6</span> we see that the Thessalonians accepted the word with joy of the Holy Spirit. The fact that the gospel was preached in the Holy Spirit indicates that the Spirit is the One who transmits the things of God into us. Thus, God the Father selected us, God the Son accomplished redemption to deliver us, and God the Spirit transmits all the divine things to us. This is the content of the word preached by Paul as the gospel. This is the reason I say that the Triune God is embodied in the word. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6E87y3trDUylNZBtiqNQ-9Tzo6W4r-esxSFna8sAOylvP_w8A7ox6JxMWlYAvz7M"> A brother may give a short gospel message in which he says that God created man, that man has become fallen, that Christ has come to die on the cross for our sins, and that now the Spirit is seeking to regenerate us. Even in such a short message, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are all included. This is the content of the proper gospel, a gospel that is the divine word embodying the Triune God and telling us what the Father has done, what the Son has done, and what the Spirit is doing. When someone believes this word and accepts it, it becomes faith within him. </p>
<p data-content-id="1-pomZlgQoWjecGSJDYVh5kAUyFdSE6StM7LoUK1JuPTdz167iZ-u6dQnK8mLseqR"> Do you realize what happens when the Triune God is ministered to a person through the word, and that person receives the word so that it becomes faith within him? At that moment such a person experiences a new birth. He is born of God. We all were sinners, but through faith we have become sons of God. Through faith we experience a new birth. </p>
<p data-content-id="9flVS1cmSfOycwab-O9mkLeF0p70S8vxBNHFqzGHC1W5xYaLyua_nLL4WijlX1bnt"> Faith is not a matter of trying to believe something that we are not able to believe. Whenever you preach the gospel, do not force anyone to believe. Instead, present the Triune God as the One most dear, precious, and valuable. When others hear the presentation of such an attractive One, they will appreciate what you are saying and receive your word. The word they accept will then become their faith. This is what it means to believe. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jJlXGtE9dmnAbo96hq_afbpNzm3SVfmdnM6nTYTFB1r5Wxlkm_IhagOk0lBnA9Qlf">TWO ASPECTS OF FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="TKq_WCxkl5nNdZM5kxAUuPY75kTq4EIeaamcJTiVBIqMSbG1bgg6uip7wz2vtNsvO"> Faith has two aspects: the objective aspect and the subjective aspect. When we accept the word of God, it becomes <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> both our objective faith and our subjective faith. Objective faith denotes the things we believe, and subjective faith refers to our action of believing. Through such a faith we are regenerated, born of God, and a relationship of life begins between us and God. Furthermore, through this kind of faith we are put into Christ. Formerly, we were outside of Christ. But now through faith we are in Christ. This means that there is an organic union between us and Christ. This is the beginning of the Christian life, and this life is a holy life that consummates in the church life. In this way the Triune God is transmitted into our being so that we may have a new life, the divine life. With this new life we have a relationship of life with God and an organic union with Christ. By means of this relationship and union we begin our Christian life, a life of holiness, a holy life for the church life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nP53GGFF52Y1qHvb0rabXz6rUWux1rnGcVg0gaarQJeYqQkaPPlDlZgyTasQ-zucu">THE WORK OF FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="6xcopxZjZK6F8a_6vdWQGxhLpkZxtkEMykk_SM5XTFcW7sYmcwcuj6n2QjN1MHxkK"> Now that we have considered <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93842" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">verse 1</span> in a rather full way, let us go on to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93843" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:3">verse 3</span>. Here Paul says, “Remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labor of love, and endurance of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.” In this verse Paul speaks of three matters: the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope. The work of faith comes first. Faith comes through our acceptance of the word that is the embodiment of the Triune God. When we accepted this word, faith was produced within us. We have seen that this faith is both objective and subjective. </p>
<p data-content-id="RoDIchE9_Iy0jaepjOKGXQjPSYEYGyxjE73qPxzxdOqbO3oRIuXM4GqsmQt1FITKE"> In Greek there is a definite article in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93844" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:3">verse 3</span>, the faith. This indicates that this verse speaks of the work of the faith. This faith is God’s word accepted by us. The word preached to us and received by us becomes faith. Because this faith is living and active, it results in the work of the faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="sxDbeBfxVsm3l4Hj5KloIsHIPS5yFuh-xvJH54aTYeZNshQy_rbupcQFuR1kJCcVN"> The Greek word for work in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93845" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:3">verse 3</span> is <em>ergon,</em> a word usually rendered as work. Paul uses this word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93846" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Romans 3:20</span>: “Because by the works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93847" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Romans 3:20</span> work mainly denotes our conduct, our behavior. Paul is saying that no fallen person can be justified before God by his conduct. Thus, in that verse work does not <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> refer to an activity or a task that we do; it refers to particular deeds in our behavior. What, then, is the meaning of work in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93848" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:3">verse 3</span>? Does it refer to deeds, or to some kind of task? Actually, in Greek this word denotes acts, actions, activities. It includes everything of our actions. Our actions involve deeds, conduct, and many other things as well. Therefore, the work of faith refers to all the acts, actions, of faith. </p>

The longer description of the church contains three names not found in the shorter: the Father, the Lord, and Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6xcopxZjZK6F8a_6vdWQGxhLpkZxtkEMykk_TM5CYFcW7sYmcwcuj6n2QjN1MHxkK">THE FATHER, THE LORD, AND JESUS</h2><p data-content-id="RoDIchE9_Iy0jaepjOKGXQjPSYEYGyxjE73qOxzYVOqbO3oRIuXM4GqsmQt1FITKE"> By reading the New Testament we realize that the first basic matter concerning the divine titles is the revelation of the name of the Father. When the Lord Jesus came and lived on earth in the flesh, what He mainly did was reveal the name of the Father to His disciples. For example, in His prayer to the Father recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93868" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span>, the Lord Jesus said, “I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93869" data-verses="John 17:6">v. 6</span>). The Lord also said to the Father, “And I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93870" data-verses="John 17:26">John 17:26</span>). It is a matter of great significance to know the Father. It is a great thing to know God, but it is an even greater thing to know the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="sxDbeBfxVsm3l4Hj5KloIsHIPS5yFuh-xvJH44a-ReZNshQy_rbupcQFuR1kJCcVN"> It is also important that we pay adequate attention to the title Lord. In the Old Testament this was used as a <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> divine title. It was not a simple matter for the man Jesus to become the Lord. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93871" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>, after His resurrection and ascension, Christ was made Lord of all. This means that a man, even a Nazarene, has become Lord of all. As applied to the Lord Jesus, the title Lord implies incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. It was through such a process that the man Jesus was made Lord of all. </p>
<p data-content-id="bIitKE5sCdBDyj_cAMJWW_--FIZ8b1WOJNT92apa-xXfGWaEAipyX08YSJ99K9EgQ"> Before the incarnation, Christ as God was already the Lord. However, He was the Lord, the Creator. But today, after a process going from incarnation to ascension, the man Jesus has been made Lord. As applied to Christ in the New Testament, this title is rich in meaning. Christ is not only the Creator, but the One who was incarnate, who lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, who was crucified, who was resurrected, and who has ascended to the heavens. By His crucifixion Christ accomplished redemption, terminated the old creation, destroyed Satan and death, and abolished every separation between God and man and also all the separations between men. Hallelujah for what the crucifixion of Christ has accomplished! Like the crucifixion, Christ’s resurrection is profound. In the words of the song entitled, “God Is Processed,” crucifixion terminates, and resurrection germinates. After His crucifixion terminated the old creation, Christ’s resurrection germinated the new creation. Now, as the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended One, Jesus Christ has been made the Lord of all. All this process and everything related to it is implied in the title Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="qLQhpzpBKjIYPlHN1GLuFvpSAobcW8RgLDaQLpUuHL6ei6jyMLDEgEMAfFcGoZtsQ"> The name Jesus also is significant and meaningful. Jesus means Jehovah the Savior, or Jehovah our salvation. In order for Jehovah to become our Savior and our salvation, it was necessary for Him to pass through a long process. </p>
<p data-content-id="yB1ksNBRYHxTj7QPg1uVLVK0HB1WRhXHIO8MP2qYtcTECvPxdx_zaTo42BSvYsPX4"> Christ means the anointed One. As the Christ, the anointed One, the Lord Jesus is the One appointed by God to accomplish His eternal purpose. Christ has been anointed, commissioned, and appointed to fulfill God’s purpose. Through the steps of His process, He, as the Christ, has fulfilled this commission and has accomplished God’s purpose. <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> Now in resurrection and ascension He is our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="8cPX_DZ1NZiP6a_9Wg7XrsKq0YlDZdVNQnM-jzmv2m8GTi_2HJ_YhTmTbXrE3jNwj"> God is not only our Creator; He is also our Father. For God to be our Father involves much more than His merely being our Creator. How was it possible for God the Creator to become our Father? In other words, how could we, creatures of God, become children of God the Father? God has no intention to become our Father by adoption, our stepfather, or our father-in-law. On the contrary, He is our Father-in-life. This means that we have received God’s life. This took place when we were born of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="0hD1ZBgUTPzaG8c-SeO6nAHtzoZfi4cmKocy5nw7XhK39fJcpOzMONPcbArkDuhSm"> It should be more than mere doctrine for us to declare that we have been born of God. Hallelujah, we are sons of God in life! Having been born of God, we are now God’s sons in life, and He is truly our Father. What a great matter this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="7sR-0mypahaHMs2g9J45pUAX55o3ZVTB0cElisJuQZxRygIoDxtPQPytkWVluLorP"> We need to be very careful in reading the Bible. If we read carefully, we shall realize that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93872" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93873" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:1">2 Thessalonians 1:1</span> are very similar, but are not exactly the same. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93874" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">First Thessalonians 1:1</span> says, “Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93875" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:1">Second Thessalonians 1:1</span> says, “Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” The former speaks of “the Father”; the latter, of “our Father.” Furthermore, in 2 Thessalonians the blessing, “Grace to you and peace,” is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93876" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:2">verse 2</span> instead of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93877" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:1">verse 1</span>. This indicates that Paul’s opening word in 2 Thessalonians is a little stronger than the one in 1 Thessalonians. Certainly Paul was not careless in writing his Epistles. Everything he wrote was with a definite purpose. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_QDBmUX8WJQab_PzMdLxsGughfDPcCHmyxi-9djpGncQ1_sZMpZv-DlQj8PRnkuJV">THE SPIRIT IMPLIED</h2><p data-content-id="BCWyd8haR9z8YbNTjOdhrcTYxqEe4v6HadbinNo_fyDVMbab6pVmNvLqgqdfus6dL"> Both Epistles tell us that the church is composed of human beings, in this case, of Thessalonians. Thessalonica was an evil city, and for the most part those in that city were immoral people. Nevertheless, some who were once immoral were saved and regenerated and composed the church in their <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> locality in the Triune God. For this reason, Paul speaks of the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. By this expression Paul denotes the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="x-5TzPFIe1rIQs4lj3UuDgHej2EVbVpf4cTxnc6ALGETSeJOeoTmYx_rQmwxTdPcU"> When some read concerning the church of the Thessalonians in the Triune God, they may say, “You claim that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93878" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> indicates that the church is in the Triune God. Yes, this verse mentions the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son, but nothing is said concerning the Spirit. If this verse speaks of the Triune God, where is the Spirit?” Here we have one of the many instances where what the Bible does not say is just as important as what it does say, if not more so. Often in our contact with the saints, we may refrain from saying something to them. This may be more important than what we do say to them. Why did Paul not say “the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit”? Eventually we shall see that there is a good reason for Paul to mention the Father and Christ the Son, but not the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="rX-pp2YZBRZeApP_hIf0dxnsF4yO--IEe2yEdFf4dQeF6OL59cEoE8YtMK_ljJiwr"> Be assured that the very God spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93879" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> is the Triune God. We know this by the fact that Paul first mentions the Father, the first of the Trinity. Whenever we have the first, we also have the second, the Son, and also the third, the Spirit. The very fact that Paul speaks of the Father is a strong indication that he is thinking of the Triune God. Moreover, the expression “the Lord Jesus Christ” implies the Spirit. The expressions “God the Father” and “the Lord Jesus Christ” both imply the Spirit. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93880" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> the Spirit is implied and understood. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRDmgjXjfWKDT94A3PP3I3d56B_w2TzxjmuKvA8CrmsqkzwL5vgteeA7WnGZqA_b-"> We must believe that the God referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93881" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> is the Triune God. To be in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ implies that we are also in the Spirit. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93882" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span> we have the Triune God implied. This verse indicates that the church is in the Triune God. </p>

The Triune God revealed in this verse is the processed God. The very God in whom the church is today is the processed Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. </p>

According to the New Testament, the Father wants many sons. The Father’s concern is with sonship. In order to produce these sons, He has been begetting children. With Him, there need be no limit to the number of children. The more children He has, the better. The Father wants sons, and He is begetting them. </p>
<p data-content-id="pMhYsahJI5wFpPZMEaVCaMpl2TYpBLhnqkBmXANuOXI-dH8RBwNQcL5f-_s9o8t-w"> God the Father has a definite purpose in producing many sons. He is not a foolish father, one without a purpose. Rather, He has a purpose and a plan. God’s selection and predestination are according to His purpose. First He selected us and then predestinated us. This indicates that God is the unique initiator and originator. Thus, for the church to be in God the Father implies that the church is in God’s purpose, plan, selection, and predestination. No doubt, the church is also in God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> calling. The church in God the Father is the church in the One who is the initiator and originator. </p>
<p data-content-id="jJlXGtE9dmnAbo96hq_afbpNzm3SVfmdnM6ndYTFJ1r5Wxlkm_IhagOk0lBnA9Qlf"> This understanding of the church in the Father is not merely a matter of doctrine; rather, it has much to do with us in our practical experience. A problem among Christians today is that they have many different purposes and plans. There are different initiators and originators. This is not right. We Christians all should have the unique purpose, the purpose of our Father. We should also have the unique plan of the Father. This means that only one—the Father—should be the initiator and originator. We should not originate anything or initiate anything. Imagine what would happen if all Christians gave up their own purposes and plans and had only one initiator and originator. What oneness there would be among us all! There would be no division whatever. </p>

Now let us go on to consider what it means for the church to be in the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a great matter to be in Christ. To be in Christ means that there is no sin, flesh, self, natural life, old creation, death, or Satan. If we are in Christ, everything negative has been terminated. Sin, death, the self, the flesh, Satan, and the old creation have all been terminated. For those who are in Christ everything other than God has been terminated. </p>
<p data-content-id="6xcopxZjZK6F8a_6vdWQGxhLpkZxtkEMykk_cM5bRFcW7sYmcwcuj6n2QjN1MHxkK"> If we realize what has been terminated in Christ, we shall know that it is shameful for so-called churches to designate themselves by certain names. For example, in China there was a group called the American Presbyterian Church. Recently in southern California I saw a sign which read “The Orange County Chinese Taiwanese Church.” A brother recently told me about a group called the San Francisco Chinese Mennonite Church. There is no room for any such names or designations in the church. Those who take a name such as these indicate by doing so that they are not <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> the church in the Lord Jesus Christ. The fact that they have a name indicates that many things among them have not been terminated. </p>
<p data-content-id="RoDIchE9_Iy0jaepjOKGXQjPSYEYGyxjE73qBxz9bOqbO3oRIuXM4GqsmQt1FITKE"> The church is in the Lord Jesus Christ. This implies that with respect to the church everything natural, everything negative, everything of the old creation, has been terminated. This means that in the church there are no Chinese or Americans, no Japanese or Koreans, no French or Germans. In the church there is room only for Jesus Christ the Lord. This is the significance of the church being in the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="sxDbeBfxVsm3l4Hj5KloIsHIPS5yFuh-xvJH34afeeZNshQy_rbupcQFuR1kJCcVN"> We in the Lord’s recovery claim to be practicing the church life. Whenever we make such a claim, however, we need to check to see whether we are still holding to our culture or disposition. Regarding this matter, sometimes we expect others to sympathize with us. On occasion sisters have said to me, “Brother Lee, don’t forget that we are sisters. According to the Bible, we sisters are weaker vessels.” But in the Lord Jesus Christ there are no weak vessels. Therefore, we should not expect anyone to sympathize with our natural disposition. As long as you want others to sympathize with you, that is an indication that in your experience you are not buried with Christ. For the church to be in the Lord Jesus Christ in a practical way, we all need to be terminated and buried. We need to die and then be placed in the tomb. This is to be in the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="wlGQFARrTrj_EDLb1Z5NJFsBCV39AzrRFKxbwpicDg1lcHFyW_sieswfArCE66mXm"> When I say this, does it seem that I am comparing the Lord Jesus Christ to a tomb? Listen to what Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93906" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Romans 6:3</span>: “Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?” This verse clearly says that to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into Christ’s death. How, then, can we be in Christ without also being in His death? To be in Christ is to be buried, terminated. Do you like to hear such a word? Whether we like to hear it or not, it is the truth that to be in Christ is to be terminated. </p>
<p data-content-id="LPYR-Rf_6uFcNnPhzwX_Lnd5SjvP79sa03VUUkYyFXE4rNinniEkq_ZS-2ehIt9XO"> During special times of conference or training, saints come together from different cities and regions. Outwardly, <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> no one says anything in favor of his locality. But deep within we may be proud of coming from a certain place. In our heart we may say, “You have to realize that we are from such-and-such place. Our place is the best.” To think in this way is to exalt ourselves. When we claim to be of a certain place, we are excluding ourselves from the Lord Jesus Christ. The church must be only in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

In Paul’s time, the Greeks for the most part were proud and evil. They had a complex mythology, and they proudly worshipped false gods. They were extremely superstitious. Thus, they were ruined and corrupted by their mythology, superstition, and philosophy. Like Egyptian, Babylonian, and Persian philosophy, Greek philosophy was not pure. On the contrary, it contained defiling elements. In a sense their philosophy promoted immorality and fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="A30ALPHLFGvAMumzxAGPf44wSNTKVEUhqYWC3thgT3IRzNKRYjXg5WMZZcE10A7Am"> When Paul speaks of the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ, he was saying, “Dear saints in Thessalonica, you are still Thessalonians. But you must realize that now that you have believed in Jesus Christ, you are different. No longer are you in mythology or philosophy. Instead, you are in God the Father, for you have been regenerated, born of God, and have had a new beginning. You are also in the Lord Jesus Christ, since in Him you have been terminated on the cross. Therefore, you are no longer Greeks, and you are no longer immoral people. You should not be in philosophy or mythology any longer, but should be absolutely in God the Father. Do you know how it is possible for you to be in the Father? You can be in Him because you have been born of Him. Thus, now you are in the begetting God, the One who has become your Father. Furthermore, instead of being in your philosophy, you are in the Lord Jesus Christ. Being in the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, you are now a holy people, a separated people. <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> From now on, you should live a life that is absolutely separated from Thessalonica, from Greece, from immorality, and from Greek mythology and philosophy.

These biographies tell His life story between His incarnation and resurrection. This period of time is, for the most part, represented by the name Jesus. If we speak of Jesus according to the biblical use of this name, we mainly <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> refer to His experience between incarnation and resurrection. After resurrection the life of the Lord Jesus is altogether in another sphere. </p>
<p data-content-id="x-5TzPFIe1rIQs4lj3UuDgHej2EVbVpf4cTxpc6ADGETSeJOeoTmYx_rQmwxTdPcU"> Today, however, many Christians are not clear in their understanding concerning Jesus and Christ. Some believers, especially those in Pentecostalism, say “Praise Jesus!” According to the Bible, it is better to say “Praise the Lord.” It is much more common for Christians today to say “Praise the Lord” than it was twenty years ago, when the Lord’s recovery came to this country. This may be due to the influence of the recovery. In any case, it is more fitting to say “Praise the Lord” than to say “Praise Jesus.” </p>
<p data-content-id="rX-pp2YZBRZeApP_hIf0dxnsF4yO--IEe2yETFf4VQeF6OL59cEoE8YtMK_ljJiwr"> According to the New Testament, the title Lord applies to the entire life and ministry of Jesus Christ. This means that the title Lord is an all-inclusive title. But the name Jesus refers to the Lord in His humanity and to His human life prior to resurrection. Christ, as we have seen, refers to the resurrected Christ in ascension. </p>

But our Christ is not only the resurrected and ascended Christ in heaven; He is also the One who has descended and entered into our spirit. Hallelujah, Christ is now in our spirit! </p>
<p data-content-id="Kv_-aIQvobBgJbFzV1nXpXo0GOSod5yAWetoB0Kc8D0LrnoyctbAikhOp590DzbxS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93924" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> the Lord Jesus spoke to His disciples regarding His going and His coming. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93925" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14:1</span> He said, “Let not your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me.” In the next verse the Lord spoke about the many abodes in the Father’s house and about going to prepare a place for them. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93926" data-verses="John 14:3">verse 3</span> He said, “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.” Here the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, “Do not be troubled by the fact that I am going. Apparently I am leaving you. But actually My going is for My coming. After I go, I shall come back again.” The Lord Jesus was not saying that He was going to heaven. Rather, He was going to the cross and then to the tomb and <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> to Hades. Then in resurrection He would come back to the disciples. </p>
<p data-content-id="lxpR8BQGIrxvvLJ_yJlo4K8ImRa4DgdFNNkTK5vT2azXeq77QRIZ2tZVg4w6F-XSH"> Nearly all Christians take the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93927" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> to refer to His second coming. This understanding is not accurate. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93928" data-verses="John 14:18">John 14:18</span> the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, “I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.” If the Lord’s coming in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93929" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> were His second coming, the disciples certainly would have been orphans. If the Lord Jesus were only in the heavens today, we all would be orphans. When the Lord said, “I am coming to you,” He was speaking of His coming in another form. This coming was fulfilled on the day of His resurrection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93930" data-verses="John 20:19-22">John 20:19-22</span>. After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came back to His disciples to be with them forever, so that they were not left orphans. </p>
<p data-content-id="OA3-cOJusChKO18oWh4UFQc5aqjSR6E2DyzJmVwqEqEQ3WOI7R0azcz1hmbgdmMAk"> The Lord’s coming in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93931" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> refers to His coming in another form. The Lord first came in the form of the flesh. When He spoke to the disciples in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93932" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span>, He was still in that form. But in this chapter He seems to be saying, “I am now in the flesh. But I am going to the cross, where I shall be slain. Afterward, I shall be buried in a tomb. Then I shall rise up from among the dead and come again in another form. When I am in that form, I shall come back to you.” And the Lord did come back in this form on the day of His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="4EXbfaQJqUx_CzAJxU-ff2J1S9n7f9MwwAxms39v9HzRv3fRDkWotHsE_dbBH8bvI"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93933" data-verses="John 20:1">Chapter twenty</span> of John describes how the Lord came to His disciples on the day of His resurrection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93934" data-verses="John 20:19">John 20:19</span> says, “When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you.” The Lord Jesus appeared in a splendid, excellent way, in a way beyond human ability to understand. The Jews were opposing the disciples and trying their best to destroy them. Therefore, the disciples were afraid and met behind closed doors. Perhaps they were groaning and wondering what to do. Suddenly the Lord Jesus appeared and said, “Peace be to you.” This One who appeared to them was not Jesus in the flesh—He was Christ the Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="oKMKMaRjikwDyJPmsV1URnuOdxon88RAycLBW_7gUmDQlkQtD1XdGDP_8m0A36E2k"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93935" data-verses="John 20:21">verse 21</span>, the Lord said to them, “Peace be to you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.” Then, as we see in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93936" data-verses="John 20:22">verse 22</span>, the Lord breathed into the disciples the holy <em>pneuma,</em> the Holy Spirit: “And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.” The Lord Jesus in His resurrection is now the <em>pneuma,</em> the Spirit. He appeared to the disciples in the form of <em>pneuma,</em> and He told them to receive the holy <em>pneuma,</em> the holy breath. In the Greek language the word <em>pneuma</em> means both Spirit and breath. Hallelujah, Christ in resurrection is the breath, the <em>pneuma,</em> the Spirit! After the disciples received Him as the holy <em>pneuma,</em> He began to live in them. </p>
<p data-content-id="3rdNAYtVwEyij9wG-6AfQj2JV6iHrXR6556d4E4dWvqsljBTWTcHI_Ft3DQrOhyqI"> We also have received the Lord Jesus Christ as the holy breath, the holy <em>pneuma,</em> the life-giving Spirit, and now He is actually in us. I believe that if we have a proper realization of Christ in us, we shall be very excited, even beside ourselves with joy. The fact that we may not be at all excited about this may indicate that we do not realize that Christ is in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_zrNHrxwZy6Tw-DBBK4kvT-A6hUSaQ-RJPQFYpiPt6EP_s8vw4VwF94uMkN5b7I2"> Where is Christ today? The answer is that Christ is on the throne in heaven and also living in us. Oh, we should be able to declare with a strong release of the spirit that Christ is in us. Our Christ today is the One who lives in us! In a very real sense, our Christ is different from the Christ in whom many Christians believe, for they have a Christ merely in heaven, but we have both the Christ in heaven and the Christ who dwells in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="cCqkCtDrfAjqWKDdS6Vs6VmCvzi-pPdKlzd7YqHn8ttTSNo9XLe6EO3QFHJQi1MYb"> I have been condemned and falsely accused of preaching another Christ. I do not preach a Christ different from the One revealed in the Bible. But, in a certain sense, I preach a Christ who is somewhat different from the One in whom many Christians believe, for the Christ I preach is both in the heavens and in me, whereas many Christians have a Christ only in heaven. Rather than enjoy the indwelling Christ today, they are waiting to die and to meet Christ in heaven. The Christ I preach is the Christ revealed in the Scriptures. He is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Lord in an <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> all-inclusive sense. For Him to be the Lord means that He is both Jesus and Christ. </p>

In the foregoing message we pointed out that for the church to be in Christ is to be in resurrection life. This resurrection life is Christ Himself in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit.

According to the traditional religious understanding, this chapter speaks of heavenly mansions. However, what <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93954" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> speaks about is not heavenly mansions; rather, it speaks of abodes, abiding places, in a divine Person, in God the Father. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93955" data-verses="John 14:2-3">verses 2 and 3</span> the Lord Jesus says, “In My Father’s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.” The Lord Jesus was telling His disciples that through His death and resurrection He would prepare the way to bring them into the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="BCWyd8haR9z8YbNTjOdhrcTYxqEe4v6HadbmgNoeSyDVMbab6pVmNvLqgqdfus6dL"> The Lord Jesus is in the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="93956" data-verses="John 14:10-11">John 14:10-11</span>). He wanted His disciples also to be in the Father, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93957" data-verses="John 17:21">John 17:21</span>. Through His death and resurrection, He <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> brought His disciples into Himself. Since He is in the Father, they are also in the Father by being in Him. Hence, where the Lord Jesus is, there the disciples are also. Where is the Lord Jesus? He is in the Father. Therefore, for us to be where He is means that we also are in the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="mtikvaKTaj-1XMvs8wpwa1Oma0heVqReLgo4EpcJIjc2daQbfu4sMgo80mpCCHIbe"> It is actually superstitious to believe that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93958" data-verses="John 14:2-3">John 14:2 and 3</span> mean that the Lord is building a heavenly mansion and that He will come back only after this work of building is complete. Some Christian teachers claim that the fact the Lord Jesus has not come back indicates that the building of the heavenly mansion is not yet finished. I was told this by a Christian teacher when I was very young. In their talk about the heavenly mansion, some have said, “How marvelous the heavenly mansion will be! The Lord Jesus has been there for more than nineteen hundred years, and still He hasn’t finished the building of this mansion. The Lord said that after He prepares a place for us, He will come back and receive us to Himself. We know from the fact that He has not yet come back that He is still building the heavenly mansion.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuckyEAbPF6VFdsnFbUF-tBPLZIVPWdjTLo1qM4xwPMmqdNkVSwlWS9383SPgzgIH"> While I was in England in 1958, I was enlightened to see from the Bible that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93959" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> has nothing to do with a heavenly mansion. The use of the word mansion in the King James translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93960" data-verses="John 14:2">John 14:2</span> is not accurate. This verse speaks of abodes, not of mansions. The word used in Greek is a noun form of the verb abide. Here the Lord Jesus seems to be saying, “I am your abode, and you shall abide in Me. You are My abode, and I shall abide in you. I am going to prepare an abode in God the Father. The Father wants to receive you all. However, because you are sinful and unrighteous and He is holy and righteous, you cannot enter into Him unless I die on the cross to take away your sins. My death will open up the way for you to come into the Father. After I have prepared a place for you in the Father through My death and resurrection, I shall come again.” Praise the Lord that in this sense the Lord Jesus has already returned! He has already come back, and He has brought us into the Father. Now as members of the church we can declare that <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> we are in God the Father. The church, including all of us, is where the Lord Jesus is, that is, in God the Father. Hallelujah, where the Lord Jesus Christ is, there we are also! We are in the same abode as the Lord Jesus is. How wonderful! </p>
<p data-content-id="A30ALPHLFGvAMumzxAGPf44wSNTKVEUhqYWG_thsR3IRzNKRYjXg5WMZZcE10A7Am"> When I began to teach that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93961" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> speaks not of heavenly mansions but of abodes in God the Father, I was criticized and condemned. Some accused me of taking away their heavenly mansion and complained that at a funeral they could no longer tell people that there is a heavenly mansion for the dead believers. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Fv1q8OEYZLgUTrPLhjVLTrfinBl18iPKNKFpT8RCWEqI1drJPDZEpy7Rp8GKMtNDB">THE RESURRECTED CHRIST<br/>IDENTICAL TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="CA2ne1_5bfKAMoAUV7_pxOD6zXt-CnOOBbMs_dsjYRn80uZ_MrLT0dvo5cer3i9d6"> I have also been accused of teaching heresy for saying, according to the Bible, that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. We should not regard the life-giving Spirit as a Person separate from the Lord Jesus Christ. When the Lord was in the flesh, He was Jesus. But in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit. We are not the only ones who have seen this fact and teach it. A number of other Christian writers have said that, in Christian experience, Christ is identical to the Spirit. In doctrine or in theology it is very difficult to explain how the second of the Trinity, the Son, can be identical to the third, the Spirit. Nevertheless, in Christian experience the resurrected Christ is identical to the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93962" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">Second Corinthians 3:17</span> says explicitly, “The Lord is the Spirit.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93963" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">First Corinthians 15:45</span>, a confirming verse, says, “The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.” Although it is according to the Bible to say that Christ is the Spirit, I have been condemned as heretical for teaching this. </p>
<p data-content-id="PvlzyEwtbfaE7dcp1AZigMEHhz2b1bu7w6GGJNtcpncXXzvbopCUAjv2qRcFWs_cL"> The Bible reveals that the resurrected Christ, the very Christ in resurrection, is the life-giving Spirit. This can be confirmed by our experience. We have Christ within us, and we also have the Spirit within us. But in your experience do you have two in you, Christ and the Spirit, or do you have one? Although both Christ and the Spirit are in us, in experience we have one in us, not two, for Christ today in resurrection is identical to the Spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="--A9tOzHYDUrCmdOWAIFncdoMx0RF9eVBJ7rwqY82YooQV8XhK1-u2ercsLhu_HQs"> In resurrection the Christ who dwells within us is a wonderful Spirit. This Spirit is life, power, holiness, love, righteousness, might, strength, wisdom, grace, kindness, mercy. Oh, this Spirit is everything! This is why we say that this Spirit, who is God and Christ, is all-inclusive. </p>
<p data-content-id="pMhYsahJI5wFpPZMEaVCaMpl2TYpBLhnqkBifANPDXI-dH8RBwNQcL5f-_s9o8t-w"> In particular I wish to point out that this Spirit contains the effectiveness of Christ’s death. The Spirit certainly does not contain death, but it does include the effectiveness of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="veeEis16kr1eWkl89FSXGGvAIAd1n7JfJQGOK4HcuLymBkA8VUroEFKs095i3rIZI">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="WPXnirzH1lEWJ6T3Edqw-T-_yRzjQpZZ-9zwxSBj-Dyy6qDNbmJhvX8N_oeaSaogx"> In the New Testament we are commanded to walk according to the Spirit. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93964" data-verses="Galatians 5:16">Galatians 5:16</span> says, “Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93965" data-verses="Galatians 5:25">Galatians 5:25</span> Paul says, “If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.” Referring to the mingled spirit, the Spirit mingled with our regenerated human spirit, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93966" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Romans 8:4</span> says, “That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.” Therefore, we should simply walk according to the Spirit. There is no need for us to do anything else. </p>
<p data-content-id="29QWdTPpMvTbx_XydjI08GzrM52i-IyY4XdzbrxuZsCWPo4MIopoZWdZpF38viLRZ"> Married brothers and sisters may be concerned about how to have a good marriage or how to be a proper husband or wife. If a brother were to ask me how to be a proper husband or how to have a good married life, I would give just one answer: Walk according to the Spirit. This word applies to brothers and sisters, to husbands and wives. Today many books have been written by Christians on how to have a good family life or how to avoid divorce. There is no need for us to read those books. Do you want to be a good husband or wife? Walk according to Spirit. Do you want to have a good marriage? The answer is the same—walk according to Spirit. Because the Spirit is all-inclusive, it is sufficient for us to walk according to Spirit. </p>

<p data-content-id="oKMKMaRjikwDyJPmsV1URnuOdxon88RAycLFe_7FWmDQlkQtD1XdGDP_8m0A36E2k"> Many Christians, including us, take things in the Bible for granted.

However, we may not have a proper understanding of God’s kingdom and glory. Of course, I do not claim to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93986" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:12">2:12</span> in full. However, I do have some understanding from study and experience. What I wish to say concerning the kingdom and glory in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93987" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:12">2:12</span> is mainly according to my spiritual experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="3rdNAYtVwEyij9wG-6AfQj2JV6iHrXR6556ZwE48VvqsljBTWTcHI_Ft3DQrOhyqI"> In this verse Paul says that God has called us into His own kingdom and glory. No doubt, God’s kingdom and glory are the goal of His calling. It is unfortunate that Christians think that God has called us into a heavenly mansion. God’s calling is not to a heavenly mansion; it is to His kingdom and glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="oKMKMaRjikwDyJPmsV1URnuOdxon88RAycLFe_7gcmDQlkQtD1XdGDP_8m0A36E2k"> According to the understanding of many Christians, at present the earth is not God’s kingdom, but one day the Lord Jesus will come back, take over the earth, and establish His <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> rule upon it. That rule will be God’s kingdom. Many of us have probably held such a concept concerning the kingdom of God. I do not say that this understanding is not accurate at all. However, I must say that it is not entirely accurate, and it is certainly much too superficial. </p>
<p data-content-id="3rdNAYtVwEyij9wG-6AfQj2JV6iHrXR6556ZwE4devqsljBTWTcHI_Ft3DQrOhyqI"> What is God’s kingdom? The kingdom of God is God being manifested through us. Whenever we express God in our daily walk, that is the kingdom. The expression of God Himself from within us is the kingdom. Suppose a brother works in an office. Certain of his colleagues may oppose him because he is a believer. They may not be happy to have him there. But if he expresses God daily in the office, his fellow workers will realize that there is something unusual about him. They will know that with this brother there is something special. This is God’s kingdom, God expressed from within that brother. On the one hand, others may oppose us, criticize us, and be unhappy with us. On the other hand, they sense something indescribable about us. This is God’s kingdom as His manifestation through us. How marvelous it would be if all Christians expressed God! This expression truly would be the kingdom of God on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_zrNHrxwZy6Tw-DBBK4kvT-A6hUSaQ-RJPUNYpuNt6EP_s8vw4VwF94uMkN5b7I2"> When I was a young Christian, I understood <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93988" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:12">2:12</span> in the traditional way. I thought that God had called me merely to enter into His kingdom and glory in the future. My concept of the kingdom of God and the glory of God was very shallow and altogether too objective. Paul did not have such a view of God’s kingdom and glory. From the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93989" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:12">2:12</span> we can see that being called into God’s kingdom and glory is related to walking worthily of God. When we walk worthily of God, there is with us a particular kind of atmosphere, and this atmosphere is God’s kingdom. Furthermore, where the kingdom of God is, there the glory of God is also. </p>
<p data-content-id="cCqkCtDrfAjqWKDdS6Vs6VmCvzi-pPdKlzd_QqHr-ttTSNo9XLe6EO3QFHJQi1MYb"> It is possible for the kingdom of God and the glory of God to be manifested in our married life. If a brother and his wife live God, they will walk worthily of God. Then in their married life there will be a certain kind of atmosphere. When others come into this atmosphere, they will <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> spontaneously have a sense of respect. This is the kingdom of God with God’s glory. If today’s Christians would walk worthily of God, would walk in a way that expresses Him, the kingdom would come. God’s kingdom would then be seen on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="YaG_U9sLIYg2lh7K7i_iFyTDyxJwzL1IY2ezTS6epTyZKGoGENj8o4nF0O2U5vS5_"> As we have pointed out a number of times, glory is God Himself expressed. Whenever the Lord is expressed from within us, we are in a situation that can be described as glorious. If someone would walk into a brother’s home when he is arguing with his wife, there would not be any glory. However, if you visit a brother’s house and find him and his wife glowing, shining, and flowing, you would see the expression of God, God’s glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkqXZ3ZGPbg7a6upPVuGEy7UjjwDYYSw0r2hy750mgjHbIaeg4iiigj7VuGmRNXxT"> Many of us can testify that when we live God and walk worthily of God, matching Him, there is an atmosphere around us that is nothing less than God’s kingdom. Spontaneously the Lord is expressed. This expression is God’s glory. Concerning the kingdom and the glory in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93990" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:12">2:12</span>, we have a further explanation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="93991" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1:1</span>, where we are told that the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

No matter how many believers there may be in the church—fifty, five hundred, or five thousand—all the saints should love one another. Furthermore, they should increase in this love and abound in it. This kind of love is surely not of our human nature. As fallen human beings, we are not capable of such love. But the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ is characterized by this increasing and abounding love. If we truly are a church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, the love we have for one another will increase and abound. <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> </p>

The Greek word sanctification means separation. Only when we are in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ are we truly separated unto God from everything other than God. If we are not in the Triune God, we are still common. Instead of being separated from the world, we are still involved, mixed up, with worldly people and worldly matters. </p>

Even though you are still young, you need to realize that as those who belong to the Lord Jesus, you are part of the church, and the church is in the Triune God. If we compare God to a box, we may say that God is boxing you in to Himself. You all need to be boxed in to Him more and more. God has placed you into Himself as a spiritual, divine, and heavenly box. Being in this box separates you to God. In other words, this being boxed in to God, this separation, is sanctification. </p>

He does not say that the gospel came to the Thessalonians in miracles, wonders, and healings. If we study this book carefully, we shall see that Paul’s emphasis is on daily living. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94014" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:5">1:5</span> he says, “You know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.” Instead of emphasizing the supernatural and the miraculous, Paul takes his living as a factor for the preaching of the gospel.

Christians should live a normal life, not a miraculous, supernatural life. Therefore, a proper life for the church life must be common, regular, and normal. Such a life is characterized by turning to God from idols, serving the living God, and waiting for the coming back of the Lord Jesus. To have this kind of life means that nothing on earth occupies us. We are free from all idols, from all things other than God, and we are occupied by the living God Himself. This living God is testified in our daily life. We have a life which testifies that the God <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> whom we serve is living. Furthermore, our goal, hope, and expectation are not related to things on earth, but are focused on the coming back of the Lord Jesus.

The structure is composed of the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope. The origin of such a life is the preaching of the gospel and the acceptance of the word preached, an acceptance resulting in turning to God from idols, serving a living and true God, and waiting for the Son. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94017" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">chapter two</span> we come to the third aspect of a holy life for the church life, the aspect of fostering. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPXnirzH1lEWJ6T3Edqw-T-_yRzjQpZZ-9zwzSBj2Dyy6qDNbmJhvX8N_oeaSaogx"> Although the word fostering cannot be found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94018" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">1 Thessalonians 2</span>, the fact of fostering can be seen in this chapter. Here Paul likens the apostles both to a nursing mother and to an exhorting father. This means that the apostles were mothers and fathers to the new believers. They regarded the believers as children under their fostering care. Just as parents care for their children, fostering their growth, so the apostles cared for the new believers. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94019" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">1 Thessalonians 2</span> we see the fostering of a holy life for the church life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94020" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1-12">verses 1 through 12</span> we have the care of a nursing mother and an exhorting father, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94021" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:13-20">verses 13 through 20</span> we see the reward given to those who foster believers in this way. Because the apostles rendered such a care to the new believers, the apostles will eventually receive a reward from the Lord. </p>

In these verses we do not have much that is weighty or deep. Here we do not have profound doctrines. Instead, we have a word that can be compared to the way parents speak <span class="pg" data-page-id="97" id="97">[97]</span> to young children. Let us consider this portion verse by verse so that we may be impressed how to help new believers. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="u-g9qgMW48a3gevz6gKGANrLlYAwxd4vvKQT8IWNh3SP4Kl1OX_cJaKP_X5TKbjyP">THE APOSTLES’ ENTRANCE</h2><p data-content-id="f3WRsn_4HmsY4ysIv3pgmsK7x6r6blTBiwmsDJuN-YX3yM8V-_ljmsty6t_55ZLjG"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94023" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">Verse 1</span> says, “For you yourselves know, brothers, our entrance to you, that it has not been in vain.” The apostle stresses repeatedly their entrance to the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94024" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:5">1:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94025" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:9">9</span>). This shows that their manner of life played a great role in infusing the gospel into the new converts. It was not only what the apostles said, but also what they were. </p>
<p data-content-id="IvdR47VB3n-7XenDM8GyPmro0fRsfGUv39v9K3vtK2c5aajRe2M8b3uAW-zmkz0lt"> The apostles came to the Thessalonians with the gospel in such a way that the Thessalonians were convinced. The apostles’ entrance was not in vain. They were a pattern of how to believe in the Lord and follow Him. Because many came to believe in the Lord Jesus through the apostles, a church was raised up in less than a month. This happened not mainly as a result of preaching and teaching, but through the kind of entrance the apostles had among the Thessalonians. </p>

They enjoyed Him as their boldness in the struggle for the gospel. They were bold not in themselves, but in God, even after they had been outrageously treated by the Philippians. Suffering and persecution could not defeat them because they were in the organic union with the Triune God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94027" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:2">verse 2</span>, they spoke the gospel of God in much struggle. This indicates that while they were preaching, they were fighting, because persecution was still going on. Hence, they were struggling and speaking the gospel to the Thessalonians in the boldness of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> </p>

All three are of and by the subtle and deceiving devil. The word entreaty includes speaking, preaching, teaching, instructing, and exhorting. Paul’s exhorting was free from deception, uncleanness, and guile. The apostles were not greedy, and they had no intention of making a gain of anyone. Their coming to the Thessalonians with the gospel was altogether honest and faithful. </p>

The apostles were first tested and approved by God and then were entrusted by Him with the gospel. Hence, their speaking, the preaching of the gospel, was not of themselves to please men, but was of God to please Him. He proves, examines, and tests their hearts all the time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94030" data-verses="Psalms 26:2">Psa. 26:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94031" data-verses="Psalms 139:23-24">139:23-24</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="qLQhpzpBKjIYPlHN1GLuFvpSAobcW8RgLDaUOpUiFL6ei6jyMLDEgEMAfFcGoZtsQ"> According to our opinion, since God already knows everything, it is not necessary for Him to test us. Yes, before we were born, He already knew what kind of person we would be. Why, then, does God test us? God’s testing is not mainly for Himself; it is primarily for us. God knows us, but we do not know ourselves. Because we do not know ourselves adequately, we may think that we are upright, honest, and faithful. However, when we are put to the test, we shall see what we really are and discover that in ourselves we are not honest, faithful, or trustworthy. God’s testing, therefore, proves us to ourselves. Only after God proves us in this way shall we have approvedness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> </p>

I have the assurance that God will use the young people. But God’s using of them will come after His testing of them. God cannot entrust anything to us until we have the approvedness that comes from His testing. God’s entrusting is based on our approvedness. But we cannot approve ourselves. Only after God has tested us will He grant us approvedness. Then He will entrust something to us and begin to use us. </p>
<p data-content-id="8cPX_DZ1NZiP6a_9Wg7XrsKq0YlDZdVNQnM6mzmjwm8GTi_2HJ_YhTmTbXrE3jNwj"> It was in this way that God entrusted the apostles with the gospel.

We may think that Paul should have given the new believers more doctrine, teaching, and instructions. Instead, Paul emphasizes the apostles’ coming, their preaching and teaching of the Word, and how the new believers accepted this word. Paul’s emphasis is on the apostles’ conduct, on their living and manner of life. The reason for this emphasis is that Paul wanted to nourish the believers, to cherish and foster them. It was not Paul’s intention to give them a lot of knowledge. He did not have the burden to teach them so many things.

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1-pomZlgQoWjecGSJDYVh5kAUyFdSE6StM7PtUKoFuPTdz167iZ-u6dQnK8mLseqR">THE WORK OF FOSTERING</h2><p data-content-id="9flVS1cmSfOycwab-O9mkLeF0p70S8vxBNHBvzGeP1W5xYaLyua_nLL4WijlX1bnt"> What we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94077" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">chapter two</span> of 1 Thessalonians is the fostering of the young Christian life. In this chapter Paul is nourishing and cherishing the believers. According to his writing, he behaves himself as a nursing mother and an exhorting father. On the one hand, he is a mother cherishing; on the other hand, he is a father exhorting. His main <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> concern is not teaching, but the carrying out of a fostering work to help the young saints to grow. </p>
<p data-content-id="jJlXGtE9dmnAbo96hq_afbpNzm3SVfmdnM6jWYTgD1r5Wxlkm_IhagOk0lBnA9Qlf"> Most Christian workers lack the concept that their work should not mainly be a work of teaching but should be a work of fostering. Paul’s concept concerning his work was one of helping believers to grow. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94078" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> he says that he planted and Apollos watered, and then God gave the growth. This indicates that Paul’s concept of Christian work is that it is a work of life. It is not work in a school; on the contrary, it is work on a farm, in an orchard, in a garden. Hence, it is not mainly a work of teaching others or educating them. But today the work of most Christians is mainly for education and somewhat for edification. This edification, however, is not directly related to life. Instead, it is related to ethics, morality, or the improvement of character. But with Paul the concept of Christian work was altogether different. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKq_WCxkl5nNdZM5kxAUuPY75kTq4EIeaamYMTi0CIqMSbG1bgg6uip7wz2vtNsvO"> According to what he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94079" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">chapter two</span>, Paul regards the believers as members of a large family. Of course, in a family there is the need for some amount of teaching. Both a mother and a father teach their children. However, in a family the focus is not on teaching the children but is on raising them by cherishing, nourishing, and fostering them so that they may grow. Their growth is not mainly in knowledge: it is primarily a growth in life. As children grow in life, they spontaneously receive more education. The knowledge they acquire always goes along with their growth in life. They should not be given knowledge prematurely. This means that their knowledge should not exceed their growth of life. This is the proper concept of Christian work. </p>
<p data-content-id="gIBX5-uTu_oOuD9VXih65CFcautNKByF3-U_-bgDPxjWZ8mTMrKtHaztQ6rUNJWaU"> Concerning this matter, we in the Lord’s recovery must have a change in our concept. Do not think that in the recovery we regard work higher than life. No, we need to concentrate on life. The church is a family. The church may also be compared to a farm or a garden. A family is a place where children grow up, and an orchard is a place where trees grow and produce fruit. Paul’s concern in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94080" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">chapter two </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> is with the growth of his children. He is fostering the young believers so that they may grow. We may also say that he is watering, nourishing, and cherishing the tender young plants so that they may grow in life. This is the reason that instead of giving the believers a great deal of teaching, he presents them a pattern of life. This pattern of a proper living is actually Paul himself. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eh6cQ09n6Bw__Z5JeWH33mLs7ZISWSbNLSjCVYroDly0wqOih9W9Ju3nQ77suk8at">GROWING BY IMITATING</h2><p data-content-id="5sCf3lJvr4egRboTwX5ig_6IWILttT_9RL5KAD98RNsduxpQaxqmRo6k53eOI1c4Y"> Some Christian teachers say that a believer should not give a testimony concerning himself. According to these teachers, to testify of our experience is to preach ourselves. Therefore, they advise others not to speak of how they have repented, believed in the Lord, received grace, and have been saved. These teachers insist strongly that we should preach only the Lord Jesus and teach the Bible, but should never say anything about ourselves. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94081" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">1 Thessalonians 2</span>, however, Paul certainly speaks about himself. He gives a strong testimony of his living among the Thessalonians. He reminds them of the apostles’ coming and of their manner of life among them. Why did Paul emphasize this? He emphasized it because he was presenting a pattern of a proper living to the young saints. I hope that all the elders and leading ones will see from Paul’s example that we must be a pattern to the saints. In every local church there must be some patterns, some models, for others to follow. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAFmcr0w4h--56l5DrC1uYUEVCX69sjIWIHhFaR_w_7vOOk3V4_SgyG4WBeqTpqW7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94082" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:6">1:6</span> Paul says to the Thessalonians, “You became imitators of us and of the Lord.” Imitating is related to growing. In fact, in many ways to imitate is to grow. In a family children imitate their parents and older brothers and sisters. The little ones do not invent anything; instead, they imitate others. A very good illustration of this is in the use of language. A child learns the language spoken by his parents. He speaks the same language with the same accent. A child learns the language and the accent by imitation. This illustrates the fact that children grow by imitating their parents. Therefore, in a family to imitate actually means to grow. The children imitate their parents in many things—in <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> gestures, in speech, and even in character. Parents are patterns, models, for their children. Whatever the parents are, the children will be also. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="txBalsTbbqEKrVM3p-c1G9OUksUoYsdc6sZkaY6AHPHNx17wBBecEbrNOZVZJyB5w">PRESENTING A PATTERN</h2><p data-content-id="hIMylAEwtWdVBwRfQUfRLKMW4rJjKHx0Mp-AVA9lnN_SE_mZhrV2-nZ1eLy43FCkv"> To give the new believers and young ones a lot of teaching is not the proper way to take care of them. The proper way to foster them is to show them a pattern. By showing them a pattern you water them, supply them, nourish them, and cherish them. This is fostering. If you find that your experience is somewhat lacking, point the new believers to different people in the Bible, for example, to ones such as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and David in the Old Testament and Peter, John, Paul, and Timothy in the New Testament. We can present the lives of Bible characters in such a way as to foster the growth of the young ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="U_qUQ9eLDgIohGSw9aRXtqLUH_FRVtIT3LC4HCa7sNOVW9gcCaYHbfyn6DN6SS12s"> If we give too much teaching to new ones and young ones, we shall damage them. Every mother knows that one of the most important matters in the raising of children is proper feeding. Caring for children is ninety percent a matter of feeding and ten percent a matter of teaching. This also should be our practice in caring for new believers in the church. We must learn to have ninety percent feeding and ten percent teaching. Feeding involves the presenting of patterns either from the Bible or from church history. By reading the biographies of saints throughout the ages, we nourish ourselves and experience a kind of fostering. The point here is that the best way to feed others and foster them is to give them a proper pattern. If there is no pattern, there can be no fostering. Only by having a pattern can we feed others. </p>
<p data-content-id="MBsqlst5P700_JKz99q2Pe_WZyx9Xuj_n-NOindO-YomzL0r_uPjVsyMNLxxCJBTm"> In the book of 1 Thessalonians Paul was not preaching himself. Rather, he was feeding his spiritual children with his own living of Christ. This means that Paul’s way of living was used to feed his spiritual children. This was the reason he emphasized his coming to the Thessalonians, his preaching, his way of handling the word of God, and his manner of living. <span class="pg" data-page-id="111" id="111">[111]</span> </p>

Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94112" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> we have the establishing of a holy life for the church life. We have seen that this holy life is constructed of faith, love, and hope. Along with fostering, this life needs to be established. Its establishment involves the three main aspects of its structure; that is, it involves faith, love, and hope. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94113" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul is establishing the believers’ faith, love, and hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuckyEAbPF6VFdsnFbUF-tBPLZIVPWdjTLo1uM4o7PMmqdNkVSwlWS9383SPgzgIH"> We should keep in mind that 1 Thessalonians is a book written to new believers. Therefore, everything in this Epistle is presented in a brief way, not in a profound way. This principle applies in particular to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94114" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span>. In writing this chapter, Paul sought to avoid profound terms. His word here can be compared to that of a father given to young children. But although Paul speaks in a brief way, he covers a number of crucial points. </p>
<p data-content-id="A30ALPHLFGvAMumzxAGPf44wSNTKVEUhqYWG7thJZ3IRzNKRYjXg5WMZZcE10A7Am"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94115" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">3:1</span> Paul says, “Wherefore, when we could bear it no longer, it seemed good for us to be left in Athens alone.” Athens was the chief city of the province of Achaia of the Roman Empire. In this city the apostle Paul preached the gospel to philosophical Greeks (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94116" data-verses="Acts 17:15-34">Acts 17:15-34</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv1q8OEYZLgUTrPLhjVLTrfinBl18iPKNKFpX8RjfEqI1drJPDZEpy7Rp8GKMtNDB"> The word “wherefore” at the beginning of this verse refers us to the previous chapter, especially to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94117" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:17-18">verses 17 and 18</span>. These verses say, “But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a little while in presence, not in heart, were more <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> abundantly eager with much desire to see your face. Wherefore we wanted to come to you, indeed, I Paul, both once and again, and Satan hindered us.” The apostles had been bereaved of the Thessalonian believers in presence and were intensely eager to see them again. This was the reason Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94118" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">3:1</span> that he could bear the situation no longer. The word “wherefore” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94119" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">verse 1</span> indicates that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94120" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> is a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94121" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:17-18">2:17 and 18</span>.

<p data-content-id="JtXz7x0CT7ZFs34GcbxV4NUHZl-g7nztpL9Dkx_PUSXjml8hGQHIQzI-wEFUPfEE8"> Timothy was sent to the Thessalonians to encourage them for the sake of their faith. This indicates that what is covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94126" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> is related to establishing and encouraging. In speaking of the Thessalonians’ faith, Paul returns to the matter of the structure of a holy life for the church life covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94127" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">chapter one</span>. His concern in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94128" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> is with the establishing of such a life. </p>

Concerning this, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94129" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:3">verse 3</span>, “That no one be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed for this.” If we are established in the faith, afflictions will do good to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94130" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Rom. 8:28</span>) according to God’s purpose in His appointment. Otherwise, we may be shaken by the tempter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94131" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:5">1 Thes. 3:5</span>) through the afflictions. The Greek word rendered “appointed” also means destined, set, located. God has destined, appointed, us to pass through afflictions. Hence, afflictions are God’s allotted portion to us, and He has set us, located us, in the situation of afflictions. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aPidR3BXQA0FfEwtqR0RM22YgWrZKYclwnsDDYu6flYGk97bs2AMHTR8ZXmHqtBgA">TWO ASPECTS OF FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="bIitKE5sCdBDyj_cAMJWW_--FIZ8b1WOJNT51apa6xXfGWaEAipyX08YSJ99K9EgQ"> We need to consider carefully the meaning of faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94132" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">1 Thessalonians 3</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94133" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:2">verse 2</span> faith is not only subjective, <span class="pg" data-page-id="119" id="119">[119]</span> referring to the saints’ believing, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94134" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:5">verses 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94135" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:6">6</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94136" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:10">10</span>, but also objective, referring to what they believe in, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94137" data-verses="1Timothy 3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94138" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">4:1</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94139" data-verses="2Timothy 4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>. These two aspects of faith involve each other. Our believing (subjective faith) is out of the things we believe and in the things we believe (objective faith). </p>
<p data-content-id="qLQhpzpBKjIYPlHN1GLuFvpSAobcW8RgLDaUIpUuDL6ei6jyMLDEgEMAfFcGoZtsQ"> The word faith in 1 Thessalonians is somewhat difficult to understand. The reason for this difficulty is that in the New Testament there are two aspects of faith, the objective aspect and the subjective aspect. Doctrinally speaking, the objective aspect comes first and produces the subjective aspect. The objective faith denotes those things in which we believe for our salvation. It includes the content of the new covenant. Thus, the content of the new covenant is equal to the objective faith. This aspect of faith is emphasized strongly in a book like 1 Timothy. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94140" data-verses="1Timothy 1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span> speaks of the faith. The faith in that verse is objective and refers to the things we believe in. However, the same verse also mentions subjective faith when it speaks of “holding faith and a good conscience.” This subjective faith refers to our act of believing. </p>
<p data-content-id="yB1ksNBRYHxTj7QPg1uVLVK0HB1WRhXHIO8IM2qYpcTECvPxdx_zaTo42BSvYsPX4"> Christians often speak of the faith in an objective sense. Someone may ask what your faith is, meaning what you believe. This aspect of faith, the objective aspect, is not a matter of our action of believing, but a matter of what we believe. This objective faith includes the contents of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="8cPX_DZ1NZiP6a_9Wg7XrsKq0YlDZdVNQnM6gzmvym8GTi_2HJ_YhTmTbXrE3jNwj"> When we receive a word concerning the objective faith, the contents of God’s New Testament economy, spontaneously subjective faith is produced in us. We respond to the objective faith by believing. This means that we hear of the objective faith, and then subjective faith rises up in us. This subjective faith is our act of believing. </p>
<p data-content-id="0hD1ZBgUTPzaG8c-SeO6nAHtzoZfi4cmKoc26nw7bhK39fJcpOzMONPcbArkDuhSm"> Subjective faith does not happen once for all. On the contrary, from the time we began to believe, the action of believing has been going within us, for the Christian life is a life of faith, a life of believing. Day by day we are living a believing life. We do not live according to what we see; we <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> live according to what we believe. As Paul says, “We walk by faith, not by appearance” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94141" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:7">2 Cor. 5:7</span>). Our walk is by faith, not by sight. </p>
<p data-content-id="7sR-0mypahaHMs2g9J45pUAX55o3ZVTB0cEhhsJucZxRygIoDxtPQPytkWVluLorP"> All the matters we are talking about in these messages are matters of faith. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94142" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</span> says that Christ is in us to be our hope of glory. We receive this word in faith. By faith we believe in His coming back, and by faith we await a crown. Our speaking concerning these things is altogether by faith. Therefore, those who do not have faith do not have any idea of what we are saying. To them, our word is either superstitious or nonsensical. They can neither believe it nor accept it. Worldly people, unbelievers, do not have faith. As a result, they cannot understand what we are saying or the way we are living. Our living is absolutely a life of believing. </p>
<p data-content-id="_QDBmUX8WJQab_PzMdLxsGughfDPcCHmyxi6-djlAncQ1_sZMpZv-DlQj8PRnkuJV"> The objective aspect of faith is profound. We cannot say that we are perfect or altogether complete with respect to the objective faith. God’s economy is profound. The content of His economy is Christ as the all-inclusive and all-extensive One. It is because God’s economy is so profound and rich in its content that we dare not say that the objective faith has been perfected among us. We need to see that our objective faith includes the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ as the content of God’s economy. We do not yet know this content adequately or realize it fully. Thus, we still need to lay hold of more of the all-inclusive Christ, more of Christ as the content of our objective faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="BCWyd8haR9z8YbNTjOdhrcTYxqEe4v6HadbmkNozZyDVMbab6pVmNvLqgqdfus6dL"> Praise the Lord that this objective faith produces subjective believing! When we receive a revelation concerning Christ, we cannot keep ourselves from believing in Him. Faith is spontaneously infused into our being, and we automatically believe in Christ. Unbelievers find it impossible to believe that Christ is in us. We, however, cannot help but believe that Christ lives in us. He is in us to be our life, our life supply, and our everything. We have seen a vision of the indwelling Christ, and we have no choice except to believe that He is actually in us. Because we have seen a revelation regarding the content of God’s economy, we cannot help <span class="pg" data-page-id="121" id="121">[121]</span> believing in what we have seen. We have been infused with the ability to believe, and now we have subjective faith, the inward action of believing. </p>

For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94178" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:10">3:10</span> he expressed his desire to come to the Thessalonians and perfect what was lacking in their faith. To be sure, these new believers were lacking in many aspects of the faith revealed in Romans, Ephesians, and Galatians.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94180" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">chapter one</span> we have the structure and origin of a holy life for the church life; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94181" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">chapter two</span>, the fostering of such a life; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94182" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> the establishing of the three items of the basic structure of this life. After covering these matters, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94183" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul injects an inoculation into the believers concerning the most serious germ that damages the church life, the germ of fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="V47gZ_dXfuuIX5rvOaHiq3ko1XLh4Vg8gDL3sGU0zCRAbwE18cUk5AJ5tvMsJdAip"> Fornication has its source in lust. People would never have a chance to indulge themselves in this lust if they did not have some form of social life. Social life is a hotbed of fornication. A person who does not have a social life is not in danger of falling into fornication. If you live alone and have little contact with others, it is very unlikely that you will commit fornication. But the church life is a meeting life, a communal life. In other words, the church life is a social life. In order to have the church life, we cannot avoid having a communal life, a social life, in which we have considerable contact with one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6E87y3trDUylNZBtiqNQ-9Tzo6W4r-esxSBka8sEOylvP_w8A7ox6JxMWlYAvz7M"> According to history, the problem of fornication has come up over and over again in one church after another. The facts prove that Christian workers in particular are often snared by fornication because they have so much contact with others. Furthermore, fornication has been the factor in damage caused to those in the Pentecostal movement. In certain places this movement has been limited because of the sin of fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="1-pomZlgQoWjecGSJDYVh5kAUyFdSE6StM7PrUK1NuPTdz167iZ-u6dQnK8mLseqR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94184" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:3">4:3</span> Paul says, “For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you abstain from fornication.” God’s will is that His redeemed people, the believers in Christ, should live a life of holiness according to His holy nature, a life wholly separated unto Him from anything other than Him. For this He is sanctifying us thoroughly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94185" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">5:23</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="131" id="131">[131]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="9flVS1cmSfOycwab-O9mkLeF0p70S8vxBNHBpzGHG1W5xYaLyua_nLL4WijlX1bnt"> At Paul’s time, both in Corinth and Thessalonica sensuality and immorality were rife in the pagan religions and even fostered by their pagan worship. Man was made for expressing God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94186" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). Nothing ruins man for this purpose more than fornication. This prevents man from being holy, separated unto God, and contaminates man to the uttermost in the fulfilling of God’s holy purpose. Hence, the apostle strongly charges the newly converted Gentile believers, by sanctification unto God, to abstain from the damage and contamination of fornication, the most gross sin in the eyes of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="jJlXGtE9dmnAbo96hq_afbpNzm3SVfmdnM6jQYTFN1r5Wxlkm_IhagOk0lBnA9Qlf"> Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94187" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">1 Thessalonians 4</span> Paul gives us a warning concerning fornication. He also spoke strongly about fornication in 1 Corinthians. Because there was so much immorality in Corinth and Thessalonica, Paul realized that along with fostering and establishing the saints in Thessalonica, it was necessary for him to warn them about the sin of fornication. Now we can understand why in a book to new believers Paul thought it necessary to speak about fornication. He wanted the saints in that evil city to be aware of the danger. As the church in such a place, they needed a warning about fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKq_WCxkl5nNdZM5kxAUuPY75kTq4EIeaamYKTiVNIqMSbG1bgg6uip7wz2vtNsvO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94188" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:20">1 Corinthians 16:20</span> Paul says, “Greet one another with a holy kiss.” Paul did not forbid the Corinthians to have contact with one another, for that would have been inhuman. However, Paul charged them to greet one another with a holy kiss. Such a word was written against the background of the situation in Corinth. In the same principle, fornication is dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94189" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">1 Thessalonians 4</span> because of the environment of Thessalonica. A young church had been raised up in the midst of an evil, immoral environment. Knowing that it would be difficult for the church in that city to avoid problems with fornication, Paul issued a warning regarding it. </p>
<p data-content-id="nP53GGFF52Y1qHvb0rabXz6rUWux1rnGcVgwjaanWJeYqQkaPPlDlZgyTasQ-zucu"> We also need this warning today. In the United States and Europe males and females have social contact with hardly any limitation. Because of this situation, it is easy for people to fall into fornication. In order for churches to exist <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> in these regions, there is a need of a warning concerning fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="6xcopxZjZK6F8a_6vdWQGxhLpkZxtkEMykk7RM5bVFcW7sYmcwcuj6n2QjN1MHxkK"> As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94190" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1-12">4:1-12</span>, we see that Paul’s tone here is one of warning. The tone is different from that found in the first three chapters. After Paul has completed his task of fostering and establishing a holy life for the church life, he changes his tone. The first warning he gives us concerns fornication. As we shall see, in his warning about fornication, Paul brings in the wonderful matter of sanctification. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RoDIchE9_Iy0jaepjOKGXQjPSYEYGyxjE73uMxz9XOqbO3oRIuXM4GqsmQt1FITKE">SANCTIFICATION VERSUS FORNICATION</h2><p data-content-id="sxDbeBfxVsm3l4Hj5KloIsHIPS5yFuh-xvJD64afSeZNshQy_rbupcQFuR1kJCcVN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94191" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">4:1</span> Paul says, “For the rest therefore, brothers, we ask and entreat you in the Lord Jesus, that even as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, even as indeed you do walk, that you abound more.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94192" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:3">verse 3</span> Paul says that the will of God is our sanctification. This sanctification is versus fornication. In order to have a walk that pleases God, we need to be sanctified. </p>
<p data-content-id="wlGQFARrTrj_EDLb1Z5NJFsBCV39AzrRFKxf9piQFg1lcHFyW_sieswfArCE66mXm"> Nothing damages a believer as much as fornication. According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94193" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:1">1 Corinthians 6</span>, fornication ruins a person’s body. Other sins may not damage us subjectively, but fornication damages our body, contaminates our entire being, and makes us utterly unholy. Moreover, fornication is used by God’s enemy to spoil the man God created for the fulfillment of His purpose. Therefore, fornication must be altogether abandoned. This is the reason Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94194" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:3">4:3</span>, “Abstain from fornication.” The word “abstain” is strong, and it indicates that we should run away from fornication. God’s will is to have us fully separated unto Himself, wholly sanctified for the fulfillment of His purpose. This requires that we abstain from fornication. </p>
<p data-content-id="LPYR-Rf_6uFcNnPhzwX_Lnd5SjvP79sa03VQZkY-DXE4rNinniEkq_ZS-2ehIt9XO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94195" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> Paul continues, “That each one of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in the passion of lust, even as also the nations who do not know God.” To possess one’s vessel is to keep it, to preserve it. There are two schools of interpretation of the word vessel here; one refers the vessel to man’s body, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94196" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>; the other to his wife, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94197" data-verses="1Peter 3:7">1 Peter 3:7</span>. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="133" id="133">[133]</span> context in this verse and the following one, with phrases “each one of you,” “in sanctification and honor,” and especially “not in the passion of lust,” does not justify the interpretation of the second school, but that of the first. The apostle considers man’s body here as his vessel, just as David did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94198" data-verses="1Samuel 21:5">1 Samuel 21:5</span>. In the same matter concerning the use of the body, both Paul and David consider man’s body as his vessel. To keep or preserve man’s vessel in sanctification and honor, not in the passion of lust, is the safeguard against committing fornication. </p>

Here, as a word of comfort, the rapture of believers at the Lord’s coming is mentioned in a general way. Concerning this matter, details are revealed in other books of the New Testament, such as Matthew and Revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="bIitKE5sCdBDyj_cAMJWW_--FIZ8b1WOJNT53apH0xXfGWaEAipyX08YSJ99K9EgQ"> What Paul describes in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94227" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:13-18">4:13-18</span> is the general hope of all believers. This is the hope of a holy life for the church life. This kind of life is neither sinful nor worldly. On the contrary, it is pure and holy. Furthermore, this holy life for the church life has a hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="qLQhpzpBKjIYPlHN1GLuFvpSAobcW8RgLDaUKpU3ML6ei6jyMLDEgEMAfFcGoZtsQ"> Because of man’s fall there is no hope for the fallen human race. The only expectation unbelievers have is death. Death is their destination. Day by day, they are living with a view toward their death, and they are on the way to death. Thus, death is their future. </p>
<p data-content-id="yB1ksNBRYHxTj7QPg1uVLVK0HB1WRhXHIO8IO2q9lcTECvPxdx_zaTo42BSvYsPX4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94228" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span> Paul describes the hopeless situation of unbelievers: “You were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.” Unbelievers have no hope because they do not have God. Because they are apart from Christ and their living is without God, they do not have any hope. The only thing that awaits them is death. Everyone realizes this and takes it for granted. For this reason, unbelievers do not like to think about their future. Actually, they do not have a positive future. In their future looms the darkness of death. <span class="pg" data-page-id="140" id="140">[140]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="8cPX_DZ1NZiP6a_9Wg7XrsKq0YlDZdVNQnM6izmO_m8GTi_2HJ_YhTmTbXrE3jNwj"> As those who believe in Christ, we have a life full of hope. Our hope is the Lord’s coming back. Furthermore, our hope includes resurrection and rapture. Resurrection is not only a matter of life but a matter of life overcoming death. When life overcomes death, that is resurrection. Rapture is something that goes even beyond resurrection. A person may be resurrected and yet not be raptured. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0hD1ZBgUTPzaG8c-SeO6nAHtzoZfi4cmKoc24nw7ThK39fJcpOzMONPcbArkDuhSm">RESURRECTION AND RAPTURE</h2><p data-content-id="7sR-0mypahaHMs2g9J45pUAX55o3ZVTB0cEhjsJuUZxRygIoDxtPQPytkWVluLorP"> The holy life for the church life is a life with a future, a life with hope. This hope is not merely the Lord’s coming; it is the Lord’s coming with resurrection and rapture. The coming back of the Lord Jesus will cause the resurrection and the rapture to occur. As we have just pointed out, resurrection and rapture are both in addition to life. Today life is our possession. We have life, we are in life, and we are enjoying life. However, we are awaiting the Lord’s coming, and His coming will bring resurrection and rapture. </p>
<p data-content-id="_QDBmUX8WJQab_PzMdLxsGughfDPcCHmyxi68djpCncQ1_sZMpZv-DlQj8PRnkuJV"> Resurrection, of course, is for those who have died. Today we are living a holy life for the church. If the Lord delays His coming back, we all shall eventually “sleep,” that is, die physically. All the believers who have died are waiting for resurrection. If we live until the coming back of the Lord Jesus, we shall not need resurrection. However, we shall still need rapture. Furthermore, those who have died will need to be resurrected and raptured as well. All believers, the dead as well as the living, need rapture. Rapture, therefore, is actually the end of our life on earth. This means that the conclusion of our life is neither death nor resurrection—it is rapture. </p>
<p data-content-id="BCWyd8haR9z8YbNTjOdhrcTYxqEe4v6HadbmmNo_byDVMbab6pVmNvLqgqdfus6dL"> In the Scriptures there is not such a word as rapture, but the thought of rapture is there. As used by Christian teachers, the word rapture means to be taken away, as what happened to Enoch and Elijah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94229" data-verses="Genesis 5:24">Gen. 5:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94230" data-verses="2Kings 2:1">2 Kings 2:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94231" data-verses="2Kings 2:11">11</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94232" data-verses="Matthew 24:40-41">Matthew 24:40-41</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94233" data-verses="Luke 17:34-36">Luke 17:34-36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94234" data-verses="Luke 21:36">21:36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94235" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94236" data-verses="Revelation 3:10">Revelation 3:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94237" data-verses="Revelation 7:9">7:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94238" data-verses="Revelation 11:12">11:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94239" data-verses="Revelation 12:5">12:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94240" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">14:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94241" data-verses="Revelation 14:16">16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94242" data-verses="Revelation 15:2">15:2</span> all refer to rapture, to the taking up of the believers to the heavens. <span class="pg" data-page-id="141" id="141">[141]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="x-5TzPFIe1rIQs4lj3UuDgHej2EVbVpf4cT1mc6AHGETSeJOeoTmYx_rQmwxTdPcU"> In the New Testament the rapture is an important subject. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94243" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:13-18">4:13-18</span> Paul speaks of it only in a general, elementary way. He tells us that the living, together with those believers who have died and have been resurrected, will be caught up to a meeting of the Lord in the air. In these verses Paul does not go further to explain the details. What he says here can be compared to an elementary school teacher giving his students some basic principles of mathematics. Actually, the rapture is not a simple matter. For this reason, there has been much debate among Bible teachers concerning it. </p>
<p data-content-id="rX-pp2YZBRZeApP_hIf0dxnsF4yO--IEe2yAcFf4RQeF6OL59cEoE8YtMK_ljJiwr"> Paul’s intention is to give the new believers a basic concept of the hope of our Christian life. He wants to impress them with the fact that the Christian life, which is a holy life for the church life, has a hope. Therefore, this life is absolutely different from the hopeless life of fallen mankind. The hope of the Christian life is the Lord’s coming back, and this hope includes resurrection and rapture. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRDmgjXjfWKDT94A3PP3I3d56B_w2TzxjmuOuA8OtmsqkzwL5vgteeA7WnGZqA_b-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94244" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:13">verse 13</span> Paul says, “But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are sleeping, that you may not sorrow even as also the rest who have no hope.” The words “those who are sleeping” refer to the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94245" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:16">v. 16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94246" data-verses="John 11:11-14">John 11:11-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94247" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:30">1 Cor. 11:30</span>). The death of believers is considered by both the Lord and the apostle as sleep. Perhaps by the time Paul wrote this Epistle some of the believers in Thessalonica had died. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for Paul to write about this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qi-xjcnIifom2ZX0YUSajXc_A60S7buDkmlxjAMG5LRGtVI6n1Ur9wktSKyeMiSC_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94248" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:14">verse 14</span> Paul continues, “For if we believe that Jesus died and rose, so also those who are asleep will God, through Jesus, bring together with Him.” To believe in the hope described here includes believing in the Lord’s resurrection. Anyone who does not believe in Christ’s resurrection will not believe in this hope. But if we believe in this hope, this indicates that we have already believed in Christ’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kv_-aIQvobBgJbFzV1nXpXo0GOSod5yAWetsO0KcwD0LrnoyctbAikhOp590DzbxS"> Some may refer to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94249" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:14">verse 14</span> and say, “When the saints die, they go to heaven, and when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will bring them from heaven with Him.” To interpret the verse in this way is to neglect the first half of the verse, where <span class="pg" data-page-id="142" id="142">[142]</span> we are told that Jesus died and rose. This, of course, refers to His resurrection. If the dead saints are already in heaven, and if the Lord will bring them with Him from heaven when He comes, then the dead saints do not need resurrection. </p>

If the dead are already in heaven, what need is there for them to rise? If they are truly in heaven, they do not need to rise. Furthermore, they do not need to be raptured or to be caught up to the Lord. Their only need would be to descend from heaven with the Lord Jesus. The fact that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94252" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:16">verse 16</span> says that the dead in Christ shall rise indicates that they must be in some place other than heaven. </p>

We have a wonderful hope, a hope that the Lord Jesus will come back and that we shall be raptured to Him. Along with this hope, we need watchfulness and soberness. As we are hoping, we need to watch and be sober. For this reason, 1 Thessalonians does not end with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94288" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span>. In this wonderful book for new believers, Paul adds yet a further word concerning watchfulness and soberness. Once again, we should follow Paul’s pattern. We should not simply encourage new believers in their hope. We should also go on to tell them that along with this hope, they need to be watchful and sober. They should not be asleep, and they should not be drunk or in some kind of stupor. </p>
<p data-content-id="dRDmgjXjfWKDT94A3PP3I3d56B_w2TzxjmuOvA8ThmsqkzwL5vgteeA7WnGZqA_b-"> As Paul was writing the last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94289" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span>, I believe that he was burdened to speak a word on the watchfulness and soberness of a holy life for the church life. If this book concluded at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94290" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span>, and if we did not have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94291" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1-11">5:1-11</span>, some believers may be misled. In fact, because they isolate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94292" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:13-18">4:13-18</span> from the rest of this Epistle, Christians have been misled or even drugged in their mentality. Therefore, as we apply <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94293" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span> to our situation, we should not neglect <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94294" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1-11">5:1-11</span>. This means that as we wait for the Lord’s coming back, we need to be watchful and also sober. </p>

The day of the Lord in this chapter is mainly for warning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94299" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:3-6">vv. 3-6</span>), since it is mentioned in the Word mostly in relation to the Lord’s judgment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94300" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:8">1 Cor. 1:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94301" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:13">3:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94302" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:5">5:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94303" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:14">2 Cor. 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94304" data-verses="2Timothy 4:8">2 Tim. 4:8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="sxDbeBfxVsm3l4Hj5KloIsHIPS5yFuh-xvJD44afaeZNshQy_rbupcQFuR1kJCcVN"> The fact that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night indicates that its coming is kept secret and that it will come suddenly. It is not known beforehand by anyone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94305" data-verses="Matthew 24:42-43">Matt. 24:42-43</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94306" data-verses="Revelation 3:3">Rev. 3:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94307" data-verses="Revelation 16:15">16:15</span>). This thought is strengthened by what Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94308" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:3">verse 3</span>: “Whenever they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as birth pangs to a woman with child, and they shall by no means escape.” </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94310" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:4">verse 4</span> Paul reminds us that we are not in darkness that the day should overtake us as a thief, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94311" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:5">verse 5</span> he points out that we are sons of light and of the day, and thus are not of the night nor of darkness. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94312" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:6">verse 6</span> he exhorts us to watch and be sober: “So then, let us not sleep as the rest, but let us watch and be sober.” To sleep here is to be unwatchful. Watch is versus sleep (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94313" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:7">v. 7</span>), and sober is versus drunk. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94314" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:7">verse 7</span> Paul says, “For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk, are drunk in the night.” Here to be drunk is to be in a stupor. </p>
<p data-content-id="mtikvaKTaj-1XMvs8wpwa1Oma0heVqReLgo4DpcJMjc2daQbfu4sMgo80mpCCHIbe"> Christians are familiar with the word watchful. However, we probably do not know the real meaning of this word. What does it mean to be watchful? Our answer will be too vague if we merely say that to be watchful is not to sleep. In this case, as with many other things, we may take for granted <span class="pg" data-page-id="149" id="149">[149]</span> that we understand what the Bible says, when actually we do not understand the matter at all. The same is true about what it means to be sober. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuckyEAbPF6VFdsnFbUF-tBPLZIVPWdjTLo1tM4x0PMmqdNkVSwlWS9383SPgzgIH"> To be watchful and to be sober are related to safeguarding the three basic structures of the holy life for the church life: faith, love, and hope. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94315" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:8">Verse 8</span> indicates this: “But we who are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and a helmet, the hope of salvation.” The words breastplate and helmet both indicate spiritual warfare. The breastplate is of faith and love, covering and protecting our heart and spirit according to God’s righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94316" data-verses="Ephesians 6:14">Eph. 6:14</span>). The helmet is the hope of salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94317" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17">Eph. 6:17</span>), covering and protecting our mentality, the mind. Faith, love, and hope are the three basic structures of the genuine Christian life as depicted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94318" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>. Faith is related to our will—a part of our heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94319" data-verses="Romans 10:9">Rom. 10:9</span>)—and to our conscience—a part of our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94320" data-verses="1Timothy 1:19">1 Tim. 1:19</span>). Love is related to our emotion, another part of our heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94321" data-verses="Matthew 22:37">Matt. 22:37</span>); and hope is related to our understanding—a function of our mind. All of these need to be protected that a genuine Christian life may be maintained. Such a life is watchful and sober. At the beginning of this Epistle, the apostle praised the believers’ work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94322" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:3">1:3</span>). Here, at the conclusion of the Epistle, he exhorts them to keep these spiritual virtues covered and protected by fighting for them. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="A30ALPHLFGvAMumzxAGPf44wSNTKVEUhqYWG4thsV3IRzNKRYjXg5WMZZcE10A7Am">HOPE IN THE LORD’S COMING BACK</h2><p data-content-id="Fv1q8OEYZLgUTrPLhjVLTrfinBl18iPKNKFpU8RCSEqI1drJPDZEpy7Rp8GKMtNDB"> The hope spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94323" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:8">verse 8</span> is the hope of our Lord’s coming back, which will be our salvation from both the coming destruction and from the slavery of corruption of the old creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94324" data-verses="Romans 8:21-25">Rom. 8:21-25</span>). Salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94325" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span> is not salvation from eternal perdition through the Lord’s death, but salvation from the coming destruction through the Lord’s coming back. </p>
<p data-content-id="CA2ne1_5bfKAMoAUV7_pxOD6zXt-CnOOBbMs4dsjURn80uZ_MrLT0dvo5cer3i9d6"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94326" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:8">verse 8</span>, we need armor to safeguard our faith, love, and hope. If we would protect these aspects of the basic structure of a holy life for the church life, we need to be watchful and sober. Therefore, being watchful and sober <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> is part of the living we should have as we hope in the Lord’s coming back. </p>
<p data-content-id="PvlzyEwtbfaE7dcp1AZigMEHhz2b1bu7w6GGONtclncXXzvbopCUAjv2qRcFWs_cL"> We have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94327" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul comforts us with this hope, telling us that at the Lord’s coming we shall be raptured. We shall be transported into a state of ecstasy to meet with the Lord in the air. However, this hope requires a living of watchfulness and soberness. We need a life of watchfulness and soberness in order to wait for the Lord’s coming. In other words, as we exercise our hope in the Lord’s coming back, we need a watching life and a sober life. If we are watchful and sober, we shall protect, safeguard, the basic structure of our Christian life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="--A9tOzHYDUrCmdOWAIFncdoMx0RF9eVBJ7r3qYwwYooQV8XhK1-u2ercsLhu_HQs">THE MEANING OF WATCHFULNESS</h2><p data-content-id="pMhYsahJI5wFpPZMEaVCaMpl2TYpBLhnqkBiYANDFXI-dH8RBwNQcL5f-_s9o8t-w"> Now we come to the crucial matter of understanding what it means to be watchful and sober. Watchfulness here is related to a battle, a fighting. Some versions use the word vigilant, a word related to warfare. Soldiers in a battle need to be watchful, vigilant. The fact that watchfulness is related to fighting is confirmed by Paul’s mention of the breastplate and helmet in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94328" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:8">verse 8</span>. A breastplate and helmet are not ordinary items of dress. They are, of course, part of the armor used by soldiers in fighting. Paul’s concept of being watchful and sober, therefore, is related to fighting, to warfare. In these verses Paul is talking about some kind of battle. </p>
<p data-content-id="veeEis16kr1eWkl89FSXGGvAIAd1n7JfJQGON4HQkLymBkA8VUroEFKs095i3rIZI"> There are sugar-coated teachings about the Lord’s coming and the rapture revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94329" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span>, but these teachings do not prepare believers for fighting. Instead, they cause them to be drugged and in a stupor. It is important for us to see that watchfulness refers to a proper spirit in fighting a battle. If we grasp this thought, we shall have in large measure the proper understanding of what it means to be watchful. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94350" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1">5:1</span>, this further word is related to the times and the seasons. </p>
<p data-content-id="EkqXZ3ZGPbg7a6upPVuGEy7UjjwDYYSw0r2h775tpgjHbIaeg4iiigj7VuGmRNXxT"> As a young believer, when I heard messages about the Lord’s coming, I was very excited. It is common for new believers to be excited when they hear about the Lord’s coming back. They may expect the Lord to come at any moment. For this reason, they need Paul’s further word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94351" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1">chapter five</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dt1F5y4bglLMcU1ASZAfhBuLHJnv9gmMRDLejwgW8uAAL2d0i93C5tMseEpyj-kzq"> The “times and the seasons” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94352" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1">verse 1</span> refer to the Lord’s coming. This is confirmed by the expression “the day of the Lord” in the following verse. The coming of the day of the Lord is different from what we imagine. Actually, it is a mystery. The Lord Jesus even said that, as a man, He did not know the time of His coming. The date of the Lord’s coming is absolutely hidden as a mystery in the Father’s heart, and this mystery has not been revealed. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94353" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:2">5:2</span> Paul says that the day of the Lord “so comes as a thief in the night.” To be sure, no thief would give an advance warning that he is coming to steal something. In the same principle, the day of the Lord will come suddenly and unexpectedly. Thus, we need to be watchful and sober. Because we have no way to figure out the time of the Lord’s coming, we need to be watchful and sober. <span class="pg" data-page-id="158" id="158">[158]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="SRrfl4Rfr7o15GXA3sDWwKhTV_svLp_nz79SYeECFz70kMUXSJb-m6Tr6vzalb5J2"> After covering the matter of watchfulness and soberness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94354" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1-11">5:1-11</span>, Paul turns in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94355" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:12-24">5:12-24</span> to our cooperation with the divine operation. In these verses Paul covers a number of items in an elementary way. </p>
<p data-content-id="Kv_-aIQvobBgJbFzV1nXpXo0GOSod5yAWetsA0Kc4D0LrnoyctbAikhOp590DzbxS"> In the New Testament there is no book that ends in such a marvelous and all-inclusive way as 1 Thessalonians. Paul’s concluding word includes a number of crucial things, which Paul did not have the time to cover in detail. Therefore, he listed them together in one section toward the end of this Epistle. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lxpR8BQGIrxvvLJ_yJlo4K8ImRa4DgdFNNkXL5vTyazXeq77QRIZ2tZVg4w6F-XSH">RESPECTING THE LEADING ONES</h2><p data-content-id="OA3-cOJusChKO18oWh4UFQc5aqjSR6E2DyzNnVwqAqEQ3WOI7R0azcz1hmbgdmMAk"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94356" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:12">Verse 12</span> says, “Now we ask you, brothers, to know those who labor among you and take the lead among you in the Lord, and admonish you; and to regard them most highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.” The word “know” here means first to recognize and then render respect and regard. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94357" data-verses="Matthew 7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>, when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will say to certain ones, “I never knew you.” The expression, “I never knew you” means not to appreciate or respect what was done. In the same principle, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94358" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:12">verse 12</span> the word “know” means to appreciate and respect those who labor among us and who take the lead among us. Here Paul probably refers to the elders who labor in teaching and take the lead among the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94359" data-verses="1Timothy 5:17">1 Tim. 5:17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="4EXbfaQJqUx_CzAJxU-ff2J1S9n7f9MwwAxit39v5HzRv3fRDkWotHsE_dbBH8bvI"> To take the lead is not mainly to rule, but to set an example in doing things first that others may follow. The elders should not only labor in teaching, but also do things as an example. The example may become a ground for their admonition. </p>
<p data-content-id="oKMKMaRjikwDyJPmsV1URnuOdxon88RAycLFX_7gYmDQlkQtD1XdGDP_8m0A36E2k"> It is indeed marvelous that, although the church in Thessalonica had been in existence less than a year and Paul had spent only three Sabbaths working there, some leading ones had been raised up. In a short period of time a church was established, and some leading ones were produced. Paul surely was a qualified and skillful Christian worker. <span class="pg" data-page-id="159" id="159">[159]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="3rdNAYtVwEyij9wG-6AfQj2JV6iHrXR6556Z5E4davqsljBTWTcHI_Ft3DQrOhyqI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94360" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:13">verse 13</span> Paul charges us to regard the leading ones most highly in love because of their work. The word “regard” here means to lead the mind through a reasoning process to a conclusion; hence, it is to think, consider, estimate, esteem, regard. The leading ones should regard themselves as slaves serving the saints. But the believers should regard them highly in love because of their work. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_zrNHrxwZy6Tw-DBBK4kvT-A6hUSaQ-RJPUEYpuJt6EP_s8vw4VwF94uMkN5b7I2"> As Paul was writing this Epistle, one thought followed upon another. As we have pointed out, the subject of the preceding section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94361" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1-11">5:1-11</span>) is watchfulness and soberness. The Christian life is a life of fighting for God’s interests, and we need to be watchful and alert. Then Paul goes on to say that we must learn to respect, honor, the leading ones in the church. It seems that the matters of watchfulness and soberness and respecting the leading ones have no logical connection. However, they are related in a very practical way. If we are on the alert, full of watchfulness in spiritual warfare, we shall surely honor the leading ones. Those who have had experience in military service know that soldiers must respect their commanding officers. If they have no respect for the officers, the leaders, the army will not be able to fight properly. The first thing a soldier must learn in order to fight is to respect the one leading him. I believe that this was Paul’s concept in turning to the matter of respecting the leading ones at this point. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cCqkCtDrfAjqWKDdS6Vs6VmCvzi-pPdKlzd_ZqHr6ttTSNo9XLe6EO3QFHJQi1MYb">TO BE AT PEACE</h2><p data-content-id="YaG_U9sLIYg2lh7K7i_iFyTDyxJwzL1IY2ezaS6elTyZKGoGENj8o4nF0O2U5vS5_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94362" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:13">verse 13</span> Paul gives this exhortation: “Be at peace among yourselves.” To regard the leading ones and to be at peace with one another is a proper condition of a local church. But if the saints in a local church do not respect the leading ones, there will be no peace. The same principle applies to the family life. If the children do not respect their parents, how can there be peace? In such a situation it will be impossible for a family to have peace. In like manner, there will not be peace in an army if the soldiers have no respect for the officers. <span class="pg" data-page-id="160" id="160">[160]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="EkqXZ3ZGPbg7a6upPVuGEy7UjjwDYYSw0r2h7750qgjHbIaeg4iiigj7VuGmRNXxT"> The sequence of Paul’s thoughts in these verses is significant. First, we need to be watchful and sober in fighting the spiritual warfare. Second, we must highly regard the leading ones. Then we shall be at peace among ourselves. </p>

Acting on their own, they are disorderly and do not care for the proper order in the church life. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94364" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:14">verse 14</span>, all the brothers, not only the leading ones, should admonish the disorderly. This means that all the saints must function to shepherd others and edify them. </p>
<p data-content-id="gIBX5-uTu_oOuD9VXih65CFcautNKByF3-U_1bgPNxjWZ8mTMrKtHaztQ6rUNJWaU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94365" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:14">verse 14</span> Paul also encourages us to console the fainthearted. Literally, the Greek word for fainthearted is “of little soul.” It refers to being narrow and weak in the capacity of mind, will, and emotion. Those who are little-souled have a very limited capacity to bear sufferings or difficulties. Among the saints there are some who are born with such a small soul. They need to be comforted, consoled. </p>
<p data-content-id="eh6cQ09n6Bw__Z5JeWH33mLs7ZISWSbNLSjCeYrkBly0wqOih9W9Ju3nQ77suk8at"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94366" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:14">verse 14</span> Paul also encourages us to uphold the weak. The weak here probably refers to the weak ones in general, who are weak either in their spirit, soul, or body, or weak in faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94367" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Rom. 14:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94368" data-verses="Romans 15:1">15:1</span>). Some saints among us are weak. They may be weak in body or in spirit, weak in heart or in will. Some are weak in their faith or weak in praying. What shall we do with these weak ones? According to Paul’s word, we need to uphold them. </p>
<p data-content-id="5sCf3lJvr4egRboTwX5ig_6IWILttT_9RL5KLD9wXNsduxpQaxqmRo6k53eOI1c4Y"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94369" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:14">verse 14</span> Paul exhorts us to be longsuffering toward all. This implies that in a local church, besides some being disorderly who need admonishing, some being of little soul who need consolation, and some being weak who need upholding, all the members may be a problem in some way and need our longsuffering toward them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="161" id="161">[161]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="NAFmcr0w4h--56l5DrC1uYUEVCX69sjIWIHhOaRz2_7vOOk3V4_SgyG4WBeqTpqW7"> Today we are still in the old creation, not in the New Jerusalem. This is the reason there are many problems among the saints. According to my experience, every one of us can be a problem to others. I may be a problem to you, and you may be a problem to me. On the one hand, we may love all the saints; on the other hand, they may cause us problems. Therefore, we need to be longsuffering toward all. </p>
<p data-content-id="txBalsTbbqEKrVM3p-c1G9OUksUoYsdc6sZkRY6MFPHNx17wBBecEbrNOZVZJyB5w"> We should not dream that the church will be a utopia. On the contrary, the church life is full of problems. If a believer does not have any problems, it is not likely that he will come into the church life. Those who have no problems have no need for the church life. In a sense, the church is a hospital filled with those who are sick. For this reason, we need to be longsuffering toward all the saints. </p>

We may also say that the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94404" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">verse 23</span> is Paul’s blessing, that he blesses the believers with a word concerning the God of peace sanctifying them. </p>

This means that we take the initiative to be preserved. However, God is the One who preserves our <span class="pg" data-page-id="167" id="167">[167]</span> spirit, soul, and body. Therefore, we take the initiative, but God does the work of preserving our entire being. Therefore, we should pray, “Lord, I long to have my spirit, soul, and body preserved.

It is difficult for us to say whether in this verse we have Paul’s prayer or his blessing. It is certain that here we see Paul’s desire, his wish. Paul desired that the God of peace would wholly sanctify the believers and that the believers would have an aspiration for their spirit, soul, and body to be preserved complete and without blame. Can you see in this verse God’s operation and our cooperation? No doubt, the apostle represents God. Thus, Paul’s wish is God’s wish. His desire is God’s desire. This means that God wishes, desires, to sanctify us wholly. But do we have the aspiration for our spirit, soul, and body to be preserved? The sanctifying work is God’s operation, but the aspiration to be preserved is our cooperation. When we have both God’s desire and our aspiration, we then have our cooperation with God’s operation to sanctify us wholly and to preserve our entire being. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94408" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">verse 23</span> Paul seems to be saying, “Are you believers excited that the Lord Jesus will come back?

If you do not practice this matter, you will <span class="pg" data-page-id="168" id="168">[168]</span> not be ready for the Lord’s coming back. You must be sanctified and preserved.

The words “in holiness” do not qualify the verb “establish.” Rather, they qualify the word “blameless.” In this verse Paul is not saying that the Lord establishes our heart in holiness. Instead, he is saying that the Lord is making our heart blameless, and making it blameless in holiness. Thus, we need to find out what it means for our heart to be blameless in holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="LPYR-Rf_6uFcNnPhzwX_Lnd5SjvP79sa03VcckYTIXE4rNinniEkq_ZS-2ehIt9XO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94450" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">Second Thessalonians 2:13</span> says, “But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” This verse speaks of salvation in sanctification, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94451" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>, of being blameless in holiness. To be in holiness is different from being in sanctification. Of course, holiness and sanctification both refer to an element that is holy. However, holiness refers to the element itself, and sanctification refers to the process of being made holy, the process of being sanctified. A process is going on to make us holy; this process is sanctification. Therefore, to be in holiness is to be in the element, and to be in sanctification is to be in the process of being made holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="YaG_U9sLIYg2lh7K7i_iFyTDyxJwzL1IY2e_SS6etTyZKGoGENj8o4nF0O2U5vS5_"> God’s salvation is in sanctification. This means that God’s salvation involves a continuing process through which we are being made holy. As this process is taking place, we enjoy God’s saving power.

<p data-content-id="EkqXZ3ZGPbg7a6upPVuGEy7UjjwDYYSw0r2tz750igjHbIaeg4iiigj7VuGmRNXxT"> Once again I would like to take as an illustration the simple matter of making tea. Tea is an element, and “tea-ification” is the process of making tea. Suppose you have a cup of plain water. In order to tea-ify the water, you need to place a tea bag into it. When a tea bag is first put into water, the water may seem to remain the same. It seems to be little more than plain water. But after a period of time and some action of stirring, the water will become tea-ified; that is, tea is added to the water and mingled with it. Hence, we may say that the water is under the process of tea-ification. Eventually, the tea is in the water, and the water is in the tea. This means that the element of tea is mingled with the water. As a result of this tea-ification, the tea and water are blended together to make one beverage. Actually, this kind of drink is tea-water. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dt1F5y4bglLMcU1ASZAfhBuLHJnv9gmMRDLSrwgz0uAAL2d0i93C5tMseEpyj-kzq"> For the tea to be in the water is one thing, but for the water to pass through the process of tea-ification is another. In like manner, we need to be blameless in the element of holiness, and we also need to undergo the process of sanctification so that we may enjoy God’s salvation daily and even hourly. <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> </p>

We have seen that this Epistle has a basic structure containing three elements: the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope. Paul speaks of this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94452" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:3">1:3</span>: “Remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labor of love, and endurance of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.” With this structure as a basis, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94453" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:9-10">1:9 and 10</span> that the believers turned from idols to serve a living and true God and to wait for His Son from the heavens. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94454" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">chapter two</span> we have the fostering of a holy life for the church life. This fostering is the work of a cherishing mother and exhorting father. The result of the proper fostering is that we walk worthily of God, who calls us into His own kingdom and glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94455" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:12">2:12</span>). In order to have such a walk, we need to be perfected in our faith, and we need to increase and abound in our love. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94456" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul is deeply concerned about the Thessalonians’ faith and love. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94457" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:10">3:10</span>, his desire was to perfect anything that was lacking in their faith. Yes, the Thessalonians had faith, yet it needed perfecting. Paul longed to see them in order to perfect what was lacking in their faith. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94458" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:12">3:12</span> he goes on to say, “And the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we also to you.” As believers, we all need to be perfected in faith and to increase and abound in love. </p>
<p data-content-id="eh6cQ09n6Bw__Z5JeWH33mLs7ZISWSbNLSjOWYroHly0wqOih9W9Ju3nQ77suk8at"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94459" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:13">verse 13</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94460" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> we see the specific reason we need to be perfected in faith and to increase and abound in love: it is that the Lord may establish our hearts blameless in holiness. The establishing of our heart is the issue, the result, of the perfecting of our faith and of the increase and abounding of our love. The Lord is doing a work of building. This building work is to establish our heart. Our heart needs to be built up, to be established blameless. Later we shall seek to explain what the word blameless in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94461" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:13">verse 13</span> means. <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="5sCf3lJvr4egRboTwX5ig_6IWILttT_9RL5GDD98VNsduxpQaxqmRo6k53eOI1c4Y"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94462" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:13">3:13</span> Paul says that the Lord will establish our hearts blameless in holiness. He does not say that our heart will be established blameless in purity or in cleanness. The New Testament emphasizes the matter of a pure heart. The Lord Jesus said, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94463" data-verses="Matthew 5:8">Matt. 5:8</span>). Paul exhorted Timothy to be with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94464" data-verses="2Timothy 2:22">2 Tim. 2:22</span>). Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94465" data-verses="Psalms 51:10">Psalm 51:10</span> David prayed that the Lord would create in him a clean heart. Why, then, does Paul not say blameless in purity or in cleanness, but instead says blameless in holiness? The reason is that the book of 1 Thessalonians is on a holy life for the church life. The conclusion of the first section of this Epistle, composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94466" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">chapters one</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94467" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">two</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94468" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">three</span>, is that the Lord will establish our heart blameless in holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAFmcr0w4h--56l5DrC1uYUEVCX69sjIWIHtGaR_0_7vOOk3V4_SgyG4WBeqTpqW7"> I believe that we all have faith, love, and hope. We have turned to God from idols, we are serving the living God, and we are waiting for the coming back of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, we have faith, love, and hope, and we have the turning, the serving, and the waiting. But we still need to be perfected in our faith. In 1 Thessalonians faith refers to our believing ability and also to what we believe. Faith, therefore, is a great matter. The aspect of objective faith, the things we believe in, is a vast field including many things. The messages we have put out over the years have covered different matters in this field of faith. These messages show us how much the Christian faith, Christian belief, comprises. It even includes the matter of the mingling of the Triune God with saved and regenerated human beings. </p>
<p data-content-id="txBalsTbbqEKrVM3p-c1G9OUksUoYsdc6sZoZY6ALPHNx17wBBecEbrNOZVZJyB5w"> Through the preaching of Paul, the Thessalonians heard the gospel. This means that they heard the faith. Not only did the Thessalonians hear the faith—they received it. However, because Paul was with them such a short time, approximately three weeks, he could not have presented all the contents of the New Testament faith. No wonder he was eager to visit them and see them face to face in order to speak further to them concerning the faith and to perfect them in the faith. Like the Thessalonians, we also need to have our faith perfected. <span class="pg" data-page-id="175" id="175">[175]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="hIMylAEwtWdVBwRfQUfRLKMW4rJjKHx0Mp-MWA9lrN_SE_mZhrV2-nZ1eLy43FCkv"> The Thessalonians had faith and also had love. As believers in Christ, we also love one another. The divine love is without measure; it is immeasurable. Hence, we need to increase and abound in our love. </p>

The inward parts are the parts of our inner being. According to the Bible, man is composed of spirit, soul, and body. The body, our physical being, is visible. This is our outer being. But the spirit and the soul, our inner being, are invisible. The soul includes the mind, the emotion, and the will. Along with all these inward parts of our being, the Bible also speaks of the heart and the conscience. We may say that the Bible is a book that deals with the genuine psychology, for it treats in a full way man’s seven inward parts: the spirit, the soul, the heart, the mind, the will, the emotion, and the conscience. These inward parts are the components of our inward being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pMhYsahJI5wFpPZMEaVCaMpl2TYpBLhnqkBueANWOXI-dH8RBwNQcL5f-_s9o8t-w">THE POSITION OF THE HEART</h2><p data-content-id="veeEis16kr1eWkl89FSXGGvAIAd1n7JfJQGCL4H5sLymBkA8VUroEFKs095i3rIZI"> At this point I would like to raise two questions. First, what is the position of the heart in our inner being? Second, what is the function of the heart? In our study of 1 Thessalonians it is important that we find the answer to these questions. In this basic book to new believers Paul tells them in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94493" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> that they need to be perfected in their faith, and they need their love to increase and abound so <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> that the Lord may establish their hearts. Surely Paul’s word concerning the heart in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94494" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:13">3:13</span> indicates something crucial. Why does Paul not say that the Lord would establish their conscience, or that He would establish their mind, will, or emotion? It is very important that here Paul speaks of the Lord establishing the heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="WPXnirzH1lEWJ6T3Edqw-T-_yRzjQpZZ-9z8wSBC9Dyy6qDNbmJhvX8N_oeaSaogx"> Throughout the years we have emphasized the spirit, and we have stressed the importance of turning to our spirit. Although we have given a number of messages on the heart, we have not emphasized the matter of the heart as much as we have emphasized the spirit. Now we would ask why in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94495" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:13">3:13</span> Paul does not say that the Lord would establish our spirit or our soul, but our heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="f3WRsn_4HmsY4ysIv3pgmsK7x6r6blTBiwmgAJuN6YX3yM8V-_ljmsty6t_55ZLjG"> We know that our being is composed of three main parts—the spirit, the soul, and the body. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94496" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:13">3:13</span>, the end of the first section of 1 Thessalonians, Paul says, “That He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.” However, at the end of the second section, composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94497" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapters four and five</span>, Paul says, “And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94498" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">5:23</span>). Why at the end of this Epistle does Paul mention nothing concerning the heart? What has become of it? What, then, is the relationship of the heart to the three main parts of our being? In order to answer this question, let us consider some verses that indicate the close relationship of the heart to the spirit and the soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="IvdR47VB3n-7XenDM8GyPmro0fRsfGUv39vxJ3vtO2c5aajRe2M8b3uAW-zmkz0lt"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94499" data-verses="Hebrews 4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span> says, “For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.” This verse speaks of the spirit, the soul, and the heart. Once the soul is divided from the spirit, we are able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. The thoughts, of course, are of the mind, and the intents are of the will. According to this verse, the mind and the will are related to <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> the heart, since the thoughts and intents are of the heart. The heart, therefore, includes the mind for thinking and the will for making decisions. This verse indicates that the heart is very close to the soul and the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="HKaPZ9s0uW_5QJUta66QK5pW_zw6zsiLSzDU8jdqR7jQZ8X9eRkV5MRin04yCoZB8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94500" data-verses="Psalms 78:8">Psalm 78:8</span> says, “And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.” In this verse we see that when the forefathers of Israel were stubborn and rebellious, their heart was not set aright, and their spirit was not steadfast. The spirit is not steadfast whenever the heart is not set aright. This verse indicates how close the heart is to the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xn0pqwtoxDJOqYS7mtjJLvxfwTY-Y2GgqqLWw-y7RX7La5uwGvtJYWZijKWKi8weg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94501" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">Matthew 5:3</span> speaks of the spirit, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94502" data-verses="Matthew 5:8">5:8</span>, of the heart. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94503" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">Verse 3</span> says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94504" data-verses="Matthew 5:8">Verse 8</span> says, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” From these verses we see that we need to be poor in spirit and pure in heart. All these verses indicate that our heart is very close to our spirit and also to our soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="kL4P7lF_dG0EBtyXit3fRPQxmUzvXShCcnickVc5JxX0krir36lsXW32wZgnsRp5k"> We have pointed out a number of times in the past that our heart is a composition of all the parts of our soul—the mind, the emotion, and the will—plus one part of our spirit, the conscience. Hence, the heart is a composition of all the parts of the soul and one part of the spirit. Our soul is our personality, our person, our self. The English word psychology is derived from <em>psuche,</em> the Greek word for soul. The soul is the base of all psychological matters. The psuche, the soul, is the “I”; it denotes our being as humans, that is, our personality. This is the reason that in the Bible the number of persons is often given as the number of souls. For example, we are told that seventy souls of the house of Jacob went down to Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="94505" data-verses="Exodus 1:5">Exo. 1:5</span>). This indicates that a person is a soul, for the soul is one’s person. </p>
<p data-content-id="JtXz7x0CT7ZFs34GcbxV4NUHZl-g7nztpL9Phx_PQSXjml8hGQHIQzI-wEFUPfEE8"> As human beings, we have an outward organ, the body, to contact the physical, visible world. We also have an inward organ, the spirit, to contact God and the spiritual realm. The soul, located between these two organs, is our person, our self. <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zeBg-GWsZp3wez2svUPLX8MRamaOUak0V4aUPej58qQ1GDqX9RDjYTZ9ShZ12Rph7">THE FUNCTION OF THE HEART</h2><p data-content-id="aPidR3BXQA0FfEwtqR0RM22YgWrZKYclwnsPGYu6blYGk97bs2AMHTR8ZXmHqtBgA"> The soul is the person himself, but the heart is the person in action. This means that whenever you act, you act by your heart. Therefore, we may say that our heart is our representative in action. We have something in our inner being that represents us, and this representative is our heart. When a brother says to his wife, “Dear, I love you,” this means that his heart loves her. Likewise, whenever we hate something, it is our heart that does the hating. Whenever we enjoy something or dislike something, it is our heart that enjoys or dislikes. Thus, our heart is our representative, the acting commissioner or ambassador, of our inner being. </p>
<p data-content-id="bIitKE5sCdBDyj_cAMJWW_--FIZ8b1WOJNT1wapa2xXfGWaEAipyX08YSJ99K9EgQ"> Because the heart is our representative, Solomon says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94506" data-verses="Proverbs 4:23">Proverbs 4:23</span>, “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” To keep our heart is actually to guard it. The Hebrew word rendered “keep” means guard. We should guard our heart above all because out of it are the issues of life. “Issues” here implies sources and springs as well as issues. Thus, the heart is related to the sources of life, the springs of life, and the issues of life. First we have the source, then the spring, and then the issue. </p>
<p data-content-id="qLQhpzpBKjIYPlHN1GLuFvpSAobcW8RgLDaYNpUuPL6ei6jyMLDEgEMAfFcGoZtsQ"> Out of the heart come all the issues of our daily life. As human beings, we have life, and this life acts through our heart. Using the illustration of electricity and a switch, we may say that the heart is the switch of our inner being, of our human life. As the flow of electricity depends on the switch, so our daily living is dependent on what our heart switches on and off. Our heart is the switch of our human life, of our daily life, of our being. The word “life” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94507" data-verses="Proverbs 4:23">Proverbs 4:23</span> implies an organic element, the element of life; it also implies our daily living and activities, in fact, our entire human life. Hence, the word life in this verse is inclusive. As human beings, we have a human life, and this human life has an organic element and also a daily living. The switch of this life is the heart. </p>

He charges them in the way of sanctification. First he tells them that the will of God is our sanctification. The will of God is that we would be sanctified, kept, preserved, and guarded in sanctification. The best way to abstain from fornication is to be sanctified, preserved, in God’s holiness. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94532" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:3">verse 3</span> he says that the will of God is our sanctification; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94533" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:4">verse 4</span>, that we should know how to possess our vessel, our body, in sanctification and honor; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94534" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:7">verse 7</span>, that God has called us in sanctification. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94535" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:4">4:4</span>, we should possess our body in sanctification and honor. Sanctification is before God, and honor is before man. Every fornicator <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> loses his honor before man.

We need to be sanctified by the God of peace not only in our soul and body, but also in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="txBalsTbbqEKrVM3p-c1G9OUksUoYsdc6sZobY6ADPHNx17wBBecEbrNOZVZJyB5w"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94537" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">5:23</span>, we bear some responsibility for being wholly sanctified. On the one hand, God will sanctify us wholly. On the other hand, our spirit, soul, and body need to be preserved. Although God preserves us, we need to bear a certain amount of responsibility to be preserved. </p>
<p data-content-id="hIMylAEwtWdVBwRfQUfRLKMW4rJjKHx0Mp-MUA9ljN_SE_mZhrV2-nZ1eLy43FCkv"> We may regard the words “be preserved” as an active-passive verb. This means that although we are being preserved, we need to take the responsibility, the initiative, to be preserved. Thus, “be” implies something active, and “preserved” implies something passive. </p>
<p data-content-id="U_qUQ9eLDgIohGSw9aRXtqLUH_FRVtIT3LC0GCa7oNOVW9gcCaYHbfyn6DN6SS12s"> God intends to preserve us, but are we willing to be preserved? We may use the matter of giving medicine to children as an illustration of our need to bear responsibility to be preserved. Sometimes a child may need medicine, but he may not be willing to take it. In fact, he may resist the attempt of his parents to give it to him and even make it necessary for them to hold him down. Parents do this in order that the health of the child may be preserved. Sometimes we do not cooperate with the Lord to be preserved. This forces Him to do certain things to subdue us or restrict us so that we may take in what is necessary to be sanctified and preserved. </p>
<p data-content-id="MBsqlst5P700_JKz99q2Pe_WZyx9Xuj_n-NCjndO6YomzL0r_uPjVsyMNLxxCJBTm"> In 1 Thessalonians, a book on a holy life for the church life, we are told that different parts of our being need to be preserved. Our heart needs to be sanctified, our body needs <span class="pg" data-page-id="191" id="191">[191]</span> to be preserved in sanctification, and eventually even our spirit, the most hidden part of our being, also needs to be sanctified. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="V47gZ_dXfuuIX5rvOaHiq3ko1XLh4Vg8gDL7rGU03CRAbwE18cUk5AJ5tvMsJdAip">OUR ACTING AGENT</h2><p data-content-id="i6E87y3trDUylNZBtiqNQ-9Tzo6W4r-esxSNja8sAOylvP_w8A7ox6JxMWlYAvz7M"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that our heart is our acting representative. Now I would like to make this matter a little more clear. Perhaps the term “acting agent” is better than representative. Every one of us is a being, a human being. The word “being” is a modern expression. The biblical term for a human being is “soul.” This means that each one of us is a soul. The soul, as a being, has two organs: the inward organ, the spirit, and the outward organ, the body. We contact the physical world through the five senses of our body. Likewise, through the spirit, an organ which has senses of its own, we contact God. </p>
<p data-content-id="1-pomZlgQoWjecGSJDYVh5kAUyFdSE6StM7DsUK1JuPTdz167iZ-u6dQnK8mLseqR"> Whether or not we are able to contact a certain thing depends upon the organ we use. For example, if you close your eyes, you will not be able to see anything. However, you cannot use your eyes to substantiate sound. For this, you must use your ears. Because atheists do not exercise their spirit, they say there is no God. We cannot substantiate God unless we use our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94538" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> tells us that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit. If we exercise our spirit, we shall immediately sense that there truly is a God. Deep within, an atheist may say to himself, “Suppose there is a God after all—what will you do?” With the mouth an atheist may say that there is no God, but in the depths of his being, in his spirit, he may sense that there is a God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9flVS1cmSfOycwab-O9mkLeF0p70S8vxBNHNuzGHC1W5xYaLyua_nLL4WijlX1bnt">ACTIVE IN HEART</h2><p data-content-id="jJlXGtE9dmnAbo96hq_afbpNzm3SVfmdnM6vXYTFB1r5Wxlkm_IhagOk0lBnA9Qlf"> Our soul must act. When our soul, our being, acts, that is the heart. But when we keep ourselves at a standstill, this means that our heart does not act. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKq_WCxkl5nNdZM5kxAUuPY75kTq4EIeaamUNTiVBIqMSbG1bgg6uip7wz2vtNsvO"> We all have two hearts: a physical heart and a psychological heart. We know where our physical heart is located, but we do not know the location of our psychological heart. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="192" id="192">[192]</span> actions or activities of our physical body depend on the beating of our physical heart. According to medical doctors, the death of the physical body takes place when the heart stops beating. A person who does not have any pulse is dead, for his heart has stopped beating. The point of this illustration is that the death of the body takes place when the heart stops beating. This is also true of the psychological heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="nP53GGFF52Y1qHvb0rabXz6rUWux1rnGcVg8kaarQJeYqQkaPPlDlZgyTasQ-zucu"> Both our physical heart and our psychological heart have arteries. The main arteries of the psychological heart are the mind, emotion, and will. Heart attacks are often due to the blockage of the arteries. Recently I read that doctors who examined the bodies of young men who died in the Vietnam War discovered that in many cases their arteries were blocked even though they were quite young. Realizing the danger of blocked arteries, many watch their diet and are careful to exercise in order to cleanse their blood vessels. The problem of the physical heart is an illustration of the problem of the psychological heart. Today there are millions of Christians. But how many of these Christians are truly living? Most of them are not living. The reason they are not living is that the arteries of their psychological heart have been blocked. This blockage has caused them to die spiritually. </p>
<p data-content-id="6xcopxZjZK6F8a_6vdWQGxhLpkZxtkEMykk3WM5XTFcW7sYmcwcuj6n2QjN1MHxkK"> We all need to ask ourselves if we are spiritually healthy. To be healthy physically we need a strong heart. We also need a strong heart if we are to be spiritually healthy. All spiritual diseases are of the psychological heart. Our psychological heart may be wrong in different ways. We may be wrong in our thinking, in our loving or hating, or in the way we use our will. </p>
<p data-content-id="RoDIchE9_Iy0jaepjOKGXQjPSYEYGyxjE73iLxzxdOqbO3oRIuXM4GqsmQt1FITKE"> If our psychological heart is healthy, it will be very active in thinking, loving, hating, and deciding. Our heart is our acting agent. This means that if we are active, our heart will be active in mind, emotion, and will. However, if a person is not active in his heart, we may wonder if he is spiritually alive. If he is alive, why is there no activity in his heart? Why does his heart not function in a normal way, since it is his acting agent? <span class="pg" data-page-id="193" id="193">[193]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="sxDbeBfxVsm3l4Hj5KloIsHIPS5yFuh-xvJP94aTYeZNshQy_rbupcQFuR1kJCcVN"> I can testify that, even though I am elderly, I am very active in my heart. I am full of thought, feeling, and intention. My entire being—spirit, soul, and body—is active. However, the agent of this activity is not the spirit, the soul, or the body; the acting agent is the heart with the three main arteries of mind, emotion, and will. </p>

Such a life surely turns to God from idols, serves the living God, and waits for the coming of the Lord. This is the main point revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94566" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">chapter one</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94567" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:1">Chapter two</span> tells us that the apostles did their best as nursing mothers and exhorting fathers to foster such a life. They cared for this life and nourished it so that it would result in a walk worthy of God’s kingdom and glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="x-5TzPFIe1rIQs4lj3UuDgHej2EVbVpf4cT5jc6lJGETSeJOeoTmYx_rQmwxTdPcU"> How can such a life become worthy of God’s kingdom and God’s glory? There is no way other than to be sanctified. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94568" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> says that this life needs to be perfected in faith and also needs to increase and abound in love in order that the Lord may establish our hearts, the acting agent of our being, blameless in holiness. This is the establishment of our inward being, of our heart, our acting agent. <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="rX-pp2YZBRZeApP_hIf0dxnsF4yO--IEe2yMZFfZeQeF6OL59cEoE8YtMK_ljJiwr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94569" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul goes on to point out that not only should our heart inwardly be established in holiness, but also that our body outwardly needs to be preserved in sanctification, the process of being made holy. Furthermore, the physical body needs to be preserved not only in sanctification before God, but also in honor in the sight of man. In this chapter Paul also speaks concerning the saints who have died, who are sleeping. He deals with this matter in the scope of hope. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94570" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul says that the holy life for the church life should be perfected in faith and should increase and abound in love, and then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94571" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span> he shows that the resurrection of the dead saints is a matter of hope. </p>
<p data-content-id="bIitKE5sCdBDyj_cAMJWW_--FIZ8b1WOJNT1yapa-xXfGWaEAipyX08YSJ99K9EgQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94572" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:8">5:8</span> Paul covers the three matters of faith, love, and hope: “But we who are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and a helmet, the hope of salvation.” In warfare two crucial parts of our body—the head and the breast—need to be guarded. The breast must be covered, and the head must be protected. Hence, we have the breastplate of faith and love to cover our breast, and the helmet of the hope of salvation to cover our head. In our study of the Song of Songs we pointed out that the breasts of the seeking one signify faith and love in Christ. For this reason, the breastplate is of both faith and love. Our head, our mind, the thinking organ with its thoughts, needs to be protected by the helmet of God’s salvation. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94573" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1">chapter five</span> we see that when we are fighting the spiritual warfare, we need to be covered by the armor of God that includes the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet of the hope of salvation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94574" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1">chapter five</span> the three basic elements of the Christian life—faith, love, and hope—are all included. </p>
<p data-content-id="qLQhpzpBKjIYPlHN1GLuFvpSAobcW8RgLDaYPpUuHL6ei6jyMLDEgEMAfFcGoZtsQ"> Eventually, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94575" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">5:23</span>, Paul expressed his desire that the God of peace would sanctify us wholly, not only in heart or in body. Inwardly we have a heart, and outwardly we have a body. The heart and the body form the main structure of a living, acting person. <span class="pg" data-page-id="201" id="201">[201]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="yB1ksNBRYHxTj7QPg1uVLVK0HB1WRhXHIO8EL2qYtcTECvPxdx_zaTo42BSvYsPX4"> As living persons, we have a heart within and a body without. The heart is the directing agent, for it directs our actions, activities, and motions. The body is the means, the organ, by which we act outwardly. Hence, through our body our heart moves, and our body acts under the direction of our heart. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94576" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> deals with the sanctification of the heart and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94577" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span>, with the sanctification of the body. </p>
<p data-content-id="8cPX_DZ1NZiP6a_9Wg7XrsKq0YlDZdVNQnM2nzmv2m8GTi_2HJ_YhTmTbXrE3jNwj"> What, then, about our spirit and our soul? Even though the soul is very much like the heart in its components, there is still a difference between the soul and the heart. As far as the composition of our being is concerned, we have a spirit, a soul, and a body. But in our acting, our living, we have a heart and a body. Thus, when speaking of our being, we should refer to the spirit, the soul, and the body. But in speaking of our living and our actions, we should refer to the heart and the body. Our daily living is a matter of our heart and our body. For this reason Paul in 1 Thessalonians differentiates what we are from how we act. In action, we have a heart with a body. But in our being, that is, with respect to what we are, we have a spirit, a soul, and a body. </p>
<p data-content-id="0hD1ZBgUTPzaG8c-SeO6nAHtzoZfi4cmKoc69nw7XhK39fJcpOzMONPcbArkDuhSm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94578" data-verses="1Thessalonians 3:1">chapter three</span> of 1 Thessalonians sanctification is a matter of our inner part, our heart. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94579" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">chapter four</span> sanctification is a matter of our outward part, our body. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94580" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:1">chapter five</span>, as a conclusion of the book, sanctification includes our entire being. This is the reason Paul speaks of the God of peace sanctifying us wholly. By “wholly” Paul means our whole spirit and soul and body. Therefore, he expresses the desire that the saints’ spirit and soul and body would be preserved complete. This is to be sanctified wholly. </p>
<p data-content-id="7sR-0mypahaHMs2g9J45pUAX55o3ZVTB0cEtmsJuQZxRygIoDxtPQPytkWVluLorP"> The adverb “wholly” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94581" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">5:23</span> indicates quantity. It points to the fact that every part of our being—spirit, soul, and body—needs to be sanctified and preserved. Furthermore, the adjective “complete” refers to quality. Thus, Paul, an excellent writer, indicates in a brief way that quantitatively we need to be sanctified wholly, and qualitatively we need to be preserved complete. We need to be preserved not partially or <span class="pg" data-page-id="202" id="202">[202]</span> superficially but completely, even absolutely and perfectly. I hope that this brief survey of 1 Thessalonians will help you to understand what we shall cover in this message and in the message following. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_QDBmUX8WJQab_PzMdLxsGughfDPcCHmyxi25djpGncQ1_sZMpZv-DlQj8PRnkuJV">A TRIPARTITE BEING</h2><p data-content-id="BCWyd8haR9z8YbNTjOdhrcTYxqEe4v6HadbqjNo_fyDVMbab6pVmNvLqgqdfus6dL"> God certainly aspires to sanctify us wholly. He wants to preserve us in the three parts of our being—to preserve our spirit, our soul, and our body. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94582" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">5:23</span>, we are tripartite beings; that is, we have three parts: spirit, soul, and body. </p>
<p data-content-id="x-5TzPFIe1rIQs4lj3UuDgHej2EVbVpf4cT5jc6ALGETSeJOeoTmYx_rQmwxTdPcU"> When I was a young Christian, I learned the truth concerning man’s tripartite being, and I contended for this truth. In theology this is known as trichotomy. There is also the school of dichotomy, which teaches that man is of two parts, body and soul. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94583" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">First Thessalonians 5:23</span> proves strongly that the school of dichotomy is not correct. In this verse there is a conjunction between the words spirit and soul and also between the words soul and body. This indicates that the spirit, the soul, and the body are different and distinct. Nevertheless, some teachers of the Bible claim that the words spirit and soul are synonyms. This can be compared to saying that the different members of our physical body, for example, the stomach and the liver, are the same. It is a very serious misunderstanding to claim that the soul and the spirit are synonymous. </p>

<p data-content-id="oKMKMaRjikwDyJPmsV1URnuOdxon88RAycLJb_79WmDQlkQtD1XdGDP_8m0A36E2k"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94611" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span> Paul says, “And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” In the foregoing message we pointed out that the way to preserve our spirit is first to exercise it to have fellowship with God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94612" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:16-18">5:16-18</span>, we need to rejoice, pray, and give thanks. If we do this, our spirit will be pulled out of a condition of deadness and will be living. Second, we preserve our spirit by keeping it from all defilement and contamination. In this message we shall go on to consider how to preserve our soul and our body. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3rdNAYtVwEyij9wG-6AfQj2JV6iHrXR6556V1E4EVvqsljBTWTcHI_Ft3DQrOhyqI">CLEARING THE ARTERIES<br/>OF OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL HEART</h2><p data-content-id="G_zrNHrxwZy6Tw-DBBK4kvT-A6hUSaQ-RJPYIYpLFt6EP_s8vw4VwF94uMkN5b7I2"> Our psychological heart has three main arteries. These arteries, which are also the three parts of the soul, are the mind, the will, and the emotion. It is important to know how in a practical way to have these arteries unclogged. For the unclogging of the arteries of our physical heart, doctors may prescribe medication. But in many cases surgery is required to remove the blockage. The way to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart is to make a thorough confession to the Lord. From experience I have learned that <span class="pg" data-page-id="210" id="210">[210]</span> we need to stay with the Lord for a period of time to confess our defects, failures, defeats, mistakes, wrongdoings, and sins. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="cCqkCtDrfAjqWKDdS6Vs6VmCvzi-pPdKlzdzVqHK3ttTSNo9XLe6EO3QFHJQi1MYb">Concerning the Mind</h2><p data-content-id="jJlXGtE9dmnAbo96hq_afbpNzm3SVfmdnM6vRYTFJ1r5Wxlkm_IhagOk0lBnA9Qlf"> We may begin by confessing all the sinfulness and uncleanness that is in our mind, in our thinking. The artery of our mind can be compared to a ditch that is clogged with dirt and needs to be dug out so that water can flow through it. Our mind is filled with dirt. As a result, this artery is clogged. In order to unclog the artery of our mind, we need to confess everything that is sinful in our thoughts and in our way of thinking. By confessing our thoughts one by one, we shall remove the blockage from this artery. </p>
<p data-content-id="TKq_WCxkl5nNdZM5kxAUuPY75kTq4EIeaamULTiVJIqMSbG1bgg6uip7wz2vtNsvO"> As we are making confession in this way, we may confess to the Lord how natural our understanding is concerning many matters. Perhaps you do not feel that your understanding of so many things is natural. This is the reason you need to go to the Lord and say to Him, “Lord, enlighten me and expose my mind. Expose all my thoughts. Lord, bring my mind fully into Your light.” Then you should follow the enlightenment and exposure to confess the problems in your thinking one by one. For example, the Lord may show you that in your married life and family life your understanding is very natural. You may understand your spouse, your children, and your family affairs in a natural way, not at all in a spiritual way. If the Lord exposes this in you, you should immediately confess and say, “Lord, forgive me. Although I love You, my understanding of married life is altogether natural. Lord, deliver me from this natural understanding and take it out of me.” This is an illustration of the kind of confession we need to make concerning our mind. For this kind of exposure and confession it may be necessary for us to stay with the Lord for a long time. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nP53GGFF52Y1qHvb0rabXz6rUWux1rnGcVg8iaanSJeYqQkaPPlDlZgyTasQ-zucu">Concerning the Will</h2><p data-content-id="6xcopxZjZK6F8a_6vdWQGxhLpkZxtkEMykk3QM5bRFcW7sYmcwcuj6n2QjN1MHxkK"> What, then, about our will? If we go to the Lord concerning our will, He will expose it in a thorough and detailed <span class="pg" data-page-id="211" id="211">[211]</span> way. It may seem as if we are being examined under a divine microscope, for one by one there will be brought to light all the germs in our will. In particular, we shall realize that we are very rebellious, that we do not know what it means to be submissive to the Lord. One by one, we need to confess the germs of rebellion in our will. The Lord may show you that, a few years ago, you were wrong in a particular matter. Then He may go on to show you how you were wrong with a certain brother or a certain sister. Each time you will need to confess. You should thank the Lord that you are under His light, under His exposure. By confessing all that the Lord exposes in our will, we unclog the artery of our will. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="RoDIchE9_Iy0jaepjOKGXQjPSYEYGyxjE73iNxz9bOqbO3oRIuXM4GqsmQt1FITKE">Concerning the Emotion</h2><p data-content-id="sxDbeBfxVsm3l4Hj5KloIsHIPS5yFuh-xvJP74afeeZNshQy_rbupcQFuR1kJCcVN"> The artery of the emotion also needs to be unclogged. When we realize how serious is the problem we have with our emotion, we may be deeply sorrowful. We may despair and feel utterly ashamed of the condition of our emotion. We shall realize that in many cases we hate what we should love, and love what we should hate. When we come into the light of the sanctuary, we shall see that the most ugly aspect of our being is our emotion, for we do not use it properly. Both our joyfulness and our sorrow may be altogether natural. As the Lord exposes us, we may feel ashamed of the way we have expressed joy and sorrow, for that expression often was natural, fleshly, even fleshy. No wonder our psychological heart does not function normally. </p>
<p data-content-id="wlGQFARrTrj_EDLb1Z5NJFsBCV39AzrRFKxT8picDg1lcHFyW_sieswfArCE66mXm"> If we take the time necessary to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart, we shall have the sense that our entire being has become living. Our mind, will, and emotion will all be in a very healthy condition. All the “dirt” in these “ditches” will then be dug away. </p>
<p data-content-id="LPYR-Rf_6uFcNnPhzwX_Lnd5SjvP79sa03VcYkYyFXE4rNinniEkq_ZS-2ehIt9XO"> No one can do this unclogging for you. I can speak to you concerning it, but you must do it yourself. Thus, you need to go to the Lord day by day and ask Him to expose everything wrong in your mind, will, and emotion. Then in the light of what He exposes, you need to confess. <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="mtikvaKTaj-1XMvs8wpwa1Oma0heVqReLgo0ApcJAjc2daQbfu4sMgo80mpCCHIbe"> Perhaps you do not feel that you are wrong in your thoughts, in your decisions, or in your emotion. This is the reason you need to go to the Lord for His enlightening. As an illustration, sometimes we may have a physical problem that we are not aware of. Even after the doctor discovers our problem and prescribes the proper medication, we may not feel the medication is necessary. However, when we take the medication and it does its work to cleanse and heal our bodies, we shall be convinced that the doctor’s advice was right. In like manner, even though we may not feel that we are wrong in our mind, emotion, and will, we need to go to the Lord and take the “medication” He gives us. If we take it, the arteries of the psychological heart will be kept clean and unclogged. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZuckyEAbPF6VFdsnFbUF-tBPLZIVPWdjTLo5uM4x4PMmqdNkVSwlWS9383SPgzgIH">PRESERVING OUR BODY</h2><p data-content-id="A30ALPHLFGvAMumzxAGPf44wSNTKVEUhqYWK7thgT3IRzNKRYjXg5WMZZcE10A7Am"> In addition to knowing how to preserve our spirit and our soul, we must also know how to preserve our body. Sin has damaged and ruined our body. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94613" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Romans 6:6</span> says that our body is a “body of sin.” Furthermore, we have presented the members of our fallen body to sin, to evil, to lawlessness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94614" data-verses="Romans 6:19">Romans 6:19</span> says, “You presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness.” For instance, in gambling a person presents his hands to things that are sinful and unclean. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fv1q8OEYZLgUTrPLhjVLTrfinBl18iPKNKFlX8ROUEqI1drJPDZEpy7Rp8GKMtNDB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94615" data-verses="Romans 7:24">Romans 7:24</span> Paul goes on to say that our body is a body of death: “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94616" data-verses="Romans 8:10">Romans 8:10</span> Paul points out that although the spirit is life because of righteousness, “the body is dead because of sin.” </p>
<p data-content-id="CA2ne1_5bfKAMoAUV7_pxOD6zXt-CnOOBbMg7dsveRn80uZ_MrLT0dvo5cer3i9d6"> If we would preserve our body, we should live a life that never follows the old man, that never follows our soul. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94617" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Romans 6:6</span> says, “Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.” If we do not follow the old man, the body of sin will be made of none effect. This means that the body of sin will lose its job and become unemployed. But if we live according to the soul, <span class="pg" data-page-id="213" id="213">[213]</span> we shall use our body to serve the old man. Therefore, to preserve our body first requires that we do not live according to our soul. </p>
