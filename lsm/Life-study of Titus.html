Philemon was written first, during Paul’s first Roman imprisonment. After his release from prison, Paul wrote 1 Timothy and the Epistle to Titus. Finally, during his second imprisonment, at the time of Nero’s persecution, he wrote his last epistle, the Epistle of 2 Timothy. </p>

During Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome, the churches were subject to testing. During this time of testing, certain churches proved not to be so orderly. Thus, after his release from prison, Paul visited various places, including the city of Ephesus and the island of Crete. Realizing the situation of the churches, Paul became burdened to write an epistle to Titus telling him how to maintain the proper order of a local assembly. This was the background and also the reason for the writing of this book. If the order of the church is to be maintained, the authority in the church needs to be established. Therefore, in this message we shall consider from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95882" data-verses="Titus 1:1-9">1:1-9</span> the establishing of the authority in the church. As we shall see, this has much to do with appointing elders in each city (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95883" data-verses="Titus 1:5">v. 5</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>

Command is on God’s side, speaking for Him and requiring something of us for Him. Faith is on our side, responding to God’s requirements and receiving His grace. It is a proclamation that we are unable to fulfill God’s requirements, but that God has done everything for us and that we receive what He has done. The life promised by God is what we have received of Him for the carrying out of His demand. It was in this way that Paul was an apostle to administrate God’s New Testament economy. </p>

This denotes the believers in Christ, who were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95889" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4">Eph. 1:4</span>) and selected from mankind for salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="PRsHUmsGFdN4ePtf7l4hjDI0yjr9w7IXOUlE86e0hhMohsEmYTw9MRK84Z33Jdepb"> Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, but also according to the full knowledge of the truth. Faith is to receive all God has planned for us, all God has done for us, and all God has given to us. Full knowledge of the truth is a thorough apprehension of the truth, a full acknowledgment and appreciation of the reality of all the spiritual and divine things which we have received through faith. Apostleship is according to such an apprehension and appreciation of the reality of God’s eternal economy. </p>

The truth, the reality, of God’s eternal economy is according to godliness, which is God manifested in man. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> Apostleship is the dispensing of this reality to God’s believing elect and the carrying out of such a godliness among them through preaching, teaching, and administration in the Word and in the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95891" data-verses="1Timothy 6:3">1 Tim. 6:3</span>). </p>

This corresponds to “according to the promise of life” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95893" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span>. In the hope of eternal life means on the basis of, on the condition of, relying upon the hope of, eternal life. Eternal life, the uncreated life of God, is not only for us to partake of and enjoy today, but also for us to inherit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95894" data-verses="Matthew 19:29">Matt. 19:29</span>) in its full extent for eternity. Today’s experience of eternal life qualifies us to inherit it in the future. Its enjoyment today is a foretaste; the full taste will be the inheritance of it in the coming age and in eternity, which is the hope of eternal life. This is the blessed hope revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95895" data-verses="Titus 2:13">2:13</span>, which is comprised of the freedom of the glory of full sonship, the redemption of our body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95896" data-verses="Romans 8:21-25">Rom. 8:21-25</span>), the salvation to be revealed in the last time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95897" data-verses="1Peter 1:5">1 Pet. 1:5</span>), and the living hope of the incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance reserved in heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95898" data-verses="1Peter 1:3-4">1 Pet. 1:3-4</span>). This is the full, spiritual, divine, and heavenly blessing and enjoyment of eternal life, both in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95899" data-verses="2Peter 1:11">2 Pet. 1:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95900" data-verses="2Peter 3:13">3:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95901" data-verses="Revelation 21:6-7">Rev. 21:6-7</span>), referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95902" data-verses="1Timothy 4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>. Paul assumed his apostleship and accomplished his apostolic ministry, not based upon the benefit of the present life, nor on the condition of the privilege of the law, but based upon the condition of this hope, indicating that for his apostleship he relied upon and trusted in the divine life with all its hope, which God promised in eternity and which was brought to us through the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95903" data-verses="2Timothy 1:10">2 Tim. 1:10</span>). </p>

Hence, in the very opening word these three things are set forth. </p>

The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95904" data-verses="1Timothy 1:16">1 Tim. 1:16</span>) and is the main element of the divine grace given to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95905" data-verses="Romans 5:17">Rom. 5:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95906" data-verses="Romans 5:21">21</span>).

It must have been in that eternal epoch that the Father promised the Son that He would give His eternal life to His believers. By receiving this life the believers, who were given to Him in eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95911" data-verses="John 17:2">John 17:2</span>), would become His brothers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95912" data-verses="Hebrews 2:11">Heb. 2:11</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="tvITTqs0uxLt5wz9odNXxTCKVAknpEm23hX-PG0ThGZ6Gp8sNm394Un_jw59uY4k4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95962" data-verses="Titus 1:10-11">verses 10 and 11</span>, Paul says, “For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped, who overthrow whole households, teaching things which they ought not for the sake of base gain.” Both Paul’s word about “those of the circumcision” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95963" data-verses="Titus 1:10">verse 10</span> and his reference to “Jewish myths” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95964" data-verses="Titus 1:14">verse 14</span> point to the influence of Judaism. Those of the circumcision were Jewish believers who were seducers within the church. Paul says that such ones must be stopped. The way to stop them is by severe reproof (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95965" data-verses="Titus 1:13">v. 13</span>) with the faithful word according to the apostles’ teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95966" data-verses="Titus 1:9">v. 9</span>). These vain talkers and deceivers overthrow whole households, “teaching things which they ought not for the sake of base gain.” What they did was similar to what was done by the reprobate prophet, Balaam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95967" data-verses="2Peter 2:15-16">2 Pet. 2:15-16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95968" data-verses="Jude 1:11">Jude 11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="h7mBxaE25bqiIspFntBMVA_WC2k09i8YS8xhTemZkDGqUCwMuVR5gg1YzAE-h370z"> I would call your attention to the little word “for,” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95969" data-verses="Titus 1:10">verse 10</span>, indicating that this verse is related to the foregoing verse. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95970" data-verses="Titus 1:9">verse 9</span> Paul says that an overseer must hold to “the faithful word which is according to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> teaching that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who contradict.” Then Paul goes on to explain that there are many unruly men, especially of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped. These verses indicate that Paul’s charge to Titus concerning the establishment of the eldership is related to the disturbances caused by the influence of Judaism. There was the urgent need for the eldership to be set in order so that those who taught differently could be dealt with. Certain Jewish believers brought their Judaism into the church life and this, with its different teachings, caused a disturbance. Here we have a basic principle related to the eldership: every elder must be a watchman who is on the alert lest some teaching different from that of the apostles’ ministry is brought into the church. </p>

These were the commandments of the earlier Gnostics, not the ascetics, who adopted their theosophy from Jewish sources, probably some derivation from the Mosaic law. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvITTqs0uxLt5wz9odNXxRmiVAknpEm23hX-PG0ThGZ6Gp8sNm394Un_jw59uY4k4"> The men Paul refers to in this verse are probably those of the circumcision (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95988" data-verses="Titus 1:10">v. 10</span>). These men turn away from the truth. The truth here and the faith in the preceding verse prove that those who were dealt with here were not unbelievers. There were some in the church who had turned away from the truth concerning God’s economy. Most of them might have been Jewish Christians who still held their Jewish myths and traditions and thereby became a great <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> disturbance to the church. They had to be stopped by the word of the truth according to the faith so that the order of the church might be maintained under the established eldership. </p>
<p data-content-id="h7mBxaE25bqiIspFntBMVCL6C2k09i8YS8xhTemZkDGqUCwMuVR5gg1YzAE-h370z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95989" data-verses="Titus 1:15">verse 15</span> Paul continues, “All things are pure to the pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience have been defiled.” The statement, “All things are pure to the pure,” must have been a Christian maxim. The apostle quoted it to refute the commandments of men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95990" data-verses="Titus 1:14">v. 14</span>), that is, the precepts of abstinence, which forbade certain actions and the eating of certain foods (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95991" data-verses="1Timothy 4:3-5">1 Tim. 4:3-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95992" data-verses="Romans 14:20">Rom. 14:20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UMlsDZ2EWWpw2B1NYfYV8b7cSWxdw9x7coCWcHgPY969IxN3Iy__Ch6XNyNJJ-ets"> Paul says that to those who are defiled, or polluted, and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled. The mind is the leading part of the soul, and the conscience is the main part of our spirit. If our mind is polluted, our soul is spontaneously polluted; and if our conscience is defiled, our spirit is unavoidably defiled. This is all due to unbelief. Our faith purifies us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95993" data-verses="Acts 15:9">Acts 15:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="M536mJIQLGscZM1A1xIkuwfnxFr89FfexLBmdow-yfqiLUFcUTfF855jzoChkO7lX"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95994" data-verses="Titus 1:16">verse 16</span> Paul goes on to say, “They profess to know God, but by their works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and as to every good work disapproved.” The Greek word rendered disapproved can also be translated reprobate, worthless, disqualified. It means unable to stand the test. </p>

The Apostle’s Charge</h2><p data-content-id="iv48n0n3Cry1V9upFgQaoXBn3xNGYhfHsvl-Fo3VdQhnOo7pk6nvDHNTdgYxo-9Yp"> Paul’s charge to Titus is simply not to pay attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95995" data-verses="Titus 1:14">v. 14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="1sSdDJwm2s7VBYOYkFv87mOntlsaOverPSTnLmbWR7mSijFE-hdKCnMBp23BP3zMM"> Just as the elders in the churches in Crete were to watch out for the influence of Judaism and Gnosticism and not permit different teachings to creep into the church life, we also need to watch out for isms today, such as Catholicism and denominationalism. We should also be watchful concerning the hypocrisy and the superficial and superstitious tales circulated among many Christians. If these things are brought into the Lord’s recovery, they will cause trouble. The pure church life is built only upon the healthy teaching of <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> the apostles. This is the reason Paul says that elders must hold to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, so that they may be able to exhort by healthy teaching. The teaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95996" data-verses="Titus 1:9">verse 9</span> refers to that of the apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95997" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>), which eventually became the New Testament. The apostles’ teaching was the healthy teaching. The churches were established according to the apostles’ teaching and followed their teaching. Furthermore, the order of the church was maintained by the faithful word given according to this teaching. At the beginning of the church life, when the believers spoke about the teaching, everyone realized that this meant the teaching of the apostles. In Jerusalem those who received the Lord Jesus and were added to the church continued in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="96D5-oxebpoQrICQ_fFANL6neT_5zgaI-TRRlNyaoWr9LRwb0fZO55afhFyHZnR9Q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95998" data-verses="Titus 1:9">1:9</span> Paul does not say “sound teaching” or even “pure teaching”; he speaks of “healthy teaching.” Certain teachings may be sound or pure without being healthy. Healthy teaching is always related to life and is able either to nourish us or to heal us. Only something living can be healthy. For example, we do not speak of a table or chair as being healthy. The teachings of the apostles were not only sound and pure, but were healthy, full of life. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96007" data-verses="Titus 2:8">verse 8</span> Paul refers to “healthy speech that cannot be condemned.” Titus was to speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching and show himself a pattern of healthy words, and the elderly men were to be healthy in faith, love, and endurance. It is significant that in these verses, a portion of Titus in which the saints are charged to live an orderly life in the church, Paul uses the word healthy three times. If we study the verses where this word is used, and especially if we pray-read them, we shall be richly nourished. I would encourage you to pray over Paul’s word concerning healthy teaching, being healthy in faith, love, and endurance, and healthy speech.

It is the content of the apostles’ teaching, the content of God’s New Testament economy. It not only ministers the life supply to the believers and heals the spiritual diseases, but in so doing also brings the church into a sound condition with a good order. Hence, it is very much stressed in these three books, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, books dealing with the disorder and decline of the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96012" data-verses="Titus 2:1">2:1</span> Paul charged Titus not to deviate from the healthy teaching, from the apostles’ teaching. He should not be like the gainsayers, the vain talkers, those who teach differently and make the church subject to the influence of Judaism and Gnosticism. </p>

The word healthy points to that which is hygienic and which can both inoculate others against spiritual poison and also supply them with life. Our teachings should not merely pass on knowledge to others, but should supply them with life. Often when I have been tempted to speak about a certain subject, I was stopped. I had the sense that there was not much of the hygienic element in what I planned to say. We need to remind ourselves and be reminded by the Spirit to give forth healthy teaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="2m8OyOXlh2-7wwE58zggP4De4plwQQH-BnQTWbbDGmSCGN3ydMQVn8nqaOZ381ZeL"> Healthy teachings do not provoke debates or arguments.

To be temperate is to have self-control and to be moderate. It is often easier for an elderly person to be offended or angered than it is for a young person to be bothered in this way. As an elderly person myself, I can testify that in a family it is usually the older ones who become irritated or impatient. Today I can be bothered by certain irritations or nuisances that did not affect me in the least fifty years ago. This indicates that, as an elderly man, I need Paul’s charge to be temperate. Of course, temperateness is a virtue needed by everyone in the church life. </p>

The word faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96018" data-verses="Titus 2:2">verse 2</span> does not refer to the objective faith, to the things we believe, but to our activity of believing. In our daily living we need a faith which keeps us in the organic union. In order to be healthy in faith, we need to come to the Word and contact the Lord by praying in a living way with our spirit. Then we shall have faith, the infusion of the living God into us through our contact with the Word in the spirit. Faith, therefore, is a living Person infused into us. The more we remain in the organic union with this divine Person, the more healthy we shall be in faith. </p>

As one who has many children and grandchildren and who is involved with so many churches and co-workers, I can testify of the need for endurance. For example, I need endurance simply to care for all the mail I receive day by day. I receive so much mail that I have developed a filing system to categorize and arrange it.

Regarding the church life, Paul covers two main points in this chapter: the government of the church and the proper teaching in the church. The church’s government is built upon the proper eldership, and the teaching in the church is based on the healthy teaching of the apostles. This healthy teaching swallows up every kind of ism, in particular Judaism and Gnosticism, and every type of differing teaching. If we would have a church life which is healthy and in good order, there must be in the church the proper administration and healthy teaching according to the ministry of the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="AvIhyclwkPFk1FJVu5CG_XgQLJazJvktfVSz3lI-4ZtJqXoWwsXqT35VGKzSuWl9H"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96034" data-verses="Titus 2:1-8">2:1-8</span> Paul speaks concerning an orderly human life. In particular, he speaks of the family life. These eight verses give us the foundation of a proper human life in the divine life. We in the Lord’s recovery should live such a human life. For the testimony of Jesus we need the highest human life, a life lived out according to the divine life given to us by God. By the divine life we need to have a human life that reaches the highest standard. In our living we should be Jesusly human. We should aspire to have a glorious testimony of the Christ in whom we believe and whom we serve and honor. Then we shall be a shining, golden lampstand. This is our declaration concerning human living. <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> </p>

Certainly Paul did not agree with the system of slavery. However, as a teacher appointed by God and as one with spiritual insight, he did not touch the existing social system. If he had done so, he would have given others the impression that he was a social reformer and not a teacher of God’s economy, a herald of the good news. Paul did not involve himself with reformation of the social system. On the contrary, he gave instructions to slaves concerning the need to behave according to the highest standard of human character. The slaves were to have an excellent testimony of the life of Jesus in their human living. </p>
<p data-content-id="CDs_S44ICKwB21BZGTu7gdp4D-cQicc5DZlakUWLUd6tVHMRoz9qbqOWnzem1qGsu"> If Paul had advocated the annulment of the system of slavery, he would have been regarded as a social reformer by those who read his Epistles. That would have obscured Paul’s teaching concerning the living out of Christ’s divine life in our human living in the midst of any kind of social system. In order to guarantee that the light would shine without hindrance, Paul did not say a word about the social system in the way of correcting it or reforming it. </p>
<p data-content-id="PRsHUmsGFdN4ePtf7l41jBMQyjr9w7IXOUlE86e0hhMohsEmYTw9MRK84Z33Jdepb"> When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He did not touch the social system. Instead, He lived as a typical Jew in a country under the control of the Roman imperialists. The Lord Jesus was born during the time of Caesar Augustus. At the time of His trial, judgment was pronounced upon Him by Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea. The Lord Jesus said to Pilate, “My kingdom is not of this world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96036" data-verses="John 18:36">John 18:36</span>). The Lord’s kingdom was not earthly; it was heavenly in nature. For this reason, when He was on earth, the Lord Jesus did not deal with the social system or with any earthly government. Paul displayed the same attitude. He did not try to reform the Roman social system. </p>

Furthermore, a master could legally <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> put a slave to death. What a dreadful system! To be sure, God was utterly opposed to such a social system, for it was altogether contrary to the place of man in His creation. Paul certainly did not approve of this evil social system. But instead of trying to reform it, he charged the slaves to behave well in it, to live in it according to the standard of the humanity of the Lord Jesus. Even in the midst of such an unjust social system, Christians could live out a life with the highest standard of humanity. What a testimony this is! </p>
<p data-content-id="NskTgkTzDsWkURTFM5pQ56auY5ccv7LmolB7HVqeG0gKkHnoE25hgZIXFsp30NgbH"> No matter how bad certain social systems may be today, none are as bad as the system of slavery in the Roman Empire. For the saints to live a Jesusly human life in that kind of social system was a marvelous testimony of the divine life. It was God’s wisdom that a slave, bought and branded like an animal, could testify of the divine life according to the highest standard. </p>
<p data-content-id="tvITTqs0uxLt5wz9odNPxRWqVAknpEm23hX-PG0ThGZ6Gp8sNm394Un_jw59uY4k4"> Some have criticized Paul for not trying to reform the social system. We realize, however, that Paul used the worst social system as an opportunity to charge the believers to live a Jesusly human life in the midst of it. If the saints could live such a human life in the worst social system imaginable, then we should be able to live such a life in any kind of circumstances today. Praise the Lord that by the divine life we can have the highest human living even in the worst social system! </p>

THE CHARGE TO THE SLAVES</h2><p data-content-id="UMlsDZ2EWWpw2B1NYfYN8bLESWxdw9x7coCWcHgPY969IxN3Iy__Ch6XNyNJJ-ets"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96037" data-verses="Titus 2:9-10">verses 9 and 10</span> Paul says, “Slaves are to be subject to their own masters in all things, to be well pleasing, not contradicting, not pilfering, but showing all good faith that they may adorn the teachings of our Savior God in all things.” The slaves here are not servants, but bondslaves bought in the market like oxen and horses. Paul charges them to be subject to their own masters in all things. They had no choice, and there was to be no argument. Moreover, the slaves were not to pilfer. On the contrary, they were to show all good faith. Faith here means fidelity, trustworthiness. In this way they would adorn the teachings of our Savior God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> The faithfulness of a bondslave can be the ornament of the teaching of God our Savior. He would even accept adornment from bondslaves! </p>

Our daily living should be a beautiful adornment to the teaching we have received. If we live according to the healthy teaching of the apostles, we shall adorn these teachings by our living. If we have a bright testimony of a living which is Jesusly human, our neighbors will realize that we are genuine Christians. They will confess that our living is the adornment of the teachings we have received in the Lord’s recovery. We should live not only in a way that is different from that of others, but in a way that is higher and more respectable. Others may even desire to follow us, because they have observed the high standard of our daily life. They may seek to learn how they can have such a life themselves. </p>

Our Savior God desires not only to save us, but also to teach us the full knowledge of the truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96042" data-verses="1Timothy 2:4">1 Tim. 2:4</span>). Hence, there is the teaching of our Savior God, which may be adorned, beautified, by the transformed character of the most vile persons saved by His grace. </p>

These concepts were the factors, the elements, of the composition of this book. In writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96087" data-verses="Titus 1:1">chapter one</span> of Titus, Paul was deeply concerned for the church. Hence, in this chapter he takes care of the proper order in the church and speaks of establishing the eldership for the administration of a local church, of the termination of the various isms, and of holding to the healthy teaching of the apostles. Paul goes on in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96088" data-verses="Titus 2:1">chapter two</span> to speak of an orderly human life, which is primarily related to the family life. Then, as we have seen in the foregoing message, he speaks of society, or of the social system. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96089" data-verses="Titus 3:1-8">3:1-8</span> Paul speaks of the rulers, that is, the government. </p>
<p data-content-id="fg1Iva5mvu0ZWcaEl93GuZ5Pzcy6FfGABILsT9ZLTmr2Aw8qQAn992wkqDZgnuGgW"> To have an orderly life, we need to take care of four units: the church, the family, the social system, and the government. If we care for these units properly, we shall have an orderly life in every way. When Paul was writing the book of Titus, he had within him a concern for these four units. Unbelievers, of course, care only for family, society, and government. Even the philosophers and thoughtful people throughout the centuries have considered only these three units among mankind. But among us in the Lord’s recovery the most important unit is the church. For us, the church is first. We give the church preeminence in our consideration, for the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> base of the truth. Furthermore, the church is the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh. Paul covered the matter of the church first in this Epistle, and we follow him to give the church the first place among the four basic units covered in this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="IWJJQa4Wsso-7Cs-M8mYxGnQKV5gTe9IcRkzcGaphB1CO8pyRfyVc4KcIYOtSAFLn"> After the church, the most important unit is the family. Some opposers have tried to defame us by spreading the devilish lie that we do not care for the family life. Next to the church, the family is the most important unit in society. Without a proper family life, how could we have a healthy society or country? A nation is constituted of families as the basic factors. We fully realize that without a proper family life it is difficult to have an orderly church life. But we also realize that without a proper church life it is difficult to have a normal and proper family life. We are here for the church and also for the family. Furthermore, we care for society. We respect others, we honor our neighbors, and we care for the existing social system. We are not here as social reformers, and it is not our intention to change the social system. In the Lord’s recovery we are here to present to others healthy teachings concerning the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the Body of Christ. </p>

According to the healthy teaching in the New Testament, we must respect the government. </p>
<p data-content-id="zQlJCHkfr8vda3jLwTVGt5hJcGYSSkGxkY24Z8D9dACNNppEP9WPPxxAijgy7047N"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96090" data-verses="Titus 3:1-2">3:1 and 2</span> Paul says, “Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work, to speak evil of no one, to be uncontentious, forbearing, showing all meekness toward all men.” To be subject to rulers is to recognize God’s authority and respect His government over men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96091" data-verses="Romans 13:1-2">Rom. 13:1-2</span>). To be uncontentious (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96092" data-verses="Titus 3:2">v. 2</span>) is to be peaceable, not quarrelsome. </p>
<p data-content-id="aKtshbpURjsMXKrowTjwTA0ryq2WI45JDyBnhU-I5ogh5Dd8xwsVsoM9gTZwZrsrh"> Before Paul could teach the saints to respect the government, he himself had to experience a certain amount of transformation. When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a patriotic <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> Jew and wanted to be free from the yoke of the Roman imperialists. But here he instructs the saints to subject themselves to rulers and to authorities. According to his word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96093" data-verses="Romans 13:1">Romans 13</span>, government officials have been appointed by God. Paul recognized that even those officials appointed by Caesar are rulers appointed by God, His deputy authority. If Paul had not been transformed from a natural person into a spiritual person with spiritual understanding, it would have been difficult for him to give such instructions. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="buWVwDmgJAuc8Sw3OhYXuAD-t-oClkqe_-8oTe1yIi6C0v5sAs4UqikSsIwCTDjXf">GOD’S SUPPLY</h2><p data-content-id="qhNsPV7UFTFvzcJSqyCQBPtqaZ4idQYfFGOrqfFRrh-G_86OUPrGGZQnMDOBwccOJ"> To care for the church life, the family life, the social system, and the government, we need a specific supply. In speaking of these four units, Paul also tells us of the divine supply. We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96094" data-verses="Titus 1:1">chapter one</span> Paul speaks concerning the church life. The supply for the church life consists of the faith of God’s chosen ones, the full knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, and the hope of eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96095" data-verses="Titus 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>). Eternal life in particular is the supply which enables us to have the church life. The word of proclamation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96096" data-verses="Titus 1:3">1:3</span>) is another aspect of the supply for the proper church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="yhZzlgl_uGEmIjaqrmD62WfP9E0Rpx1JF4Mx-994w_JpIK5Wu6WbJFecqgjUgj_Pb"> Just as there is a supply for the church life, there is also a supply for the family life. The supply for the proper family life includes healthy teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96097" data-verses="Titus 2:1">2:1</span>), healthy speech (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96098" data-verses="Titus 2:8">2:8</span>), and being healthy in faith, in love, and in endurance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96099" data-verses="Titus 2:2">2:2</span>). For the family unit we need the supply of healthy teaching and healthy speech. The word speech in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96100" data-verses="Titus 2:8">2:8</span> refers to our ordinary daily conversation, such as conversation at the dinner table. If our speech is healthy, it will supply us that we may have a proper family life. </p>
<p data-content-id="83ZXW7sjhyEL8tXglv1nciVS5htEYKtZfGCmWx4-QbtTJV3JpSf6xlVvY_Y66wNj0"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96101" data-verses="Titus 2:9-15">2:9-15</span> Paul charges the slaves to behave well in the social system of slavery. This indicates that we need to have the proper attitude toward society. But what is the supply for living in the existing social system? This supply is the grace of God which has appeared, bringing salvation to all men and training us to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age as we await the <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96102" data-verses="Titus 2:11-13">2:11-13</span>). By means of this supply we can adorn the teaching of our Savior God in all things. </p>
<p data-content-id="0pUNhRGgEwgJtvLqdIGOr_N-5FhyVKKg_iPL5HX2TQXyNX-gP0JW_k-hyB7dSMuUg"> The supply which enables us to keep a good relationship with the government is wonderful. Paul speaks of this supply in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96103" data-verses="Titus 3:4-7">3:4-7</span>. Prior to this, he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96104" data-verses="Titus 3:3">verse 3</span>, “For we also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving as slaves various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.” We should remember that in nature we were once the same as others, living in the fallen condition; therefore, we should sympathize with their pitiful life and pray for their salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96105" data-verses="1Timothy 2:1">1 Tim. 2:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96106" data-verses="1Timothy 2:4">4</span>). We also once served as slaves various lusts, various desires and gratifications. But now we have a marvelous supply to have a good relationship with the government. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7_BF_wDf5W74UU0GYYsT6RAeczcuzERCvxI77uCLi8YUTAP7BJGRw1k12XpGQbaP_">KINDNESS, LOVE, AND MERCY</h2><p data-content-id="_vpdHA3RGy0Rhalf_Df1ZqS3Bmmc5JWN3NRUHIMHif2ygmlj_HkoGqpy0NosAXmf5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96107" data-verses="Titus 3:4">Verse 4</span> says, “But when the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared.” It is the kindness and love of our Savior God that has saved us and made us different from others. </p>
<p data-content-id="BhCTQAlP_00xrIDmR0PSINRVoztaILAWK7Ba3T8HGxRvnTRTakglwca9L0HDOAWwD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96108" data-verses="Titus 3:5">verse 5</span> Paul continues, “Not by works in righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy, He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96109" data-verses="Titus 2:11">Titus 2:11</span> says that the grace of God brings salvation to man, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96110" data-verses="Titus 3:7">3:7</span> says that we have been justified by the grace of the Lord. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96111" data-verses="Titus 3:5">verse 5</span> says that according to His mercy He saved us. God’s mercy reaches farther than His grace. Our pitiful condition created a wide gap between us and God’s grace. It was God’s mercy that has bridged this gap and brought us to His salvation of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="xFIJMz3ys-DPJRpf6ryJY1A7BeXwvHpycI5Q2V47jOYYwlZd6ZypHfxJkn3IagqKE"> Notice that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96112" data-verses="Titus 3:4-5">3:4-5</span> Paul does not speak of grace, but speaks of kindness, love, and mercy. Love is the source of grace. In the heart of God the Father there is love. But when this love is expressed through the Son, it becomes grace. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96113" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span> speaks of the grace of Christ and the love of the Father. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96114" data-verses="John 1:16-17">John 1:16 and 17</span> we <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> have grace; however, in 1 John we touch the love of God the Father as the source of this grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="r6Q_sR66lgwHEC7IqDKB5ZyYgvKn7D-ONBwbHCLSHvijJZlD48SJVv9NJB2T0voTn"> What, then, are mercy and kindness? We have pointed out that mercy always reaches farther than grace. When we are in a proper situation, God’s love will come to us as grace. However, we were all in a pitiful situation and may still be in such a situation today. Therefore, we need God’s mercy to reach us. The mercy of God can come to us even in our pitiful situation. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96145" data-verses="Titus 3:7">verse 7</span> Paul says, “That, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.” Becoming heirs of God is the goal of His eternal salvation with His eternal life given to us by grace in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96146" data-verses="Titus 3:4-6">verses 4 through 6</span> we see some crucial matters needed to reach God’s goal. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96147" data-verses="Titus 3:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> we read of certain divine attributes: kindness, love, and mercy. When these attributes are put together, we have grace. God has exercised His love, mercy, kindness, and grace in order to save us. Whenever we are about to do something of great importance, we exercise our whole being. Our mind, will, emotion, heart, and even our disposition are exercised. In like manner, God exercised His being in order to save us. He exercised His love, kindness, mercy, and grace. By means of these divine attributes God has saved us. These attributes, however, are the source; they are not the activity or the process. </p>
<p data-content-id="yhZzlgl_uGEmIjaqrmD22Xr39E0Rpx1JF4Mx-994w_JpIK5Wu6WbJFecqgjUgj_Pb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96148" data-verses="Titus 3:5-6">3:5 and 6</span> we have activity, an action, constituting the process through which God saved us: “He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior.” God’s salvation is based upon the exercise of His attributes and through the process of the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. The goal is that we become God’s heirs. </p>
<p data-content-id="83ZXW7sjhyEL8tXglv1rcjxu5htEYKtZfGCmWx4-QbtTJV3JpSf6xlVvY_Y66wNj0"> Paul certainly was an excellent writer. Knowing that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96149" data-verses="Titus 3:4-6">verses 4 through 6</span> he had not written anything concerning justification, he inserts the words “having been justified by <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> the grace of that One.” Although justification is somewhat implied by the matters of salvation and washing, Paul mentions it explicitly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96150" data-verses="Titus 3:7">verse 7</span>. We have been saved, washed, and justified. The grace by which we are justified is the totality of God’s kindness, love, and mercy. These attributes are of God. But when they become a totality in our experience, that is grace. Kindness, love, and mercy are of the Father, whereas grace is of Christ, of “that One.” For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96151" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span> Paul speaks of the grace of Christ and of the love of God the Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="0pUNhRGgEwgJtvLqdIGCr9ZO5FhyVKKg_iPL5HX2TQXyNX-gP0JW_k-hyB7dSMuUg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96152" data-verses="Titus 3:7">3:7</span> Paul says that we become heirs according to the hope of eternal life, whereas in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96153" data-verses="Titus 1:1-2">1:1 and 2</span> he says that he became an apostle in the hope of eternal life. This eternal life meant a great deal to Paul. It also means a great deal to us as believers. Paul became an apostle in the hope of eternal life, and we become heirs of God according to the hope of eternal life. Why does Paul use the word “in” when speaking of himself and the word “according to” when speaking of us? The fact that he used the word “in” with respect to himself indicates that he was already experiencing the hope of eternal life. But because we have not yet entered into this experience to a very great extent, he says that we are heirs according to the hope of eternal life. As a very matured believer, Paul was experiencing the hope already. He was in it. But, for the most part, this experience lies ahead of us. Therefore, we are heirs according to this hope. </p>

THE APOSTLE’S CHARGE</h2><p data-content-id="1sSdDJwm2s7VBYOYkFvs7m-_tlsaOverPSTnLmbWR7mSijFE-hdKCnMBp23BP3zMM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96154" data-verses="Titus 3:9">3:9</span> Paul goes on to say, “But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and strifes and contentions about the law, for they are unprofitable and vain.” The questionings here are those aroused by genealogies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96155" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">1 Tim. 1:4</span>), and the strifes issue out of the questionings and genealogies. Contentions refer to fightings, which are due to different opinions issuing from the deviant and mythological studies of the law. The law in this verse is the law of the Jews used for Gnostic Judaism, which stood in opposition to the simplicity of the gospel. These questionings, genealogies, strifes, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> contentions are all vain; that is, they are aimless, without any positive result. </p>
<p data-content-id="96D5-oxebpoQrICQ_fFQNLK_eT_5zgaI-TRRlNyaoWr9LRwb0fZO55afhFyHZnR9Q"> The positive things stressed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96156" data-verses="Titus 3:4-8">verses 4 through 8</span> should be affirmed strongly and consistently, positive things including our Savior God, Jesus Christ our Savior, the Holy Spirit, God’s kindness, love, mercy, grace, and eternal life, with His acts of justifying, saving, washing, regenerating, and renewing. These are the Triune God with His attributes and virtues, plus His divine actions in His eternal salvation: they are things of life, which belong to the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96157" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>) and produce heirs to inherit all that He is for them. The negative things dealt with in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96158" data-verses="Titus 3:9-11">verses 9 through 11</span> should be avoided. These things include foolish questionings, genealogies, strifes, contentions about the law, and factious, opinionated men. These matters are of the knowledge that is deadening, matters that belong to the tree of knowledge and kill their victims. </p>
<p data-content-id="jcAlcZCY9zvSX--VT2HgMU5kc9XsQFLvnHlKiX5t3RjNfSPR1ZvP9X8Q2b9ubIO3W"> Paul’s word about avoiding foolish questionings, genealogies, strifes, and contentions corresponds to what he says about teaching differently in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96159" data-verses="1Timothy 1:1">1 Timothy 1</span>. Differing teachings had begun to creep into the church, and Paul charges Titus to avoid them. </p>
<p data-content-id="TZIN421yFpNPVLWuRcvTTi78ScSKqAdi6vWq63RdNirapFOyL3w1-mclAD-vvzCoP"> The Lord’s ministry is not the teaching of any individual. The ministry is the teaching of God’s New Testament economy. This means that the Lord’s ministry is the healthy teaching which conveys to us the New Testament economy. Unfortunately, most of today’s Christian teachers have missed the mark of God’s economy. God’s economy may be likened to a kernel or a grain. Most Christian teachers pay attention not to the kernel, but to the stem, the leaves, and even to the husks. They may argue and debate over husks and neglect the kernel. </p>
<p data-content-id="n1W6_wvCPuN7Zn4aPjT0Ze9umVFB8H4bLztEIiXv3TkbzWIfP2P-n_4HsoHRgyVxN"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96160" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Colossians 1:25</span> Paul says, “I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.” To complete the word of God means to complete the divine revelation. This completion of the word of God is the mystery of Christ. This expression refers both to Christ and to His mystery. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> mystery of Christ is the church. The content of the teaching of the New Testament economy is the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="6JSClAluWIqL2rF46ONHxyTV_CErJmrq5wlrH4VGWPAcmbcgFMyV30FSQxX8ZXqg9"> Any teaching which deviates from this central focus should be regarded as a differing teaching. For example, suppose a certain Christian teacher insists that we baptize people in the name of Jesus Christ, not in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and not even in the name of Christ Jesus. Although such a teaching may be presented in a way which sounds fundamental and scriptural, it is actually a differing teaching because it emphasizes something other than the focus of God’s economy and distracts the saints from the proper church life. Yes, the Bible commands us to be baptized. But we should not be influenced by differing teachings related to the name in which the believers are baptized. To pay too much attention to such matters will cause us to be distracted from God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="RcaeftiJu7j0iyacTPEXAfQ8QR4jhK8nyyyRtrz5sG3WlSsGvxrk1KmSRiXqmRqU-"> It is not the goal of the Lord’s recovery to recover doctrinal truths. The goal of the recovery is to bring us back to God’s New Testament economy, which is Christ and the church. What the Lord desires of us, and what we ourselves need, is to have our entire being focused on God’s economy. In the Lord’s recovery we must pay our full attention to Christ and the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="sa9HZ4PGd7sNRRGjLAH6cn-CA6cVATHUQVo4yR5mfQmd9pTwSVGjFqwrBIPOa9Ifx"> As we direct our attention to God’s economy concerning Christ and the church, we must avoid differing teachings. These teachings may be scriptural, and certain preachers may speak of them in an eloquent, attractive manner. However, we must discern whether or not such speaking is focused on Christ and the church, whether or not it strengthens the believers to live Christ and practice the church life. A person may deliver an excellent message on love from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96161" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">1 Corinthians 13</span>. However, if he has not seen the vision of the New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church, even his inspiring message on love may be a distraction. The more he expounds <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96162" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">1 Corinthians 13</span>, the more those who listen to him are distracted from Christ and from the church life.

<p data-content-id="w2ZoOTp6xuZ9aiTElmnJdvYMmqsWOt9WlK841_AFbl7Bl-RDMi3kQDRghdJXCNali"> Many seeking Christians have been distracted not by heresies, but by good teachings on certain favorite portions of the Bible. Many Christians are impressed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96163" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">1 Corinthians 13</span>, and they appreciate messages on this chapter. But although they may talk a great deal about love and about the need to love one another, they neglect the church life. </p>
