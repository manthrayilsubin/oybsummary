We will pay our full attention to this matter of life—the Christian life and the church life. This means that our purpose is not to have a training in doctrines, although we still need to know the basic truths and the principles from the divine Word. The entire training will be devoted to the book of Romans. We need to study the Recovery Version of Romans thoroughly. This message serves as a foreword to the book of Romans. </p>

It may sound secular and unreligious. However, if you have entered into the deep thought of the Bible, you will realize that the Bible is a romance, in the most pure and the most holy sense, of a universal couple. </p>

The Story of a Marriage</h2><p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52xihYAca2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> Immediately after the record of God’s creation, we find the story of a marriage (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78285" data-verses="Genesis 2:21-25">Gen. 2:21-25</span>). In this marriage Adam is the type of Christ as the husband, and Eve is the type of the church as the wife. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78286" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> we see the couple typified by Adam and Eve—Christ and the church. The type of Adam and Eve reveals that the persons of this universal couple must be of the same source. God created one person, Adam, and out from this person a wife came. Eve was not created separately by God; she came out of Adam. Eve was made out of a rib, a piece of bone, that came from Adam, indicating that both Adam and Eve proceeded out of the same source. In this universal couple the wife must come out of the husband. Likewise, the church must come out of Christ. The two persons of this couple must be of the same source. They also must be of one nature. Furthermore they must share one common life. Adam’s nature and life were also Eve’s. Eve had the same nature and life as Adam. The two persons of this couple were of one source, of one nature, and had the same one life. Without doubt, they also had one living. They lived together. Eve lived by Adam and with Adam, and Adam lived by Eve and with Eve. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q95Dv6AsIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI"> This couple is the secret of the universe. The secret of the whole universe is that God and His chosen ones are to be one couple. Hallelujah! We, God’s chosen ones, and God are of one source, of one nature, and have one life. Now we also need to have one living. We are not living by ourselves or for <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> ourselves; we are living with God and for God, and God is living with us and for us. Hallelujah! </p>

God was desirous of being a husband and of having His people as His wife. Many times the prophets spoke of God as the Husband and of His people as His wife. Humanly speaking, we always think of God in a religious way as the Almighty, feeling compelled to worship Him. But do you married brothers expect this from your wives? Suppose your wife thought of you as a big body, as a giant, approaching you adoringly, bowing herself, and kneeling down to worship you. What would you say? You would say, “Silly wife, I don’t need such a worshipper. I need a dear wife to embrace me and kiss me. If you will simply give me a little kiss, I will soar in the air.” Our God certainly is the Almighty God, and, as His creatures, we must worship Him. Many verses speak about worshipping God in this way. However, have you never read in Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea that God desires to be a husband? In ancient times God’s people built the temple and established a system of worship complete with priesthood and sacrifices. One day God intervened and spoke through Isaiah saying, “I am tired of this. I am weary with your sacrifices. I want you to love Me. I am your Husband, and you must be My wife. I want to have a marriage life. I am lonely. I need you. I need you, My chosen people, to be My wife.” </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGRtyHsODqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO">c. The Full Romance in Song of Songs</h2><p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvdn7gPU0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> Among the 39 books in the Old Testament, there is one book called the Song of Songs. Song of Songs is more than a romance; it is a fantastic romance. Have you ever read a romance like the Song of Songs? As far as I am concerned, the Song of Songs is the finest romance. It speaks of two people who fall in love. Although I do not like to use this <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> term, “fall in love,” I cannot deny the fact. In Song of Songs we find a woman falling in love with a man saying, “Oh, that he might kiss me with the kisses of his mouth. I am thirsty for this.” Immediately, her beloved is at hand, and the pronoun changes from “he” to “you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78297" data-verses="Song of Songs 1:2-3">S. S. 1:2-3</span>). “Your name is sweet, and your love is better than wine. Draw me, my beloved. Don’t teach me, draw me. I don’t need a pastor or a preacher. I don’t need an elder or even an apostle. I need you to draw me. Draw me, we will run after you.” What a romance! </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtb4Mj2EFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> In the case of Adam and Eve we saw that the couple had one source, one nature, one life, and one living. In Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea we saw that God desires to have a wife who will live together with Him. God longs to have a marriage life, to have divinity live together with humanity. But His people failed Him. In Song of Songs, however, we see the genuine marriage life. What is the secret of such a romance? The secret is that the wife must take her husband not only as her life and her living, but as her person. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLNo7_JmoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP">THE GOSPEL OF GOD</h1><p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVeps2Pa4Mc8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> The gospel of God is the subject of the book of Romans (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78357" data-verses="Romans 1:1">1:1</span>). Christians are accustomed to saying that there are four gospels, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. However, Paul also refers to his epistle to the Romans as a gospel. The gospel in the first four books of the New Testament concerns Christ in the flesh as He lived among His disciples before His death and resurrection. After His incarnation and before His death and resurrection, He was among His disciples, but not yet in them. The gospel in Romans concerns Christ as the Spirit, not Christ in the flesh. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78358" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> we see that the Spirit of life who indwells us is simply Christ Himself. Christ is in us. The Christ in the four gospels was among the disciples; the Christ in Romans is within us. The Christ in the four gospels is the Christ after incarnation and before death and resurrection. As such, He is a Christ outside of us. The Christ in Romans is the Christ after His resurrection. As such, He is the Christ within us. This is something deeper and more subjective than the Christ in the gospels. Keep this one point in mind: that the gospel in Romans concerns Christ as the Spirit in us after His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XIHhd-mP0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0"> If we only have the gospel concerning Christ as in the first four books of the New Testament, our gospel is too objective. We need the fifth gospel, the book of Romans, to reveal the subjective gospel of Christ. Our Christ is not merely the Christ in the flesh after incarnation and before resurrection, the Christ who was among His disciples. Our Christ is higher and more subjective. He is the Spirit of life within us. He is such a subjective One. Though <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78359" data-verses="John 14:1-2">John chapters 14 and 15</span> revealed that Christ will be in His believers, <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> yet that was not fulfilled before His resurrection. The book of Romans is the gospel of Christ after His resurrection, showing also that He is now the subjective Savior in His believers. So, this gospel is deeper and more subjective. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvMocAX5773NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr">I. PROMISED IN THE SCRIPTURES</h2><p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaP5RwXob3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> This gospel was promised by God through the prophets in the Scriptures. This means that the gospel of God was not an accident; it was planned and prepared by God. The Bible shows us that this gospel was planned by God in eternity past. Before the foundation of the world, God planned to have this gospel. So, numerous times in the Holy Scriptures, from Genesis through Malachi, God spoke in promise through the prophets regarding the gospel of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qlyyKhn3LZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV">II. CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoCvVsXAsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El"> This gospel of God concerns a Person, Christ. Of course, forgiveness, salvation, etc. are included in the gospel, but they are not the central point. The gospel of God concerns the Person of the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord. This wonderful Person has two natures—the divine nature and the human nature, divinity and humanity. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvMocAXkx73NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr">A. Come Out of the Seed of David</h2><p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaP5RwOjb3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> Paul mentions Christ’s humanity first, not His divinity, saying that He was born out of the seed of David according to the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78360" data-verses="Romans 1:3">1:3</span>). This is His human nature, His humanity. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qlyyKhnSDZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV">B. Designated the Son of God<br/>out of Resurrection</h2><p data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoCvVs2JsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El"> Then Paul says that He was “designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78361" data-verses="Romans 1:4">1:4</span>). This is a clear reference to Christ’s divinity. Why is His humanity mentioned first and His divinity last? </p>
<p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PZUgUTqjprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> Paul mentions Christ’s humanity first because he maintains the sequence of Christ’s process. Firstly, Christ passed through the process of incarnation to become flesh. Then He <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> passed through the process of death and resurrection. By means of the second step of His process He became the Son of God out of resurrection. Christ has been processed in two steps: the first step—incarnation; the second step—death and resurrection. By these two steps Christ became two different things. He became flesh by incarnation and He became the Son of God through death and resurrection. His first step brought God into humanity. His second step brought man into divinity. Before His incarnation, Christ, as a divine Person, already was the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78362" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>). He was the Son of God before His incarnation, and even <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78363" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> says, “God sent His Son.” Since Christ already was the Son of God before the incarnation, why did He need to be designated the Son of God out of resurrection? Because by incarnation He had put on an element, the flesh, the human nature, that had nothing to do with divinity. As a divine Person Christ was the Son of God before His incarnation, but that part of Him which was Jesus with the flesh, the human nature, born of Mary, was not the Son of God. That part of Him was human. By His resurrection Christ has sanctified and uplifted that part of His human nature, His humanity, and He was designated out of this resurrection as the Son of God with this human nature. So, in this sense, the Bible says that He was begotten the Son of God in His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78364" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78365" data-verses="Hebrews 1:5">Heb. 1:5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="6ANzUA-iUjeJrXG0OumNHlKcYqeqVJQuX5wL_kKU5dq3C7vF1_YQpuJ09rnAq0MJO"> Let us consider the example of a small carnation seed. When this seed is sown into the earth, it grows and blossoms, a process which we may label its designation. When we behold a little carnation seed before it is sown into the ground, we may be unable to determine what kind of seed it is. However, once it has been sown, has grown, and has blossomed, it is designated. Its blossom is its designation. Therefore, everyone can say, “This is a carnation.” Both the seed and the blossom are the carnation, but the blossom is very different in form from the seed. If the seed should remain as a seed without blossoming, it is difficult for most people to realize that it is a carnation. But after it has <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> grown and blossomed, it is designated as a carnation for all to see. </p>
<p data-content-id="RRUrZa0dvyz7r8k3lCUxe1IaLLT7GZHs7O9Lgyqlqhw7CeO8ACPd1Y2-5rrPSFRGa"> When Christ was in the flesh during His 33½ years on the earth, He was exactly like the carnation seed. Although the Son of God was in Him, no one could recognize this easily. By being sown into death and growing up in resurrection, He blossomed. By this process He was designated the Son of God, and by this process He uplifted the flesh, the human nature. He did not put off the flesh, He did not put off humanity. He sanctified it, uplifted it and transformed it, and had Himself designated with this transformed humanity the Son of God with the divine power. When He was the Son of God before His incarnation, He had no human nature. After His resurrection He is the Son of God with humanity uplifted, sanctified, and transformed out of resurrection. He is now both of humanity and divinity. He is both the seed of David and the Son of God. He is a wonderful Person! </p>
<p data-content-id="sTrENaXmH-QUV41dS8Dc6-RY2afIOwXHPvMDWR4kxnQD3MSPXqGO1AtiIimI5PGDO"> Christ became flesh to accomplish the work of redemption. Redemption requires blood. It is certain that divinity has no blood; only humanity has blood. Nevertheless, redemption demands blood, for without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78366" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Heb. 9:22</span>). Thus, Christ became flesh for the work of redemption. Redemption, however, is not God’s goal. Redemption opens the way for life to be given. In the Gospel of John, Christ was first introduced as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78367" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). That was for redemption. Following this, John presents Him with the Dove who gives life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78368" data-verses="John 1:32-33">John 1:32-33</span>). Firstly, Christ accomplished redemption for us; then He became our life. Christ became flesh to accomplish the work of redemption for us, and He was designated the Son of God out of resurrection that He may impart Himself to us as our life. The first step of His process was for redemption, and the second step was for imparting life. Now we have the resurrected Christ within us as our life. The resurrected Christ as the Son of God is life to us. Whoever has the Son of God has life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78369" data-verses="1John 5:12">1 John 5:12</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="21" id="21">[21]</span> </p>

After the introduction, Paul presents the matter of condemnation in four aspects: on mankind in general (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78411" data-verses="Romans 1:18-32">1:18-32</span>), on the self-righteous in particular (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78412" data-verses="Romans 2:1-16">2:1-16</span>), on the religious specifically (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78413" data-verses="Romans 2:17">2:17-3:8</span>), and on all the world totally (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78414" data-verses="Romans 3:9-20">3:9-20</span>). Firstly, the book of Romans reveals that condemnation has come upon mankind in general. Then attention is given to two special classes of mankind—the self-righteous class and the cultured, religious class. Finally, the whole world is brought under condemnation. Whether we are good or bad, religious or non-religious, we are under God’s condemnation. Although we do not want to dwell upon the subject of condemnation, there are two points related to it that are quite important. First is the source of evil, the source of wickedness. Because of this source mankind is evil. Thus, in this message we will see the source of man’s wickedness. Second, we need to see the way of restriction. There is a way to restrict this wickedness. Since we have been saved from condemnation, we need not give it much attention. However, we need to return to it long enough to learn the source of evil and the way to restrict evil. </p>

Holding Down the Truth<br/>in Unrighteousness</h2><p data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_nNznbSet51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7"> The first element in the source of wickedness is holding down the truth in unrighteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78416" data-verses="Romans 1:18">1:18</span>). What is truth? Truth is not mere doctrine or knowledge. Truth is reality; it is solid and substantial. There is reality in this universe, and the prime reality is God Himself. To say that there is no God is to speak vanity; to declare the reality of God is to speak something solid, substantial, genuine, and true. God is real. No one can deny the reality of God or disclaim the fact that He exists, for the existence of God is a reality. However, from the very beginning, mankind did not respect the reality of God, but suppressed it. They simply did not care for this reality and refused to hold it in a proper way. They held down the truth in unrighteousness, suppressing it in an unrighteous manner. In the United States today we behold evil on every side, and the newspapers are filled with wicked and shameful things. Why are there so many shameful things in the leading country of the world? Because so many people will not maintain the truth, but instead, wrongfully hold it down. This is the most significant aspect of the source of wickedness. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_ziC6A1N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB">2. Disapproving of Holding God<br/>in Full Knowledge</h2><p data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGz0_2GeS_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv"> Although mankind knew there was God, they tested and tried Him, eventually deciding not to hold Him in their full knowledge. They disapproved of holding God in their full knowledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78417" data-verses="Romans 1:28">1:28</span>). Many professors and professional people do not believe in Christ. If you ask them about God, they will say, “We know there is a God, but we don’t like to believe in Him.” Such people disapprove of holding God in their knowledge. We must hold God in our knowledge, for it is dreadful to refuse to do this. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGRvyHgMDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO">3. Not Glorifying God and<br/>Not Worshipping Him</h2><p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvdl7gDW0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> In the ancient times man knew God, but did not glorify Him as God. Neither did they thank Him, worship Him, or <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> serve Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78418" data-verses="Romans 1:21">1:21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78419" data-verses="Romans 1:25">25</span>). This is another element in the source of evil. Refusing to glorify God, thank God, worship God, and serve God is a major aspect of the source of wickedness. However, if we glorify and thank Him, worship and serve Him, we will be protected from every evil. There are so many divorces and so much immorality throughout the world today because people will not glorify God and worship Him. A man who glorifies God, thanks God, worships God, and serves God, will never divorce his wife. All divorces and immorality come from one source—refusing to worship God. Never think that worshiping God is an insignificant matter and that glorifying Him is trivial. They mean a great deal to our human living. We need to thank God. We have many things for which to thank Him. Some people do not thank God until the hour of their death. Although that is very late, it is better than nothing. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtb6Mj6CFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> We need to realize that glorifying God, thanking God, worshiping God, and serving God are extremely important. Suppose I have a bad temper, a shameful and ugly disposition. If I try to suppress it, I will never succeed. However, if I thank and praise God continually, I will find the best method of escape from my poor disposition. Whenever you are about to lose your temper, you should say, “I am going to serve God. I don’t have time to lose my temper. God, I thank You that You are my God, that You are my Creator. Without You, I would have no being. I owe my very existence to You. I thank You, worship You, and serve You.” If you do this, you will be freed from your disposition immediately. How much we need to worship God! </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSICR9VzskAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m">4. Exchanging God</h2><p data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYIaEvYPOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm"> Then mankind exchanged God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78420" data-verses="Romans 1:23">1:23</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78421" data-verses="Romans 1:25">25</span>). It is terrible to exchange God, for God is the glory and the reality of the universe. When God is expressed, that is glory. To exchange God means to give Him up for something else. The people exchanged God for idols. God is glory; idols are vanity. God is reality; idols are a falsehood and a lie. How foolish and awful it was for man to exchange God for idols! Most of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> people in the United States have learned not to worship visible idols, although some people do practice this. Nevertheless, many people in this country have exchanged God for their self-made idols—their future, positions, degrees, and goals. This means that their future, position, degrees, and goals have become their idols. They care for these idols, not for God. Therefore, they also have exchanged God for idols. </p>
<p data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWaleGNvAiavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na"> If we consider carefully these four aspects of the source of wickedness, we will see that they constitute the origin of every kind of evil and sinfulness. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7CRm-HQUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx">B. The Result of Giving Up God</h2><p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_nPzBh5sEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> Now we need to inquire into the result of giving up God. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYpwQ_QIMtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg">1. Being Given Up by God</h2><p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8QZisuZvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> The first result of giving up God is being given up by God. When you give up God, this forces God to give you up. If you let go of God, God will be compelled to let go of you. This is most deplorable. It is terrible to be given up by God. We must say to God, “Even if I let You go, don’t let me go. Perhaps I will be so foolish as to give You up. Lord, be merciful to me and never give me up.” We need to pray in this way, for it is awful to be given up by God. When a person has been given up by God, he will never do good things. He will not improve but only descend lower and lower. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_387z8xdgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78422" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Romans 1</span>, God gives people up to three things. First is uncleanness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78423" data-verses="Romans 1:24">1:24</span>). When a person gives up God and forces God to give him up, that person will be defiled, immediately becoming involved with uncleanness. Second, God gives up people to passions of dishonor, to shameful lusts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78424" data-verses="Romans 1:26">1:26</span>). I do not like to mention these shameful lusts with my clean lips. Such people may become sodomites, indulging in evil passions and unrestricted affection, dishonoring their bodies with one another. Third, God gives people up to a disapproved mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78425" data-verses="Romans 1:28">1:28</span>). If you disapprove of holding God in your knowledge, God will allow you to have a mind that He disapproves. The mind of sinful men can never be approved by <span class="pg" data-page-id="35" id="35">[35]</span> God. For example, God disapproves of a mind that is occupied with thoughts of divorce. Look at today’s sinful society: no one has a mind that can be approved by God. All have been given up by God to a disapproved mind, for they do that which is improper. People are so foolish and shameful in their sinful ways. Their behavior is absolutely improper. Nevertheless, they continue in sin because God has given them up to a disapproved mind. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3bqrmG3VlY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6">THE VANITY OF RELIGION<br/>AND THE TOTALITY OF HOPELESSNESS</h1><p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRH44BtfOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> In this message we will cover the vanity of religion shown in the condemnation on the religious (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78442" data-verses="Romans 2:17">2:17—3:8</span>) and the totality of hopelessness shown in the condemnation of all the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78443" data-verses="Romans 3:9-20">3:9-20</span>). As we have pointed out, Paul deals with condemnation in four aspects: on mankind in general, on the self-righteous in particular, on the religious specifically, and on all the world totally. This is very meaningful. From these aspects of God’s condemnation we can see four things: the source of wickedness, the way of restriction, the vanity of religion, and the totality of hopelessness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPbOQgCD1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq">I. THE CONDEMNATION ON THE RELIGIOUS</h2><p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxV5gxO9n3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> Let us first consider the vanity of religion. Human culture is the best human invention, and within this culture the foremost item is religion. Religion is the apex of man’s culture. Human culture needs religion, for without it culture is wild. If religion were eliminated from human culture, culture would remain crude. Therefore, most people respect religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkT6Ofxhm-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> Among the human race the two best religions are Judaism and Christianity. These are the typical religions. They are genuine, sound, and fundamental religions. Both proceeded out of the same source, the divine revelation in the Bible. Along with these two religions, we have Islam, a counterfeit of Judaism. Judaism was the source of Islam. The Koran, the sacred book of the Moslems, is actually an imitation of the Old Testament, although its contents have been changed in order to propagate lies. The Koran even speaks about Christ, saying that He is greater than Mohammed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> According to the Koran, Christ was never crucified. As the people attempted to nail Him to the cross, angels descended and took Him away into heaven. The Koran even tells us that this Jesus will return. It is evident, therefore, that Islam and its sacred book, the Koran. are counterfeits. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVp4Ol-nbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> Strictly speaking, besides Judaism, Christianity, and the counterfeit religion of Islam, there are no other religions. Buddhism is not a religion; it is nonsense. A religion teaches people to worship God, but in Buddhism there is no God at all. You may ask about Confucianism. The teachings of Confucius are nonreligious; they are altogether ethical teachings, having nothing to do with God. In his classical writings, Confucius probably mentioned God only once or twice, calling Him “the Heavens.” We should not consider Confucianism as a religion. On this earth there are just three religions—the genuine religions of Judaism and Christianity and the counterfeit religion of Islam. </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeVex0bzjT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> Even with the two genuine religions there is still nothing but vanity. We do not need religion. We need a living Person. We do not need something related to God; we need God Himself. We do not need a way to worship God; we need the living Person of God to come into us. When God gave us the Bible, He had no intention of giving us a religion. God’s intention was to reveal Himself into us through the Holy Word, not to have a religious form. However, the ancient Jews formed a religion out of the Old Testament. Then Christianity made a stronger religion because it has 27 books more than the Jews. The Jews had only 39 books to use in establishing a religion; Christianity has 66. Thus, Christianity has formed an even stronger religion. Nevertheless, the stronger a religion is, the more vanity it contains. </p>
<p data-content-id="w_QXt_moIy43U-iBdBHGgUzaRmL7iM3CET_8qgPLZCAY5YjmkXjovKLmYef-__VX0"> I realize that I may offend some people in speaking this way. The word Christianity is sweet and precious to the ears of many Christians, and it is offensive to them for a man to say that Christianity is vanity. If you are offended by this, it proves that you are exceedingly religious. I do not say that Christ is vanity and I do not say that Christians are vanity, but I assert strongly that Christianity is vanity. Any “anity” <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> is vanity, including “churchanity.” The church is precious, but if you add “anity” to the church it becomes vanity. We want Christ, Christians, and the church, but we do not want any “anity.” This is not my teaching. If we return to the pure Word in the New Testament, we find the term Christ and the term Christians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78444" data-verses="Acts 11:26">Acts 11:26</span>). However, the terms Christianity or Christmas are not in the Bible. A kind of “anity” or “mas” has been added to Christ. Christmas is vanity. When people hang lamps on a little tree, that is “anity” and “mas.” That is vanity. We must beware of religion: religion is vanity. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKWxmRZsI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx">A. Having an Outward Name</h2><p data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcZd0ApKNNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r"> Now we need to consider a few matters about the vanity of religion. First, religion has an outward name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78445" data-verses="Romans 2:17">2:17</span>). Recently, I went to the barbershop for a haircut. The barber talked about attending Christmas Mass. I used the opportunity to ask him how many people would be there. He said, “You know, this is just a religious duty. Some people attend Mass only once a year at Christmas time.” Here we see an example of the vanity of religion: attending Mass once a year as a religious duty in order to keep the name of being a Catholic. What kind of believer is this? A believer with a mere outward name. If you are real in the spirit, meaning you are a genuine believer, that is wonderful. However, if you lack the reality and simply keep the outward name, it means nothing. It is vanity. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1A4STb1RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM">B. Knowing God in Outward Knowledge</h2><p data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCQCepPSNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi"> The second aspect of the vanity of religion is knowing God in outward knowledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78446" data-verses="Romans 2:17-18">2:17-18</span>). It is vain to know God merely in external knowledge, in outward letters. We need the inward knowledge of God, the knowledge in our spirit, the knowledge that spreads into our whole being. We need such an inward and subjective knowledge of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_nKzn6det51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7">C. Having the Scriptures Outwardly</h2><p data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-3YcKLDkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc"> The third item of the vanity of religion is having the Scriptures outwardly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78447" data-verses="Romans 3:2">3:2</span>). Both Jews and Christians have <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> the Bible, but the Bible, for many of them, has become a superstitious book. They hold the Bible in a superstitious way. Some Christians have told me that they are afraid to sleep at night without having a Bible nearby. If they do not place the Bible beside their pillow or on their table, they have no peace to sleep at night, thinking the Holy Bible will keep the demons away from them. This is superstition. Other Christians use the Bible to find guidance in an extraordinary way. They open the Bible, point their finger to a certain place, and follow the leading given in whatever verse they locate. I once heard of a superstitious person who opened the Bible and placed his finger on the verse which said that Judas went out to hang himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78448" data-verses="Matthew 27:5">Matt. 27:5</span>). I wonder what he did. It is terrible and absolutely superstitious to handle the Scriptures in this way. All of these vain practices must be torn down. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK3lemT8LzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> Of course, most orthodox Jews and genuine Christians do not handle the Bible in such a superstitious way, but they do not take the Scriptures in a real and living way. They care for the teachings in letters; they do not care for Christ, the living Person. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78449" data-verses="John 5:39-40">John 5:39-40</span> the Lord Jesus told the Jewish religionists that they search the Scriptures for knowledge, yet will not come to Him for life. Today many Christians are in the same category. Thus, the Bible does not mean much to them in life and reality. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kTTg-WL5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl">D. Keeping the Outward Form in Letter</h2><p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3bqrmG-WlY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> Some religious people keep the outward form in letter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78450" data-verses="Romans 2:27-28">2:27-28</span>). Take the example of baptism. Many dear Christians cling to their concepts about baptism by immersion in water. I myself am strongly in favor of baptism by immersion according to the Scriptures and I would never baptize people by sprinkling them. However, this matter of baptism has almost entirely become a mere outward form. We must avoid all outward forms. Paul told the Jews that if their circumcision is merely outward, it is unreal. The genuine circumcision is inward, in the heart and in the spirit. We may apply the same word to baptism, for, in a sense, baptism replaces <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> circumcision. In the Old Testament was circumcision, and in the New Testament circumcision has been replaced by baptism. Since circumcision is unreal as long as it is practiced as a bare outward form, so baptism can never be real if it is simply outward. I am sorry to say that nearly all baptisms have degraded into an outward form. </p>

Martin Luther was raised up by God to wage a fierce battle over justification because it is such a great doctrine in the Bible. Although Luther contended for the truth of justification, we have to understand how justification relates to propitiation, redemption, and reconciliation. In this message, we shall cover all these terms and seek to make them clear. However, we first need to consider the righteousness of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwY-oY8fqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> What is the righteousness of God? We may say that the righteousness of God is what God is with respect to justice and rightness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78463" data-verses="Romans 3:21-22">Rom. 3:21-22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78464" data-verses="Romans 1:17">1:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78465" data-verses="Romans 10:3">10:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78466" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">Phil. 3:9</span>). God is just and right. Whatever God is in His justice and rightness constitutes His righteousness. Furthermore, all that God is in His justice and rightness is actually Himself. Therefore, the righteousness of God is God Himself. The righteousness of God is a Person, not merely a divine attribute. </p>

We should not say this. Our righteousness is not the righteousness of Christ; it is Christ Himself. Christ Himself as a Person, not His attribute of righteousness, has been made the righteousness of God to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78467" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> Do not say that the righteousness of Christ has become your righteousness. Instead you should say, “Christ is my righteousness. My righteousness before God is the living Person of Christ, not an attribute. The righteous Christ is mine.” God has made Christ, who is the very embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness. </p>

Paul does not say that the believers are made righteous; he says that they are made righteousness. We have been made the righteousness of God in Christ. This is a deep matter. How can we become the righteousness of God? By having Christ wrought into us. We have seen that Christ is the embodiment of God, and that God, as a living Person, is righteousness. Therefore, righteousness, God, and Christ are one. The righteousness of God is God Himself. Since this God is embodied in Christ, Christ is the righteousness of God. Christ has been wrought into us, and we have been put into Christ. We have been mingled together with Christ as one. Thus, we become the righteousness of God. Paul declares, “For to me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78469" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>). As Christ has been wrought into us, we can say with Paul, “For to me to live is Christ.” Suppose we have a glass of water. Once tea has been blended with it, it no longer is plain water; it is tea. Likewise, once Christ has been wrought into us, we become one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYpwW_QEOtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> The righteousness of God is not only God Himself in His justice and rightness, and it is not only the living Person of Christ; it is also we who have been made one with Christ. The living Person of Christ as God’s righteousness has been wrought into us, and we have been put into Him. Therefore, we have been made the righteousness of God. We must proclaim, “I am the righteousness of God. I have been justified. God is righteousness, and I am too. I am the righteousness of God in Christ. I am what God is. I’m fully justified. God and I have been identified. I approve God, and He approves <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> me. We mutually approve each other.” This is justification by faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8QfisibvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> Some may think we should not say that we approve God. Nevertheless, we all must approve Him. God likes to be judged and approved by us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78470" data-verses="Romans 3:4">Rom. 3:4</span>). Thus, we can say to God, “You approve us, and we approve You.” </p>

Justification is God’s action in approving people according to His standard of righteousness. His righteousness is the standard, not ours. Although we think we are righteous, our righteousness is only a quarter inch high. Regardless of how righteous we are or how righteous we think we are, our righteousness is just a fraction of an inch high. How high is God’s righteousness? It is unlimited! Can you be approved by God according to your own righteousness? This is impossible. Although you may be right with everyone—with your parents, your children, and your friends—your righteousness will never justify you before God. You may justify yourself according to your standard of righteousness, but that does not enable you to be justified by God according to His standard. We need justification by faith. Justification by faith before God means we are approved by God according to the standard of His righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HfZfrger0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> How can God do this? He can do it because our justification is based upon the redemption of Christ. When the redemption of Christ is applied to us, we are justified. If there were no such redemption, it would be impossible for us to be justified by God. Redemption is the basis of justification. </p>

The Expiatory Cover of the Ark</h2><p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmgs1QsmJO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> The expiatory cover (rendered “mercy seat” by the King James Version) was the lid of the ark (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78475" data-verses="Exodus 25:17-22">Exo. 25:17-22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78476" data-verses="Leviticus 16:14">Lev. 16:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78477" data-verses="Hebrews 9:5">Heb. 9:5</span>). Under this cover was the law which was called the testimony of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78478" data-verses="Exodus 25:21">Exo. 25:21</span>). Why was it called the testimony of God? Because the law testifies of what God is. God is fully testified and expressed by His law. Above the expiatory cover were the cherubim of glory, signifying the expression of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78479" data-verses="Exodus 25:19-20">Exo. 25:19-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78480" data-verses="Hebrews 9:5">Heb. 9:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78481" data-verses="Romans 3:23">Rom. 3:23</span>). Therefore, under the cover was the testimony of God, showing what kind of God He is, and above the cover were the cherubim of glory, expressing the glory of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJNPMhWVV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM"> The expiatory cover was sprinkled with the expiatory blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78482" data-verses="Leviticus 16:14">Lev. 16:14</span>, cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78483" data-verses="Leviticus 16:18">18</span>). On the day of atonement, or, as is better to say, the day of expiation, the blood of the expiatory sacrifice was shed, brought into the Holy of Holies, and sprinkled upon the expiatory cover. That blood was a speaking blood. At that time, some problems existed between God and the people. Everyone had sinned against God and was short of God’s glory. Thus, two problems—the problem of sins and the problem of falling short of God’s glory—existed between God and the people, creating a separation between them. There was no way for them to come together. Although the people needed God’s grace, and although God had grace to dispense to them, there was no way for the two parties to approach one another. Expiation was the way. That was the way of atonement, of at-one-ment. In the Old Testament times, the way of atonement, that is of expiation, required a sacrifice in which blood was shed. This blood was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled upon the cover of the ark. As we have seen, under this cover was the law exposing and condemning the people as they approached God, and above the cover were the cherubim of glory observing <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> everything. As the blood of atonement was sprinkled upon the cover of the ark, it satisfied the righteous requirements of God’s law and it fulfilled the demands of God’s glory. Therefore, upon the expiatory cover of the ark God could meet with man, speak to man, and fellowship with man in a lawful way without contradicting His righteousness or glory. It was in this place that God and man were made one. That was the atonement, the expiation. </p>

Although this book covers many doctrines, it was actually written according to facts and experiences. The book of Romans is based on experience. Justification may appear to be a doctrinal matter, but the Apostle Paul, along with the doctrine of justification, gives us a living example of it—the person of Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78536" data-verses="Romans 4:1-25">4:1-25</span>). In this message we will consider Abraham, the example of justification. He is our model, our pattern. The name Abraham means “father of a multitude.” According to the Scriptures, Abraham was the father of both the Jews and the believing Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78537" data-verses="Romans 4:11-12">Rom. 4:11-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78538" data-verses="Romans 4:16-17">16-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78539" data-verses="Galatians 3:7-9">Gal. 3:7-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78540" data-verses="Galatians 3:29">29</span>). Whoever is of faith, whether Jew or Gentile, is a descendant of Abraham. </p>

THE CALLED ONE</h2><p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtb_MjnMFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> Abraham was the called one. Adam was created, but Abraham was called. There is a great difference between being created and being called. The book of Genesis is divided into two main sections: the first section covers the first ten and a half chapters and relates the history of the created race, with Adam as the father and head; the second section covers from the middle of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78541" data-verses="Genesis 11:10">chapter eleven</span> through the end of the book and relates the history of the called race, with Abraham as the father and head. The history of the created race as recorded in Genesis culminates in the building of the tower and city of Babel (Babylon in Greek). Names of idols were written on this tower, meaning that the whole created race had turned to idolatry. Thus, Paul says the human race had exchanged God for idols (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78542" data-verses="Romans 1:23">1:23</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78543" data-verses="Romans 1:25">25</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSICU9VqjkAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> Paul wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78544" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Romans 1</span> according to the history narrated in Genesis. Beginning with the time of Cain, man disapproved of holding God in his full knowledge and gave Him up. Mankind forsook God and built the city of Enoch, the first human culture as recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78545" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>. With that culture the human race descended into corruption and remained in a state of corruption until the flood came as God’s judgment upon them. By God’s mercy, eight persons were saved through the ark, which typified Christ. The number eight is the number of resurrection, indicating that these people were saved and preserved in resurrection. In a sense, Noah was the head of a new race. However, not long afterward the descendants of Noah also gave up God at Babel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78546" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span>. When they exchanged God for idols, the forsaking of God was complete. The giving up of God was not completed before the flood; it was completed afterward by the descendants of Noah, who fell into idolatry. </p>
<p data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYIfEv9DOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm"> Fornication followed idolatry. After Babel, Sodom emerged. Sodom was a city of fornication. In the English language we have the words sodomy and sodomites, which signify the most shameful acts of fornication. The inhabitants of Sodom violated their own nature and caused great confusion. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78547" data-verses="Genesis 19:1">Genesis 19</span>, the human race, which had exchanged God for idols, had fallen into sodomy. As a result, every kind of wickedness burst forth. </p>
<p data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWaleDNvhvavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na"> This was the background of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78548" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Romans 1</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78549" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Romans 1</span> was written according to the history of the human fall: disapproving of holding God, exchanging God for idols, falling into fornication, and producing every kind of wickedness. </p>
<p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kTRg-WD5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> During the terrible process of the fall, mankind exchanged God for idols and completely abandoned Him. In return, God also forsook mankind. God seemed to say, “Since you have given Me up, I will let you go.” The created race gave up God, and God gave up the created race. </p>
<p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3bqpmG-elY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> However, God called out of this race one man with his wife. God had no intention of calling a third person. His intention was to call one complete person, which includes a man and wife. If you are an unmarried man, you are incomplete. Without your wife, you are an incomplete person; you need <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> her to complement you. Together you are a complete entity. Therefore, God called Abraham with his wife as one complete person. </p>
<p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRH64B4XOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> We may think of ourselves as not being very absolute for God. However, Abraham, our believing father and model, was not absolute himself. When he was called by God to leave Ur of the Chaldees, he not only brought his wife, but other relatives as well. </p>
<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPbMQgTK1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> God called Abraham by appearing to him as the God of glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78550" data-verses="Acts 7:2-3">Acts 7:2-3</span>). God did not call him by mere words: He called him by His glory. Abraham saw the glory of God and was attracted. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxV5ixOgp3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> Our experience is the same. In a sense, we also have seen the glory of God. When we heard the gospel and it penetrated us, we saw the glory of God. Did you not see the glory of God at the time you were saved? I saw it when I was an ambitious young man. I had no intention of receiving God, but as the gospel penetrated into me I could not help saying, “God, I want You.” I could not deny that the glory of God had appeared to me. Such an experience is indefinable. No human words can adequately describe what we saw when the gospel penetrated our being. We can only say that the God of glory appeared to us, attracting us and calling us. We, like Abraham, were called by the God of glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkT6Mfx4p-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> Abraham was the same as we are. We should not think that we are different from him. We should not appreciate Abraham and depreciate ourselves, for we are all on the same level. We are all Abraham. Abraham was not outstanding. When I heard the story of Abraham as a child, I thought he was extraordinary. However, as I read the Word in later years, I realized that there is little difference between Abraham and me, that we are nearly the same. Although Abraham had been called by God, he did not have the boldness to leave the land of idolatry, forcing God to use Abraham’s father to bring him out of Ur. Abraham was the called one, but his father initiated the actual departure. They left Ur of the Chaldees and dwelt in Haran. However, when Abraham still was not bold enough to follow God <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> absolutely, God was forced to take his father. His father died in Haran, and God called Abraham the second time. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVp6OlbrbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> Abraham’s first call is recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78551" data-verses="Acts 7:2-4">Acts 7:2-4</span>; the second call is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78552" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12:1</span>. We should note the difference between these two calls. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78553" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span>, God called Abraham out of two things—his country and his kindred. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78554" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12:1</span>, another item is added—his father’s house. The first call asked Abraham to leave his country and his people; the second call asked him to leave his country, his kindred, and his father’s house. Abraham and his wife had to go out alone. God took away Abraham’s father and He did not want him to take any other relative with him. </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeVcx06-jT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> If we consider what Abraham did, we will realize that we are not the only ones who are not absolute in obeying the Lord’s call. Our father Abraham was the first to follow God without being absolute. He felt lonely. He did not want to leave by himself. Thus, he took his nephew Lot with him. This violated God’s call. Although Abraham answered the Lord’s call, his answer, at least in part, disobeyed that call. Likewise, nearly all of us have answered God’s call; yet in our answer we acted contrary to His call. None of us has answered God’s call in an absolute way. Nevertheless, God is absolute. Regardless of how unabsolute we are, God will fulfill His call. </p>
<p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomGZxmpu65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> Abraham loved Lot. God used him to discipline Abraham. Eventually, Lot separated from Abraham and Abraham followed God’s call absolutely. He no longer had his father or his nephew. He was alone with his wife. He had left his country, his kindred, and his father’s house. However, Abraham had to leave one more thing—himself. He held on to himself. </p>

We should not understand it just in a superficial way. If we enter into the depths of this chapter, we will see it reveals that adequate, living justification is God’s deeper work in calling fallen people out of everything other than God and bringing them back to Himself. God created man for Himself and to Himself. However, man fell. The meaning of the fall of man is to be kept from God by anything that is not God. The man who had been created to God fell away from God to other things. It does not matter whether a thing is good or bad. As long as it is not God and it keeps man from God, it constitutes a fall. In God’s justification, God calls the fallen man out of everything back to Himself. Therefore, when God called Abraham, He did not tell him where he should go, because His intention was to bring Abraham back to Himself. Moment after moment and step after step, Abraham’s heart had to cleave to God. He had to trust in God for every move, not leaving His presence for a moment. In other words, Abraham had to be one with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKStomoiB0TVgGaB81DmsoAIACkQefxo1786oQtaQs3phAEmsIsEHfDkTPzIJOxrQ"> After God called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees, God trained Abraham to believe in Him. As we have seen, believing in God means to believe into God and to make ourselves one with God. In this kind of believing, a man admits that he is nothing, that he has nothing, and that he can do nothing. He agrees that he must be terminated. Thus, believing <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> in God means to terminate ourselves and to let God be our very being, to let God be all that we should be. From the time we first believe in Him, we should not be anything. We should be completely terminated and allow God to be everything in us. This is the accurate meaning of circumcision. It is inadequate even to ask the Lord to circumcise our heart, for the deep and adequate circumcision is to terminate yourself and allow God to be everything. </p>
<p data-content-id="D5w8-kFdQxmkmF1GzR6E4rr2kKPPWrkUq03mqLc30FIAV31DN5B-3O4zuykkIOmJX"> When a person has been called by God in this way, the living God transfuses Himself into him. This word transfuse is important in describing what transpires at God’s calling. The living God spontaneously transfuses Himself into the called one. As a result, he is attracted by God and to God. Unconsciously, some element, some essence of the living God is transfused into him, and he reacts to God by believing in Him. This reaction is faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6W-qcHaRvTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> When you heard the gospel of glory regarding the Lord Jesus, you repented. This means that God called you out of everything other than Himself. At that moment, without your even knowing it, the living Christ in His gospel of glory transfused Himself into you (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78573" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4">2 Cor. 4:4</span>). Some element of Christ penetrated your being, and you were attracted to Him. You reacted to Him, and your spontaneous reaction was your believing, your faith. The Christ who transfused Himself into you became your faith. Therefore, faith does not originate with us; it comes from God. Faith is not separate from Christ, for it is actually Christ Himself transfusing Himself into us and producing a reaction within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="D5w8-kFdQxmkmF1GzR6E4rrTuKPPWrkUq03mqLc30FIAV31DN5B-3O4zuykkIOmJX"> Our believing is an echo. How can there be an echo without a sound? It is impossible. Christ is the sound. When this sound reaches our heart and spirit it causes a reaction, an echo. This reaction is our appreciation of and faith in the Lord Jesus. This faith is actually Christ Himself within us responding to the gospel. Therefore, this faith is reckoned to us by God as righteousness. When Christ transfused Himself into you, there was a reaction within you—believing. After you believed in the Lord, God reacted to you, reckoning your faith, which is Christ, as righteousness. We do not find this <span class="pg" data-page-id="79" id="79">[79]</span> experience in the Bible if we read superficially, but if we probe into the depths of the Scriptures, we find it there. It is as if God said to us, “Poor sinner, you don’t have righteousness. As I, the living God, am speaking with you, My essence is being transfused into you. This will cause you to react to Me in faith, and I will reckon this faith to you as righteousness.” When God does this to us, we have an appreciative and loving reaction toward Him. This reaction is our faith, a faith that does not originate with us, but which is the essence of the living Christ within us. This faith returns to God, causing a reaction in God toward us: the righteousness of God is reckoned as ours, and we have something that we never had before. This is our experience of God in justification. </p>
<p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6W-qcH7avTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> Thus, we have the righteousness of God, which is Christ. Isaac was a type of Christ. Abraham, our believing father, received the righteousness of God and Isaac. Likewise, we have received both the righteousness of God and Christ, the present Isaac. This is an experience of God calling things not being as being. When we came to God on the day we were saved, we had nothing. Nevertheless, God appeared to us and called things not being as being. Formerly, we did not have the righteousness of God; after a few minutes we had it. Before that time, we did not have Christ; after a few minutes we had Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="gTWF_O-VusFLsBnICnGYB1lDxHlcJrTjqrrJfkDlEYM2QChTjzMfb7iFBzHc2B8W3"> Once we have an experience of the righteousness of God and Christ, we will guard it as a priceless treasure. We will proclaim, “I have the righteousness of God. I have Christ.” However, one day God will intervene and say, “Offer this on the altar.” Will you do it? Not one out of a hundred Christians is willing. Instead they say, “O Lord, don’t ask me to do this. I would do anything else, but not this.” Nevertheless, we must remember the reactions which go back and forth between man and God. The righteousness of God and Christ are ours—these came as God’s reaction to our faith. Now we must return this reaction to God by offering it to Him. After we react in this way, God will react again. God’s first reaction was to call things not being as being. His second reaction is to give life to the dead. This is profound. <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8yjVGTLwJuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78574" data-verses="Romans 4:1">Romans 4</span>, the ultimate issue of this series of reactions is the resurrected Christ. This resurrected Christ is now in the heavens as a strong proof that God has been satisfied and that we have been justified. The resurrected Christ is in the third heavens at the right hand of God as conclusive evidence that all of God’s requirements have been satisfied and that we have been thoroughly and adequately justified. However, this resurrected Christ is not only in the heavens, but also within us to impart life that we may have a life of justification. Therefore, justification is not merely a positional matter; it becomes a dispositional matter. The death of Christ gave us a positional justification, and the resurrected Christ in the heavens is a proof of this. Now the resurrected Christ also lives inside us, reacting within us and living out a life of dispositional justification. Eventually, we are justified both in position and in disposition. We not only have an objective justification, but a subjective justification as well. We may now live such a subjective, dispositional justification. </p>
<p data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822F0l6ePdifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n"> This justification is the real, living circumcision. What is circumcision? Circumcision means to terminate ourselves and to come into God: it terminates us and it germinates God into us. The Jews do not care for the inward reality of circumcision; they only care for the outward form, the practice of cutting off a piece of flesh. This is not circumcision in the eyes of God. In God’s eyes, circumcision means to cut off yourself, terminate yourself, and allow God to germinate Himself within you to be your life that you may have a new beginning. This circumcision is the outward seal of the real, inward justification. </p>

By the birth of Isaac Abraham experienced God in this way. Furthermore, by the resurrection of Isaac, Abraham experienced God as the One who gives life to the dead. There are two kinds of Isaac: the first is Isaac born; the second is Isaac resurrected. The God in whom Abraham believed had these two aspects. He believed in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> God who calls things not being as being and who gives life to the dead. </p>

<p data-content-id="hoPGAKCjyReE3jTK36Db_QlZsbyuYQyTD22BFHBhVNAcZ4CopGqxWdODu-9xdw8R1"> When Paul wrote the book of Romans, he must have had the Old Testament in view. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78608" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Romans 1</span> we find a clear reference to the book of Genesis. The phrase, “the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen,” refers to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78609" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>. The “invisible things,” meaning God’s divine attributes, may be apprehended from creation. Thus, Paul began the book of Romans with an allusion to the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78610" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">first chapter of Genesis</span>. Furthermore, Paul’s account of the condemnation on mankind follows the stages of the fall of man recorded in Genesis. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78611" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span>, Cain gave up God, disapproving of holding Him in his understanding. By the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78612" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span>, the entire fallen race had exchanged God for idols. They exchanged the God of glory for idols of vanity and degenerated into fornication and confusion, which were manifested in the extreme at Sodom. This resulted in the practice of every imaginable evil. Paul used this history of the corrupted race as the background for the section on the condemnation of mankind. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78613" data-verses="Romans 3:1">Romans 3</span> Paul alludes to the picture of the ark with its cover as he portrays Christ as the propitiation place. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78614" data-verses="Romans 3:1">Romans 3</span> was also written with the Old Testament in view. Moreover, when Paul came to the conclusion of justification, he employed the history of Abraham as a full example. Abraham’s history affords a complete pattern of the genuine and subjective justification of God. If we only had Paul’s teaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78615" data-verses="Romans 3:1">Romans 3</span>, we could <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> never appreciate the depths of God’s justification. We would only have the seed of justification without the kernel. </p>

In my spirit I am burdened that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78616" data-verses="Romans 4:1">Romans 4</span> be fully opened to the Lord’s people. As I have said already, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78617" data-verses="Romans 4:1">Romans 4</span> is a deep chapter, far deeper than we realize. It presents Abraham’s experience with God. Abraham is an example of the experience of God’s called ones with God. We do not have the adequate human language to describe such an experience. After considering this matter very seriously, I have selected the word transfuse to help us understand the interaction between God and man. </p>
<p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVeps2Fa48c8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> The application of electricity depends on the fuse, and we may say that the power of electricity is applied through the fuse. This is transfusion. The heavenly electricity is far away in the heavens, but the place where this electricity must be applied is here on earth. If this divine electricity is to come to us, we need a transfusion. Thus, God transfuses Himself into us. Once we have this transfusion, we will experience a spiritual infusion as God’s essence infiltrates our being. This infusion of God’s element will saturate and permeate us. Transfusion brings in infusion, and this infusion permeates us with God’s element. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XIHrd-WP0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0">FAITH AS A REACTION</h2><p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomGXxmpm65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> This permeation causes a reaction. The spiritual virtues and divine attributes that have been transmitted into us will react within us. The first reaction is believing. This is our faith. This is the highest definition of faith. Faith is not our natural ability or virtue. Faith is our reaction toward God, which results from God’s transfusing Himself into us and infusing His divine elements into our being. When God’s elements permeate our being, we react to Him, and this reaction is faith. Faith is not a human virtue; it is absolutely a reaction caused by a divine infusion, which saturates and permeates our being. Once we have such a faith, we can <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> never lose it. It is deeper than our blood, for it has been infused into us and constituted into our being. Although we may try not to believe, we can never succeed. This is what the Bible means by believing in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVsvih-B7xl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> If my memory is accurate, Paul never uses the term “by faith in Jesus.” However, at least two or three times he mentions “the faith of Jesus,” a phrase that troubles most translators. Some, finding it difficult to define such a phrase, have changed the preposition from “of” to “in.” If we change the preposition, the phrase will read “faith in Jesus” and mean that we believe in Jesus by ourselves. This is not Paul’s meaning. Paul means that we believe in the Lord Jesus by means of the Lord Jesus Himself as our faith. Since we do not have the ability to believe, we must take Christ as our believing ability. We need to believe in the Lord Jesus by His faith. I have tried to understand this for nearly forty years. In the past I explained faith as Christ working Himself into us. That was the best definition I had at the time. However, in the last few days the Lord has given me a better term: faith is our reaction to God produced by His transfusion, infusion, and saturation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2GDo-lUQ_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk">THE PROCESS OF TRANSFUSION</h2><p data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0ScupIStDRsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx"> How is this transfusion accomplished? God, as the heavenly electricity, comes to His chosen ones. For example, God came to Abraham by appearing to him. If we study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78618" data-verses="Genesis 11:1-24">Genesis 11 through 24</span>, including the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78619" data-verses="Acts 7:1">Acts 7</span>, we find that God appeared to Abraham several times. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78620" data-verses="Acts 7:2">Acts 7:2</span> says that the God of glory appeared to Abraham. It is sure that Abraham was attracted by the appearing of the God of glory. To be attracted simply means that God transfused Himself into Abraham without his realizing it or being conscious of it. This is similar to the radium treatment practiced in modern medicine. The patient is placed under the X-ray, unconscious of the beams that are penetrating him. God is the strongest radium. If we sit under Him for an hour, He will transfuse Himself into us. This transfusion will cause infusion, saturation, and permeation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Du4QfUZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4">THE TRANSFUSION IN THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbJ2SeGxfe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> In any proper gospel preaching there should be such a transfusion, the transfusion of Christ into people. How can Christ be transfused into us? It is by the preaching of the gospel. Whenever we preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in a normal way, there will be an appearing of the living Christ, and this appearing will transfuse Christ into people. </p>
<p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocPuryK2nWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> I can confirm this by my own experience. Although I was born in China and learned the teachings of Confucius, Confucius had no attraction for me. Christianity as a religion did not appeal to me either. When I was nineteen years old, the Lord sent a young sister to my town to preach the gospel. I was curious to see her. As I sat in the meeting place and heard her singing and speaking, the glory of God appeared, and I was attracted. No one had to convince me to believe. As I listened to her, God transfused Himself into me, and this transfusion overwhelmed and conquered me, causing a very positive reaction. Coming out of the meeting hall and walking along the road, I lifted up my eyes to the heavens and said, “God, You know I am an ambitious young man. But, even if the people promise me the whole world to be my empire, I would refuse it. I want to take You. From this day onward I want to serve You. I would like to be a poor preacher going from village to village, telling people how good Jesus is.” In this way the living Jesus was transfused into my being. Immediately I reacted to God, and God reacted back to me. My reaction to God was my believing in Him. That was my faith. God’s reaction back to me was to justify me, to give His righteousness with peace and joy to me. The righteousness of God reacted to me, and from that time on I had that righteousness. Christ was made the righteousness of God to me. Thus I had peace and joy, and I was filled with hope. I had been justified by God. God had called me out of everything other than Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwYzoYlSqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> Once Christ has transfused Himself into you, you can never escape; you must believe in Him. I am familiar with many cases that occurred under my own gospel preaching. Some people said, “I simply don’t know what happened to <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> me. After I listened to that preacher the first time and came home, I said that I didn’t want anything to do with Christ, that I did not like Jesus. But something got into me. I tried to cast it away, but I couldn’t do it. Although I don’t want to go back, something within me urges me to go hear him again and again.” What is this? This is the effect of the transfusing of Christ into people. Out of this transfusion a reaction comes—believing in Jesus by the faith of Jesus. </p>

The love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78654" data-verses="Romans 5:5">v. 5</span>). We have access into this grace in which we stand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78655" data-verses="Romans 5:2">v. 2</span>). Since we have been justified by faith we have peace toward God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78656" data-verses="Romans 5:1">v. 1</span>). Following this, we boast, exult, and glory in hope (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78657" data-verses="Romans 5:2">v. 2</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78658" data-verses="Romans 5:10">Verse 10</span> tells us that we shall be saved in His life. Finally, we expect to share the glory of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78659" data-verses="Romans 5:2">v. 2</span>). These six items are part of the result of God’s justification. Do you want God’s love and grace? Do you desire peace and hope? Do you want to share the divine, eternal life of God and be in His glory? For all of these matters you need justification. All of them are our portion as the issue of God’s justification. </p>
<p data-content-id="RRUrZa0dvyz7r8k3lCUxV1IHHLT7GZHs7O9Lgyqlqhw7CeO8ACPd1Y2-5rrPSFRGa"> Along with these six significant words, we have three wonderful Persons. (Although I do not like the term “Persons” because it has been inaccurately understood in the teachings on the Trinity, yet, there is no term more adequate in our human language to use in relation to the Godhead.) In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78660" data-verses="Romans 5:1-11">Romans 5:1-11</span> we see the three Persons of the Triune God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78661" data-verses="Romans 5:5">Verse 5</span> speaks of the Holy Spirit, telling us that the Holy Spirit has poured out the love of God into our heart. <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78662" data-verses="Romans 5:6">verse 6</span> tells us that while we were yet weak and ungodly, Christ died for us. Finally, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78663" data-verses="Romans 5:11">verse 11</span> says that now we boast in God. The King James Version reads, “joy in God,” meaning that God has become our enjoyment. We joy, boast, exult, and glory in God because He is our enjoyment. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78664" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> unveils six wonderful things and three wonderful Persons. We have love, grace, peace, hope, life, and glory. As a result of God’s justification, we have the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God as our enjoyment. Oh, this portion of the Word is so rich! We need a great many messages to cover it adequately. </p>

Many times in our Christian life we need encouragement and confirmation. As we pass through periods of suffering, we may have questions and doubts. Perhaps you say, “Why are there so many troubles in my Christian life? Why are there so many trials and tests?” We may have such questions and doubts about our circumstances. Although these doubts arise, we cannot deny that the love of God is within us. From the day we first called on the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. This means that the Spirit reveals, confirms, and assures us with the love of God. The indwelling Holy Spirit seems to say, “Don’t doubt. God loves you. You don’t understand why you must suffer now, but one day you will say, <span class="pg" data-page-id="103" id="103">[103]</span> ‘Father, I thank You for the troubles and trials which I passed through.’” When you enter the gate of eternity, you will say, “Praise the Lord for the sufferings and tests which fell upon me on my journey. God used them to transform me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLNj7_AtoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP"> Oh, the love of God has been poured into our hearts! Although we may be afflicted, poor, and depressed, we cannot deny the presence of God’s love within us. Can we deny that Christ died for us? Christ died for ungodly sinners such as we. Once we were enemies, but Christ shed His blood on the cross to reconcile us to God. What love is this! If God has given us His own Son, surely He will not do anything to hurt us. God is sovereign. He knows what is best for us. The choice is His, not ours. Regardless of our preference, what God has planned for us will be our portion. Everything related to us has been prepared by our Father. We should simply pray, “Lord, have your way. I simply want what You want. I leave everything entirely in Your hands.” This is our response to God when we realize afresh that He loves us so and that His love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. </p>

If you are about to quarrel with your wife and sense you are out of the realm of grace, stop what you are doing, return to the realm of grace, and stand there. </p>
<p data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvMoXAXk173NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr"> We need not do anything sinful to be cut off from grace. We only need to stay in a place too long and we will sense that we have moved from the realm of grace into another sphere. What should we do in such a case? We should pray, “Lord, forgive me. Bring me back to the realm of grace.” We return to the realm of grace by the same way through which we entered it originally. We entered the realm of grace <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> through justification by faith. We simply confessed our sins to God, received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, applied His blood, and we were justified. God’s justification brought us into this grace in which we stand. Whenever we act wrongly and sense that we are out of grace, we must repeat the same prayer, “O God, forgive me. Cleanse me with the precious blood.” If you do this, you will be brought back to grace instantly. </p>
<p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaPyRwOnb3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> Since we have been justified by faith and stand in the realm of grace, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78669" data-verses="Romans 5:1">5:1</span>). Paul does not say that we have peace with God, but peace toward God. This means that we are still on the way toward God. We have not finished our journey. In the spiritual world, we first enter the gate and then walk along the way. Justification by faith is the opening of the gate, giving us an access, an entry into a wide field of enjoyment. Once we have passed through the gate of justification, we need to walk the way of peace. Sinners have no peace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78670" data-verses="Romans 3:17">Romans 3:17</span> says that when we were sinners we did not know the way of peace. Today, however, we are walking in the way of peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qlyyBhnSHZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> If you are moving in a certain direction and do not sense the peace within, you should stop. Always go along with the peace. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78671" data-verses="Luke 7:50">Luke 7:50</span>, the Lord Jesus told the sinful woman, once she had been saved, to go in peace. Young people, after you are saved you must go your way in peace. Wherever you go, you must take the way of peace. If you have no peace, do not go. Whatever you do, do it in peace. If you have no peace, do not act. Grace is for our stand, and peace is for our walk. If you do not have the grace to stay in a certain place, do not stay there. If you have no peace to take a certain direction, do not walk. Stand in grace and walk in peace. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_jOznzSet51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7">THE GIFT IN CHRIST SURPASSING<br/>THE HERITAGE IN ADAM</h1><p data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-zccKePkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc"> If we read the book of Romans carefully, we will observe that the section on justification ends with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78687" data-verses="Romans 5:11">Romans 5:11</span>. This means that in the first part of Romans we mainly have two sections, condemnation and justification. The section on condemnation begins at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78688" data-verses="Romans 1:18">1:18</span> and ends with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78689" data-verses="Romans 3:20">3:20</span>. The portion on justification begins with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78690" data-verses="Romans 3:21">3:21</span> and concludes at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78691" data-verses="Romans 5:11">5:11</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK3hamTtGzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> In the section on justification, Paul is concerned with our outward position before God. Originally, we were full of sin and needed the redemption of Christ as a base upon which God can justify us. God’s justification has changed our position. Formerly, our position was under God’s condemnation; now our position is under God’s justification. As a result of justification, we have love, grace, peace, hope, life, glory, God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Although we may enjoy these six significant items and three wonderful Persons, they are mainly outward and objective. Nevertheless, in the section on justification Paul does give some hints to indicate that he will proceed to deal with our inward disposition. </p>
<p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kXXg-LJ5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> The first hint is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78692" data-verses="Romans 4:24-25">Romans 4:24-25</span>, where Paul speaks of the resurrected Christ. The crucified Christ can never enter our being, but the resurrected Christ is able to come into us. Our Christ is not only the Christ who was crucified for our redemption; He is also the Christ who was resurrected that He may impart life into us. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78693" data-verses="Romans 4:24-25">Romans 4:24-25</span> intimates that Christ will come into the justified ones and live in them a life of justification. </p>
<p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3buvmGnVlY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> We see another hint in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78694" data-verses="Romans 5:10">Romans 5:10</span>, which says that we shall be saved in His life. The words “shall be” imply experiences in the future. Prior to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78695" data-verses="Romans 5:10">Romans 5:10</span> we were told that we <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> have already been saved, because we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled. Why does this verse suddenly say that we shall be saved? Although we have been saved by Christ’s death for redemption, justification, and reconciliation, we have not yet been saved for sanctification, transformation, and conformation. Redemption, justification, and reconciliation all require the death of Christ in which His blood was shed, while sanctification, transformation, and conformation require the inward working of His life. Christ’s death on the cross saved us in an objective way, and His life will save us in a subjective way. The crucified Christ saved us objectively on the cross; the resurrected Christ within us saves us subjectively. His life must enter into us. Eventually, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78696" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, the conclusion of the section that deals with our disposition, we see that Christ is in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78697" data-verses="Romans 8:10">8:10</span>). Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78698" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapter five</span> Christ was crucified on the cross, but was not yet in us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78699" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> Christ is no longer on the cross—He is in us. This indwelling Christ is the life that will save us subjectively after we have been saved objectively. We need to be saved more and more. We have been saved from hell and from God’s condemnation: this is positional salvation. Now we need to be saved from our disposition, such as our old man, our self, our natural life, etc.: this is dispositional salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRD84BdfOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> Another hint that Romans shifts from a positional aspect to a dispositional aspect after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78700" data-verses="Romans 5:11">5:11</span> is found in the occurrence of the words sin and sins. Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78701" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12</span> the word sin is always found in the plural number. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78702" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12</span> this word suddenly appears in the singular. Why is there this change? Sins are outward and concern our position; sin is inward and concerns our disposition. The outward sins in our position, our sinful deeds, have been fully dealt with by the death of Christ, but the sin in our disposition, our sinful nature, has not yet been dealt with. Starting with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78703" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12</span>, Paul begins to concentrate upon the dispositional sin within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPfKQgyD1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> Furthermore, although we are in God and Christ at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78704" data-verses="Romans 5:11">Romans 5:11</span>, we have not had much experience of God and Christ living within us. Although we are in God, boast and <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> joy in God, and stand in the realm of grace, we have not fully experienced God and Christ dwelling within us. To be in Christ is a positional matter; to have Christ in us, especially living and dwelling in us, is a dispositional and experiential matter. We must be in Christ, and then Christ can be in us and live within us. We find both aspects of this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78705" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span>, which says, “Abide in me, and I in you.” “Abide in me” means to be in Christ; “I abide in you” means that Christ lives in us. Firstly, we are in Christ, then Christ lives in us. The dispositional matter of Christ living in us is covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78706" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12 through 8:30</span>, the section on sanctification and glorification. Both sanctification and glorification deal with our disposition and nature, not with our outward behavior. Paul treated our outward behavior in the preceding sections. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78707" data-verses="Romans 5:12">5:12—8:30</span> he is occupied with our nature, our self. If we are not clear about these distinctions, we will be unable to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78708" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12—8:30</span> adequately. </p>
<p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZgxvyY6Pm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> As we approach the section on sanctification, we must realize that the gift in Christ surpasses the heritage in Adam. Since we were all born of Adam and in Adam, we have inherited all that he is and has. What are the items of our inheritance in Adam? Two dreadful things—sin and death. Regardless of whether we are good or bad, as long as we were born of Adam’s race we have sin and death as our heritage. Praise God for the gift in Christ! The gift in Christ surpasses the heritage in Adam. There is no comparison. </p>

This passage is difficult to remember because everything in it transcends our understanding. By nature, we do not have the concept that is revealed in this passage of Scripture. If we did, we would easily be impressed with Paul’s thought. Have you ever thought that in the whole universe there are only two men? Nevertheless, in the eyes of God there are just two men—Adam and Christ. We ourselves are nobodies. We <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> are all included in either the first man or the second. Everything depends on where you are. If you are in Adam, you are a part of Adam.

Adam was created by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78712" data-verses="Genesis 1:27">Gen. 1:27</span>), and had nothing of the divine nature and life of God.

What does it mean to say that Christ is the second man and the last Adam? It means that Christ is the last man. After Him, there is no third man, for the second man is the last.

After God created Adam, He <span class="pg" data-page-id="115" id="115">[115]</span> placed him in front of the tree of life, indicating that Adam should partake of this tree. This would have enabled him to receive God’s life and to live with God. Adam failed. He forsook the tree of life that denoted God as life and turned to the tree of knowledge that signified Satan as the source of death. Thus, Adam’s transgression consisted in leaving the tree of life and pursuing the tree of knowledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78719" data-verses="Genesis 2:8-9">Gen. 2:8-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78720" data-verses="Genesis 2:17">17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78721" data-verses="Genesis 3:1-7">3:1-7</span>).

As we have already pointed out, this turn is a turn from sins to sin, from position to disposition, and from justification to sanctification, or we may say from salvation to life. After making such a turn, Paul begins to deal with our person instead of our behavior. In the first four and a half chapters of Romans Paul was concerned with man’s deeds, not with man himself, and the sinful acts of fallen man were covered comprehensively. We have been brought out of that fallen state into the realm of grace, where we may enjoy God. However, this was merely a change of state, realm, and position. As yet, there has been no change in man himself, in his nature or disposition. Although man’s deeds have been dealt with and his condition changed, man himself has not yet been touched. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVsrrh-Qwxl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> Beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78794" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12</span>, Paul deals with man himself. We must go beyond man’s condition, situation, environment, and estate, for all these things have been completely settled in the foregoing chapters. These problems have been solved, and man has been cleansed, forgiven, justified, and reconciled. The problem now in view is man himself. In no other portion of the Divine Word is man exposed as thoroughly as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78795" data-verses="Romans 5:1-8">Romans 5 through 8</span>. In these four chapters man is acutely diagnosed by Paul. Paul seems to use every available spiritual instrument to diagnose the sickness of man. </p>
<p data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2GHh-lJY_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk"> What kind of man is exposed in this section of Romans? He is a man with sin in him, a man under the reign of death and, therefore, a man under God’s righteous judgment and condemnation. Man has been poisoned with the evil nature of Satan, stung by the poison of sin. Man himself <span class="pg" data-page-id="128" id="128">[128]</span> is absolutely sinful, not only in his dreadful deeds, but also in his disposition and nature. As far as man’s being is concerned, man is thoroughly sinful. Sin is in man’s fallen body, and man is under the reign of death, judged and condemned by God. This is the diagnosis given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78796" data-verses="Romans 5:1-8">Romans 5 through 8</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0ScutBStaYsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx"> Before I continue with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78797" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span>, I want to review the material we covered in the last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78798" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Chapter 5</span>—the two men, two acts and two results with the four reigning things. Although these matters were covered succinctly in message ten, it will perhaps benefit the reader if we approach them from another perspective. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Hn4Q6aZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4"> I want now to make a clear and definite contrast between all that belongs to Adam and all that belongs to Christ. In order to do this we may use the terminology of debit and credit found in accounting. In accounting we have a debit column and a credit column. Based upon these columns, we may reckon or make an account. I am not the first to use the word account in regard to spiritual things, for the Apostle Paul, who was a good, heavenly accountant, used this term himself. Several times in the book of Romans Paul employs the word “reckon” which also means “put to account.” First, God reckoned Abraham’s faith as righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78799" data-verses="Romans 4:3">4:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78800" data-verses="Romans 4:9">9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78801" data-verses="Romans 4:22">22</span>). When Abraham reacted to God by believing in Him, God, as the heavenly chief accountant, looked at the figures and seemed to say, “This faith of Abraham’s should be accounted as righteousness. I credit Abraham with righteousness.” Thus, God put righteousness in the credit column of Abraham’s account. Furthermore, Paul says that sin is not reckoned where there is no law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78802" data-verses="Romans 5:13">5:13</span>). A better translation of this word is that sin is not put to account without law. To say that sin is not reckoned actually means that sin is not put to account. Without law sin existed, but was not entered into God’s accounting book. When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78803" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span>, we must use our spiritual mathematics to do some accounting work (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78804" data-verses="Romans 6:11">v. 11</span>). Since we have been crucified with Christ and resurrected with Him, we must make an entry of this fact <span class="pg" data-page-id="129" id="129">[129]</span> into our accounting book, that is, we must reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbN_Sen-fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> Let us proceed to draw two columns, a debit column and a credit column, for Adam and Christ. The first item on the debit side of the ledger is Adam himself. Adam constitutes a great debit for us all. Under Adam, the second item is transgression, or, to use synonymous terms, offense or disobedience. As used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78805" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span>, the words transgression, offense, and disobedience all refer to the same thing. They are used interchangeably to designate the fall of Adam. This fall caused a tremendous debit, which, when put in monetary terms, is an amount that runs into the billions. The third item in the debit column is sin, which came in through Adam’s transgression. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78806" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span>, judgment, the fourth debit item, follows the entrance of sin. God is a sober God. He is not only righteous, but also sober, always on the alert. God never sleeps. Immediately after Adam transgressed, God intervened and exercised judgment. Thus, judgment always follows sin. Do not think that you must wait until your death to be judged, for we all were judged in Adam six thousand years ago. We were judged before we were born. Thus, judgment is the fourth item in the debit column. The fifth item is condemnation. God’s condemnation follows His judgment. Therefore, Adam, with everyone included in him, is under God’s condemnation. Since we came out of Adam, we were there when Adam was condemned. </p>
<p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PdXgUTujprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> What is the total of the debit column? The total is death. We may list death as item number six, although actually it is the total of the first five items. The sum total of Adam, transgression, sin, judgment, and condemnation is death. This is the total of the universal debit column in the accounting record of the human race. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ANzUA-iUjeJrXG0OumJElKccqeqVJQuX5wL_kKU5dq3C7vF1_YQpuJ09rnAq0MJO"> Hallelujah for the credit column! In the universal account we also have a credit column. The first item in this column is Christ who is versus Adam. Although Christ is versus Adam, there is no comparison between them. Paul says, “Not as the offense, so also is the free gift” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78807" data-verses="Romans 5:15">5:15</span>). Adam is not as <span class="pg" data-page-id="130" id="130">[130]</span> Christ, for Adam cannot compare with Christ. Christ far surpasses Adam. When Christ’s record is placed on the credit column, it is followed by billions of zeros. I am so glad that all of this is now our credit. I do not care about Adam’s debit. I have Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="RRUrZa0dvyz7r8k3lCU1d1IaPLT7GZHs7O9Lgyqlqhw7CeO8ACPd1Y2-5rrPSFRGa"> Under Christ we have the second item in the credit column, obedience. Christ’s obedience to the death of the cross is called His righteous act. The two terms obedience and righteous act are synonymous. The act of Adam is called transgression, offense, and disobedience; the act of Christ is called obedience or a righteous act. What is the worth of Christ’s obedience? There is no computer in existence that can calculate it. </p>
<p data-content-id="sTrENaXmH-QUV41dS8DY5-RYyafIOwXHPvMDWR4kxnQD3MSPXqGO1AtiIimI5PGDO"> As Christ’s obedience and righteousness are versus Adam’s disobedience and transgression, so also grace is versus sin. Hence, grace is the third item on the credit column. Which is more prevailing, sin or grace? Paul tells us clearly that there is no comparison, for “where sin abounded grace has more abounded” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78808" data-verses="Romans 5:20">5:20</span>). To what degree does grace exceed sin? I do not know, and even Paul himself simply said that it was “much more.” Do not worry about the debit of sin, because the credit of grace is much more (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78809" data-verses="Romans 5:17">5:17</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q99Av6RhIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78865" data-verses="Romans 5:12-21">Romans 5:12-21</span> we saw that the gift in Christ surpasses the heritage in Adam. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78866" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> revealed our identification with Christ. In order to have a genuine experience of our identification with Christ, we must pay attention to two negative items found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78867" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>—the law and the flesh. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78868" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> exposes the bondage of the law in our flesh. Although we have been identified with Christ through baptism, and although we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death and are now growing together with Him in the likeness of His resurrection, the law and the flesh continue to exist. We may present ourselves as slaves and our members as weapons of righteousness to God that we may be sanctified and enjoy the riches of the divine life, yet the law of God outside of us and our flesh within us still exist. </p>
<p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_3jC6d_N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> Why does Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78869" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter 7</span> speak in such detail about the law and the flesh? Because <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78870" data-verses="Romans 6:14">Romans 6:14</span> says, “you are not under law but under grace.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78871" data-verses="Romans 5:1-2">Romans 5 and 6</span> Paul explained clearly that we are now under grace, not under law. However, he has not yet explained how it can be that we are not under law. Because in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78872" data-verses="Romans 6:14">6:14</span> Paul said, “you are not under law,” he must write another chapter to explain how we are not under law. Without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78873" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> we could never be clear about this matter. Although the law continues to exist, we are not under it; we have nothing to do with it any longer. Has God recalled the law? Has He annulled or abolished it? The answer to these questions is no. How then can we say that we are not under the law? How can we be outside of the law and discharged from it? How can we be freed from <span class="pg" data-page-id="140" id="140">[140]</span> the law? The answer to these questions is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78874" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>, especially in the first six verses. This portion of the Word gives us a full definition and explanation of why we are no longer under the law. If we understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78875" data-verses="Romans 7:1-6">Romans 7:1-6</span>, we will know how we have been discharged from the law. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78877" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> we have two men, two acts, and two results with the four reigning things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78878" data-verses="Romans 7:1-6">Romans 7:1-6</span> we have two husbands, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78879" data-verses="Romans 7:7-25">7:7-25</span> we have three laws. What are the two husbands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78880" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>? </p>
<p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvZk7gif0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> As a young Christian I was eager to know the Bible. I found it especially difficult to learn who was the first husband in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78881" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. I tried to accumulate the best expositions of the Scriptures. However, I still could not determine who was the first husband in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78882" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. Was he the law or the flesh? I inquired of those who were knowledgeable in the Scriptures, but none of them were clear about this. Some said that the first husband was the law, while others said that he was the flesh. I read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78883" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> again and again, trying my best to understand it. I continued to study this matter for years. Twenty-two years ago I conducted a thorough study of the book of Romans, but even at that time I was not absolutely certain about the first husband. Now, after many years of study and experience, this matter is clear. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtf7Mj6GFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> Who is the first husband in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78884" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>? We must approach this question with the entire Bible in view, for we should understand one verse of the Bible according to the Bible as a whole. Let us now adopt such a view regarding the first husband in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78885" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. </p>

Thus, according to God’s creation, man had the position of a <span class="pg" data-page-id="141" id="141">[141]</span> wife. As a wife to God, we must depend upon Him and take Him as our head. This was our original position. </p>

The fallen man assumed the position of a husband. The man created by God was a wife; the fallen man became a husband. Assuming the position of the husband, the fallen man became independent of God and made himself the head as the husband. Before you were saved, you never considered yourself as a wife. If you were a female, you might have thought of yourself as stronger than a man. Among fallen people both males and females think of themselves as husbands. Many wives have said, “Why must I be under my husband? He should be under me. Why should he be the head? I want to be the head.” Hence, fallen man became a strong, ugly husband. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_jOzBh1sEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb">C. The Law of the Old Man</h2><p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYp0R_QEKtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> Since fallen man wanted to be the husband, God gave him the law. The law is not intended for the wife, but for the fallen husband. Thus, this law becomes the law of the old man, the law of the husband (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78887" data-verses="Romans 7:2">7:2</span>). However, God did not intend that the old man keep the law, because the old man cannot keep it. The law was given that the old man might be exposed. People make a great mistake when they think that God gave man the law that he might keep it. On the contrary, God gave the law to man that he might break it and that, by breaking it, he might be completely exposed. If you try to keep the law, you are wrong; if you break the law, you are correct. The law was not given for man to keep; it was given for man to break. </p>
<p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8UYisifvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> This thought is scriptural. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78888" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Romans 3:20</span> says, “by law is knowledge of sin.” The law gives us the knowledge of sin. If man had no law, he would continue to commit sins, but would not recognize them as such. Man would excuse his sinful deeds, using favorable terms to describe them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="142" id="142">[142]</span> However, the law identifies sin as sin. Moreover, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78889" data-verses="Romans 4:15">Romans 4:15</span> says, “where no law is, neither is there transgression.” You may think that the law prevents transgression, but this verse says that the law exposes transgression. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78890" data-verses="Romans 5:20">Romans 5:20</span> says, “But the law entered that the offense might abound.” The law did not enter that the offense might be reduced or restricted. This is our natural concept and thought. Paul says that the law entered that the offense might abound, meaning that it might increase plentifully. Thus, the Bible indicates that the law was not given for us to keep, but for us to violate. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_346z89XgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> You may say, “I will not try to break the law.” Whether you want to break the law or not means nothing, for you will break the law. You cannot help but break the law. The law says, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Although you may try to love your neighbor, you cannot do it. Even the children in school cannot love their classmates as themselves. Everyone reading this message has broken and continues to break at least one of the ten commandments. Who can keep the law? No one. The law entered that the offense might abound. </p>
<p data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJgzjKk-90stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78891" data-verses="Romans 7:7">Romans 7:7</span>, we would not have known sin except through the law. In this verse Paul says that he would not have known coveting except the law had said, “You shall not covet.” As a summary we may say that the law works that the offense might abound. Once the offense abounds, the law exposes it as sin. In this way the law leads us to the knowledge of sin. </p>

THREE LAWS</h2><p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYp0Q_QZGtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> In the previous message we saw the two husbands revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78947" data-verses="Romans 7:1-6">Romans 7:1-6</span>. In this message we shall consider the three laws revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78948" data-verses="Romans 7:7-25">7:7-25</span>. I would like to read each verse and, when necessary, make some comments on it. </p>
<p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8UZis7SvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> “What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! But I had not known sin except through the law; for I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78949" data-verses="Romans 7:7">v. 7</span>). This verse makes it quite clear that the law gives us the knowledge of sin, for the law exposes sin and identifies it as sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_347z8YVgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> “But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, wrought in me coveting of every kind. For without law sin is dead” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78950" data-verses="Romans 7:8">v. 8</span>). Sin utilizes the law, and the law helps sin to work in us. Hence, the law was not given to help us, but to assist sin. Without law, or apart from the law, sin is dead. </p>
<p data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJgziKkf-0stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q"> “For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78951" data-verses="Romans 7:9">v. 9</span>). Surely the law does not help us; it helps sin. The law came to revive sin, to make sin alive. Before the law came, sin was dormant. However, when the law appeared, sin was quickened and revived. </p>
<p data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCUFepPWNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi"> “And the commandment which was unto life, this was found to me to be unto death” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78952" data-verses="Romans 7:10">v. 10</span>). Although the law was supposed to be unto life, eventually, as far as we are concerned, it was death. </p>
<p data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_jNzn6Zet51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7"> “For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78953" data-verses="Romans 7:11">v. 11</span>). Sin is a killer <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> and the law is the killing instrument. The law is the knife used by sin to kill us. Without a knife or killing instrument it is difficult to kill people. Sin, using the law, firstly deceives us and then kills us. Since the acts of deceiving and killing are certainly the behavior of a person, we must consider sin as the personification of Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-zfcKLHkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc"> “So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78954" data-verses="Romans 7:12">v. 12</span>). There is no problem regarding the nature of the law. The nature, the essence, of the law is holy, just, and good. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK3hZmT8PzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> “Did then that which is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me through that which is good; that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78955" data-verses="Romans 7:13">v. 13</span>). This verse is additional proof that the law does not help us. Instead, the law makes sin exceedingly sinful. Are you still attracted by the law? We must stay away from it. </p>
<p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kXUg-WH5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> “For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78956" data-verses="Romans 7:14">v. 14</span>). The phrase “sold under sin” means sold to sin. Sin is the buyer, the buying master, and we have been sold to him. </p>
<p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3busmG-alY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> “For what I do, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78957" data-verses="Romans 7:15">v. 15</span>). The word acknowledge in this verse does not mean that we do not know. How can we say that we do not know what we do? Certainly we know. This verse means that Paul did not acknowledge what he did. It means that although we may act wrongly we do not acknowledge it or approve it. </p>
<p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRD_4B4TOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> “But if what I do not will, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good. So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78958" data-verses="Romans 7:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). Paul says that it is no longer he who does what he does not want to do, but sin that dwells within him. The word dwells is not the same Greek word that is elsewhere translated “abide”; it is a Greek word that actually means “make a home,” because the verb has the root meaning of home or house. Therefore, this verse does not mean that sin simply abides or remains within us for awhile, but that sin makes its home in us. Thus it is no <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> longer we who do the evil that we do not want to do, but sin that makes its home within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPfJQgTO1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> “For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to do the good is not” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78959" data-verses="Romans 7:18">v. 18</span>). Paul does not say that there is nothing good in him; he says that there is nothing good in his flesh. We must pay careful attention to the modifier used by Paul—“in my flesh.” Never say that there is nothing good in you, for there is good within you. However, in our flesh, that is, in our fallen body, nothing good dwells. In our fallen body, which the Bible calls “flesh,” sin dwells with all its lusts. Thus, nothing good is found in our flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxV9nxOgl3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> “For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78960" data-verses="Romans 7:19">v. 19</span>). This verse proves that there is good within us, for we do have a good will, a will to do the good. However, we are unable to practice the good that we will to do. </p>
<p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkT-Jfx4l-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> “But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me. I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78961" data-verses="Romans 7:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78962" data-verses="Romans 7:21">Verse 21</span> mentions the law that operates whenever we will to do good. This law is evil, for whenever we attempt to do good, the evil is present with us. The Greek word translated “the evil” in this verse denotes that which is evil in character. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVt_OlXtbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> “For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive in the law of sin which is in my members” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78963" data-verses="Romans 7:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78964" data-verses="Romans 7:22">Verse 22</span> mentions the law of God in which Paul delights according to the inner man. We may label this as law number one. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78965" data-verses="Romans 7:23">verse 23</span> Paul refers to the law of the mind, which we may label law number two. Since this law is the law of the mind and the mind is a part of our soul, it means that there is a law in our soul. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78966" data-verses="Romans 7:23">Verse 23</span> also mentions what Paul calls “a different law in my members.” Since this law is in our members and our members are a part of our flesh, our fallen body, it means that in our flesh is another law. This law, law <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> number three, wars against the law of our minds. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78967" data-verses="Romans 7:23">7:23</span> we find two laws fighting against one another, warring against one another. Paul says that this “different law” in our members makes us captive to the law of sin. This “law of sin which is in my members” is equivalent to the “different law in my members” mentioned earlier in the verse. This law is the third law. Thus, in this one verse we find two laws: one is a good law in our mind, and the other is an evil law in our members. </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeRZx024jT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78968" data-verses="Romans 7:24">v. 24</span>). Why is our body termed the body of this death? Because in our body is the evil law that wars against the good law in our soul. This evil law makes our body a “body of this death.” What is “this death”? It is the death of being defeated, the death of being made captive and carried away by the law of sin in our body. </p>
<p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomCcxmlk65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> “Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve as a slave the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78969" data-verses="Romans 7:25">v. 25</span>). This verse gives the answer to the question raised in the preceding verse. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78970" data-verses="Romans 7:25">verse 25</span>, deliverance from the body of death is through Jesus Christ our Lord. In this verse Paul tells us that with his mind by himself, not in his spirit by the Lord Jesus, he served the law of God as a slave. He also says that with his flesh he served the law of sin. </p>

<p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmgo0QszAO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> We need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79083" data-verses="Romans 8:1-6">Romans 8:1-6</span> carefully and attentively. “There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79084" data-verses="Romans 8:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>). The phrase “the law of the Spirit of life” is very significant. In this phrase we see three elements that compose one entity—the law, the Spirit, and the life. These three items are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJJOMh_bV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM"> “For what is impossible to the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79085" data-verses="Romans 8:3">v. 3</span>). God is the subject of this sentence. He condemned sin in the flesh of Christ by “sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin.” </p>

The Spirit of Life</h2><p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HbYfrgar0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> Before we deal with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79091" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> itself, we need to consider a glorious and marvelous term found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79092" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span>—“the Spirit of life.” This term is used only once in the entire Bible. In the book of Romans the term “the Spirit of life” is not revealed until <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79093" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span>. However, before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79094" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> we do have several references to the divine, eternal, uncreated life. The first occurrence of this word life in the book of Romans is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79095" data-verses="Romans 1:17">1:17</span> which says that the just shall have life and live by faith. The word life in this verse denotes the divine life. The second occurrence of this word in Romans is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79096" data-verses="Romans 2:7">2:7</span>, where we are told that “those who by endurance in good work seek for glory and honor and incorruptibility, life eternal.” If we continually seek God, He will give us life eternal. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79097" data-verses="Romans 5:10">Romans 5:10</span> says that we shall be saved in His life, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79098" data-verses="Romans 5:17">5:17</span> tells us that, after receiving the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness, we shall reign in life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79099" data-verses="Romans 5:18">Romans 5:18</span> mentions justification of life, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79100" data-verses="Romans 5:21">5:21</span> says that grace might reign unto eternal life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79101" data-verses="Romans 6:4">6:4</span> we are told to walk in newness of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79102" data-verses="Romans 6:22-23">Romans 6:22-23</span> says that eternal life is the end of sanctification and that the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Thus, in the first six chapters of Romans there are many references to the divine life. Life is <span class="pg" data-page-id="169" id="169">[169]</span> the goal of God’s salvation. God has redeemed us, justified us, and reconciled us that we might share this life. Once we receive it, we should be saved in life, reign in life, walk in newness of life, and be sanctified in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKStomoiB0TVgGaB81DivoARJCkQefxo1786oQtaQs3phAEmsIsEHfDkTPzIJOxrQ"> Although the foregoing chapters in Romans say that we should be saved, reign, walk, and be sanctified in life, Paul has not yet told us how we can do all these things. How can we be saved in life and reign in life? How can we walk in newness of life? How can we experience the sanctification in life? Paul has not told us. Neither has he told us precisely how the just shall have life. Although he says that this life is out of faith, he has not explained the matter clearly. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79103" data-verses="Romans 1:1-6">Romans 1 through 6</span> Paul refers to life nine times. Now, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79104" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span>, he suddenly joins life with the Spirit in the phrase “the Spirit of life.” </p>
<p data-content-id="D5w8-kFdQxmkmF1GzR6A7rrTqKPPWrkUq03mqLc30FIAV31DN5B-3O4zuykkIOmJX"> The way to have life is the Spirit. The way to be saved in His life is the Spirit. The way to reign in life is the Spirit. The way to walk in newness of life is the Spirit. The way to be sanctified in life is the Spirit. The Spirit is the way. Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. These two are actually one. We can never separate life from the Spirit, nor the Spirit from life. The Lord Jesus Himself said, “The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79105" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>). In this word the Lord Jesus connects the Spirit and life. If we have the Spirit, we have life; if we do not have the Spirit, we do not have life. If we walk in the Spirit, we walk in life, but if we do not walk in the Spirit, we do not walk in the newness of life. Thus, the way to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is the Spirit. By this we may see the relationship between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79106" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> and the previous chapters. The seven foregoing chapters lead us to life and consummate in life. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79107" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span> we are at the point of life. We must give special attention to the word life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79108" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6W6pcH7evTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P">B. The Fourfold Life</h2><p data-content-id="gTWF_O-VusFLsBnICnGcC1lD1HlcJrTjqrrJfkDlEYM2QChTjzMfb7iFBzHc2B8W3"> The word life is used four times in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79109" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79110" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> mentions the law of the Spirit of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79111" data-verses="Romans 8:6">Romans 8:6</span> says that the mind set on the spirit is life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79112" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Romans 8:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79113" data-verses="Romans 8:10">10</span> we <span class="pg" data-page-id="170" id="170">[170]</span> are told that if Christ is in us our spirit is life because of righteousness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79114" data-verses="Romans 8:11">Romans 8:11</span> says the indwelling Spirit will give life to our mortal bodies. The first time life is mentioned in this chapter it is connected to the Holy Spirit, the second time it is related to our mind, the third time it is associated with our spirit, and the fourth time it is a matter of our body. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79115" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> unveils a fourfold life. Firstly, life is the Spirit. Then the Spirit comes into our spirit to make our spirit life. Then the Spirit spreads from our spirit into our mind to make our mind life. The Spirit even imparts this life into our mortal bodies to make the body of sin a body of life. We have a fourfold life. The focus of it all is the Holy Spirit indwelling our spirit. This life will spread from our spirit into our mind and throughout our whole soul, even reaching all the members of our body. Eventually, our whole being will be filled with life and we will be a man of life. Have you ever seen this? We may call this the fourfold life. The Spirit is life, our spirit is life, our mind is life, and even our body is of life. Thus, the connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79116" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> and all the foregoing chapters is life plus the Spirit. </p>

<p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PdTgU2kjprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79172" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> Paul cried out, “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79173" data-verses="Romans 7:24">v. 24</span>). Paul opened <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79174" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> by saying, “There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79175" data-verses="Romans 8:1">v. 1</span>). In the book of Romans there are two kinds of condemnation: the outward, objective condemnation and the inward, subjective condemnation. The outward condemnation comes from God, and the inward condemnation comes from ourselves. We see the objective condemnation of God in the early chapters of Romans, for example in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79176" data-verses="Romans 3:19">3:19</span> which says “that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become subject to the judgment of God.” Hence, objective condemnation results from being under the righteous judgment of God. This type of condemnation is completely solved by the redeeming blood of Christ. Christ’s redeeming blood has saved us from the judgment of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> </p>

The Condemnation outside of Christ</h2><p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxV9hxOgt3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> The inward, subjective condemnation is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79177" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span>. When Paul lamented, “Wretched man that I am,” he was not experiencing the condemnation of God, but the condemnation that came from himself, the self-condemnation of one who tries to keep the law. This condemnation comes from the person himself, not from God. The more you attempt to be good and fulfill the law, the more inward condemnation you will have. If you are a careless person, never trying to be good, you will not experience inward condemnation. However, if you say, “I must be right and perfect,” you will be condemned by yourself. The more you try to improve yourself, the more self-condemnation you will be under. The condemnation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79178" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> is that of a person outside of Christ, although it is experienced by many Christians who attempt to fulfill the law after they are saved. This condemnation does not come from God. God would say, “Stupid child, I don’t want you to have this kind of condemnation. You have caused this trouble for yourself.” Many Christians, having solved the problem of objective condemnation, have created for themselves the problem of inward condemnation. Some have been so condemned that they could not eat or sleep properly. I even know of some people who developed mental problems due to subjective condemnation. Some brothers condemned themselves severely for not loving their wives, and certain sisters judged themselves for not being kind to their husbands. Eventually, the sense of subjective condemnation became so extreme they developed mental problems. Such people are under a tremendous weight of self-condemnation. </p>

Without Christ, or outside of Christ, he struggled according to the law in his mind to keep the law of God in order that he might <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> please God, but he was totally defeated by the law of sin. That occurred when he was without Christ. Thus Paul condemned himself. He had a deep conviction of this inward, subjective condemnation. But “now” “in Christ Jesus” there is no longer this kind of condemnation. Paul had “no condemnation” because in Christ he did not need to keep the law of God by himself, an effort which produced self-condemnation; “no condemnation” because in Christ he had the law of the Spirit of life which is more powerful than the law of sin and which set him free from the law of sin; “no condemnation” now, not because of the redeeming blood of Christ which removed the objective condemnation of God, but because of the law of the Spirit of life which brought in the freedom of the Spirit in his spirit and which broke through all his subjective condemnation; and “no condemnation” because he was freed from both the law of God and the law of sin. </p>

The Freedom of the Law of the Spirit of Life</h2><p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomCaxmpi65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79181" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> Paul does not say, “There is no condemnation in Christ Jesus because the blood of Jesus has cleansed me.” This kind of condemnation is not dealt with by the blood. We are freed from subjective condemnation, not because of the blood which cleanses us, but because of the law which liberates us. There is a law which sets us free from inward condemnation. This law that releases us has the greatest potential of any law. Although we have the law of God outside of us demanding, the law of good in our mind agreeing with the law of God, and the law of sin in our body warring against and defeating the law of good, we must nevertheless praise the Lord that in our spirit is the law of the Spirit of life. No law can prevail against this law. Who can defeat the Spirit of life? Nobody and nothing can defeat the Spirit of life. This law of the Spirit of life is the spontaneous power of the Spirit of life. It is the most powerful law in the universe; it is in us and it sets us free. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVsrvh-B_xl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> How does the law of the Spirit of life set us free? It frees us in a “super” way. If, according to the ancient method of warfare, some soldiers were surrounded by enemy troops, <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> they would have had to fight their way through. However, in modern warfare there is no such need. If we are surrounded by the enemy, we need not fight through—we have a way up. We have an upward way. Thus, we may say to Satan, “Satan, compared to me you are powerful. But don’t you know that I have a wonderful God who is both in my spirit and in the heavens? It may be difficult for me to go to the heavens, but it is easy for Him. He is both in me and in the heavens. Satan, I don’t need to fight through. I just say, ‘Praise the Lord,’ and I am in the third heaven. Satan, you and your attacking army are under my feet, and I am free.” </p>
<p data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2GHl-lUU_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk"> In case you think this is little more than a good theory, let me apply it and make it very practical. Suppose we have a sister who wants to submit to her husband according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79182" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>. She says, “I love this word. It is so sweet and holy. I want to submit myself to my husband.” This is simply the exercise of her mind as it attempts to fulfill the commandment given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79183" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>. However, when she determines to practice this, something strange happens. It seems that her surroundings change and the very opposite of submission occurs. Her husband, who is always nice and gentle with her, on the very morning that she determines to submit to him, is quite mean. Much to her disappointment, she fails to fulfill the commandment. Satan comes up against her, surrounds her, and attacks her. The more she tries to suppress her irritation with her husband’s behavior, the more angry she becomes, until she finally loses control of her temper. Her struggle, her attempt, was vain. The sister was defeated because she used the wrong strategy. Whenever we are surrounded by the enemy, we should forget about every attempt of fighting through and say, “Praise the Lord! Amen!” Immediately we will be transcendent. Every enemy, including the people who aggravate us, will be under our feet. If you do not believe this, I ask you to try it. This strategy works; it is the most “modern,” most prevailing weapon against the enemy. Instead of condemnation there is praise. Why is there praise and release instead of condemnation? <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> Because the law of the Spirit of life frees us from the law of sin and death. </p>

THE INDWELLING OF CHRIST THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCUAepScNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi"> Although in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79222" data-verses="Romans 8:1-6">Romans 8:1-6</span> we clearly see the freedom of the law of the Spirit of life, it is difficult to see the central point of the next seven verses. However, if we enter deep into the thought of this portion, we will see that in it Paul is trying to tell us that something other than sin has its lodging within us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79223" data-verses="Romans 7:20">7:20</span> Paul said, “But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.” Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79224" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> exposes the indwelling sin. As we have seen, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79225" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> is a sharp contrast to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79226" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79227" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> has bondage; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79228" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> has freedom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79229" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> has the law; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79230" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> has the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79231" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> has our flesh; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79232" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> has our spirit. Moreover, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79233" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> has the indwelling sin. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79234" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> what indwells us? It is Christ, the indwelling Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79235" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> we have the indwelling sin as the main factor of all wretchedness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79236" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> we have the indwelling Christ as the factor of all blessedness. </p>
<p data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_jIznjSet51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7"> If Christ were not the Spirit, He could never indwell us. He must be the Spirit in order to indwell us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79237" data-verses="Romans 8:9-10">verses 9 and 10</span> we find three synonymous terms used interchangeably: “the Spirit of God,” “the Spirit of Christ,” and “Christ.” Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79238" data-verses="Romans 8:11">verse 11</span> refers to the indwelling Spirit. These synonyms indicate and prove that Christ is the indwelling Spirit. Undoubtedly “the Spirit of God” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79239" data-verses="Romans 8:9">verse 9</span> is “the Spirit of life” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79240" data-verses="Romans 8:2">verse 2</span>. After Paul mentions “the Spirit of God,” he speaks about the “Spirit of Christ” and “Christ” Himself. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79241" data-verses="Romans 8:11">verse 11</span> he refers to the indwelling Spirit. This means that the “Spirit of God” is the “Spirit of Christ” <span class="pg" data-page-id="192" id="192">[192]</span> and the “Spirit of Christ” is “Christ” Himself. Hence, Christ in us is the indwelling Spirit. He is “the Spirit of life,” He is “the Spirit of God,” and He is also “the Spirit of Christ” indwelling us that He may impart Himself as life to us. Christ not only imparts life to our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79242" data-verses="Romans 8:10">v. 10</span>), but also to our minds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79243" data-verses="Romans 8:6">v. 6</span>) and to our mortal bodies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79244" data-verses="Romans 8:11">v. 11</span>). Therefore, Christ is now life in the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79245" data-verses="Romans 8:2">v. 2</span>), life in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79246" data-verses="Romans 8:10">v. 10</span>), life in our mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79247" data-verses="Romans 8:6">v. 6</span>), and life in our mortal body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79248" data-verses="Romans 8:11">v. 11</span>). Christ is life with fourfold riches. </p>
<p data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-zacKuPkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc"> Although the book of Romans has been in my hands for years, only recently have I seen that Christ is the fourfold life. Christ is life to us with fourfold, intensified riches. He is not only life in the Divine Spirit and in our human spirit; He is even life in our minds. Furthermore, Christ can be life to our mortal bodies. In other words, He is now the life in God as well as the life in God’s people. This is the main point of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79249" data-verses="Romans 8:7-13">8:7-13</span>. The central point is that Christ as the indwelling Spirit is life to us with fourfold riches. He is so rich. He sustains our spirit, supplies our minds, and even enlivens our mortal bodies. This life, which is Christ Himself, is the life that we enjoy today. May the Lord fully unveil this to us, not merely in a doctrinal way, but in the way of experience. We all must see that our Christ is the indwelling Spirit as life with fourfold riches. </p>

If our mind is set on our flesh, it also becomes hopeless. Anything that is one with the flesh is hopeless. Do not think that you can sanctify your flesh. This is impossible. Flesh is flesh, and flesh is absolutely hopeless. Never place any hope in your flesh. It can never be improved. God has made the definite decision that the flesh must be terminated because it is utterly corrupt. God judged Noah’s generation with the flood because that generation had become flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79251" data-verses="Genesis 6:3">Gen. 6:3</span>). When that generation became <span class="pg" data-page-id="193" id="193">[193]</span> flesh, God considered it hopeless. God found it impossible to rescue it, recover it, or improve it. God seemed to say, “Let that generation go. I must place it completely under My judgment.” The judgment of the flood was a judgment upon the flesh. Only when man had become flesh did God exercise judgment over man as the flesh. Therefore, never say that your flesh can be improved. Never think that your flesh today is better than before you were saved. Whether a person is saved or not, the flesh remains flesh. The flesh is hopeless, and everything related to it also is hopeless. </p>
<p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmgo2QsqLO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> Paul said that “the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God.” The flesh is enmity against God, and the mind set upon it is also enmity against God. The mind set on the flesh is not subject to the law of God. It is impossible for such a mind to be subject to God’s law, even if it would want to be. Thus, the verdict on the flesh is final. The flesh is over, and everything related to the flesh is over. </p>
<p data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJJMMhaTV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM"> Paul continues this thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79252" data-verses="Romans 8:8">verse 8</span> which says, “And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” As long as we are in the flesh, we cannot please God. Never say that your flesh is good. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79253" data-verses="Romans 8:7-8">verses 7 and 8</span> we see four points: that the flesh is enmity against God, that it is not subject to the law of God, that it cannot be subject to the law of God, and that the flesh cannot please God. This is the condition of the flesh. </p>

But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79254" data-verses="Romans 8:9">v. 9</span>). Many verses in the epistles begin with the wonderful word “but.” Hallelujah for “but”! In our history we need many “buts” such as this. We should be able to say, “Oh, I was down this morning, ‘but.’ I am so weak in myself, ‘but.’ I am absolutely hopeless, ‘but.’” Paul says, “But you are not in the flesh....” Never say that you have a good flesh and that you are in your good flesh. We should not remain in our flesh, for our flesh has been condemned. If a house has been condemned by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="194" id="194">[194]</span> government, it is illegal for you to stay there. Likewise, the flesh has been thoroughly condemned by God, and we should not remain there, arguing that our flesh has improved. We should not be in the flesh, but in the spirit. This spirit denotes the human spirit mingled with the Divine Spirit. </p>

The Indwelling of the Spirit of God</h2><p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVepsyLa4ZQ8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> There is a condition for us to be in the spirit. The condition is that the Spirit of God dwell in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79255" data-verses="Romans 8:9">v. 9</span>). The word “dwells” really means “makes home.” We are in the spirit if the Spirit of God dwells, makes His home, in us. Although you are saved, perhaps the Spirit of God does not yet make His home in you. This explains why you are still not in the spirit. Although the Spirit of God is in you, He has been unable to make His home in you. He does not dwell in you. I may be invited to your home, but I am unable to make my home in your home. I am there as a guest, unable to settle myself there. Likewise, the Spirit of God is in us, yet He may be unable to dwell in us. He is the guest, not the dweller. If the Spirit of God can make His home in us, settling Himself in us with adequate room, then we will be in spirit and not in the flesh. However, if the Spirit of God does not have this room in which to lodge, we will remain in the flesh, not in the spirit. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkT-Nfxpm-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4">GOD’S RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br/>HOLINESS, AND GLORY</h2><p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVt7OlGnbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> Paul was an excellent writer and his thought was very deep. In the book of Romans Paul firstly covers the subject of condemnation and then proceeds to cover justification, sanctification, and glorification. As God deals with us, He always cares for three of His divine attributes—His righteousness, holiness, and glory. God is righteous, God is holy, and God is a God of glory. Righteousness is related to God’s acts, to His ways, actions, and activities. Everything God does is righteous. Holiness is God’s nature. Holiness is not a matter of action, but of nature. As the nature of a table is wood and the nature of a book is paper, so the nature of God is holiness. God’s acts are righteous and His nature is holiness. What is glory? Glory is God Himself expressed. When God is expressed, that is glory. Therefore, in righteousness we see God’s ways, in holiness we see God’s nature, and in glory we see God expressed. Three of the sections in Romans—justification, sanctification, and glorification—were composed according to these three attributes of God: justification according to God’s righteousness, sanctification according to God’s holiness, and glorification according to God’s glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeRdx0jzjT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> In the first stage of God’s salvation we participate in the righteousness of God. This is justification in which we gain God’s righteousness. In the second stage we are in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> process of sanctification, a process in which God works His divine nature into us. God’s righteousness is reckoned to us in justification, but it is not wrought into us. However, in God’s sanctification His holiness is wrought into our being. Although we have obtained and participated in God’s righteousness outwardly, God’s holiness needs to be wrought into us inwardly. The second stage of God’s salvation is that He works His holy nature into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomCYxmMs65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> In order to accomplish this God has been processed into the available Spirit of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79278" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span>). Before being processed He was not available to perform this subjective work of sanctification. Before He was processed He was able to create the world, but He was unable to enter into His creature. Although He could do many things outside of us, He could not come into us until He had passed through the complete process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Since being processed, He has become and still is the available Spirit of life. Now, like the air for breathing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79279" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>), it is so easy for Him to enter into us. As the available Spirit of life, God has come into our spirit, making it life. Since Christ, the life-giving Spirit, is in us, our spirit is life because of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79280" data-verses="Romans 8:10">8:10</span>). The Lord has made our spirit life by regeneration. Now, as the Spirit of life in our spirit, He is spreading Himself from our spirit into our soul—into our mind, emotion, and will. Eventually, He will even expand into our mortal body. In such a way God saturates us with Himself. This saturation is called sanctification. Through this saturation God works Himself with His holy nature into our entire being, into our spirit, soul, and body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79281" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thes. 5:23</span>). Thus, our whole being will be fully permeated, sanctified, with His holy nature. We are presently undergoing this process of sanctification, the second stage of God’s salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVsrth-gwxl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> In the next stage we will be raptured and glorified. That will be the redemption of our body. Glorification means to transfigure our vile body into a glorious body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79282" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Phil. 3:21</span>). At that time we will be completely and absolutely brought into God Himself as our glory. Then we will be fully glorified. <span class="pg" data-page-id="205" id="205">[205]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Hh4QfQZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4"> The first stage of God’s salvation, justification, takes care of our spirit; the second stage, sanctification, mainly deals with our soul, with a slight amount of saturation in our body; and the third stage, glorification, concerns our physical body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79283" data-verses="Romans 8:10">Romans 8:10</span> Paul says that if Christ is in us, our spirit is life because of righteousness, meaning that in God’s justification we have gained righteousness. Through this righteousness our spirit has been made alive and actually becomes life. However, there is not yet the divine life in our soul. Therefore, we need to cooperate with the indwelling Christ by setting our mind upon the spirit, enabling the Spirit of life to saturate our mind with Himself. Then our mind will be life. If we continue to cooperate, this saturating and spreading One will spread Himself from our spirit even into our mortal body. Then we only need wait for the time when our body will be brought into His glory. That will be our glorification. </p>
<p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbN5SeG1fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> Now we can understand why Paul wrote Romans in the order that he did, with justification first, followed by sanctification and glorification. These three sections cover the three stages of complete salvation and correspond to the three parts of our being. In justification our spirit is made alive, in sanctification our soul is made life, and in glorification even our body will be full of life. When this process is completed, we will not only be justified and sanctified, but also glorified. Presently we are in the process of sanctification. Thus, I am burdened to give this message on sanctification in life. Although you may never have heard the term sanctification in life, it is nevertheless a fact. </p>
<p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocLhryKynWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> From the beginning of the book of Romans through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79284" data-verses="Romans 8:13">8:13</span> two main things are covered, justification and sanctification. In justification God gives us His righteousness, which is Christ Himself. God has made Christ righteousness to us. However, this is objective, for righteousness is Christ as our covering. Hence, righteousness is objective, like a roof that covers us. However, in the second stage, sanctification, God is working Christ into us to make Him our sanctification <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> subjectively. Our whole being will be permeated with the holy nature of God. This is sanctification in life. </p>

This life is mainly for sanctification. It is by this life that Christ permeates us, saturates us, and infuses the holy nature of God into us, making us holy dispositionally. In other books of the Bible we find mention of sanctification by the blood and are told that the blood of Christ has sanctified us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79285" data-verses="Hebrews 13:12">Heb. 13:12</span>). However, we do not find this aspect of sanctification in the book of Romans. In Romans we do not have objective sanctification by the blood, but subjective sanctification in life. Therefore, this message is concerned with sanctification in life. Thus, we need to read and consider several verses which mention this matter of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYC5m38nydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79286" data-verses="Romans 1:4">1:4</span> Paul speaks of Christ saying that He “was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.” The “Spirit of holiness” here is in contrast with the “flesh” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79287" data-verses="Romans 1:3">1:3</span>. As the flesh in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79288" data-verses="Romans 1:3">1:3</span> refers to the human essence of Christ, so the Spirit in this verse refers not to the Person of the Holy Spirit, but to the divine essence of Christ, which is “the fulness of the Godhead” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79289" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79290" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span>), is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy. Christ has two natures: the human and the divine. With each nature there is an essence. The essence of His human nature, His humanity, is flesh; the essence of His divinity is the Spirit of holiness. Thus, the Spirit of holiness here is the divine essence of Christ’s Person. This essence is holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52xmnYAca2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> The last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79291" data-verses="Romans 1:17">1:17</span> declares, “But the just shall live by faith.” “Shall live” may be translated as “shall have life and live.” For what purpose shall we have life? For the purpose mainly that we might be sanctified. Although we have been justified, we still need to have life that we might be <span class="pg" data-page-id="207" id="207">[207]</span> sanctified, that is, have God’s holy nature wrought into our being. This is sanctification. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q99Fv6AsIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79292" data-verses="Romans 5:10">5:10</span> Paul says that “we shall be saved in His life.” This saving in His life is not for justification; that has already been obtained by His death. Although we have received justification by Christ’s death, we need to be sanctified in His saving life. Hence, to be saved in life is not for justification, but mainly for sanctification. </p>

<p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwczoY0fqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> In this message we come to the matter of glorification. What is the goal of glorification? The goal of glorification is the full sonship of the children of God. Condemnation requires justification, justification is for sanctification, sanctification is for glorification, and glorification is for the full sonship of the children of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZg5vyFwPm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI">I. THE BLESSINGS OF SONSHIP</h2><p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYC2m3loydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79356" data-verses="Romans 8:14">8:14</span> the terms “children of God” and “sons of God” have not been used in the book of Romans. The concept of “children of God” is only brought in at this point, proving that Paul wrote the book of Romans with a deep purpose in view. Starting with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79357" data-verses="Romans 8:14">8:14</span> Paul begins to speak about the sons of God and the children of God. However, the ultimate concept of the section on glorification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79358" data-verses="Romans 8:14-39">8:14-39</span>) does not concern the children or the sons, but the heirs. We may be a child of God without the growth of a son of God, or a son of God without the qualification for an heir. Thus, Paul’s ultimate concept in this portion of Romans concerns the heirs of glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52xmoYA5W2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79359" data-verses="Romans 8:14">Romans 8:14</span> says, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” This verse is a continuation of the foregoing portion in which Paul tells us that we must walk according to spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79360" data-verses="Romans 8:4">v. 4</span>). In a sense, to walk according to spirit is to be under the leading of the Holy Spirit. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79361" data-verses="Romans 8:14">verse 14</span> continues Paul’s thought by saying that as many as are led by the Holy Spirit, or by the Spirit of God, are the sons of God. By means of this short sentence Paul turns the whole concept from that of the sanctified ones to that <span class="pg" data-page-id="216" id="216">[216]</span> of the sons of God. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79362" data-verses="Romans 8:13">verse 13</span> the thought was on the sanctified ones, the ones who were condemned, justified, reconciled, identified, and eventually sanctified. With <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79363" data-verses="Romans 8:14">verse 14</span> Paul introduces the concept of the sons of God. How are we sanctified? By walking according to spirit. In a sense, walking according to spirit means to be led by the Spirit of God, and “as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” In this way Paul turns us from sanctification to sonship. Now we have come to the matter of the sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q99Kv6hhIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI"> We need to approach the subject of sonship in the spirit, not in the letter. If we are in the letter, we will have difficulty. Why? Because according to the letter all the sisters are excluded. How can sisters be sons? Paul did not say, “As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons and daughters of God.” However, we all, brothers and sisters alike, are sons of God. We must read the Bible not merely in letter, but in spirit. Although we are males and females, brothers and sisters, in spirit we are all sons of God. In eternity there will be no daughters, only sons. </p>
<p data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvMsWAXkx73NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr"> One day the Sadducees came to the Lord Jesus, arguing with Him about resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79364" data-verses="Matthew 22:23-33">Matt. 22:23-33</span>). They thought that they were quite wise. They told Him about the case of a woman who, in succession, married seven brothers. After they all had died the woman also died. Then the Sadducees asked Him whose wife she would be in the resurrection since all seven had been married to her. The Lord said that they were wrong and knew neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. The Lord said further that in the resurrection we would neither marry nor be given in marriage, but would be as the angels of God. We shall be wonderful persons with no difference between male and female. We shall not only be justified and sanctified, but also glorified. We shall all be glorified persons, the eternal sons of God. If we walk according to spirit, there is no difference between male and female, for we are all sons of God. However, we must not forget that we are still in the flesh. In the flesh we have male and female, husband and wife. We must not apply something <span class="pg" data-page-id="217" id="217">[217]</span> that will be true in resurrection to the situation today. If we do that, we will have trouble. Nevertheless, we all, brothers and sisters alike, are sons of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaLzRwOjb3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4">A. The Spirit of Sonship</h2><p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qly2AhnSDZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> “For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.” How did we receive this spirit of sonship? By the Spirit of the Son of God coming into our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79365" data-verses="Galatians 4:6">Galatians 4:6</span>, a sister verse to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79366" data-verses="Romans 8:15">Romans 8:15</span>, says, “And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79367" data-verses="Romans 8:15">Romans 8:15</span> says that we “have received a spirit of sonship”; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79368" data-verses="Galatians 4:6">Galatians 4:6</span> says that “God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son” into us. Because the Spirit of the Son of God enters into our spirit our spirit becomes a spirit of sonship. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79369" data-verses="Romans 8:15">verse 15</span> says that we “have received a spirit of sonship.” Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79370" data-verses="Romans 8:15">verse 15</span> mentions “a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father”; but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79371" data-verses="Galatians 4:6">Galatians 4:6</span> it says that “the Spirit of His Son” cries “Abba, Father.” There is a difference here. Nevertheless, whether we cry or He cries, we both cry together. When we cry, He cries in our crying. When He cries, we cry with Him. According to grammar, the subject of crying in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79372" data-verses="Romans 8:15">verse 15</span> is “we,” but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79373" data-verses="Galatians 4:6">Galatians 4:6</span> the subject of crying is “the Spirit.” These two verses prove that we and He, our spirit and the Spirit, are one. When we cry, “Abba, Father,” He joins with us in our crying. The Spirit cries in our crying because the Spirit of the Son of God indwells our spirit. Hence, there is no fear, only a sweet crying of, “Abba, Father.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoGlVs2JsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El"> “Abba” is an Aramaic word which also means father. When these two terms “Abba” and “Father” are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate. “Abba, Father” is sweetness intensified. Children of every race address their father in such a sweet way: in America we say, “Daddy”; in China they say, “Baba”; and in the Philippines they say, “Papa.” We do not speak one syllable, such as “Da,” “Ba,” or “Pa.” It is not sweet at all if we speak just one syllable. We need to say, “Daddy,” “Baba,” <span class="pg" data-page-id="218" id="218">[218]</span> or “Papa.” We need to call, “Abba, Father.” If you do it, you will realize how sweet it is. </p>
<p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PdegUTqjprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> Why do we call, “Abba, Father”? Because we have a spirit of sonship. If a certain man is not my father, it will be difficult for me to call him “Daddy.” It may be easy for me to call him “mister,” but I cannot call him “Daddy.” It would be even harder for me to say to him, “Abba, Father.” In fact, it would be impossible. If my dear father were still living, I would like to call him, “Daddy.” It would be so sweet to address him in this way because I was born of him. Young people, there is no need for you to doubt whether or not you are the sons of God. When you say, “Abba, Father,” do you have a sweet, intimate sensation within you? If you do, it proves that you are a son of God and that you have a spirit of sonship. If you find yourself able to call Him God, but not Abba Father, it indicates that you are not a son of God. However, as long as you can call, “Abba, Father” sweetly, you may be assured that you are a son of God. </p>

The Firstfruit of the Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYMQEvFDOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79391" data-verses="Romans 8:17">Romans 8:17</span> says “And if children, heirs also; heirs of God and joint-heirs of Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79392" data-verses="Romans 8:17">verse 17</span> we see that we have progressed from children to heirs. We are heirs of God and joint-heirs of Christ. Paul’s thought here is very strong. Please notice the semicolon in this verse. It indicates that there is a condition involved in being an heir. We should not say that simply because we are children we are heirs. This is too hasty. There is no condition imposed for us to be the children of God. As long as the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, we are the children of God. However, for us to progress from children to heirs there is a condition. This condition is mentioned in the latter part of the verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWalaMNvZvavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na"> The condition for being heirs of God and joint-heirs of Christ is that “we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.” We may not like suffering, but we need it. Remember that suffering is the incarnation of grace. We should not be distressed by suffering. If we suffer with Him, we will be glorified with Him. Although I cannot say that without suffering we will not be glorified, it is certain that the degree of our suffering determines the degree of our glory. The more suffering we pass through, the more our glory will be intensified, for suffering increases the intensity of our glory. We would like to be glorified, but we do not want to experience suffering. However, suffering increases glory. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79393" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:41">1 Corinthians 15:41</span> Paul says that “one star differeth from another star in glory,” indicating that some stars shine more <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> brightly than others. We all will shine and we all will be glorified, but the intensity of our glory will depend on the amount of suffering we are willing to take. It is certain that the Apostle Paul in that day will shine more brightly than all of us. Do you believe that you will shine as brightly as Paul? We shall all be glorified, but the intensity of our glory will differ according to our suffering. Therefore Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79394" data-verses="Romans 8:18">verse 18</span>, “For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us.” The present suffering means nothing compared with the coming glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7Gbm-iSUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79395" data-verses="Romans 8:19">Verse 19</span> reads, “For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God.” This revelation denotes the manifestation or the appearing of the sons of God. We all are the sons of God. As I have previously mentioned, if we tell people on the street that we are sons of God, they will think that we are crazy. They will say, “Look at you and me. What is the difference between us? We are both human beings. You are not different from me. You are just another person. Why do you say that you are a son of God?” However, the day will come when the sons of God will be manifested. In that day there will be no need to make the declaration, “From now on we are the sons of God,” because we all shall be glorified. We shall be in glory, designated as sons by the glory of God. Then all other people will have to admit that we are the sons of God. They will say, “Look at these people. Who are these people so full of glory? They must be sons of God.” There will be no need for us to say anything. We shall be designated by our glorification. The entire creation is waiting for this with watching eyes, for the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_jFzBA6sEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79396" data-verses="Romans 8:20">Verse 20</span> continues, “For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him Who subjected it.” We need to notice the word “vanity.” The entire creation is under vanity. Everything under the sun is vanity. The wise king Solomon said, “Vanity of vanities; all is vanity” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79397" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 1:2">Eccl. 1:2</span>). Creation is subject to vanity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="227" id="227">[227]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_3oC6A1N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79398" data-verses="Romans 8:21">verse 21</span> says, “In hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.” We need to notice two other words, “slavery” and “corruption.” In the entire universe there is nothing except vanity and corruption. This corruption is a kind of bondage, a slavery that binds the whole creation. Creation has been made subject to vanity in the hope that it will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. One day the children of God will be glorified, brought into glory. With that glory there will be freedom, and that freedom will be a kingdom, sphere, or realm. The whole glory will be a kingdom, a sphere, into which we will be brought. When we are brought into that freedom or kingdom of glory, creation will be delivered from vanity, corruption, and slavery. This is the reason that the entire creation is awaiting that time. We have very much to do with the creation, for the future destiny of the creation rests upon us. If we mature slowly, the creation will blame us and murmur against us. It will say, “Dear children of God, you are growing too slowly. We are waiting for the time of your maturity, the time when you will enter into glory, the time when we will be freed from vanity, corruption, and slavery.” We must be faithful to the creation and not disappoint it. </p>
<p data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGzw12GeS_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79399" data-verses="Romans 8:22">Verse 22</span> says, “For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.” It seems that one star groans to another and that the moon groans to the planets. They all groan together. Not only does the creation groan together, it also travails as in the pangs of childbirth. The whole creation is groaning and travailing together until now. </p>
<p data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGVlyHgMDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79400" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Verse 23</span> follows, “And not only so, but we ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.” Although we have been born through regeneration as the sons of God and have the Spirit as the firstfruit, we also groan because we are still in the body which is linked to the old creation. We must admit that our body still <span class="pg" data-page-id="228" id="228">[228]</span> belongs to the old creation. Since our body belongs to the old creation and has not yet been redeemed, we are groaning in it as the creation does. However, while we are groaning we have the firstfruit of the Spirit. The firstfruit of the Spirit is for our enjoyment; it is a foretaste of the coming harvest. This firstfruit is the Holy Spirit as a sampling of the full taste of God as our enjoyment, of all that God is to us. God is so much to us. The full taste will come in the day of glory. Nevertheless, before the full taste comes, God has given us a foretaste today. This foretaste is His Divine Spirit as the firstfruit of the harvest of the full enjoyment of all that He is to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvZv7gDW0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> If you talk with unbelievers, they will admit that, in a sense, they have some enjoyment in their entertainments, like dancing and gambling. However, they will also tell you that they are unhappy. You may ask them, “Why do you go dancing or to a gambling casino?” They would reply, “Because I am so sad, so depressed. I need to do something.” They also are groaning, but only groaning; there is nothing else. We, on the contrary, as we are groaning, have within us the Spirit as the firstfruit, as the foretaste of God Himself. Even as we are suffering, we have the enjoyment. We have the taste of the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord is simply the Spirit as the firstfruit for our enjoyment. So, we are different from worldly people. They experience groaning without the inward enjoyment. We, however, groan outwardly, but rejoice inwardly. Why do we rejoice? We rejoice because we have the firstfruit of the Spirit. The Divine Spirit within us is the foretaste of God which leads us to the full taste of the enjoyment of God. This is a great item in the blessings of sonship. </p>

<p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6W2tcHiRvTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> In the past two messages we considered the blessings of sonship. In this message we shall see that the heirs are conformed for glorification. To what are the heirs conformed? To the image of Christ, God’s firstborn Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79414" data-verses="Hebrews 1:5-6">Heb. 1:5-6</span>). Christ is God’s firstborn Son, and the believers are the many sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79415" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10">Heb. 2:10</span>). As God’s firstborn Son, Christ is the model, example, pattern, and prototype for all His brothers, the many sons of God, who will be conformed to His image. This conformation is for the coming glorification. We should not expect to be glorified without firstly growing in life and being conformed to the image of God’s Son. If we expect to be glorified without being conformed, we will be disappointed. The glorification to come depends on our conformation to the image of the Son of God. Thus, glorification depends upon our growth in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="gTWF_O-VusFLsBnICnGQG1lm5HlcJrTjqrrJfkDlEYM2QChTjzMfb7iFBzHc2B8W3"> Once again I use the illustration of a carnation seed. The seed is sown into the ground and sprouts: this is regeneration. Then the carnation grows: this is the growth in life, the stage of transformation. Eventually the carnation plant grows to the point of blossoming: this is transfiguration and glorification. The stage of the blossoming of the carnation plant is the stage of its glorification. If while the carnation plant is in the sprout stage it expects without growing to blossom and to be glorified, the time of blossoming will never come. If you do not grow in life, yet await the time of blossoming, <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> the time of glorification, you are a dreamer. Nevertheless, this is exactly the situation among many Christians today. </p>
<p data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8yrSGTq5JuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo"> Recently, I had dinner with some Christian friends who are very familiar with the outward world situation. They told us that a great many Christians are interested in two main aspects of prophecy: the rapture and the signs relating to the Lord’s coming. However, if we expect to be raptured without growing in life, we are dreamers, for rapture is actually our transfiguration and glorification. No carnation seed can grow from a sprout to a blossom overnight. Imagine that a carnation sprout dreamed that overnight it grew from the sprout stage to the blossom stage. This may occur in a dream, but not in real life, for such an unusual development is absolutely against the law of life. According to the law of life, a carnation plant must grow gradually until it reaches maturity. Then and only then will a blossom appear. Likewise, we must grow gradually until we arrive at a full grown man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79416" data-verses="Ephesians 4:13">Eph. 4:13</span>, Gk.). Once we reach the stage of blossoming, we are ready to be transfigured and glorified. Thus, glorification with transfiguration is possible only after we have reached maturity. </p>
<p data-content-id="w_QXt_moIy43U-iBdBHOkUzaRmL7iM3CET_8qgPLZCAY5YjmkXjovKLmYef-__VX0"> We may also use the illustration of graduating from college. Suppose a college freshman dreams that he completes his education in one night and that he will graduate the next morning. That is merely a dream. In reality, he should not expect to graduate until he has completed four years of study. After he has finished all of his courses and passed all of his examinations, he will be approved for graduation. Graduation never comes suddenly. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKe1mRZsI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx"> Many Christians live in a dream. Although many Christians have expected to be taken to the air, eventually they all passed into the earth. During the last century and a half there have been many peculiar predictions regarding the coming of the Lord. Many so-called teachers of prophecy even dared to fix the date when the Lord would descend to the air. However, the years passed and nothing happened. Every prediction failed to materialize. <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcRZ0ApKNNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r"> I was saved as a teen-ager a few years after the end of World War I. I loved to read the Bible and to know its truths. Therefore, although I was a student with little money, I tried to buy spiritual books. Many of those who taught and wrote about prophecy offered a number of predictions, most of which were shattered by the start of World War II; none were fulfilled. D. M. Panton, a great teacher of the Bible, published a paper entitled <em>Dawn.</em> In the mid-1930’s he printed an article which included two photographs, one of Caesar Nero and the other of Mussolini. D. M. Panton said, “Look at these pictures. See how much they resemble one another. Mussolini must be the antichrist.” After we came to know about this article, I said in one of the church meetings, “Dear saints, Mr. Panton has published an article telling us that Mussolini is the antichrist. If this is the case, certainly the Lord is coming soon, and we will be raptured. Brothers, deep in my spirit I do know one principle—that the rapture is the issue of maturity. In the New Testament the rapture is likened to a harvest, and a harvest is possible only after the crop has matured and ripened. If the crop is not ripe, but is still tender and green, how can the harvest come? It is impossible. Brothers and sisters, look at the situation among the Lord’s people today. Look at the crop. Is it ripe? Do you believe that according to the present stage of the growth of the crop the harvest is imminent? It is impossible. Look at the field—nowhere is there any real growth. Although there are thousands of genuine Christians everywhere on the earth as a result of two centuries of evangelization, of missionaries going out to the uttermost parts of the earth with the gospel, there is still very little growth. Where is the real growth in life? There is hardly any growth and no maturity. How then can we expect to have the harvest? I dare to say that the harvest will not come until the crop is ripe.” I spoke this word nearly forty years ago; however, the rapture has not yet happened. Mussolini was killed and buried, and no Christian has seen the antichrist. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1I8STb1RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM"> We should not approach prophecy in the peculiar way of prediction. Many writers have done this and every one of <span class="pg" data-page-id="238" id="238">[238]</span> them has been put to shame. We must realize that glorification with transfiguration depends upon our growing in life until we reach maturity. If we want to be glorified, we must grow, for glorification comes as the issue of maturity. When we enter into maturity, that maturity will issue in glorification. Glorification will not come as an accident, as an overnight occurrence; it is the result of growth in life. Brothers and sisters, we need to grow. As God’s crop we need to ripen until the time of harvest, the time of our transfiguration and glorification. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCYGepPSNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi">B. Joint-heirs of Christ</h2><p data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_vOzn6det51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7"> From here on we need to read more verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79417" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> and comment on them, including some of the verses which we have covered in the two previous messages. We may begin with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79418" data-verses="Romans 8:17">verse 17</span>. “And if children, heirs also; heirs of God and joint-heirs of Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.” Children cannot be legal heirs. In order to become legal heirs the children must grow into sons, and the sons must grow into heirs. When we have reached this stage of growth, we shall be glorified. Although we considered this verse in the last message, I want to approach it now from another angle. We need to understand that the genuine growth of any kind of life depends upon hardship and suffering. Without hardship or suffering it is difficult for any life to grow. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79419" data-verses="Romans 8:17">verse 17</span> we find the matter of suffering. I have already pointed out that the more suffering we undergo, the greater will be our degree of glory. However, the suffering mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79420" data-verses="Romans 8:17">verse 17</span> does not only concern outward glorification; suffering is also for growth in life. The more we suffer, the more we grow and the faster we are matured. If a crop in the field could speak, it might say that it grows not only by the soil, water, fertilizer, air, and sunshine, but that it also grows by suffering. Even the sunshine itself is a source of suffering, for the scorching heat of the sun burns the crop into ripeness. Therefore, if you expect to grow, you need to tell the Lord, “Lord, I don’t reject any <span class="pg" data-page-id="239" id="239">[239]</span> kind of suffering. Suffering helps my growth.” We should not expect a life that is free of suffering. </p>

Outwardly by the Working Together<br/>of All Things</h2><p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVeps-Ma4Ec8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> We cannot avoid the process mentioned in the previous message, for it is the purpose of the Holy Spirit’s intercession with groanings. God the Father knows the purpose of the Spirit’s groaning and thus He causes all things to work together (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79427" data-verses="Romans 8:28">v. 28</span>). Following <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79428" data-verses="Romans 8:26-27">verses 26 and 27</span> which speak of the Spirit’s intercession, we have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79429" data-verses="Romans 8:28">verse 28</span> which says, “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose.” The Holy Spirit groans within us, interceding for us, and God the Father answers this intercession by causing all things to work together for good. In Greek the word translated “all things” means all matters, all persons, all things, all in all. God the Father is sovereign, and He arranges everything. He knows how many hairs you need (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79430" data-verses="Matthew 10:30">Matt. 10:30</span>) and how many children you should have. Do not complain about your children, for God will not give you more or less than you need. He is sovereign. He knows. He knows whether you need obedient children or naughty children. He knows whether you need boys or girls. Again and again I say that He knows. He causes all things, all matters, and all persons to work together for your good. It seems that God sacrifices everyone for you. To the wife her husband is a sacrifice, and to the husband his wife is a sacrifice. To the children the parents are a sacrifice, and to the parents the children are a sacrifice. Who can do such a work? Only God. I have told the Lord, “Lord, why do You <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> sacrifice everyone just for me?” I have the inward sensation that all the brothers with whom I coordinate and even all the churches are sacrifices for me. Nevertheless, when you suffer, I suffer more. When the wife suffers loss, the husband suffers more, and when the children suffer, the parents suffer more. Praise the Lord that God causes all things, all matters, and all persons to work together for good to those who love Him and who have been called by Him to the end that He may fulfill His purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XIPid-uP0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0"> God has determined our destiny beforehand, and this destiny can never be fulfilled without the divine arrangement that causes all things to work together for us. Our destiny is to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. We are not yet fully in the image of the firstborn Son of God, but God the Father is planning, molding, and performing by causing all things to work together for good. Praise the Lord! While we are growing, He is molding. </p>
<p data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvMgfAXB773NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr"> We all should be comforted. If you have a nice wife, praise the Lord for your nice wife. If you have a difficult wife, praise the Lord even more for your difficult wife. Whether you have a nice wife or a difficult wife, a nice husband or a difficult husband, obedient children or naughty children—whatever you have, you should be comforted. You should tell the Lord, “Lord, I can make and I have made many mistakes, but You can never be mistaken. Even my mistakes are in Your hands. If You do not allow me to make a mistake, You just move Your little finger and change the situation and I will not make one. Everything is in Your hands.” Therefore, we all must be comforted. </p>
<p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaH6Rwvob3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> However, do not be so spiritual that you go to an extreme and pray the Father to give you suffering. Do not pray for sufferings. Instead, you should pray, “Father, deliver me from temptation. Deliver me from all manner of sufferings. Keep me away from every kind of disturbance.” Although you pray in this way, some hardships and afflictions will visit you. When they come, do not complain and do not be troubled, but say, “Father, thank You for this. Father, if it is possible, take this cup away from me. Nevertheless, Father, <span class="pg" data-page-id="249" id="249">[249]</span> not my will but Thine be done.” This is the proper attitude. Never pray that sufferings come, but pray the Father to keep sufferings away from you. However, when the sufferings come, do not be disappointed; accept them and continue to pray, “Father, if possible take this away. Keep me in Your presence, away from every trouble and distraction.” On one hand, we must pray in this way; on the other hand, we must be happy with all that the Father gives us, because we know that everything is in His hands and comes our way that we may be conformed to the image of His firstborn Son. This conformation is the preparation for our glorification. </p>
<p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7KTm-HYUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> Let us now proceed to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79431" data-verses="Romans 8:31">verse 31</span>. “What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?” We should not take this word according to our natural concept. God is not for us in our way, but in His. </p>
<p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_vNzBhxsEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79432" data-verses="Romans 8:32">Verse 32</span> says, “He Who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?” The word “all” in this verse is also the Greek word <em>panta,</em> which means all things, matters, and persons. All things, matters, and persons have been freely given to us. We must believe that everything works together for good. Even our enemies are for our good. </p>
<p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYp4S_QEOtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> “Who shall bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God Who justifies” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79433" data-verses="Romans 8:33">v. 33</span>). Only God is qualified to place a charge against us, but He justifies us. </p>
<p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8YbisibvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> “Who is he that condemns? It is Christ Jesus Who died, but rather Who was raised, Who is even at the right hand of God, Who also intercedes for us.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79434" data-verses="Romans 8:10">verse 10</span> we see clearly that Christ is in us, but here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79435" data-verses="Romans 8:34">verse 34</span> we are told that Christ is at the right hand of God. Thus, in one chapter we are told that Christ is in two places—in us and at the right hand of God. Where is Christ? Because He is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79436" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>), He is omnipresent. He is both in heaven and on earth, both at the right hand of God and in our spirit. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79437" data-verses="Romans 8:26">verse 26</span> the Spirit intercedes within us, and according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79438" data-verses="Romans 8:34">verse 34</span> Christ intercedes for us at the right hand of God. Do we have two intercessors—one within us and the other at the right hand of God? No, these two are <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> one. This is similar to electricity. We have electricity in our homes as well as in the power plant; nevertheless there is just one electricity. Likewise, Christ intercedes for us both at the right hand of God and from within our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_305z89bgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> I would now like to call your attention to the fact that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79439" data-verses="Romans 8:30">verse 30</span> all of the verbs are in past tense. Let us read this verse once again. “And whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.” Since glorification will occur in the future, why does Paul say “glorified” and not “He will glorify”? Although glorification has not yet occurred, Paul uses the past tense. What does this mean? Once again we see that if we only read the Bible according to the black and white letters we will get into difficulty. I ask you, has glorification been accomplished? Why does the Apostle Paul here say “glorified”? Have you been glorified? The Bible says that we have been glorified already. Everything mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79440" data-verses="Romans 8:30">verse 30</span> is an accomplished fact—predestinated, called, justified, and glorified. There is no problem with saying “predestinated,” because that was an action performed in the past. We may also say “called”; however, many people have not yet been called and we must preach the gospel to them that they may be called. Furthermore, although we have been justified, many new converts will be justified. Moreover, none of us, including Paul himself, has been glorified. Nevertheless, Paul put everything in the past tense. </p>

We may consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79467" data-verses="Romans 9:1">chapters nine through eleven</span> as a parenthesis and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79468" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span> as a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79469" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span>. In the sense of the life process or life practice it is correct to say this; however, I do not think that in Paul’s concept these chapters were parenthetical, for in them are some elements which are a continuation between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79470" data-verses="Romans 1:1">chapters one through eight</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79471" data-verses="Romans 12:1">twelve through sixteen</span>.

OF GOD WHO CALLS</h2><p data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKe3mRAnI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx"> God’s selection is our destiny. Our eternal destiny has been fully established by God’s selection. This selection and destiny are of the very God who calls, not of those who work. Our selection is absolutely of God who calls. In order to grasp this point we need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79474" data-verses="Romans 9:1-13">9:1-13</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcRb0AMCNNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r"> “In Christ I speak the truth, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit.” This verse proves that the conscience is a part of the human spirit. We have seen that the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79475" data-verses="Romans 8:16">8:16</span>). However, in this verse we are told that our conscience bears witness in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, since the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit and our conscience witnesses with the Holy Spirit, our conscience must be part of our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1I-ST68RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM"> Paul’s conscience testified that he had great grief and unceasing pain in his heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79476" data-verses="Romans 9:2">v. 2</span>). This was the pain Paul suffered for his kinsmen that they might be saved. <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kbVg-WD5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> “For I was praying that I myself would be a curse, separated from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79477" data-verses="Romans 9:3">v. 3</span>). This is a serious prayer. Paul prayed in such an earnest way because of his desire for Israel to be saved. To pray that Israel be saved was necessary, but to pray that he be a curse was too extreme. Regardless of how spiritual we may be and how much in our spirit we may be, it is still possible for us to utter a prayer in a way that is not of the Lord. When Paul was praying that he might be a curse, separated from Christ, I do not believe that it was of the Lord. Do you believe that the Lord compelled Paul to pray that he become a curse, separated from Christ? I do not think that the Lord required this of him. Then what motivated him to pray this way? Paul’s intense desire. He prayed that way because of his great love for his kinsmen. </p>
<p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3bitmG-elY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> Many times we have an intense desire for a certain thing and that desire causes us to utter a prayer in an extreme way. A brother may pray for his wife who is seriously ill, praying desperately in every way, even with fasting. The Lord may answer his prayer, but not according to his way. Such was the case with Paul’s prayer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79478" data-verses="Romans 9:3">verse 3</span>. He prayed with a great desire that God would put him aside and make him a curse that his brothers might be saved. God answered his prayer, but not in his way. </p>
<p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRP-4B4XOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> “Who are Israelites, whose are the sonship, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service, and the promises” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79479" data-verses="Romans 9:4">v. 4</span>). Sonship means the right of inheritance. What is the glory mentioned in this verse? The glory of God was manifested at least twice to the people of Israel: in the wilderness when the tabernacle was erected (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79480" data-verses="Exodus 40:34">Exo. 40:34</span>) and in Jerusalem when the temple was built and dedicated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79481" data-verses="2Chronicles 5:13-14">2 Chron. 5:13-14</span>). On both occasions the Israelites saw the glory of God. The covenants are those God made with Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79482" data-verses="Genesis 17:2">Gen. 17:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79483" data-verses="Acts 3:25">Acts 3:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79484" data-verses="Galatians 3:16-17">Gal. 3:16-17</span>) and with the children of Israel at Sinai (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79485" data-verses="Exodus 24:7">Exo. 24:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79486" data-verses="Deuteronomy 5:2">Deut. 5:2</span>) and at Moab (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79487" data-verses="Deuteronomy 29:1">Deut. 29:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79488" data-verses="Deuteronomy 29:14">14</span>). These covenants are treasured by the Israelites (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79489" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">Eph. 2:12</span>). The giving of the law refers to the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79490" data-verses="Deuteronomy 4:13">Deut. 4:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79491" data-verses="Psalms 147:19">Psa. 147:19</span>), which is precious to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> Israelites. The service mentioned in this verse is undoubtedly the priestly or Levitical service, for all the service related to the tabernacle was under the hand of the priests and Levites. The promises are those God gave to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79492" data-verses="Romans 15:8">Rom. 15:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79493" data-verses="Acts 13:32">Acts 13:32</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPTIQgTK1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79494" data-verses="Romans 9:5">Verse 5</span> says, “Whose are the fathers, and out of whom according to flesh is the Christ, Who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.” The fathers were Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and others. Also, according to His human nature, Christ came out of the children of Israel. Paul says that Christ is “over all, God blessed forever.” When Paul came to this point in his writing, he was so filled with the glorious Person of Christ that he poured out what was in his heart—“Christ is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.” We all have to be deeply impressed with and fully realize and appreciate the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ is the very God who is over all and blessed forever. Though He came out of the Jewish race in flesh, He is the very infinite God. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79495" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> says, “Unto us a child is born...and his name shall be called...The mighty God.” We praise Him for His deity and we worship Him as the very God forever. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxVxmxOgp3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> “Not, however, as though the word of God has come to naught. For not all are Israel who are out of Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79496" data-verses="Romans 9:6">v. 6</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79497" data-verses="Romans 9:3">verse 3</span>, Paul prayed out of his desire for his kinsmen to be saved. As he came to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79498" data-verses="Romans 9:6">verse 6</span> he spoke of God’s economy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79499" data-verses="Romans 9:3">verse 3</span> he uttered a prayer out of his desperation, even willing to be “a curse, separated from Christ.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79500" data-verses="Romans 9:6">verse 6</span> he said, “Not all are Israel who are out of Israel.” God’s economy is that not all who are out of Israel, that is, all who are born of Israel, are the true Israel. All Jews have been born of Israel, but not all of them have been selected by God. All of them are of the Jewish religion, but not all are saved even though outwardly they have all the good things, including Christ, promised by God in His Holy Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkTyIfx4p-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> “Neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children, but, In Isaac shall your seed be called” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79501" data-verses="Romans 9:7">v. 7</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79502" data-verses="Romans 9:6-7">verses 6 and 7</span> Paul is in the light of God’s economy and sees things clearly. Only that part of Abraham’s seed which is in <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> Isaac is called. Besides Isaac, Abraham had another son named Ishmael. Though Ishmael was born of Abraham, neither he nor his descendants, the Arabs, have been selected by God. They are the children of the flesh and cannot be reckoned as the children of God. Only Isaac and a part of his descendants are selected by God and reckoned as the children of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVh-OlbrbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79503" data-verses="Romans 9:8">Verse 8</span> continues, “That is, Those who are the children of the flesh are not the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as the seed.” According to God’s economy, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise who are reckoned as the seed. Not all the seed of Abraham are the children of God. The natural birth is inadequate to make them children of God; they need to be born again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79504" data-verses="John 3:7">John 3:7</span>). The phrase “children of the promise” denotes the second birth, for it is only by the second birth that they can be the children of the promise and thus be reckoned as the seed. </p>

<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPTJQgKD1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79525" data-verses="Romans 10:4">Romans 10:4</span> says, “For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes.” Christ is the end of the law. This means that He has completed and terminated the law. He came to fulfill the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79526" data-verses="Matthew 5:17">Matt. 5:17</span>). By fulfilling the law He ended and terminated the law. The result of Christ’s terminating the law is that God’s righteousness is given to everyone who believes in Christ. When He died on the cross, Christ completed and terminated the law. The law ended in Him. Since the law was terminated on the cross of Christ, we should be under it no longer. We may simply receive God’s righteousness by believing in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxVxnxOFn3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> The Jews treasured the law and tried to keep it that they might establish their own righteousness before God. They did not see that the law had been fully completed and terminated by Christ. If they had seen this, they would have stopped their attempts to keep the law. They would never again have tried to establish their own righteousness before God, but would have taken Christ as their righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkTyJfxZm-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> The principle is the same with a great many Christians today. After being saved, they make up their minds to do good to please God. As a result, they spontaneously make regulations for themselves, regulations which may be considered as their self-made laws, and they endeavor to fulfill them in order that they may be pleasing to God. Like the Jews, they do not see that Christ is the end, the termination of all regulations and that they should take Him as their life <span class="pg" data-page-id="268" id="268">[268]</span> that they may live righteously before God. Furthermore, they need to see that the genuine righteousness before God is Christ, the One who has terminated the law that He might be the living righteousness to everyone who believes in Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79527" data-verses="Romans 10:1">Romans 10</span> unfolds so much of Christ that we may know how to participate in and enjoy Him as our real and living righteousness before God. </p>

Christ, Incarnated and Resurrected</h2><p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6W2ucH7avTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> We need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79528" data-verses="Romans 10:5-7">verses 5 through 7</span>. “For Moses writes that the man who does the righteousness which is out of the law shall live in it. But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? That is, to bring Christ down. Or, Who will descend into the abyss? That is, to bring Christ up from among the dead.” Paul’s writing is very deep. Apparently these verses do not mention the incarnation and resurrection of Christ; actually both are included in this portion. Although Paul did not use the words incarnation and resurrection, he nevertheless had both of them in mind when he wrote this part of Romans. Paul quotes <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79529" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:12">Deuteronomy 30:12</span> saying, “Do not say in your hearts, Who will ascend into heaven?” He then points out that this means “to bring Christ down” and that this refers to Christ’s incarnation, for Christ came down from the heavens in His incarnation. Furthermore, Paul says that we should not ask, “Who will descend into the abyss?” To “descend into the abyss” means “to bring Christ up from among the dead,” and this refers to Christ’s resurrection. To descend into the abyss means to die and to enter into hades. When Christ died He descended into the abyss, and in resurrection He was brought up from among the dead, that is, out of the abyss. Christ is the One who has passed through incarnation and resurrection. Therefore, we may say that He is the “processed” Christ, Christ incarnated and resurrected. </p>
<p data-content-id="gTWF_O-VusFLsBnICnGQF1lDxHlcJrTjqrrJfkDlEYM2QChTjzMfb7iFBzHc2B8W3"> Christ has passed through a long process from incarnation through resurrection. In this process He accomplished everything that is required by God’s righteousness, holiness, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="269" id="269">[269]</span> glory and all that is needed to enable us to partake of Him. He was God incarnated to be a man, and, as a man, He was transfigured through resurrection into the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79530" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). Now in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit He is so available to us that we may receive Him and take Him in at any time and in any place. </p>
<p data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8yrRGTLwJuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo"> We need to say a word about the “abyss” mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79531" data-verses="Romans 10:7">verse 7</span>. In Greek the word rendered as “abyss” is <em>abyssos.</em> This word is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79532" data-verses="Luke 8:31">Luke 8:31</span> (translated “deep” in KJV) referring to the dwelling place of the demons. It also occurs in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79533" data-verses="Revelation 9:1">Revelation 9:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79534" data-verses="Revelation 9:2">2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79535" data-verses="Revelation 9:11">11</span> (always translated “bottomless pit” by KJV in Revelation) denoting the place out of which the “locusts,” whose king is Apollyon, will come; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79536" data-verses="Revelation 11:7">Revelation 11:7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79537" data-verses="Revelation 17:8">17:8</span> signifying the place out of which the beast which is the antichrist will ascend; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79538" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">Revelation 20:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79539" data-verses="Revelation 20:3">3</span> specifying the place into which Satan will be cast and imprisoned during the millennium. The Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, uses this word for the word “deep” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79540" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2</span>. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79541" data-verses="Romans 10:7">Romans 10:7</span> it points to the place Christ visited after His death and before His resurrection, which place, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79542" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79543" data-verses="Acts 2:27">27</span>, is hades. For <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79544" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79545" data-verses="Acts 2:27">27</span> reveals that Christ went into hades after He died and rose from that place in His resurrection. So, according to biblical usage, the word abyss always refers to the region of death and of Satan’s power of darkness into which Christ after His death descended as into the lower parts of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79546" data-verses="Ephesians 4:9">Eph. 4:9</span>), which He conquered, and from which He ascended in His resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822F8h6ePdifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n">C. Christ, Near to You</h2><p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmgkzQsqPO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> Please pay attention to what Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79547" data-verses="Romans 10:8">verse 8</span>. “But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart: that is, the word of the faith which we preach.” The resurrected Christ as the living Word is near us, in our mouth and in our heart. In this verse Paul suddenly uses the term “the Word” interchangeably for Christ, indicating thereby that this Word undoubtedly is Christ Himself. Christ in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit is the living <span class="pg" data-page-id="270" id="270">[270]</span> Word. This corresponds to the New Testament revelation that the Word is the Spirit. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79548" data-verses="Ephesians 6:18">Ephesians 6:18</span> in the Greek, you will discover that the Spirit is the Word. Hence, Christ in His resurrection is both the Spirit and the Word. He is the Spirit for us to touch and He is the Word for us to understand. We may receive Him as both the Spirit and the Word. The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the living Word that is so near to us. He is in our mouth and in our heart. Our mouth is for calling, and our heart is for believing. Thus, we can call upon Him with our mouth and believe in Him with our heart. When we call on Him we are saved; when we believe in Him we are justified. </p>
<p data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJFJMhaXV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM"> After being processed through incarnation and resurrection, Christ today is both the Lord sitting on the throne of God in heaven and the life-giving Spirit moving on the earth. Thus, He is near and available to us. He is so near that He is even in our mouth and in our heart. No one can be nearer than this. He is so available that whoever believes in Him with his heart and calls on Him with his mouth will partake of Him. He has accomplished everything and He has passed through every process. He is now moving on earth, ready for and available to anyone who will receive Him. </p>

Christ, Believed In and Called Upon</h2><p data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417WCYJz81xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8"> We need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79549" data-verses="Romans 10:9-13">verses 9 through 13</span>. “That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes unto righteousness and with the mouth man confesses unto salvation. For the scripture says, All who believe on Him shall not be put to shame. For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him. For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Paul says that with the heart “man believes unto righteousness.” “Unto” is an equivalent of a Greek preposition which, in many instances, means “resulting in.” Therefore the result of believing with the heart is righteousness, while the result of confessing with the mouth is salvation. If we want to be justified, that is, to <span class="pg" data-page-id="271" id="271">[271]</span> have the righteousness of God, we must believe in the Lord Jesus. If we want to be saved, we need to confess the Lord Jesus, that is to call upon Him. </p>

A REMNANT RESERVED BY GRACE</h2><p data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Li4QCaZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79623" data-verses="Romans 11:1">11:1</span> Paul asks, “I say then, Has God cast away His people? Certainly not!” Paul was an excellent attorney, capable of arguing and winning either side of a case. If we did not have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79624" data-verses="Romans 11:1">Romans 11</span>, we would certainly think that God, after having chosen Israel, must have changed His mind. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79625" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Chapters nine and ten</span> of Romans seem to indicate that God has given up Israel. Because some people think this way Paul asked, “Has God cast away His people?” Then he answered the question himself, saying strongly, “Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite out of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says in the case of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what does the divine answer say to him? I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79626" data-verses="Romans 11:1-4">11:1-4</span>). Elijah, a prophet of God, pleaded with God against Israel. However, God told Elijah not to accuse the people before Him because He had reserved to Himself seven thousand men who had not bowed the knee to Baal. Paul continues, “So then at the present time also there is a <span class="pg" data-page-id="280" id="280">[280]</span> remnant according to the selection of grace. But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79627" data-verses="Romans 11:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbB6Sef-fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> Paul argued in a marvelous way, always winning his case regardless of which side of the question he debated. When in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79628" data-verses="Romans 10:1">chapter ten</span> he said that Israel was bad, he proved how bad they were. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79629" data-verses="Romans 10:21">Romans 10:21</span> says, “But to Israel he says, All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and contradicting people.” Certainly the worst people on earth are a disobedient and contradicting people. When we read a statement like this we are inclined to say, “Israel’s situation is hopeless. Israel is finished.” However, when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79630" data-verses="Romans 11:1">chapter eleven</span> we see a record of how the Lord Himself argued with Elijah. Elijah said, “Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars.” Both of these statements were true. Then Elijah said, “I am left alone and they seek my life.” The Lord came to Elijah and seemed to say, “Elijah, listen to Me. You are not alone. I have reserved seven thousand men. Elijah, what are you talking about?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79631" data-verses="Romans 10:1">chapter ten</span> it appeared that, in a sense, Paul was against Israel. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79632" data-verses="Romans 11:1">chapter eleven</span> he is in favor of Israel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79633" data-verses="Romans 11:5">11:5</span> Paul says that “at the present time also there is a remnant according to the selection of grace.” Paul simply cannot be defeated. Paul was saying, “Not only were seven thousand men reserved by God in the time of Elijah, but at the present time, the time in which we are living, God still has a selection according to grace. Today also there is a remnant reserved.” The principle is the same for our own time. Regardless of how far Christianity has degraded, we believe that among the thousands and even millions of Christians there are a number, a remnant, that have been reserved by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocHiryv6nWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> I am not speaking proudly, but I consider myself as one whom the Lord has reserved. How do you feel about yourself? A number of times in the past years my thought was the same as Elijah’s. But I praise the Lord that eventually I discovered that the Lord had reserved a good number to <span class="pg" data-page-id="281" id="281">[281]</span> Himself. God has reserved a remnant for His eternal purpose. Do not be disappointed. </p>
<p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwQ_oYEfqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79634" data-verses="Romans 11:6">Verse 6</span> says, “But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.” Never forget that we have all been reserved by grace. It is not the result of our work; it is altogether by His grace. If it were otherwise, grace would no longer be grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomObxmpm65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> “What then? That which Israel is seeking for he has not obtained, but those who were chosen have obtained it, and the rest were hardened” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79635" data-verses="Romans 11:7">v. 7</span>). In principle, the situation today is the same. What have we to boast of? Only the grace of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVsnuh-B7xl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79636" data-verses="Romans 11:8">Verse 8</span> says, “As it is written, God gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes to see not and ears to hear not, until this very day.” Is this our condition? Some people have eyes, but their eyes have lost their sight; some have ears, but their ears have lost their function. This is exactly the situation in our own time. In 1937 I was assigned by the work of the Lord to travel throughout northern China with the purpose of sharing with Christianity all the truths that the Lord had given us. I was assigned to do this by the work under the leadership of Brother Nee. I was charged not to stay in any of the local churches, but to travel throughout northern China. During that time I performed a good deal of traveling ministry in denominations. By that I learned that the situation was pitiful. Not many people had a heart; most did not have eyes to see or ears to hear. Then I gave up traveling and stayed in Chefoo, my home town. I was clearly burdened by the Lord not to travel anymore but simply to stay in that city with the local church. After I remained there for four years, a revival occurred. </p>
<p data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2GLk-lUQ_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk"> Let me tell you another story. During 1934 I stayed for quite some time in Shanghai with Brother Nee. One day as we were driving to another city he said to me, “Brother, the denominations have rejected us.” Quoting Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79637" data-verses="Acts 13:46">Acts 13:46</span> he said, “Let us go to the Gentiles.” Since that time the work in the Lord’s recovery took a definite turn toward the Gentiles. Since the time I first stayed with <span class="pg" data-page-id="282" id="282">[282]</span> Brother Nee in 1933 until the time we parted from one another in 1950, he did not receive one invitation from any denomination in China. Although no denomination invited him to minister, his books are very popular. Regardless of the situation, the Lord has His remnant today. </p>
<p data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0ScuhEStDRsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx"> Let us go on to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79638" data-verses="Romans 11:9">verse 9</span>. “And David says, Let their table become a snare and a trap and a cause of falling and a just retribution to them.” We have seen the same thing happen in today’s situation. </p>

THE NATIONS SAVED THROUGH<br/>ISRAEL’S STUMBLING</h2><p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocHiryK2nWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> God’s economy in His selection is firstly with the remnant reserved by grace and secondly with the nations, the Gentiles saved through Israel’s stumbling. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79640" data-verses="Romans 11:11">verse 11</span> Paul says, “I say then, have they stumbled that they might fall? Certainly not! But by their false step salvation has come to the nations to provoke them to jealousy.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79641" data-verses="Romans 9:32">9:32</span> Paul said that Israel “stumbled at the Stone of stumbling.” Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79642" data-verses="Romans 11:11">11:11</span> he says that they have not stumbled that they might fall. Paul developed his argument very carefully, saying that they stumbled, but that they did not fall. In the next part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79643" data-verses="Romans 11:11">verse 11</span> Paul describes their stumbling as a “false step.” As a result of this false step of unbelief, salvation has come to the nations. What a case Paul presents, and what an attorney he was! No one can defeat him. Everyone must submit to him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79644" data-verses="Romans 11:12">11:12</span> Paul says, “Now if their false step is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the nations; how much more will their fullness be?” The false step made by Israel has become the riches of the world and their loss the riches of the nations.

<p data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGz852GPZ_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv"> In this message we come to the most practical section in the book of Romans, the section on transformation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79677" data-verses="Romans 12:1">12:1-15:13</span>). Transformation is for life practice. As we have seen, sanctification is for the life process. Since the day we were justified we have been participating in this process of life. This life process will sanctify us and eventually glorify us. The life practice is somewhat different from the life process. For the practice of life we need transformation, for we can never have the proper practice of life in our natural life. Nothing natural is useful for the life practice. The natural element must be transformed into an element that is spiritual and holy. Hence, for the sake of the life practice we need a thorough transformation. Furthermore, the Holy Word reveals that the practice of life is mainly with the church, with the Body life. The local church life is the practical kingdom of God on earth today. </p>
<p data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGZpyH9EDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO"> Many so-called spiritual Christians truly love the Lord and pursue the growth of life according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79678" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79679" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8</span>. However, after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79680" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> and even after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79681" data-verses="Romans 11:1">Romans 11</span> there is another section, indicating that even if we have attained the standard revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79682" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> we still are lacking because we do not have the church life. The spiritual experiences of sanctification, glorification, and conformation do not exist for themselves. Sanctification is not for sanctification, and conformation is not for conformation. Both of these experiences are for the church life. As we shall see, after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79683" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapters eight</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79684" data-verses="Romans 11:1">eleven</span> Paul begs us to present our bodies as a <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> living sacrifice. The purpose of this presentation is not for us to be more spiritual, but for us to practice the Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvVj7gaf0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> Many seeking Christians do not like to talk about the church life. They seem to say, “As long as we are spiritual and sanctified and are growing in life, everything is fine. The Lord will build us together one day spontaneously.” I would say strongly that their book of Romans has only eight chapters, only half of the book. They do not seem to realize that Romans has sixteen chapters. But in the book of Romans we have five complete chapters that dwell on the matter of the church. Life is not for life—life is for the Body. Life is for the church. We have to be alert, for we can be veiled even by the best things. Praise the Lord that in Romans we have five chapters on the church life. The material on justification, sanctification, and glorification together equals five and a half chapters, but the church life itself occupies five chapters. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtT8MjfMFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> I wish to point out that the church is Paul’s final word in the book of Romans. When we listen to someone speak we always wait for his concluding word, and the concluding word in the book of Romans concerns the church. Therefore, if you stop at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79685" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> you will miss a great deal, separating yourself from the final word of Paul’s discourse. We must proceed all the way to Paul’s conclusion. </p>
<p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSIKX9VSjkAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> Why did Paul write the book of Romans? He did not write merely for justification, sanctification, or even for glorification. Romans was written ultimately and consummately for the church life. The consummation of the book of Romans is the church. Praise the Lord that Paul was so strong and rich in the matter of the church that he took five chapters to emphasize it. He took five chapters to cover the church life in a wonderful way. In Romans Paul does not present the church life in a doctrinal way, but in a very experiential and practical way. As we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79686" data-verses="Romans 15:1-2">Romans 15 and 16</span>, we shall see that Paul describes and presents the churches in the way of experience and practice, not in the way of doctrine. </p>
<p data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417WEYJz01xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8"> If you fail to probe into the depths of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79687" data-verses="Romans 12:1-16">Romans 12 through 16</span> you will consider these five chapters merely to be chapters <span class="pg" data-page-id="291" id="291">[291]</span> filled with exhortations and teachings concerning the behavior of Christians. If you think this way, it proves that you still hold a natural concept in understanding this portion of the Bible. We should not understand the Holy Word according to our natural concept. Most of the Christian teachers say that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79688" data-verses="Romans 12:1-16">Romans 12 through 16</span> describes the behavior of believers. They say that after we are saved we need to exhibit good Christian behavior. I must admit that when I conducted a thorough study of Romans more than twenty years ago with almost a thousand people I still clung to this natural concept. In that study I also said that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79689" data-verses="Romans 12:1-16">Romans 12 through 16</span> depicts the behavior of believers. It was not until recent years that, after studying Romans again and again, I said to myself, “Man, how natural you were in understanding the holy, divine revelation.” </p>
<p data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLFv7_AtoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP"> Apparently the last five chapters of Romans describe the behavior of Christians. However, what is the main item, the main aspect, of a believer’s behavior? It is the church life. The church life, the Body life, is the main structure of a Christian’s behavior. After he has been saved a believer’s behavior is primarily concerned with the church life. Do you realize that our church life is ninety percent of our living? We have even coined a new word—“churching.” Day after day we are churching. We are churching people. I can testify to you that I am churching day and night. We spend a great deal of time, money, and energy that we may continue churching. We do not care for time, the cost, or the energy—we only care for the church. We are churching all the time. The Apostle Paul held this concept of churching when he wrote the book of Romans. He did not care only for so-called behavior; his main concern was the church life. We need to practice the processed life, which is unfolded in the section on sanctification in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79690" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapters five through eight</span>, in the church life, and for this we need transformation. Therefore, the transformation in life is for the practice of life, and the practice of life is conducted mainly in the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVeps-Ia4ZU8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> Consider the contents of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79691" data-verses="Romans 12:1-16">Romans 12 through 16</span>. Undoubtedly the focus of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79692" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> is the Body life. From the <span class="pg" data-page-id="292" id="292">[292]</span> beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79693" data-verses="Romans 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> through the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79694" data-verses="Romans 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> we have a long portion dealing with the matter of receiving the saints. The receiving of the saints is also for the church life. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79695" data-verses="Romans 15:1">chapters fifteen and sixteen</span> are a practical record of the church life, not of a church in the heavens, but of churches in localities on the earth. Between these two portions we have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79696" data-verses="Romans 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. I have been bothered about <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79697" data-verses="Romans 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, finding it difficult to determine whether it belongs to the practice of the Body life presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79698" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span> or whether it should stand alone with the three items of submission, love, and spiritual warfare. Even at this writing I am not very certain about the position of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79699" data-verses="Romans 13:1">Romans 13</span>. It may be considered as a part of the subsection on the living of a normal life. If so, then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79700" data-verses="Romans 12:1-16">Romans 12 through 16</span> will have three items related to transformation, and all of these items belong to the church life: firstly, the practice of the Body life; secondly, the receiving of the saints; and thirdly, the ultimate consummation of the gospel, that is, the local churches. Hence, every aspect of the section on transformation is related to the Body life. What is your daily life? Properly speaking, your daily life is a part of your church life. If you had no daily life, you could not have the genuine church life. Your daily life is for the church life. Therefore, based upon this understanding, I prefer to say that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79701" data-verses="Romans 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> is a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79702" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span> and is a part of the subsection concerning the normal life of Christians for the church life. </p>

Not Thinking Highly of Ourselves,<br/>But Thinking Soberly<br/>according to the Measure of Faith</h2>
<p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HXafrFSr0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79744" data-verses="Romans 12:3">Romans 12:3</span> says, “For I say through the grace given to me to everyone among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.” In this verse we come to a very practical point. Everyone of us thinks highly of himself. Outwardly you may appear to be humble, but inwardly you think quite highly of yourself. This is a problem to the church life. If we are to have the proper church life, the first thing that must be torn down is the high opinion that we have of ourselves. We need “to think so as to be sober-minded.” If you think highly of yourself, your mind is not sober or normal. It means that you have an abnormal element in your mind. Your mind needs to be adjusted and renewed, and all the negative elements in it need to be swallowed up by the life of Christ. Then your mind will be renewed and sobered. <span class="pg" data-page-id="304" id="304">[304]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="EKStomoiB0TVgGaB81DutoAwACkQefxo1786oQtaQs3phAEmsIsEHfDkTPzIJOxrQ"> Furthermore, we need to think “as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.” It is not difficult to understand the meaning of “a measure of faith.” How much God has transfused and infused Himself into you constitutes your measure of faith. Your measure of faith equals the amount of God’s element which has been transfused into you. That is the faith which God has allotted to you, and you need to consider yourself soberly according to that measure. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZs3vyY6Pm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI">B. Realizing One Body with Many Members<br/>Having Different Functions</h2><p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYO4m38jydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> “For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79745" data-verses="Romans 12:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>). We need to realize that the many members of the one Body have different functions. Two young sisters may be very close to one another in age, but still have different functions. What one sister can do the other sister cannot do. If we would all realize this, we would not think so highly of ourselves, but would respect others. I hope that so many of the young brothers could say to one another, “Brother, what I can do, you cannot do, and what you can do, I cannot do.” We all have different functions. </p>
<p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52xqmYAce2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> The different functions of the members of the Body are illustrated by the human face. Look at your face: you have eyes, ears, a nose, and lips. The eye may say to Brother Nose, “Do you know that I cannot do what you can do and that you cannot do what I can do?” Brother Nose would reply, “Yes, Brother Eye. That is wonderful. And we all must understand that neither of us can do what Brother Ear can do.” Then perhaps Brother Ear would respond, “Brothers, you are right. But Brother Lips can do what none of us are able to do.” The face illustrates what is true of the entire body: we have many members and each has a different function. This is the way it should be in the church life. As I see the members functioning in the meetings, I am very happy because they can do what I cannot do. Of course, it is also true that I can do what they cannot do. <span class="pg" data-page-id="305" id="305">[305]</span> </p>

We are many members, not many separate units. As members, we have to coordinate with each other that we may be a living, functioning Body. If we do not cooperate with each other, then we are detached members, and the Body life cannot be practically realized. When it says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79747" data-verses="Romans 12:5">verse 5</span> that we “are severally members one of another,” the word “severally” does not mean separately; it means differently. It means that you are one kind of member and that I am another. Perhaps you are a nose, I am an eye, and another sister is an ear. Hence, we are severally members one of another.

Exercising Our Different Gifts<br/>according to the Grace Given to Us</h2><p data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGZqyHgIDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO"> We need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79748" data-verses="Romans 12:6-8">verses 6 through 8</span>. “And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them accordingly: whether prophecy, according to the proportion of faith; or service, in the service; or he who teaches, in teaching; or he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, in simplicity; he who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79749" data-verses="Romans 12:6">verse 6</span> Paul says that we have “gifts that differ according to the grace given to us.” What is grace? As we saw in a previous message, grace is simply God in Christ as our enjoyment. When this grace, this divine element, which is the divine life, comes into our being, it brings with it certain skills and abilities which are the gifts. The gifts, the spiritual abilities, come from the divine element which we have enjoyed. As you enjoy God, receiving and assimilating His divine element into your being, out of this divine element proceeds some gift, skill, or ability. These gifts differ according to the divine element which we have enjoyed and which we have assimilated into our being. The grace given to us refers to the grace we have enjoyed <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> and assimilated. Therefore, the gifts mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79750" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> are the gifts of grace in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvVg7gDS0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> This can be proved by other verses in the book of Romans. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79751" data-verses="Romans 5:17">Romans 5:17</span> says that “those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life.” This verse indicates that grace is related to life. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79752" data-verses="Romans 5:21">5:21</span> Paul says that “grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” These two verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79753" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> prove that grace is related to life. What is grace? It is the divine life for our enjoyment. When the eternal life of God becomes our enjoyment, that is grace. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79754" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span> Paul said, “I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.” The grace of God which was with Paul was the divine life within Paul as his enjoyment. Thus, he labored more than the other apostles, although actually it was not Paul himself, but the divine life which he enjoyed. Thus, grace in Romans is a matter of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtT_Mj6OFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> The gifts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79755" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> are according to grace. This means that the gifts are granted according to the measure of life. If you have enjoyed the life of God to a high degree, you will receive a higher gift. However, if your enjoyment of the life of God is limited, your gift also will be limited, for the measure of your gift is limited by the extent to which you have enjoyed the divine life as grace within you. The gifts enumerated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79756" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> are not the miraculous gifts which come to you suddenly. No, the gifts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79757" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> are like the abilities of the members of our human body. The measure of ability depends upon the amount of life in the body. If the body is mature with considerable growth of life and with a great amount of life, it will have an abundant overflow of life, and this overflow of the inner life of the body will produce abilities. These abilities resemble the gifts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79758" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span>. All of the items included in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79759" data-verses="Romans 12:6-8">verses 6 through 8</span> are gifts of grace in life. We may list seven of them: prophecy, service, teaching, exhortation, giving, leading, and showing mercy. We need to remember that each of these seven items, including the showing of mercy, is a gift. <span class="pg" data-page-id="307" id="307">[307]</span> </p>

Some people were born in such a way that they are unable to weep or to rejoice. Regardless of how happy or joyful you are, they remain expressionless, resembling the statue of Mary at the entrance of a Catholic church, which never changes its expression. Some brothers and sisters are like this. They do not know how to rejoice or to weep with others; they seem to be stones without human affection. However, the church life needs emotional people. We all must be properly emotional and full of expression. I would like to have a face that can express all my emotions properly and adequately. We cannot put together people with stone faces and call it the church life; we must be living stones, stones full of affection. We must learn to rejoice and to weep with others. </p>

Our whole being—spirit, soul, and body—is <span class="pg" data-page-id="317" id="317">[317]</span> included in the church life. For the sake of the church life, our body needs to be presented, our soul needs to be transformed, and our mind needs to be metabolically changed. Our mind must be renewed, not simply by being taught, but by being transformed, having the element of Christ spread into it to produce a metabolic change. The transformation of our soul primarily depends upon the renewing of our mind. If we are serious about practicing the church life, we need to present our body, to have our soul transformed, and to be burned and burning in our spirit. If we have a heart for the church life, but fail to present our body to the church, we are impractical. However, suppose we are bodily in the church life, yet our mind is filled with old concepts, thoughts, and traditions. Suppose our mind is occupied by our own natural cleverness, imaginations, and concepts. We may come to the church with our body, but we bring with us our very troublesome mind. Such an unrenewed mind will be a great problem to the church. Our body must be presented and our mind must be renewed. Suppose, by the Lord’s mercy, our body has been presented and our mind has been renewed, but our spirit remains cold. That will never work for the church life. After the presenting of the body and the renewing of the mind, we need the burning of the spirit. How we long to see that all the saints in the Lord’s recovery would have three characteristics: a body that has been absolutely presented for the church life; a mind that has been completely renewed by metabolic transformation in the soul, a mind that is free from worldly, natural, and religious thoughts, wholly saturated with the Lord’s mind, and purely for the Lord; and a spirit that is set on fire. If all the saints in the Lord’s recovery are like this, how wonderful the church life will be. </p>

<p data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoKlVsnAsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El"> The gospel of Romans is wonderful. In the first eleven chapters Paul completely covers justification, sanctification, glorification, and selection. If we read these four main sections, we shall see that God has accomplished nearly all that He intended to do. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79839" data-verses="Romans 1:1-11">Romans 1 through 11</span> we have seen God’s creation, man’s fall, Christ’s redemption, God’s justification, and God’s reconciliation. Furthermore, Paul has unveiled to us God’s identification, the life process of sanctification, and glorification. Also Paul has led us into the source of all of God’s activities—His heart of love. Paul also has led us into the secret chamber of God’s selection where we have seen His economy. What a panoramic view we have seen! Consider all of the items we have passed through: God’s creation, the fall of man, God’s redemption, justification, reconciliation, identification, sanctification, glorification, love, and selection. Although all of these items are wonderful, none of them is the ultimate consummation of God’s work. </p>
<p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PRegUOkjprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> The ultimate consummation of God’s work is the church life. Satan is subtle and has caused many of the dear, seeking Christians to even hate the word church. Many Christians uplift sanctification and life, but seem to cast the church behind their back, not caring for it, and even opposing it. Most of them hold the erroneous concept that the church is not for now, but for the future. Hence, whenever we talk about the church we find ourselves in trouble. This is the subtlety of the enemy. Nearly two thousand years ago the Lord Jesus promised that He would soon return; yet He <span class="pg" data-page-id="328" id="328">[328]</span> has not come because the church is not ready. Where is the church properly built as the Lord mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79840" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>? Without the church properly prepared, there is no way for the Lord Jesus to return. His coming back requires two things: the restoration of the nation of Israel and the recovery of the church life. If you understand prophecy, you will realize that these two matters are the greatest signs of the Lord’s return. The restoration of Israel and the recovery of the church are necessary for the Lord’s coming back. Without this preparation it is impossible for the Lord to return. In the Lord’s recovery we are preparing the way for His return. Every day we read in the newspapers regarding the events in the Middle East. All that is occurring there is the preparation for the restoration of the nation of Israel. Although I am assured that the Lord is working in the Middle East, I am quite concerned about His work among us. He must match His work with Israel by His work with the church. Thus, we must pay our full attention to the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ANzUA-iUjeJrXG0OumFNlKFXqeqVJQuX5wL_kKU5dq3C7vF1_YQpuJ09rnAq0MJO"> After eleven chapters of discourse, Paul comes to the ultimate point, the church life, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79841" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span>. We have already seen that Paul uses five chapters to cover the church life. I have previously pointed out that the section on the church life begins in a specific manner, with Paul saying, “I beg you therefore, brothers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79842" data-verses="Romans 12:1">12:1</span>). Paul was begging us to present our bodies physically and practically for the church life. After begging us to present our bodies for the church life, Paul proceeded to the second part of our being, our soul, and spoke to us regarding our need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79843" data-verses="Romans 12:2">12:2</span>). Our soul needs a radical, essential, and metabolic change in both nature and form. Our whole being needs to be changed for the sake of the church life, for nothing natural, common, worldly, or modern is suitable for the Body life. We need a metabolic transformation through the inward working of the divine life element. We need a radical revolution in our thought, emotion, and will. Once we undergo this kind of metabolic transformation in our whole being, we shall be good for the church life. Furthermore, once our body has been presented and our soul <span class="pg" data-page-id="329" id="329">[329]</span> transformed by the renewing of our mind, our spirit needs to be burning. Our spirit must be set on fire. If we have all of these qualities, we shall see out of the growth in life the manifestation of the gifts of grace in life. The different gifts and functions will begin to emerge. We must not be like the pew-sitters in the so-called churches who go to the church building and sit in their pews as dead members without any function. Such people can never participate in the church life. The people in the church life must have their bodies presented, their souls transformed by the renewing of their minds, and their spirits burning. Then the necessary gifts will be exercised and we shall have the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="RRUrZa0dvyz7r8k3lCU5U1I_HLT7GZHs7O9Lgyqlqhw7CeO8ACPd1Y2-5rrPSFRGa"> For the proper church life, we need the proper Christian life. Therefore, beginning at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79844" data-verses="Romans 12:9">12:9</span> and continuing through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79845" data-verses="Romans 13:14">13:14</span> Paul covers the normal Christian life. We have seen that in this portion of Romans Paul covers many points: our attitude and behavior toward God, our fellow members, ourselves, and our persecutors; our attitude toward the government and the established authorities; the exercise of the principle of love; and the warfare against the flesh. In order to practice the church life, we need to have a normal Christian daily life, a life which matches the church life. We need to have our body presented, our soul transformed, our mind renewed, our spirit burning, and our gifts exercised. Thus, at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79846" data-verses="Romans 13:1">Romans 13</span>, the church life has been portrayed and the Christian life adequately defined. </p>
<p data-content-id="sTrENaXmH-QUV41dS8DUw-R57afIOwXHPvMDWR4kxnQD3MSPXqGO1AtiIimI5PGDO"> However, there is still a great need. We must take care of the matter of receiving the saints. In the matter of receiving the saints, we need to exercise the discernment which is derived from the practicing of the church life and the living of a normal Christian life. If we are unclear about receiving the believers, we shall damage the church life and cut it into pieces. We shall resemble a person who, in so many details, takes care of his physical body, but is negligent about a particular matter which can cause death. If we are not careful about receiving the saints, the church will be mutilated. During the more than forty years I have been in the church life, I have met a good number of dear saints who proclaimed <span class="pg" data-page-id="330" id="330">[330]</span> that they had seen the Body, but who, after a short time, became divisive over doctrine, damaged the church, and cut themselves off from the fellowship of the church. When they first contacted the church, they said, “Hallelujah, I have seen the church,” but they became dissenting a few months later. Therefore, I say that we must be very careful about properly receiving the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtTxMj6GFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> In order to receive our fellow believers in the Lord, we need transformation. If we remain natural, we shall be unable to go along with others. In fact, according to our natural disposition, we cannot even agree with ourselves consistently. We all fight with ourselves. Thus, it is very difficult for any Christian remaining in his natural disposition to go along with others. Receiving the saints requires transformation. I believe that Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79847" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span> concerning being transformed by the renewing of the mind not only governs the section on the practice of the Body life, but also all the other chapters relating to the church life. Transformation governs the items found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79848" data-verses="Romans 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> as well as some of the aspects of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79849" data-verses="Romans 14:1">chapters fourteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79850" data-verses="Romans 15:1">fifteen</span>. If we are not transformed to at least a certain degree, we shall be unable to be one with other believers. Although we may meet with them, we shall be unable to fellowship with them or to open ourselves to them. If we were to open ourselves to them, we would end up fighting with them because we are untransformed and so natural in our concept, behavior, and all that we are and do. Thus, in order to receive our fellow believers, we need transformation. All of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79851" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span> and part of 15 is devoted to this matter. As we shall see, Paul deals with the receiving of the believers with respect to five main points. </p>

IN THE PRINCIPLE OF LOVE</h2><p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK3tTmTlGzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> We need to receive the believers in the principle of love. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79918" data-verses="Romans 14:13-15">14:13-15</span> Paul says, “Therefore, let us judge one another no longer, but rather judge this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause of falling before the brother. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that there is nothing common in itself; but to him who reckons anything to be common, to that man it is common. But if because of food your brother is grieved, you no longer walk according to love. Do not destroy by your food that man for whom Christ died.” If we receive the believers in love, we shall not judge others, not put stumbling blocks before them, not grieve the brothers, not destroy the man for whom Christ died, but rather walk according to love. We must receive in the principle of love all the believers for whom Christ died. Please remember that Romans was written shortly after Paul had written 1 Corinthians, and that he wrote Romans from Corinth. Paul devoted <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79919" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">1 Corinthians 13</span> to the matter of love, inserting it between the two chapters that deal with spiritual gifts. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79920" data-verses="1Corinthians 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> Paul presented the most excellent way of exercising the gifts and he listed many of the attributes and characteristics of love. I believe that this concept of love was fresh within him when he wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79921" data-verses="Romans 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> of Romans. <span class="pg" data-page-id="344" id="344">[344]</span> Therefore, in Romans, it seems that Paul was telling the saints, “You must receive others in the principle of love. Love must govern you. Love must be the controlling principle in the receiving of the saints.” </p>

It is good to be strong in the faith that there is nothing common and that everything is suitable for eating. But you should not let your good be slandered in your being unwilling to take care of those who are weak in faith. For their sake, you must be careful about eating what you think is good for eating. Paul’s intention is that, for the sake of the weaker ones, it is better that you not eat. </p>

<p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kbeg-WH5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> The church is the kingdom of God in this age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79923" data-verses="Matthew 16:18-19">Matt. 16:18-19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79924" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:10">1 Cor. 6:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79925" data-verses="Galatians 5:21">Gal. 5:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79926" data-verses="Ephesians 5:5">Eph. 5:5</span>). There is much argument between various schools of teaching concerning the kingdom of God. One school of thought claims that the kingdom of God is not with us today. According to this school, the kingdom of God was suspended at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79927" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>. This school affirms that when the Lord Jesus came He came with the kingdom of God and presented it to the Jewish people. Since the Jewish people rejected the kingdom of God, the Lord suspended it until the time of His return. Thus, this school teaches that during the period in which we live there is no kingdom of God. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79928" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Romans 14:17</span> says “the kingdom of God is....” This is a strong proof that the kingdom of God is here today. Further evidence that the church is the kingdom of God today is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79929" data-verses="Matthew 16:18-19">Matthew 16:18-19</span>, where <span class="pg" data-page-id="345" id="345">[345]</span> we see that the words church and kingdom are synonymous and are used interchangeably by the Lord Jesus Himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79930" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">verse 18</span> the Lord said, “I will build my church,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79931" data-verses="Matthew 16:19">verse 19</span> He said, “I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” Hence, the building of the church is actually the establishing of the kingdom. Furthermore, Paul in the epistles considered the kingdom of God as equivalent to the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79932" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:10">1 Cor. 6:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79933" data-verses="Galatians 5:21">Gal. 5:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79934" data-verses="Ephesians 5:5">Eph. 5:5</span>). How wrong it is to say that the kingdom has been suspended and that it will return at the coming of the Lord! We should not accept this concept concerning the kingdom. We must return to the pure Word which says that the church life is the kingdom of God. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3bimmG-alY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6">2. A Matter of Exercise and Discipline</h2><p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRP14B4TOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> The church is a matter of grace and life, whereas the kingdom is a matter of exercise in this age and discipline in the coming age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79935" data-verses="Matthew 25:15-30">Matt. 25:15-30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79936" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:13-15">1 Cor. 3:13-15</span>). The church, like a human head, has a different appearance when seen from different angles. If you look at the back of my head, you do not see any holes; however, if you look at the front, you will see seven of them. Although the back of my head differs from the front, both are aspects of one entity. It is the same with the church. From one angle we see the church as a matter of grace and life; from another angle we see it as the kingdom of God with exercise and discipline. In the church, on the one hand we enjoy grace and experience life, while on the other hand we undergo a certain amount of exercise. </p>
<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPTDQgTO1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> We should not neglect our need for such exercise. Because of our need for exercise, the church is the present kingdom of God. According to some of the Brethren teachers, every believer will enter the millennial kingdom as a king. But, look at ourselves. Do we resemble kings? If the Lord Jesus should come and ask you to be a king I think that you would be frightened because you don’t know how to be a king. You have never been exercised and trained to be a king. I have been told that the kings of Britain are trained to be kings from their youth. Birth is insufficient; a king must be trained and exercised. Although you have the potential of being a <span class="pg" data-page-id="346" id="346">[346]</span> king, the kingship also depends upon your exercise. Do not be loose and careless. If you are unwilling to be exercised in this age, you will be disciplined in the coming age. Your destiny is to be a king, and sooner or later the Lord will make you one. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxVxtxOgl3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> God has arranged all the details of your daily life to enable you to be exercised. Every event which transpires in your life is a part of God’s sovereign arrangement. Without the help of your environment and circumstances you cannot know yourself. You will imagine yourself to be an angel, considering yourself to be nice and wonderful, but ignorant of how poor, mean, and wild you actually are. You need a spouse, children, brothers and sisters in the church, and various circumstances to give you a multi-dimensional photograph of yourself that you may be exposed from every direction. When you see this photograph, you will declare, “Is it I? I didn’t know that I was that bad.” I have experienced this myself. When I have been tempted to blame others, the Lord has told me to put the blame on myself. He has told me to thank Him for the dear brothers that expose me and give me a healthy look at myself. Without such brothers I could not be exposed. This is an exercise we undergo in the church life for the sake of the kingdom. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkT2Kfxxm-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4">THE CONSUMMATION OF THE GOSPEL</h1><p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVl8OlOnbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> In all of the foregoing messages we have covered seven sections of the book of Romans: introduction, condemnation, justification, sanctification, glorification, selection, and transformation. Now we come to the last section, the conclusion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79959" data-verses="Romans 15:14">15:14-16:27</span>). Although Paul has covered so much, in this section of Romans he shows us some experiential and practical matters. He presents a full unveiling of the ultimate consummation of the gospel. I use the word “unveiling” because so many of the precious things have been veiled. In this message I want to point out some of the treasures that are hidden and concealed in the last section of Romans. </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeZax0rzjT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> None of Paul’s other epistles has such a long conclusion as does the letter to the Romans. Why is the conclusion so long? I doubt that any of us would compose a letter in this way. However, Paul was wise and deep, knowing that after the section on transformation he still needed to present the ultimate consummation of God’s gospel—the practical church life. Furthermore, he did not write about the church life in a doctrinal way, but in an exceedingly practical way. Hence, we find no doctrine in the conclusion; everything in this section is experiential and practical. As we shall see, in this section Paul tells us of his zeal in preaching the gospel and of his desire to visit Spain. He tells how he was burdened to supply the material needs of the saints in Judea and that the Gentile believers wanted to help the Jewish saints in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomKfxm0s65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79960" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span> the words “church” and “churches” are used five times. If we read this chapter carefully in the spirit, we will realize that Paul wrote it with a definite purpose. Every reference to the church in this chapter is experiential and <span class="pg" data-page-id="356" id="356">[356]</span> practical. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79961" data-verses="Romans 16:1">16:1</span> Paul speaks of Phoebe, a deaconess of the church at Cenchrea. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79962" data-verses="Romans 16:4">16:4</span> he says that the churches of the nations were thankful to Prisca and Aquila because they risked their necks for Paul and also for the churches. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79963" data-verses="Romans 16:5">16:5</span> we find mention of “the church in their house,” meaning that the church in Rome met in the house of Prisca and Aquila. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79964" data-verses="Romans 16:16">16:16</span> he mentions the churches of Christ and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79965" data-verses="Romans 16:23">16:23</span> he says that Gaius was the host of the entire church. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79966" data-verses="Romans 16:20">Verse 20</span> is also very important. “Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.” Under whose feet will Satan be crushed by the God of peace? Under the feet of the people in the churches. God will crush Satan beneath the feet of the “churching” people, and the grace of the Lord Jesus will be dispensed into them. Finally, Paul sends his greetings to many saints; almost the entire chapter is devoted to this. I admire Paul’s excellent memory, for he recalled the names of so many saints and mentioned their particular characteristics. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVsjqh-Ywxl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> The conclusion of Romans resembles the painting of a forest. If you look at this painting from afar, you will only see the forest itself; you will be unable to perceive the hidden things, the treasures hidden within the woods and under the leaves of the trees. Whenever I studied the book of Romans as a youth, I skipped over the conclusion, thinking that I had completed the doctrinal portions and did not need to give attention to the list of names in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79967" data-verses="Romans 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>. Because I found these peculiar names difficult to pronounce, I decided to study this book only through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79968" data-verses="Romans 15:13">15:13</span> and the last three verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79969" data-verses="Romans 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> which are a melody of praise to God and should not be neglected. Recently, however, the Holy Spirit brought me into the forest and showed me some of the treasures concealed beneath the shadows cast by the trees. Now I believe that the conclusion is the most precious and valuable section of the entire book of Romans. The practical church life is hidden under the shadows of the trees. We may say that the greetings to the individual saints are the trees and that under the trees are the churches as the treasures—the church at Cenchrea, the churches of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="357" id="357">[357]</span> nations, the church in the home of Prisca and Aquila, the churches of Christ, and the church which received hospitality from Gaius. Now I want to consider these hidden treasures in some detail. </p>

<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3w4z89fgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> We need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79970" data-verses="Romans 15:16">15:16</span>. “That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.” Paul was a minister of Christ, a public servant serving people with Christ, ministering Christ into the Gentile believers. He was like a waiter serving people at the dining table with delicious food. Paul was a waiter at the universal dining table, serving people with Christ. All the people at this dining table were filled with Christ, and Christ became the transforming element within their being. Thus, the Gentiles were transformed with the essence of the wonderful, all-inclusive Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit. Moreover, this verse reveals that Paul was a priest, for he was “ministering as a priest the gospel of God.” As a priest he offered to God the believing Gentiles as a sweet sacrifice for His satisfaction. The very Gentiles whom he served with Christ he presented to God as an offering. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJg7hKk-10stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q">B. In the Wide-spread Preaching of the Gospel</h2><p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HTcfrgar0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> The offering of the nations was made possible through the wide-spread preaching of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79971" data-verses="Romans 15:18-23">15:18-23</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79972" data-verses="Romans 15:19">15:19</span> Paul says that “from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.” During Paul’s time, Illyricum was a remote region on the northeastern corner of Europe. Paul preached the gospel from Jerusalem, a cultured city, to a remote, uncultured region. Furthermore, he desired to travel all the way to Spain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79973" data-verses="Romans 15:24">v. 24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="EKStomoiB0TVgGaB81DqroARJCkQefxo1786oQtaQs3phAEmsIsEHfDkTPzIJOxrQ"> Our preaching of the gospel must be uplifted. Our gospel should not be a kind of heaven-going gospel; it must be a gospel which ministers Christ to people. We need to <span class="pg" data-page-id="358" id="358">[358]</span> minister Christ to people that they may be sanctified and transformed with the very essence of Christ and thereby become an offering to God. Whenever and wherever the church preaches the gospel, we must do it with the conviction that we are ministering Christ to people, that we are serving Christ as food for hungry sinners. We must minister Christ to them in order that Christ might become within them the sanctifying element to change their very being. </p>

Paul considers the Gentile believers as a sweet offering to God. Once they were unclean and defiled people, but now they are sanctified and have become an offering pleasing to God. They have been transformed and conformed to the image of God and thus are fully acceptable to Him. This was the result of Paul’s ministering Christ into the Gentiles. When Christ was wrought into them, becoming their very element, the Gentiles became a corporate offering to God, an offering that had been saturated with Christ and permeated with His divine essence. Hence, they were presented to God for His satisfaction. </p>

<p data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822F4i6ePRifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n"> Out of the ministering of Christ to the nations and the offering of them as a sacrifice to God, developed the fellowship of love, the communication in love between the Gentile and Jewish saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="79975" data-verses="Romans 15:25-28">15:25-28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79976" data-verses="Romans 15:30">30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="79977" data-verses="Romans 15:32">32</span>). The Gentile saints communicated with the Jewish saints by the means of giving practical, material things. Formerly, in the eyes of the Jews, the Gentiles were swine; now they have become saints, a fragrant offering to God. Thus, the Gentile believers had it in their heart to care for the material needs of their Jewish brothers and they offered their own possessions as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="359" id="359">[359]</span> expression of their desire to take care of the needs of the saints in Judea. When the Apostle Paul came to the Gentiles, he came with Christ and ministered Christ into them. When he returned from them to Judea, he returned with material possessions for the needy saints. Paul came with Christ and returned with material possessions of the saints’ love. This was the result of Paul’s ministry. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwU6oYsfqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2">A CLOSING WORD</h1><h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZowvyNwPm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI">I. THE GOD IN ROMANS</h2>
<p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYK_m3toydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> We have seen that God is revealed progressively throughout the book of Romans. God is revealed in twelve situations in Romans. </p>
<p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52xuhYABW2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> First of all, Romans shows us God in His creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80020" data-verses="Romans 1:19-20">1:19-20</span>). God is invisible; yet the invisible things of God, such as His eternal power and divine nature, are clearly seen, being apprehended by means of the things created by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q91Dv6ZhIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI"> Secondly, Romans unveils to us God in condemnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80021" data-verses="Romans 2:1">Rom. 2</span>). After being created, man fell and became sinful. This brought in God’s condemnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE__gC6l_N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> After this, Romans presents to us God in redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80022" data-verses="Romans 3:1">Rom. 3</span>). God’s condemnation reveals man’s need of salvation, but for the righteous God to save sinful man, redemption is needed. </p>
<p data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGz492G_Z_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv"> After redemption, God is revealed in justification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80023" data-verses="Romans 3:1">Rom. 3—4</span>). God is righteous and He cannot be unrighteous. The redeeming death of Christ has fulfilled and satisfied God’s righteous requirements for us sinners. Hence, the redemption of Christ not only affords God the righteous ground upon which to justify those who believe in Christ’s redemption, but also God Himself is bound by His righteousness to do so. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxV1lxOgt3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> Following this, God is seen in reconciliation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80024" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Rom. 5</span>). We were not only sinners, but also enemies of God. God’s justification is based upon Christ’s redemption and issues in His reconciliation. Here we joy in God and enjoy God in all that He is to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkT2Lfx4t-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> More than this, God is realized by us in our identification with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80025" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Rom. 6</span>). God has not only reconciled us to Himself, but has also identified us with Christ. We were <span class="pg" data-page-id="368" id="368">[368]</span> born in Adam, but God has transferred us from Adam into Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80026" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> God has become the God in identification, having accomplished a great work in order to make us one with Himself. God has identified us with Himself in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVl9OlbvbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> Romans also shows that God is experienced by us in sanctification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80027" data-verses="Romans 6:1-8">Rom. 6 through 8</span>). He has made us one with Christ so that we may be sanctified not only positionally, but also dispositionally. Identification thus issues in sanctification. In sanctification, He is the God in our spirit. The very God who created us, redeemed us, and justified us is now in us! He is no longer merely objective to us, but He is very subjective. He is no longer just in the heavens, far away from us; He is now right within us, in “our spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80028" data-verses="Romans 8:16">8:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeZbx066jT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> Romans also reveals that God is enjoyed by us in glorification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80029" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Rom. 8</span>). He has foreknown us, predestinated us, called us, and justified us. He is now sanctifying us and He will glorify us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80030" data-verses="Romans 8:29-30">8:29-30</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomKexmpi65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> Moreover, God is further revealed to us in His love that secures our destiny (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80031" data-verses="Romans 8:31-39">8:31-39</span>). In justification He has made us partakers of His righteousness, in sanctification He is working His holiness into our being, and in glorification He will bring us into His glory. His love is the security of all these things. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVsjrh-B_xl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> God is also seen in His selection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80032" data-verses="Romans 9:1-11">Rom. 9 through 11</span>). It is not that we have selected Him, but rather that He has selected us. His selection is our destiny. In His selection we have been destined to have a share, a portion, in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2GPh-lUU_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk"> Eventually, God is glorified in the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80033" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Rom. 12</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80034" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span> God is in the Body. He is not only God in the spirits of the believers, but God in a corporate, collective entity. </p>
<p data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0SculBStDVsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx"> Finally, Romans unfolds to us that God is expressed in the church life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80035" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Rom. 16</span>). The Body of Christ is spiritual and universal. It has to be expressed practically in various localities as churches. God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in His Body, and the Body of Christ is expressed in the churches. As we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80036" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span>, we discover that <span class="pg" data-page-id="369" id="369">[369]</span> God is in the local churches. On the one hand, God is in our spirit; on the other hand, He is in all the local churches. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Pn4QfYZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4">II. THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD’S WORK</h2><p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbF_SeG9fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80037" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Romans 1</span> we find the word “creation”; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80038" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span> we find the word “churches.” It is quite easy to say how God created: He spoke the word and creation came into being. However, it is difficult to say how He produced the churches. God had to perform a work in various stages as part of a lengthy process which included redemption, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. As a result of this lengthy process, God has made the churches. The churches are the peak, the consummation, of God’s work and building. He cannot go any higher. Therefore, the book of Romans ends with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80039" data-verses="Romans 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80040" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span> the Lord’s work has reached its summit. When I read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80041" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span>, I am satisfied because He is satisfied. We must tell God, “Lord, You cannot go any further. You have reached the peak.” With the establishing of the churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80042" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span>, the eternal God has attained the peak of His work and is satisfied. </p>
<p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocDnryGwnWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> Most of the Christian teachers say, “Look ahead. Look to the future. This world is evil and the age is dark. There is nothing good on earth. Look forward to the future.” However, this was not Paul’s attitude in the book of Romans. If we had written Romans, we would have added another chapter saying, “Dear brothers, look at the poor situation. We must look ahead to the future when we will all be raptured. Then we will be in heaven.” Paul, however, did not speak this way in Romans, and there must have been a reason why he did not. Although Christians like to dream of the future in heaven, Paul knew that the Lord desires to have the churches on earth. We look to the future, but the Lord wants us firstly to have the church life at the present time. Paul understood that the Lord is satisfied to have local churches on the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwU6oYpUqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> If you study all the books in the New Testament, you will find that, other than Romans, not one of them ends with <span class="pg" data-page-id="370" id="370">[370]</span> such a melody as we find in the last three verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80043" data-verses="Romans 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>. Although some people have called these verses a doxology and a benediction, I prefer to call them a melody. When Paul wrote these words, he was excited, happy, and satisfied. Not even the book of Revelation concludes with such a melody. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80044" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span> we have the local churches, and when we have the local churches, it is sufficient for us to be excited, happy and satisfied. Once you have the local churches, what else do you need? After Paul unveiled the local church life, including many of the virtues and attributes of the dear saints, he was very happy and concluded his letter with a melody of praise. </p>
<p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZowvyU4Pm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> In his concluding praise, Paul said, “Now to Him Who is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in times of the ages” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80045" data-verses="Romans 16:25">16:25</span>). We need nothing further. We simply need to acknowledge that God has given us everything and then keep what we already have. Paul said that God was of power to establish us according to his gospel, not according to the gospel of Mark or Luke. What is the difference between the gospels of Mark and Luke and the gospel of Paul? In Mark and Luke we have salvation, but in neither of them do we find the churches. However, Paul’s gospel includes the churches and presents a portrait of the local church life, mentioning people such as Phoebe who served the church and Prisca and Aquila who risked their necks for the churches. Never forget that Paul’s gospel has sixteen chapters, not eight or twelve. </p>
<p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYK_m3whydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> Once again I say that Paul was excited and satisfied at the end of Romans. God had started from creation and had reached His peak in the local churches. Therefore, Romans is an extract or an abstract of the whole Bible. The Bible begins in Genesis with God’s creation and concludes in Revelation with the New Jerusalem, the totality of all the local churches and the consummation of God’s building. Romans consummates with the local churches, and the Bible as a whole consummates with the New Jerusalem as the totality of all the local churches. This is the view from God’s side. <span class="pg" data-page-id="371" id="371">[371]</span> </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSIOQ9V6jkAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m">THE BASIC CONCEPT OF ROMANS</h1><p data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYEbEvNDOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm"> We have covered the book of Romans in a general way in the thirty-one foregoing messages. But there are still a number of crucial points concerning the matter of life that need to be covered in detail. Beginning with this message, we shall consider these points one by one, not taking care of the sequence of the chapters of the book of Romans, but of the important aspects of life. In this message we shall cover some basic points from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80072" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80073" data-verses="Romans 6:1">6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80074" data-verses="Romans 7:1">7</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80075" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWalSHNvRvavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na"> Before we come to these basic points, however, I wish to say a word about the basic concept of this book. Romans is quite a long book, having sixteen chapters. Undoubtedly, Paul did his best to condense into these chapters all the things related to God’s salvation. In every kind of writing there is the basic thought upon which the entire writing depends. This is also true of the book of Romans. Since Romans is a long book and covers many points, it is quite difficult for most readers to find the basic thought. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7OQm-aSUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx">THE BASIC THOUGHT OF ROMANS</h2><p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_rOzB46sEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> Many Christians say that the basic thought of Romans is justification by faith, and others say that it is the salvation of God. These viewpoints are not incorrect, but they are not adequate. The basic thought of this book is that God is making sons out of sinners to form a body for Christ that He may be expressed. We sinners are the basic material which God is using to produce many sons for Himself. Paul received a revelation of God’s eternal plan, God’s eternal purpose. God’s eternal plan is to produce many sons for Himself by means of Himself as their life. This means that God intends to work Himself as life into many sinners and that these <span class="pg" data-page-id="378" id="378">[378]</span> sinners will become His many sons, after they have been redeemed and saved and have His life. Every sinner who has been born of God and has received God’s life has become one of His sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80076" data-verses="John 1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span>). This, however, is still not the ultimate goal of God’s purpose. The ultimate goal of His purpose is to build all these sons together into one Body to express Christ. God is making sons out of sinners to form the Body to express Christ. This is a full statement of the underlying concept of the book of Romans. This thought was deep in Paul’s heart and in his spirit when he composed this book. His writing of this Epistle was based upon this. Having this concept as the basic content of Romans, Paul covered so many details relating to it in sixteen chapters. When we get into this book, we see that it reveals that God is working to make sons out of sinners to form the Body to express Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYp8R_QhGtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg">THE MAJOR SECTIONS</h2><p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8cYisDSvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> Now we need to consider the major sections of the book of Romans. None of the other books in the Bible is as well organized as Romans. Therefore, it is easy to subdivide it. This book is subdivided into three main sections. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80077" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Chapters one through eight</span> compose the first section, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80078" data-verses="Romans 9:1">chapters nine through eleven</span>, the second section, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80079" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapters twelve through sixteen</span>, the third section. In this message we shall temporarily set aside the middle section and consider only the first and last sections. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822F4g6ePZifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n">PERSONAL SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmggyQsqLO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> The first section deals with the personal salvation of the individuals who believe in Christ. In other words, it is a section on personal salvation. We do not see the Body in this section. We have the many brothers of Christ, but not yet the many members of the Body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80080" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> we read of the many brothers of the Firstborn (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80081" data-verses="Romans 8:29">v. 29</span>). Although the many brothers are undoubtedly the members of the Body of Christ, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80082" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> does not refer to them as members, but as brothers of the firstborn Son. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80083" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> the concept has not gone so far as to reach the Body. It is still a matter of <span class="pg" data-page-id="379" id="379">[379]</span> the divine life producing the many sons. So the many sons are called not the many members of the Body of Christ, but the many brothers of the firstborn Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJBIMhaTV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM"> In the New Testament the Son of God is related to life. If you have the Son of God, you have life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80084" data-verses="1John 5:11-12">1 John 5:11-12</span>). If you do not have the Son, you do not have life. Because we have the divine life, we have become brothers of the firstborn Son. Now God not only has the unique Son, the only begotten Son, but also the many sons, the brothers of the Firstborn. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hoPGAKCjyReE3jTK36DX1QlIlbyuYQyTD22BFHBhVNAcZ4CopGqxWdODu-9xdw8R1">THE BODY, THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417SDYJzw1xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8"> The last section of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80085" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans, chapters twelve through sixteen</span>, covers the Body, the church life. The many brothers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80086" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> become the members of the Body in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80087" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. This is not a matter of life—life is fully covered in the first section—but a matter of function. Being a son is a matter of life, but being a member of the Body is a matter of function. We all must function together as the Body to express Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLBo7_ApoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP"> This Body must be expressed practically in all the local churches. In other words, the local churches are the practical expression of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the expression of Christ, and Christ is the expression of God. God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the Body, and the Body is expressed in the local churches. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80088" data-verses="Romans 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, we have the churches: the church at Cenchrea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80089" data-verses="Romans 16:1">v. 1</span>); the church in Rome, which met in the house of Prisca and Aquila (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80090" data-verses="Romans 16:3">vv. 3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80091" data-verses="Romans 16:5">5</span>); the churches of the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80092" data-verses="Romans 16:4">v. 4</span>); and the churches of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80093" data-verses="Romans 16:16">v. 16</span>). We are now in the churches. Hallelujah! The Body is in the churches, Christ is in the Body, and God is in Christ. How wonderful this is! If we see this, then we see the basic concept of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVeps6Pa4ZQ8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> This matter is worthy of our full attention. The first section of Romans covers personal salvation, and the last section covers the Body, which is not a matter of individual salvation, but of corporate function. The first section is on individual salvation, and the last section is on corporate function. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> corporate function is the Body, which is expressed in hundreds and even thousands of localities as local churches. This is the reason that Paul wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80094" data-verses="Romans 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> in such a wonderful way, not in the way of doctrine, but in the way of practical experience, in the way of greetings. Through his greetings, Paul opened a window through which we may look at the churches of the first century. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80095" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span> is a window. Praise the Lord for this window! Without this chapter, we could never be so clear what was taking place in the churches at that time. </p>

It is a fact that we once were in Adam; no one can deny this. Every human being either is in Adam or was in him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80108" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Chapter six</span> deals with the fact that we are now in Christ. Thus, we may entitle <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80109" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span>, “In Adam,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80110" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span>, “In Christ.” Remember, these two things are facts, one past and the other present. We were in Adam, but now we are in Christ. How much better is this present fact! </p>
<p data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8yvRGTS5JuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80111" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Chapter seven</span> deals with the experience in the flesh. This is not merely a fact, but an experience. Hence, over <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80112" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span> we may write, “In the flesh.” </p>
<p data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822F4h6eqTifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80113" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Chapter eight</span> deals with our experience in the spirit. It is difficult to determine whether this is the Holy Spirit or our human spirit because it refers to the mingled spirit. Therefore, over <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80114" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> we may write, “In the spirit.” </p>
<p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmggzQsLAO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80115" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapters five and six</span> we have two facts, the facts of being in Adam and in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80116" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapters seven and eight</span> we have two kinds of experiences, the experience in the flesh and the experience in the spirit. The experience in the flesh is the experience of the fact of being in Adam. The fact of being in Adam revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80117" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapter five</span> is experienced in the flesh as described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80118" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span>. If we had only <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80119" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapter five</span> without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80120" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span>, we would have the fact that we were so dead, but not the experience. Likewise, the experience in the spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80121" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> is the experience of the fact <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> of being in Christ revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80122" data-verses="Romans 6:1">chapter six</span>. In other words, the fact of being in Christ can be experienced only in the spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Pl4QfQZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4">IN ADAM</h2><p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbF9SeG1fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> In Adam there are three main things: sin, death, and being constituted sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80123" data-verses="Romans 5:19">5:19</span>). In Adam, we inherited sin, were under the reign of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80124" data-verses="Romans 5:12">5:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80125" data-verses="Romans 5:14">14</span>), and were constituted sinners. Of course, we were also under God’s condemnation. Whether we were good or evil means nothing. Even if we were the best person, in Adam we were still sinners under God’s condemnation. In Adam we inherited sin, were under the reign of death, and were constituted sinners under God’s condemnation. These are facts. We all were condemned even before we were born. This was our case. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocDlryKynWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu">IN CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwU4oYlWqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> Praise the Lord that we have the second fact, the fact of being in Christ! As a result of being in Christ, we have grace with righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80126" data-verses="Romans 5:17">5:17</span>). In Adam we had sin; in Christ we have grace with righteousness. What we have is not righteousness alone or grace alone but grace with righteousness. Grace with righteousness is versus sin. In Adam, we inherited sin. In Christ we have received grace with the gift of righteousness. Grace and righteousness work together because grace works through righteousness. Furthermore, in Christ we have eternal life instead of death. We can even reign in this eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80127" data-verses="Romans 5:17">5:17</span>). Although death once reigned over us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80128" data-verses="Romans 5:14">5:14</span>), now we can reign in life. Moreover, in Christ we are not under God’s condemnation; we are under His justification. In Christ we all have been justified. </p>
<p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZoyvyY-Pm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> Perhaps you are asking how you can be in Christ. We have no doubt about our being in Adam. But how can we be in Christ? It is by being baptized into Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80129" data-verses="Romans 6:3">6:3</span>), and by believing into Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80130" data-verses="John 3:15">John 3:15</span>). Being baptized into Christ includes believing into Him. Hence, we are in Christ by believing and by being baptized. When you believe in Christ, you actually believe yourself into Him. Likewise being baptized into <span class="pg" data-page-id="389" id="389">[389]</span> the water is a sign indicating that we are being baptized into Christ. God has put us into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80131" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>), and we all must believe this fact and reckon on it. Hallelujah, we are in Christ! We have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. Today I can testify boldly that I am no longer in Adam—I am in Christ. Because I am in Christ, His death, His resurrection, and all that He is have become mine. Whatever He has done is mine because I am in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYK9m38nydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> Consider the example of Noah’s ark. The ark with the eight persons aboard passed through many things. Whatever the ark passed through was also the experience of those eight persons, because they were in the ark. This is a clear type of our being in Christ. Christ is our ark, and we, the resurrected people, are in Him. (The number eight signifies resurrection.) Whatever Christ has obtained and attained and whatever He is now is ours. His death is ours, His resurrection is ours, and His life is ours. Christ’s death has terminated every negative thing in the universe, and His death is ours. Nothing terminates a person like death. If someone asks whether or not you are dead, you should strongly reply, “Yes, I died two thousand years ago (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80132" data-verses="Romans 6:6">6:6</span>). Christ’s death on the cross cleared up everything for me and terminated me absolutely. I am dead.” Praise the Lord that we all are dead! Having died with Christ on the one hand, on the other hand we are resurrected with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80133" data-verses="Romans 6:8">6:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80134" data-verses="Romans 6:11">11</span>). We are resurrected, we are living, and we are growing together with Christ in the likeness of His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80135" data-verses="Romans 6:5">6:5</span>). We all must believe these facts, recognize them, and reckon ourselves according to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52xujYAca2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> If we stand on these facts, we may present ourselves to God as slaves and present our members as weapons of righteousness unto sanctification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80136" data-verses="Romans 6:13">6:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80137" data-verses="Romans 6:19">19</span>). When we reckon upon the fact that our old man has been crucified and that we are alive to God in Christ Jesus and when we present ourselves with all of our members as weapons of righteousness to God, the way is open for the divine life to work within our being in a free way. This divine life will transfuse all that God is into our being. This is sanctification. This is <span class="pg" data-page-id="390" id="390">[390]</span> not the objective redemption on the cross; it is God’s subjective, sanctifying work in our very being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q91Bv6AsIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI">IN THE FLESH</h2><p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE__iC6A9N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> After we realize that we have died with Christ, we must also see that we no longer have anything to do with the law. Because we are dead, we are freed, discharged, from the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80138" data-verses="Romans 7:6">7:6</span>). Do not go back to the law. To go back to the law means to make up your mind to do good. Whenever you make up your mind to do good, you are returning to the law. If you pray, “O God, help me to be humble from now on,” you are going back to the law. Although you are praying to God, you are not going to God; you are going to the law. Consider a husband who repents for not loving his wife. He makes up his mind to love his wife from now on and asks the Lord to help him love his wife. This prayer indicates that he is going back to the law. I can assure you that he will not be able to love her. The more he tries to love her, the more he will fail to love her. He will find himself in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80139" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>, in the situation of not doing what he wills to do, but of doing what he does not will to do (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80140" data-verses="Romans 7:19">7:19</span>). Although you may will to love your wife, you cannot do it. You may will never to lose your temper, but eventually you lose your temper more than ever. Why? Because by going to the law you are going to the wrong source. You have not yet realized that you are an utterly hopeless and helpless case. We need to reject ourselves and say to the self, “Self, I don’t trust in you. Self, don’t make up your mind to do anything. You are not able to do anything.” Whenever a husband is tempted to make up his mind to love his wife, he should immediately say, “Satan, get away from me. I will never try this. Instead, I shall reject the self. My self must go.” </p>

This—not justification by faith—is the basic concept of this book. If we do not have this view, we shall have a very superficial understanding of Romans. Ultimately, this book is not merely for our personal salvation; it is for the formation of the Body of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XILnd-mP0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0">FOUR STATIONS</h2><p data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvMkaAX5773NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr"> In the book of Romans there are four stations: justification, sanctification, the Body, and the churches. All Christians may be classified according to these four stations. Many real Christians have stopped at the station of justification. They have been redeemed, justified, reconciled, and saved, but they have stopped their journey at justification. It seems that they are satisfied and do not want to hear anything further. In the past I have talked to many Christians about seeking the Lord and going on with Him. But some have said, “Isn’t it good enough to be saved? I have been saved, the blood of Jesus has redeemed me, I have been regenerated, and I am now a child of God. One day I shall go to heaven. Please don’t bother me with anything else.” A great part of genuine Christians go no farther than this station. </p>
<p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaD_RwXob3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> By the Lord’s grace, other Christians seek for what is called the deeper life or the inner life. They are not satisfied merely with justification, but pursue something further, <span class="pg" data-page-id="394" id="394">[394]</span> higher, richer, and deeper. These Christians eventually reach the station of sanctification in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80152" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qly-Mhn3LZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> After the end of World War II, some of the saints in the second station began to talk very much about the Body. According to the book of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80153" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans, chapter twelve</span> is the station of the proper Body life. But according to the experience of many Christians today, it is not actually the station of the Body, but the station of Body-talk. Thus, we may call these Christians the Body-talkers. When I came to this country, I was surprised at all the talk about the Body ministry. Later I learned that what was meant by Body ministry was several preaching one by one instead of only one preaching. Although Christians talk so much about the Body, where is the Body? The more they talk about the Body, the more divisions they cause. Before 1945 there were not so many divisions in the United States as there are today. But from that time, hundreds of little groups began to form, nearly all of which were talking about the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoOpVsXAsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El"> We do not have the Body simply by talking about the Body. The Body can be realized only in the local churches. If you do not have the church life, how can you have the Body? Thus, along with the third category of Christians, the Body-talkers, there is the fourth category: those who practice the church life. This is the fourth station in Romans. </p>
<p data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvMkaAXkx73NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr"> Where are you in relation to these four stations? I have the full assurance that I am in station four. God has been and still is working to transform sinners into sons of God. These sons of God are the members forming the Body of Christ to express Christ. As we have seen, God is in Christ, Christ is in His Body, and His Body is in the local churches. This is the basic concept and central thought of this book. If we do not see this, we are short-sighted. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaD_RwOjb3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4">TAKING CARE OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE<br/>AND WHAT WE ARE</h2><p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qly-MhnSDZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> In order to accomplish the task of making sons out of sinners to form the Body of Christ, God firstly had to take care of our past deeds. Do you still remember the things you did <span class="pg" data-page-id="395" id="395">[395]</span> before you were saved? If you were to ask me this question, I would say, “Please don’t remind me of this. What I did in the past was too dirty, evil, and ugly. I don’t want to talk about it.” If you think that your past deeds were not bad, let me ask if you have ever stolen anything. When people tell me how good they are, I check with them about stealing. None of us can boast of our past. Since God cannot accept us as His sons with such an evil history, He had to take care of it. </p>
<p data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoOpVs2JsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El"> God has dealt with not only what we have done, but also with what we are. Even after being saved, we are still not so good. We are all a problem to others. The wives are a problem to the husbands, and the husbands are a problem to the wives. The children are a problem to the parents, and the parents are a problem to the children. I am a problem to my neighbors, to my in-laws, and to my dear wife and children. Thank God that He takes care of what we are! </p>
<p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PVSgUTqjprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> Christ’s death on the cross deals with what we have done, and the resurrected Christ living in us deals with what we are. Through His death we have obtained righteousness, and we are therefore justified in the presence of God. By this, the problem of our past has been solved. Now Christ is living in us, working God’s holiness into our being to accomplish for us a subjective sanctification. His death brought the righteousness of God to us, but His dwelling in us works God’s holiness into our very being. In this way He takes care of what we are. By taking care of our past through His death and by taking care of what we are by His living in us, He is transforming sinners into God’s very sons. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ANzUA-iUjeJrXG0OumBBlKcYqeqVJQuX5wL_kKU5dq3C7vF1_YQpuJ09rnAq0MJO"> As wonderful as this is, it is still not the end of the process. At His coming, the Lord will glorify us. He will bring our mortal body into the glory of God, transfiguring our deadened body into a body of glory. At that time we shall be brought into full sonship. His death has gained the righteousness of God for us, His living is working the holiness of God into our being, and His coming back will bring us into the divine glory so that we may have the full sonship. <span class="pg" data-page-id="396" id="396">[396]</span> </p>

If we are in the flesh, we experience Adam, and if we are in the spirit, we experience Christ. The Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80158" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapter five</span> can be experienced only in the flesh in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80159" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span>, and the Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80160" data-verses="Romans 6:1">chapter six</span> can be experienced only in the spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80161" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span>. Without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80162" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span> we do not have the experience of being in Adam. A newborn child certainly is in Adam. But with that little child you do not see the experience of being in Adam. However, the older we are, the more we have the experience of being in the flesh. Whatever we have inherited in Adam is experienced by us in a practical way in the flesh. When we live in the flesh, we experience all the riches of Adam. Mothers, although you love your little baby, that infant is a great storehouse of the riches of Adam. If you do not believe this, I ask you to wait for twenty years. During these years, the stored-up riches of Adam will be gradually shown to you. Then you will say, “Brother Lee was right. Twenty years ago he said that this little one was a storehouse of the riches of Adam. At that time I did not believe him, but now, after twenty years of experience, I am convinced. All the riches of Adam were in fact stored in that little child.” What we have in Adam is experienced by being in the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="w_QXt_moIy43U-iBdBHKgUzaZmL7iM3CET_8qgPLZCAY5YjmkXjovKLmYef-__VX0"> In the same principle, the fact of being in Christ can be experienced only by being in the spirit. When we walk according to the spirit, we experience all the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are far greater than those of Adam. But to experience them we must walk according to the spirit. </p>

<p data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKawmRInI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx"> As we have seen, the focal point of the revelation in this book is that God is transforming sinners into sons to form the Body of Christ. God is expressed in the Son, the Son is expressed in the Body, and the Body is expressed in the local churches. Before we became sons, we were constituted sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80197" data-verses="Romans 5:19">5:19</span>), not only in name and in position, but in constitution. We were constituted sinners because sin had entered into us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcVc0A0CNNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r">SIN ENTERING INTO OUR BEING</h2><p data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1M5STC8RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM"> In order for a substance to be constituted in a certain way, a particular element must be added into it. By God’s creation, we were good, righteous men. However, due to the fall of Adam, sin was injected into our being. When man fell, he not only made a mistake and did something wrong. If man had only made a mistake, his fall would not have been that serious. However, in the fall something more serious than a mistake occurred: sin was injected into man’s being. </p>
<p data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCcDepqcNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi"> Suppose a mother has a bottle of poison at home. She keeps it in a specific place and tells her little boy never to touch that bottle. One day, while the mother is outside, the little boy, wondering what is in the bottle, takes it, opens it, and drinks some of the poison. When the mother finds out what happened, she is not concerned about the mistake her son has made. She is worried about the poison that has gotten into him. Most Christians think that man merely disobeyed God and made a mistake in taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Not many realize that by man’s eating <span class="pg" data-page-id="406" id="406">[406]</span> the fruit of the tree of knowledge, something evil and even satanic entered into man. Through the fall an evil, satanic element was injected into him. The Bible calls this element sin. Sin is not merely a matter of lying or stealing. Such things are the fruit of sin, not sin itself. Sin is the very nature of Satan, the evil one. </p>
<p data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_rLznbSet51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80198" data-verses="Romans 5:1-8">Romans 5 through 8</span> there are many indications that sin is like a living person: it entered (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80199" data-verses="Romans 5:12">5:12</span>), it reigns (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80200" data-verses="Romans 5:21">5:21</span>), it can lord it over us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80201" data-verses="Romans 6:14">6:14</span>), it deceives us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80202" data-verses="Romans 7:11">7:11</span>), it kills us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80203" data-verses="Romans 7:11">7:11</span>), and it dwells in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80204" data-verses="Romans 7:17">7:17</span>). Once sin, the evil element of Satan, was injected into man, man was constituted a sinner. Now instead of being proper men, we are sinners by our very constitution. The amount of good or evil we have done makes no difference because sin is now in our being. Although our deeds may not be sinful outwardly, we have a sinful nature inwardly. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE__kC6A1N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB">THE RESULTS OF SIN</h2><p data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGz452GeS_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv"> Sin results in a number of things. It has brought in both the flesh and the law. Hence, we have the problems of sin, the flesh, and the law. But we have still another problem, the ultimate issue of sin, which is death. Where there is sin, there is death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80205" data-verses="Romans 5:12">5:12</span> Paul says, “As through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned.” Death comes in through sin and reigns because of sin. Therefore, sin issues in three things: the law, the flesh, and death. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGdpyHgMDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO">FREED FROM SIN, THE LAW, AND THE FLESH</h2><p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvRj7gDW0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80206" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> reveals that we have been constituted sinners, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80207" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> reveals that “the body of sin” has been “made of none effect” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80208" data-verses="Romans 6:6">6:6</span>) since our old man has been crucified with Christ. Through the death of the old man, we are freed from sin. As we pointed out in a previous message, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80209" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> we are freed from sin, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80210" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> we are freed from the law, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80211" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> we are freed from the flesh. We are free from sin because our old man has been crucified. The death of the old man has caused the body of sin to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="407" id="407">[407]</span> unemployed, to be made of none effect. Because the body of sin has lost its job, we no longer need to serve sin as slaves. This means that we have been freed from sin. Likewise, we have been freed from the law because the old husband has died and has been given a funeral. At the time of this funeral, we were married to our new husband. By losing our old husband and marrying our new husband, we are freed from the law. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80212" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> reveals, we are freed from the flesh by walking according to the spirit. We are freed from sin by having our old man crucified and our body of sin made of none effect; we are freed from the law by burying our old husband and by marrying another; and we are freed from the flesh by walking according to the spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtX8Mj6CFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF">THE WORKING OF DEATH</h2><p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSIOX9VzskAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> But now we must face another problem, the problem of how we can be freed from death. If we would know this, we need to understand what death is. Everyone is under the reign of death and under its working. Within every living person is something which the Bible calls the working of death. Suppose a certain brother loves the Lord. One morning in his fellowship with the Lord he decides that from now on he will always honor and obey his parents, love his wife, and be kind to his children. This is the desire of his heart. He has also made up his mind never to lose his temper. However, soon afterward a difficult situation arises, and he loses his temper again. You may say that this is the result of the working of sin. I agree. But the effect of sin is death; it is death working in us. After being stung by death, we become so weak that no matter how hard we try to honor our parents or love our wives, we simply cannot do it. </p>
<p data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYEcEvYPOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80213" data-verses="Romans 7:7-8">7:7 and 8</span> Paul said, “I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet. But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, wrought in me coveting of every kind.” Covetousness is not an outward matter; it is an inward desire. One day a missionary in China was telling his cook that everyone was sinful. Arguing with him, the cook said that he was honest and never stole from others. <span class="pg" data-page-id="408" id="408">[408]</span> Upon further questioning, it came out that even while they were discussing sinfulness and honesty, the cook was thinking about the missionary’s horse and how he could get the horse. Then the missionary told him, “This is covetousness, and covetousness is sinful.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80214" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> Paul also uses covetousness as an illustration. How difficult for us to control covetousness! The more we try not to be covetous, the more covetous we are. The Apostle Paul was trying to be righteous, holy, and perfect. To some extent at least, he was successful. He kept himself from stealing, but he could not keep himself from covetousness. In fact, he learned that it was impossible for him to control his covetousness. Therefore, he cried out, “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80215" data-verses="Romans 7:24">7:24</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWalSANvAiavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na">“THIS DEATH”</h2><p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7OXm-HQUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> What did Paul mean by “this death”? He meant the death that, in the form of covetousness, was constantly killing him. In like manner, something within us is killing us every minute of the day. If we are loose or careless, we shall not realize this. But if we try to be upright, holy, spiritual, and perfect, we shall find that instead of being perfect, we are constantly being killed by death. To experience death, there is no need for us to wait until we are old and about to die physically. Even with physical death there is the matter of dying gradually. Every day we die a little more, even as we are living. The older we become, the more we die. Suppose you have seventy dollars. If you spend five dollars, you have sixty-five dollars left. If you spend sixty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents, you will have only a penny left. In like manner, we are spending our life span. Whether we are old or young, we are gradually dying. I am an old man with many grandchildren. When they tell me how old they are, I sometimes think, “You are not living. You are all dying.” </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxV1ixO9n3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv">DEATH ENTERING AND REIGNING</h2><p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkT2Mfxhm-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80229" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Romans 5:12</span> says, “Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned.” For sin to enter into the world means that it has entered into humanity. Through one man, Adam, sin entered into mankind. Furthermore, through sin death entered. Sin came first and death followed. Wherever there is sin, there is death. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVl6Ol-nbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80230" data-verses="Romans 5:17">Romans 5:17</span> says, “By the offense of the one, death reigned through the one.” Death has not only entered the world; it reigns.

If you do the work of sin, you will receive the wages of death. This means that death is the pay received for your work of sin. For example, you may lose your temper. This is a work of sin, and the payment for doing this work is death. When people work overtime, they receive higher wages. Likewise, if you sin a little, you receive little pay, but if you sin a great deal, you will receive extra pay. <span class="pg" data-page-id="416" id="416">[416]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKazmRZsI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx">SIN KILLING US THROUGH THE COMMANDMENT</h2><p data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcVf0ApKNNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80232" data-verses="Romans 7:11">7:11</span> Paul says, “For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.” According to this verse, sin does two things: it deceives us and it kills us. To kill something is to put it to death. Thus, to say that sin kills us means that sin puts us to death. This happens through the law, for sin takes occasion through the commandment. In a sense, sin takes advantage of the law to kill us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1M6STb1RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM"> Before you were saved or before you were stirred up in spirit to seek the Lord, you might have lost your temper frequently without being aware of any killing. The reason for this is that you had not made up your mind not to lose your temper any more. But after you were saved or were stirred up to seek the Lord, you prayed, “O Lord, I know that as one who is seeking You, I should not lose my temper. This damages my testimony for You among my family and friends. Therefore, I am making up my mind that from now on I will never lose my temper again.” In praying this way you make a strict law for yourself regarding losing your temper. This new law is your eleventh commandment. Moses gave ten commandments, but you make another commandment, the commandment about not losing your temper. However, when you lose your temper after making such a law, your temper kills you. It takes advantage of your self-made law to put you to death. If you lose your temper in the morning, you may be killed for the whole day. But when you lost your temper in the past, you did not sense the killing because you had not made a law about losing your temper. </p>
<p data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCcAepPSNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi"> This illustration shows that we need to be careful about making laws for ourselves. The more laws we make, the more we shall be killed. Remember, sin always takes advantage of the commandment to put us to death. </p>

Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” In this verse Paul speaks of “this death,” which is the very death <span class="pg" data-page-id="417" id="417">[417]</span> defined in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80234" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. It is important to know what is the death revealed and explained in this chapter. Whenever we make up our mind to keep the law, something in our flesh rises up, fights against the law of good in our mind, defeats us, captures us, and kills us. If we do not make up our mind to keep the commandments, this element in our flesh remains dormant. But whenever we make up our mind to do good in order to please God, this element is stirred up and seems to say, “What! Do you intend to do good to please God? Let me show you that you can’t do it. I’ll defeat you and kill you.” Thus, sin in the flesh rises up, defeats us, captures us, and slays us. This causes us to suffer what Paul calls “this death.” </p>
<p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK3pcmT8LzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80235" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> the problem is not hell or the Devil; it is “the body of this death.” We have a body which has in it an awful thing called “this death.” In order to exist, we need a body. Yet our body is no longer a pure body, but a terrible body, a body of this death. Whenever we decide to do good in order to please God, something in this body rises up to kill us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kfRg-WL5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl">THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH</h2><p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3bmpmG-WlY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80236" data-verses="Romans 7:24">7:24</span> we go on to the matter of the law of sin and of death in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80237" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span>. Although it is difficult to find terminology to express what this law is, it is easy to understand it according to experience. For example, it is easy to apply electricity in using household appliances, but it is difficult to define electricity. Instead of attempting to define the law of sin and death, we shall talk about it from the standpoint of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRL64B0VOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> None of us likes to lose our temper. We realize that it is very unbecoming to do so. But suppose you are stirred up to love the Lord and you make up your mind not to lose your temper again. One morning you pray about this and decide never again to lose your temper. Immediately afterward, your wife gives you a difficult time and makes you angry. Although you try to suppress your anger, eventually you lose your temper. It seems that the more you try to hold in your <span class="pg" data-page-id="418" id="418">[418]</span> temper, the stronger it is when it is released. You had no intention or desire to lose your temper, but you lost it anyway. This comes from the working of the law of sin within you. Suppressing your temper is like pressing down a rubber ball: the more you press it down, the higher it rises. This is a law. When sin works by the law, death follows immediately. As soon as you lose your temper, death comes in to kill you. Thus, by losing your temper you are killed by the law of death. Because the law of death has killed you, you cannot pray, fellowship, or testify. If you should try to do any of these things, you feel that you are hollow and empty and that your words are lifeless. This is the result of the working of the law of sin and of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPXMQgfI1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> Sin and death are two items, but they have just one law. The law of sin is the law of death, and the law of death is the law of sin. This is the reason that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80238" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span> speaks of the law of sin and of death. Sin works to bring in death, and death works to follow sin. These two always go together. Every sin, even a little weakness, brings in death. </p>

For example, to set your mind on worldly fashions or advertisements in the newspaper is to set it on things of the flesh. Likewise, to consider the weaknesses of your wife or husband is to set the mind on the flesh. The result of this is death. </p>

This proves that Satan is an actual person and that Hades is a definite place. Therefore, death must also be something concrete. Nevertheless, no one can adequately explain what death is. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbF5SeX-fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X">FOUR LAWS</h2><p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocDhryX6nWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> The matter of law is profound. Many Bible students have been troubled by Paul’s use of the word “law” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80273" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. This word firstly denotes the law of God, that is, the ten commandments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80274" data-verses="Romans 7:22">7:22</span>). Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80275" data-verses="Romans 7:23">7:23</span> Paul speaks of “the law of my mind,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80276" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span>, of “the law of sin and of death” and of the “law of the Spirit of life.” It is difficult to understand the words “law” and “life” and even more difficult to understand the term “the law of the Spirit of life.” Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80277" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapters seven and eight</span> the word “law” is used in different ways: for the law of God, for the law of the mind, for the law of sin and of death, and for the law of the Spirit of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwU8oY8fqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2">ANOTHER LAW</h2><p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZo2vy9wPm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80278" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span>, however, there is still another law: “I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80279" data-verses="Romans 7:21">v. 21</span>). Before we can know the law <span class="pg" data-page-id="428" id="428">[428]</span> covered in this verse, we need to understand the law of God, the law of the mind, the law of sin and death (which is the law of sin in our members), and the law of the Spirit of life. Learning these four laws is like learning the basic principles of mathematics. The law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80280" data-verses="Romans 7:21">verse 21</span> is neither the law of the mind nor the law of sin in our members. We may call it “the law that.” There is a law, a principle, that whenever we will to do good, the evil is present with us. The law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80281" data-verses="Romans 7:21">7:21</span> refers to this principle. </p>
<p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYK5m3doydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> Paul discovered the principle that whenever he tried to do good, evil was present with him. Have you ever realized that there is such a law? If we do not try to do good, it seems that evil is not present. But it is a law that whenever we try to do good, the evil is present. For example, if you do not try to be humble, pride will not seem to be present. But if you make up your mind to be humble, pride will be present with you. Likewise, if you do not make up your mind not to lose your temper, your temper is not present. But whenever you determine never to lose your temper again, your temper is present immediately. This is “the law that.” This law has no commandments, only the principle that whenever we will to do good, evil is present. </p>
<p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7OVm-HYUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> Not many Christians, including the seeking Christians, know that there is such a law. However, we all have been troubled by the fact that whenever we purpose to be patient, we fail. Instead of being patient, we become angry. In like manner, whenever we make up our mind to be humble, we end up being proud. Before we were saved or when we were not diligent in seeking the Lord, we seemed to be doing rather well. Later, we learned that we should be a new person. I was taught in this way. But the more I tried to live like a new person, the more the old person was present with me. Then I was taught to reckon myself dead, and I practiced this teaching. However, the more I reckoned myself dead, the more living I became. The more I tried to do good, the worse I was. </p>
<p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_rLzBhxsEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> I believe that we all have experienced this. When we were careless, we apparently were all right. But when we <span class="pg" data-page-id="429" id="429">[429]</span> desired to do good to please the Lord, it seemed that our behavior became worse. For example, a brother may say, “As a Christian who loves the Lord, I should not lose my temper with my wife or mistreat her. I will ask the Lord to help me in this matter.” However, shortly afterward, this brother loses his temper with his wife. </p>
<p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYp8U_QEOtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> I was bothered by matters like this for eight years, from 1925 until 1933. During those years, there were many times when I could not eat or sleep well because I was troubled about my Christian life. Some with this problem have even thought to stop being Christians and have said to themselves, “I don’t want to be a Christian any longer. I was told that if I became a Christian, I would be happy. But now I am troubled every day. I want to be humble, but instead I am proud.” Through this kind of experience I was exposed, unable to believe how evil I was. Through reading the Bible and through my experience in the Christian life, I have found that there is a law operating in human beings that when we try to do good, evil is present. When I discovered this law, I realized that I should not be so foolish as to keep on trying to do good. Trying to do good is like pushing the button that causes evil to be present. If you do not push the button, evil is not here. But if you push it, evil comes immediately, eager to work. It was in 1933 that I first stopped pushing this button. I found it difficult, however, to keep from pushing it, for I had been pushing it all my life. Although I know better than to push this button, I must confess that sometimes I push it even now. Probably you have pushed this button already today. Maybe we shall not stop this completely until we are raptured or until we are in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8cdisibvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> Perhaps you have read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80282" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> again and again without seeing this fifth law. In addition to the four laws, there is the law that operates whenever we will to do good. We need to ask the Lord to keep us from pushing this button, for whenever we push it, evil is present. If we try to be patient, we push the button, and we are angry instead. If we try to be humble, we push the button again, and we are <span class="pg" data-page-id="430" id="430">[430]</span> proud. Christians have often prayed that the Lord would help them to do good, to do such things as love their wives or submit to their husbands. But we need to pray that the Lord would keep us from trying to do these things. Regarding this, we need a revelation, a vision, that will keep us from pushing the button that causes evil to be present with us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3w_z89bgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ">THREE PERSONS AND THREE LIVES</h2><p data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJg7mKk-x0stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q"> Now we need to consider the law of good in our mind, the law of sin in our members, and the law of life in our spirit. In the garden of Eden there were two trees—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life. In these two trees we see good, evil, and life. With each of these there is a law: the law of good, the law of evil, and the law of life. We are a miniature garden of Eden because the triangular situation involving God, man, and Satan is now within us. Furthermore, the law of good, the law of evil, and the law of life are all in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HTbfrger0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> As far as persons are concerned, there are just three beings in the universe: the divine person, God; the evil person, Satan; and the human person, man. Each of these persons has a life. The divine person has the divine life, the human person has the human life, and the evil person has the evil life. Our human life does not come merely from our parents; it comes from God’s creation. Our human life was created when Adam was created, not when we were born of our parents. </p>

These words are life and death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80291" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> life is represented by the tree of life, and death, by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80292" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">v. 9</span>). The issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is actually death, not knowledge. Therefore, we may call these trees the tree of life and the tree of death. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvRu7gSf0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd">KNOWLEDGE, GOOD, AND EVIL</h2><p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtXxMjnMFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> The tree of death is very subtle. Although it brings forth death, it is not called the tree of death; instead, it is called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. There are three related things concerning this tree—knowledge, good, and evil. Although we all appreciate knowledge and good, we do not like evil. We consider good and evil to be in two distinct categories. The concept of good and evil in the Bible, however, is different; the Bible puts both good and evil in the same category. This indicates that we should be for life, not for good or evil. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80293" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, knowledge and good are put together with evil. Belonging to one family, they are three “sisters” who work together to bring forth death, which is, of course, the opposite of life. </p>

But most of the items found in Genesis are seeds of spiritual truths developed elsewhere in the Bible, and we should not neglect them. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80295" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we have the <span class="pg" data-page-id="438" id="438">[438]</span> seed of life and the seed of death. But at the end of the book of Revelation we see the consummation of these seeds. Death, the last enemy, is cast into the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80296" data-verses="Revelation 20:14">Rev. 20:14</span>). Life abounds in the New Jerusalem, for there we see the river of water of life with the tree of life growing in it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80297" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Rev. 22:1-2</span>). From center to circumference, the New Jerusalem is a city of life. The seed of life sown in the beginning of the Bible consummates in the harvest of life, and the seed of death consummates in the harvest of death. Because the seeds of life and of death grow throughout the Bible, we can trace in the Bible both the line of life and the line of death. In this message we shall consider these two lines as they appear in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80298" data-verses="Romans 5:1-8">Romans 5 through 8</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWalSNNvhvavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80299" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> there is a triangular situation involving God, man, and Satan. In this chapter man faces two sources: God as the source of life and Satan as the source of death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80300" data-verses="Romans 5:1-8">Romans 5 through 8</span> there is the continuation of this triangular situation. Eventually, this triangular situation will result in a twofold consummation. The negative things will, along with death, be swept into the lake of fire, but the positive things will, with those who have been redeemed, flow into the city of living water. Today we are all heading toward this ultimate consummation, the believers to the New Jerusalem and the unbelievers to the lake of fire. In their everyday experience many Christians have one foot on the line of life and the other on the line of death. Other Christians vacillate between the two. Perhaps yesterday you were on the line of death, but today, by the Lord’s mercy and grace, you are once again on the line of life. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80304" data-verses="Romans 5:17">verse 17</span> we find the line of life: “For if by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="439" id="439">[439]</span> offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80305" data-verses="Romans 5:21">verse 21</span> Paul declares, “As sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Sin has brought in death, but grace through righteousness brings in life. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80306" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapter five</span> we see both the reign of death and the reign of life with grace. </p>

The next verse says, “For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.” As we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, that is, in the baptism mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80308" data-verses="Romans 6:4">verse 4</span>, so we shall also grow together with Him in the likeness of His resurrection, that is, in the newness of life as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80309" data-verses="Romans 6:4">verse 4</span>. To grow together in the likeness of Christ’s resurrection is to be in newness of life. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80310" data-verses="Romans 6:11">verse 11</span> tells us to reckon ourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. These verses indicate that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80311" data-verses="Romans 6:1">chapter six</span> also there are both the line of life and the line of death. </p>

Here, instead of life, we find killing and death. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80313" data-verses="Romans 7:11">Verse 11</span> says, “For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.” Sin is a murderer that uses the law as its weapon to kill us. This should warn us not to turn to the law. If we do, sin will rise up as if to say, “How good that you have turned to the law! You have just given me an excellent opportunity to use the law to kill you.” As one who had been killed in this way, Paul cried out in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80314" data-verses="Romans 7:24">verse 24</span>, “Wretched man <span class="pg" data-page-id="440" id="440">[440]</span> that I am!

Furthermore, if the life-giving Spirit dwells in us, that is, makes His home in us, He will even impart the divine life into our mortal bodies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80320" data-verses="Romans 8:11">v. 11</span>). Therefore, not only our spirit and mind are life, but even our mortal bodies can be enlivened. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80321" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, all three parts of our being, our spirit, soul, and body, can receive life. Our spirit is life because Jesus Christ has entered into our spirit. Our mind can be life because the indwelling Christ is spreading from our spirit into our mind. Furthermore, this spreading of the divine life will even reach our mortal body and enliven it. Praise the Lord for the life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80322" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>! </p>
<p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomKXxmpu65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> As we have pointed out, in this chapter there is a fourfold life: life in the divine Spirit, life in our human spirit, life in our mind, and life in our mortal body. But although there is such a fourfold life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80323" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, death is still present. Not until we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80324" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">Revelation 20</span> will there be only life and no death. At that time, death, the last enemy, will be cast out of humanity and into the lake of fire. Therefore, in the New Jerusalem there will be only the element of life, not the element of death. However, within us today we have both the element of life and the element of death. </p>

These two trees represent two different sources with two opposite results. The tree of life brings us into life, and the tree of knowledge brings us into death. Furthermore, the Bible concludes with two consummations: the lake of fire, which is <span class="pg" data-page-id="448" id="448">[448]</span> the second death, and the New Jerusalem, which is the city of life. Therefore the Bible ends as it begins, with death and life. </p>
<p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6WykcHaRvTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80340" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> is on the way between the beginning in Genesis and the consummation in Revelation. Between the two sources and the two consummations there are two lines: the line of life and the line of death. As we pointed out in the last message, sometimes we may have one foot on the line of life and the other on the line of death. At other times we may be altogether on one line or the other. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80341" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> deals with these two lines from the aspect of our experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="D5w8-kFdQxmkmF1GzR6I2rrTuKPPWrkUq03mqLc30FIAV31DN5B-3O4zuykkIOmJX">THREE QUESTIONS CONCERNING<br/>ABIDING IN CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6WykcH7avTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80342" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> the Lord Jesus reveals that He is the vine and we are the branches. He also says that we need to abide in Him and that, if we do, He will abide in us. What a wonderful life this mutual abiding is! Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80343" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> tells us to abide in Christ, it does not present the way to abide. As we shall see, the way to abide in Christ is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80344" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, which is a progression from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80345" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="gTWF_O-VusFLsBnICnGUP1lDxHlcJrTjqrrJfkDlEYM2QChTjzMfb7iFBzHc2B8W3"> For more than fifty years, I have been considering how we can abide in Christ. Christ is far away in the third heaven, and we are on earth. How can we abide in Him? Years ago, the Bible teachers under whom I studied could not answer this question adequately. They could only tell me that we abide in Christ through the Holy Spirit. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80346" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> Christ does not say to abide in Him through the Spirit. As a young man who desired to know the Bible in a logical way, not according to superstition or tradition, I thought it was not logical to say that we abide in Christ through the Spirit. How can you abide in one person through another person? Thus, concerning the abiding in Christ, we first need to seek the answer to this question: Where is the Christ in whom we must abide? </p>
<p data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8yvbGTLwJuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo"> The second question is this: What is the “Me” spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80347" data-verses="John 15:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80348" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>? To answer we must know not only <em>who</em> Christ is but also <em>what</em> Christ is. If we would abide <span class="pg" data-page-id="449" id="449">[449]</span> in Christ as the vine, we must be able to answer this question. How can we abide in something if we do not know what we are to abide in? How can Christ be the One in whom we abide? We can understand the meaning of the words “Follow Me,” but it is not easy to understand the words “Abide in Me.” To follow the Lord means that He goes ahead of us and that we walk behind Him. But what does it mean to abide in Him? We can easily understand what it means to abide <em>with</em> Christ, but not what it means to abide <em>in</em> Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822F4r6ePdifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n"> The third question is this: How can we abide in Him? Even if we know where Christ is and what the “Me” is in whom we must abide, we still need to know how to remain in Him. The words “Abide in Me” certainly are mysterious and perplexing. Like many other sayings in the Gospel of John, these words are simple, but their meaning is profound. </p>
<p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmgg5QsqPO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> In order to answer all these questions we have raised regarding abiding in Christ, we need to come again to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80349" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. The divine revelation in the holy Word is progressive; therefore, to understand this matter of abiding in Christ we need to proceed from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80350" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80351" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. Suppose your father wrote you a long letter of many pages. In order to understand your father’s thought as revealed in the letter, you would need to read the whole letter, not just the first few pages. The thought in his letter would be revealed progressively. Likewise, as we go on from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80352" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80353" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, we see a progression in the matter of abiding in Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJBDMhaXV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM">CHRIST IN US</h2><p data-content-id="hoPGAKCjyReE3jTK36DX-QlIhbyuYQyTD22BFHBhVNAcZ4CopGqxWdODu-9xdw8R1"> Firstly, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80354" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> we find the answer to the question concerning where Christ is today. This chapter reveals that Christ is not only in the heavens but also in us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80355" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Verse 34</span> says that Christ is at the right hand of God, whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80356" data-verses="Romans 8:10">verse 10</span> reveals that Christ is in us. The very Christ who is seated in the third heaven is now living in us. How wonderful! Thus, through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80357" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, we know where Christ is. <span class="pg" data-page-id="450" id="450">[450]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417SIYJz81xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8">EXPERIENCING CHRIST<br/>AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLBj7_AloK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP"> Now we come to the question concerning the “Me” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80358" data-verses="John 15:5">John 15:5</span>. This involves the matter of what Christ is. Most Christians know Christ merely according to an objective doctrine of the Trinity. We definitely believe that God is triune. As the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, God is three-in-one. This is a heavenly, divine, spiritual mystery which no one can explain adequately. We do not even have a thorough understanding of ourselves, much less of the Triune God. In the Bible, the Triune God is not for us to analyze in a doctrinal way, but for the dispensing of Himself into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVeps6Ea4VW8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> The Gospel of John reveals that God the Father is embodied in God the Son and is made known through the Son. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80359" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span> says, “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” When Philip asked the Lord Jesus to show the disciples the Father, the Lord was apparently surprised at such a question, and He said to him, “Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80360" data-verses="John 14:9">John 14:9</span>). The Lord answered Philip in a mysterious way, telling him that as long as he had seen the Lord Himself, he had seen the Father. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80361" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span> the Lord went further: “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works.” Here we see that the Father is embodied in the Son and seen in the Son. </p>

We may know the term the life of Christ, and we may be familiar with the verses in the Gospel of John where the Lord says that He is life and that He has come that we might have life more abundantly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80399" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80400" data-verses="John 10:10">10:10</span>). Nevertheless, we must admit that we are short of the genuine experience of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hoPGAKCjyReE3jTK36DL3QlZsbyuYQyTD22BFHBhVNAcZ4CopGqxWdODu-9xdw8R1">THE PROGRESSIVE REVELATION OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417OBYJu-1xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8"> The divine revelation in the holy Word is progressive. Hence, although the Gospel of John is wonderful, it does not contain the ultimate revelation. After John and the Acts, we have the Epistles, which are a progression from the Gospels. The seeds sown in the Old Testament sprout in the Gospels, but they grow and develop further in the Epistles. The harvest of all the seeds, of course, is in the book of Revelation. The seed of life is sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80401" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, in the word regarding the tree of life. Life there refers neither to the physical life <em>(bios)</em> nor to the soulish or psychological life <em>(psuche)</em> but to the divine life, the life of God <em>(zoe).</em> If we had only the second chapter of Genesis, it would be difficult to understand what life is. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80402" data-verses="Psalms 36:9">Psalms 36:9</span> reveals more concerning life: “For with thee is the fountain of life.” This indicates that God, the Triune God, is the fountain of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80403" data-verses="John 1:1">Chapter one</span> of John reveals that life is in the Word, that is, in Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="460" id="460">[460]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80404" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80405" data-verses="John 1:4">4</span>). When the Lord Jesus came forth to minister, He said clearly that He is life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80406" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80407" data-verses="John 14:6">14:6</span>). According to the revelation of John’s Gospel, life is a living person, Christ, who is the very embodiment of God. Thus, the book of John is a book of life. Life sprouts in this Gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLdq7_ZmoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP"> We see the growth of the sprout in Romans. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80408" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> the Lord Jesus tells us to abide in Him. However, as we pointed out in the foregoing message, the way to abide in Christ is found not in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80409" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80410" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80411" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> reveals that Christ today is the Spirit of life. As the Spirit of life, He is in our spirit. Hence, the spirit in this chapter is the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit. In order to abide in Him, we need to set our mind, which represents our whole being, on the mingled spirit. The result is life and peace. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80412" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> is necessary in order to have the realization of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80413" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> in a practical way. To have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80414" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> without <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80415" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> is to have the sprout without the growth. </p>
<p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVepsmNa48c8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> In the same principle, many other wonderful aspects of life found in the Gospel of John are developed in the book of Romans. In John we have a vision of life; however, this Gospel does not give us the definite way to experience this life. For this, we need the book of Romans. In Romans life is unveiled in such a way that we can not only know life but also experience it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XIXjd-WP0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0">JUSTIFICATION AND LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomWfxmpm65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80416" data-verses="Romans 1:16">1:16</span> Paul says that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes. Then in the next verse he says, “For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith: as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.” God’s salvation is by justification out of faith. Although all Christians have heard this, most have missed the ultimate point in this chapter. This matter is not salvation nor justification nor faith. It is life. Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80417" data-verses="Romans 1:17">1:17</span> says that the just shall live by faith. This verse can also be translated, “The just shall have life by faith.” Therefore, the best way to grasp <span class="pg" data-page-id="461" id="461">[461]</span> the full meaning here is to say, “The just shall have life and live by faith.” </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVs_qh-B7xl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> God has saved us and justified us so that we may have life. Justification results in life. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80418" data-verses="Romans 5:18">5:18</span> Paul speaks of the “justification of life.” God’s justification of us in Christ is of life. Justification results in life. God’s purpose in justifying us is to enable us to enjoy His life. Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80419" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> did not need justification because at that time sin had not come in. Man lived in innocence before God. Because of Adam’s fall and his involvement with sin, the way to the tree of life was closed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80420" data-verses="Genesis 3:24">Gen. 3:24</span>) until the Lord Jesus died on the cross to fulfill God’s righteous requirements. Christ is our righteousness. When we believe in Him, He becomes righteousness to us, and we are justified by God. Through this justification we are brought back to the tree of life. Therefore, justification is of life, for life, and results in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2GTg-lUQ_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk"> Many Christians concentrate on the matter of justification but neglect the matter of life. Therefore, we need to emphasize one phrase in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80421" data-verses="Romans 5:18">5:18</span>—justification of life. The key word here is “life.” Justification is not an end in itself; justification is for life. Have you been justified by faith in Christ? If you have, then you should strongly proclaim that your justification is for life. The just shall have life and live by faith. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0Scu5AStDRsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx">SAVED IN HIS LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Tm4QfUZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80422" data-verses="Romans 5:10">5:10</span> Paul says that “while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.” The death of Christ is for redemption, justification, and reconciliation. But all this is for life. As Paul goes on to say in this verse, “Much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.” We have enjoyed the benefits of Christ’s death; now we need to enjoy His life. He who died on the cross for our sins is now living within us and for us as our life. Just as we participate in the death of Christ, so we also need to experience the life of Christ. The life of Christ is Christ Himself living within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbZ-SeGxfe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> This life saves us from all kinds of negative things. It <span class="pg" data-page-id="462" id="462">[462]</span> is not the life of Christ, however, that saves us from hell or from God’s judgment, because we have already been saved from these things through the death of Christ on the cross for our sins. Although we were sinful and destined to be eternally condemned by God, Christ’s death has solved this problem. Therefore, by the death of Christ we have been saved from hell and from the eternal judgment of God. This salvation has been accomplished once for all. Nevertheless, Paul says that “we shall be saved in His life,” indicating that we still need to experience the saving life of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocfmryK2nWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> From what are we saved? If we would answer this question fully and in detail, we would need to mention hundreds of items, including temper, disposition, self-pride, and jealousy. Everyone has a problem with temper or with the natural disposition or with self-pride or with jealousy. You may even feel jealous of someone who gives a good testimony in the meeting. How much we need to be saved in the life of Christ! Although we need to be saved from hundreds of items, in the book of Romans the Apostle Paul deals with just a number of major things from which we need to be saved, including sin, worldliness, naturalness, individualism, and divisiveness. </p>

The first chapters cover redemption, the middle portion covers life, and the last part deals with the building, which is the issue of redemption and life. In the foregoing message we saw that after being saved, justified, and reconciled to God, we still need to be saved in Christ’s life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80435" data-verses="Romans 5:10">5:10</span>). Redemption, justification, and reconciliation have been accomplished by the death of Christ on the cross. Through Christ’s death, the problems between us and God on the negative side have been solved. But God’s purpose on the positive side must still be fulfilled. God’s purpose is not merely to save us from hell or from His judgment; His purpose in the universe is to build up the Body as the corporate expression of His Son. For this reason, the book of Romans does not stop with redemption or justification, but proceeds onward to reach the goal of God’s eternal purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ANzUA-iUjeJrXG0OumdElKNXqeqVJQuX5wL_kKU5dq3C7vF1_YQpuJ09rnAq0MJO"> The unique way God uses to fulfill His purpose is life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80436" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapter five</span> the matter of life is introduced in an experiential way. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80437" data-verses="Romans 5:10">5:10</span> Paul says, “For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.” Notice the tense here: we <em>shall</em> be saved in His life. After reconciliation, there is still the need for us to be saved in life. Although we have been saved already, we still need to be saved. On the one hand, we have been saved from hell and from the judgment of God. This was accomplished once for all through the death of Christ on the cross. But, on the other hand, we still need to be saved from so many present problems. Many Christians are waiting to go to heaven. However, if they were suddenly transported to heaven, upon arriving <span class="pg" data-page-id="468" id="468">[468]</span> there they might feel that they are not suitable for the glory of heaven. Heaven is glorious, but in many respects we still are so low. Are you pleased with the way you are today? Are you satisfied with yourself? I am glad that I am still in the process of Christ’s ongoing salvation. I need to be saved because I am still too much in my natural life. Although I do not want to be in the natural man and earnestly endeavor to be free from my natural man, I must confess that I am still natural. Therefore, I need to be saved daily and even hourly in the life of Christ from my natural man. </p>

In the Gospel of John the Lord said definitely and emphatically, “I am...the life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80439" data-verses="John 14:6">14:6</span>). Therefore, to be saved in His life is actually to be saved in the Person of Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="w_QXt_moIy43U-iBdBHWlUz_bmL7iM3CET_8qgPLZCAY5YjmkXjovKLmYef-__VX0"> The salvation of Noah and his family in the ark is a type of our being saved in Christ. Noah and his family were saved not <em>by</em> the ark but <em>in</em> the ark. Today, as believers in Christ, we are in Him as today’s ark. Christ is our life, and we are in Him. In Him we are being saved. As long as we are in Him, we are in the process of being saved in His life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKG0mR4nI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx"> We have seen that we are saved in Christ’s life from the law of sin. The law of sin works in us spontaneously and automatically. There is no need for us to strive in order to tell lies or to lose our temper. The telling of lies and the losing of temper are an automatic product of the spontaneous working of the law of sin. Nevertheless, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus frees us from the law of sin and of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80440" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span>). As long as we are in Christ as life, we are spontaneously freed by the law of His life from the law of sin and of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417OAYJz01xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8"> We are also saved in Christ’s life from worldliness. This means that in His life we are sanctified, separated from the world. We all were born into a worldly situation and were then trained to be worldly. The tendency to be worldly is in our nature. Therefore, we need to be in the divine life in <span class="pg" data-page-id="469" id="469">[469]</span> order to be delivered from worldliness. This divine life separates us from worldliness and sanctifies us both positionally and dispositionally. We cannot be saved from worldliness by following certain religious instructions or regulations such as those found among certain religious groups. At most, adherence to such rules can produce only an outward, positional sanctification. The sanctification spoken of in Romans, however, is not merely positional; it is also dispositional, an inward matter that affects the depths of our being. In the life of Christ we are being sanctified inwardly. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLdr7_AtoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP">A METABOLIC CHANGE</h2><p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVepsmMa4ZU8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> Along with being saved from sin and from worldliness, we need to be saved in life from naturalness. This means that we need to be transformed. We need not only an outward change, but also an inward change. This inward change is called transformation. Transformation involves a metabolic change in our being. A new element, a divine, holy, heavenly element, must be added to our natural element to produce a metabolic, organic change. The result of such a change is transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XIXid-3G0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0"> Suppose a person with a pale complexion puts makeup on his face in order to improve his color. Such a change is outward; it is definitely not the result of inward transformation. God’s way is different. Firstly, He washes away our sins in order to fulfill His righteous requirements. Then, in transforming us, He is not primarily concerned with our outward appearance, but with what we are organically. To continue the illustration of makeup, the best way to improve our facial color is not to put on makeup but to eat nourishing food. This food will cause an organic change that will eventually improve our color. This change is transformation. By inward transformation our outward appearance will change. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvM4fAXk173NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr">TRANSFORMED FOR THE BUILDING UP<br/>OF THE BODY</h2><p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaf6RwOnb3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> This organic transformation has very much to do with the building up of the Body. Although we have been reconciled to <span class="pg" data-page-id="470" id="470">[470]</span> God through the death of Christ, we still are very natural. In the church life we have believers of many different nationalities: Americans, Chinese, Mexicans, Japanese, Filipinos, British, French, Germans, Koreans, Ghanians. However, if we remain in our natural status, we cannot be the Body of Christ. How can the Chinese be built up with the Japanese, or the Westerners with the Easterners? Nevertheless, in the Body of Christ we must be one and be built up together. For this, we need to be transformed. </p>
<p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qlyiJhnSHZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> By nature, we all are either male or female. However, even this natural distinction causes problems in the church life. A brother who uplifts his male status will cause problems to the sisters in the church life. Therefore, even with respect to being male and female, we need to be transformed for the building up of the Body. If we remain in our natural life, we simply cannot be built up with others. If we are natural, the brothers cannot be built up with the sisters, nor the sisters with the brothers. Furthermore, if the sisters are not transformed, they cannot be built up with one another. In our natural status, whether male or female, we are not capable of being built up as the Body. Again we see that we need to be transformed, to be saved in the life of Christ from our naturalness. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_3MznzSet51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7">SAVED IN LIFE FROM INDIVIDUALISM</h1><p data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-necKePkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80442" data-verses="Romans 5:10">Romans 5:10</span> is a key verse, for it concludes one section and opens another. This verse covers both the reconciling death of Christ and the saving life of Christ. Reconciliation includes redemption and justification. Christ died on the cross for our redemption; through redemption we have been justified by God and reconciled to Him. Now there is nothing between us and God. However, we still have a number of subjective problems. For this reason, even after we have been reconciled to God, we still need to be saved in Christ’s life. Because reconciliation through the death of Christ is an accomplished fact, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80443" data-verses="Romans 5:10">5:10</span> Paul used the past tense with respect to reconciliation. But because we are still in the process of being saved in life, Paul used the future tense when speaking about being saved in the life of Christ. In this message we shall consider the matter of being saved in life from individualism. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK31YmTtGzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6">SEVEN NEGATIVE THINGS</h2><p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kDVg-LJ5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> In the book of Romans Paul dealt with seven negative things from which we need to be saved. As we have seen, the first item is the law of sin. Within our flesh, our fallen body, the law of sin works spontaneously and automatically. This law of sin is the power of evil that operates spontaneously within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3b6tmGnVlY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> The second negative item is worldliness. We were born into a worldly environment and then raised to be worldly. Worldliness is in our very being; hence, it also is a subjective matter, a matter of our constitution. There is no need to teach a child to love the world, for there is something in his <span class="pg" data-page-id="476" id="476">[476]</span> nature that causes him to love it. The love of the world is an element of our fallen constitution. </p>
<p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRX-4BdfOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> The third item is naturalness. We all have a natural life and a natural disposition. Our very constitution is natural. All these natural elements are enemies to God. God has nothing to do with our natural being, our natural life, our natural strength, our natural disposition, or our natural power. These natural elements are deep within our being, much deeper than the law of sin. The law of sin is related mainly to our flesh, but our natural being is our self. For the sake of God’s purpose, we need to be saved in the life of Christ from our naturalness. </p>
<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPLIQgyD1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> We also need to be saved from our individualism, that is, from being individualistic. Because we all have the tendency to be individualistic, none of us naturally like to be one with others. Our married life exposes how individualistic we are. Because we are individualistic, a wife does not like to be dependent on her husband, and a husband does not like to be dependent on his wife. God’s intention is not to have a group of individualistic believers. On the contrary, it is to build up the Body for the fulfillment of His purpose. In order for this purpose to be carried out, we need to be saved from individualism. </p>
<p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZ0zvyY6Pm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> The life of Christ also saves us from divisiveness. Although we talk a great deal about oneness, we actually do not like to be one. To be one is to be restricted, bound, and eventually put to death. Where is the oneness in today’s Christianity? Throughout the centuries, there has been a shortage of oneness among Christians. Instead of oneness, there has been division upon division. All divisions come from the element of divisiveness in our fallen nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYW8m38jydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> The sixth negative item from which we need to be saved is self-likeness. By self-likeness we mean the appearance and expression of the natural self. We need to be saved from self-likeness by being conformed to the image of the Son of God. In so many respects we do not yet have the likeness of Christ. Instead, we bear the likeness of the self. Therefore, <span class="pg" data-page-id="477" id="477">[477]</span> we need to be saved in life from self-likeness and conformed to the likeness of the glorious Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52xyiYAce2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> Finally, we need to be saved from our natural body. Eventually, in God’s full salvation, our body will be glorified. The day is coming when our physical body will be transfigured. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q9pAv6AoIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI">JUSTIFICATION, LIFE, AND BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_jjC6AxN_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> As a complete sketch of the Christian life and the church life, the book of Romans firstly reveals the matter of justification. Because justification issues in life, the section after the section on justification deals with life. Life leads to the building, which is covered in the last part of Romans. Therefore, the book of Romans may be summarized in three words: justification, life, and building. </p>
<p data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGzk-2GeW_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv"> Neither justification nor life is God’s goal. God’s goal is the building up of the church as the Body for Christ’s expression and as the house for God’s dwelling. For this reason, the book of Romans begins with justification, goes on to life, and concludes with the building. As those who have been saved, redeemed, justified, and reconciled, we are not idly waiting for the Lord to come back. We are being built up in the church life for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Beginning with justification, we must go on to the experience of life in order to reach the goal of the building. Unless we experience life and have the building, the Lord Jesus does not have a way to come back. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGBuyHgIDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO">THE GREATEST HINDRANCE<br/>TO THE BUILDING</h2><p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvNk7gDS0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> Do you realize that we ourselves are the greatest hindrance to the building? This is the reason Paul does not speak of the Body until <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80444" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, after he has covered redemption, justification, sanctification, and transformation. The building up of the Body comes after all this. Justification is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80445" data-verses="Romans 1:1">chapters one through four</span>; sanctification, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80446" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapters five through eight</span>; and transformation, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80447" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. Then, beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80448" data-verses="Romans 12:4">12:4</span>, Paul begins to deal with the building up of the Body. Those who are still <span class="pg" data-page-id="478" id="478">[478]</span> worldly or natural cannot be built up with others. In order to be built up together, we need to be justified, sanctified, and transformed. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtL7Mj6OFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> We all have problems with our mind, emotion, and will. If we remain in our natural mind, emotion, and will, we cannot be one. The peculiar thoughts, concepts, and imaginations we have in our minds keep us from being built up together. Our emotion is even more difficult to control, and our stubborn will causes many difficulties. Due to these problems, the church has not yet been built up, although it has been in existence for more than nineteen hundred years. </p>
<p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSISQ9VzgkAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> The Lord Jesus has not come back because He does not yet have the building. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80449" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span> indicates that the Lord will come back for the Bride, a corporate entity. Eventually, the Lord will have the building and Bride. If we do not cooperate with Him in this matter, He will find others who will cooperate with Him. Through my many years of experience in the church life, I know the difficulties, even the human impossibility, in having the building up of the Body. Nevertheless, I have the full assurance that the Lord is able to get the building. One day, the Lord will have the building He desires. I believe that many of us are willing to allow the Lord to complete His work of building the church. Our burden is not to do a great deal of work; it is to see the genuine building up of the saints for the Lord’s coming back. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYYbEvUJOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm">OPENING TO THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWalOHNvMkavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na"> In order to afford the Lord the opportunity to have the building, we should not try to do anything. Instead, we should simply open to the Lord and say, “Lord, we realize that in ourselves we are hopeless. Our mind, emotion, and will are great problems. But, Lord, we believe that You are able. You call things not being as being. Therefore, we open ourselves to You, and we are willing to go along with You. Lord, by Your mercy, we lay ourselves on Your altar. Do whatever You desire with us. Do whatever is necessary to deal with our mind, emotion, and will.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="479" id="479">[479]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7SQm-LaUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx">DEALING WITH THE MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL</h2><p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_3OzBtzsEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> Our married life tests how much we have been built up. Are you truly one with your husband or wife? In our married life, we have the opportunity to learn what it means to be built up in the church life. A number of times the Lord has pointed out to me that if I cannot be built up with my wife, I cannot expect to be built up with others. In order to be built up with our husband or wife, or with others in the church, our mind, emotion, and will must be dealt with. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeFZx0zzjT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-">SAVED IN LIFE FROM DIVISIVENESS</h1><p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomWcxm8s65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80451" data-verses="Romans 5:10">Romans 5:10</span> speaks of both the death of Christ and the life of Christ. Although we have already been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God through the death of Christ, we still need to be saved in His life from many negative things. These negative things are not objective; they are subjective and are related to our inner being. In the foregoing messages we have covered four of the negative things from which we are saved in the life of Christ: the law of sin, which is the spontaneous power of sin in our flesh; worldliness, which includes everything worldly and common; naturalness, which includes our natural life, natural strength, natural wisdom, and natural disposition; and individualism, the attitude and practice of being individualistic. In this message we shall consider the fifth item—divisiveness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVs_ph-Qwxl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA">THE ELEMENT OF DIVISIVENESS</h2><p data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2GTj-lJY_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk"> In our natural makeup there is an element of divisiveness. Before we were saved, we probably did not realize that such an element existed within our being, that in our natural life there is the tendency to be divisive. Divisiveness is worse than naturalness or individualism. If someone is individualistic, he prefers to be left alone. He does not want others to bother him or to interfere with him. He simply wants to be whatever he is. But to be divisive is to cause division in an active way. In contrast to those who are individualistic, the divisive ones are aggressive to form parties. They contact the saints with the aim of dividing them. They may even travel from place to place with the intention of causing division. </p>
<p data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0Scu5DStaYsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80452" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> says that the law of the Spirit of life sets us <span class="pg" data-page-id="484" id="484">[484]</span> free from the law of sin, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80453" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> tells us that the life of Christ is sanctifying us dispositionally. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80454" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> we are told that we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80455" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> also says that we are one Body and members of one another. To be transformed is to be saved from naturalness, and to be built up into the Body is to be saved from individualism. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80456" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span> we have transformation and building, but when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80457" data-verses="Romans 14:1">chapters fourteen and fifteen</span>, we see that Christ’s life can save us from divisiveness. In these chapters the Apostle Paul deals with our divisive nature. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Tl4Q6aZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4">RECEIVING THE SAINTS</h2><p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbZ9Sen-fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80458" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span> Paul covers the matter of receiving the saints. We need to be willing to receive all Christians. Even in the first century there were different kinds of Christians. Some ate only vegetables, and others ate all things. Some observed certain days above others, and others regarded every day the same. If you had lived at the time of the Apostle Paul, would you have been able to receive all these types of Christians? We need to receive all those who have the faith in Christ. If a person believes that Jesus is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, that He died on the cross for our sins, that He was resurrected physically and spiritually, and that He is now on the right hand of God, then we must receive him. In fact, we should have the attitude that we have already received him. </p>
<p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PJVgUTujprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> However, the problem is that Christians who eat only vegetables may not receive those who eat everything and that those who eat everything may not receive those who eat only vegetables. Likewise, those who regard every day the same may not receive those who observe certain special days, and those who observe certain days may not receive those who regard every day the same. Nevertheless, as long as someone believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, we need to receive him, no matter what he eats or whether he observes certain days. <span class="pg" data-page-id="485" id="485">[485]</span> </p>

However, we have different understandings or interpretations of many things in the Bible. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80459" data-verses="Romans 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> Paul deals with two of these differences, eating and the observing of days. To eat something is to take it into us so that it becomes part of us, and to observe a day is to follow an outward ritual or regulation. The differences among today’s Christians are related mainly to the things they take in and to the outward rituals and regulations they observe. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80460" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">Colossians 2:16 and 17</span>, the regulations in the Bible regarding outward observances are types and shadows of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80461" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">Colossians 2:16</span> Paul says, “Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days.” Here we see the two categories mentioned previously, eating and the outward observances. In the next verse Paul points out that all these “are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.” If I stand in the light, a shadow in the shape of my body will be cast behind me. My body is the reality of my shadow. In like manner, the matters of eating and drinking and of keeping certain days are shadows, but the body, the reality of these shadows, is Christ. </p>

They were not to eat anything that was unclean. However, most of God’s people did not realize that these dietary regulations were related to Christ. All the clean things in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80462" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span> signify various aspects of Christ. Christ is unsearchably rich and has innumerable aspects. Such a rich Christ requires thousands of items to typify Him. All the items suitable for God’s people to eat, as recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80463" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span>, are types of different aspects of Christ. Furthermore, the things God forbade His people to eat are types of things other than Christ. Anything of Christ is good for us to eat, but anything that is not Christ is not good for our eating. This brings us back to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80464" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, <span class="pg" data-page-id="486" id="486">[486]</span> where we see that the tree of life is good for food but that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is not. God’s concern, however, is not our physical eating; it is Christ. God only cares for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKG2mRZoI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx"> Regarding the keeping of days, in the eyes of God every day is the same. But in order to portray Christ, God uses certain days as shadows. For example, the Sabbath day is a shadow of Christ as our rest and satisfaction. Because Christ is the completion, the perfection, of everything God has done, Christ is our satisfaction and rest. Thus, Christ is our Sabbath. Likewise, Christ is our new moon, our new beginning. All the days that God’s people in the Old Testament were commanded to observe were shadows of Christ. God, however, does not actually care for those days; He cares for Christ. Therefore, we should hold on to everything that is of Christ, but we should cast aside those things that are not of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcJa0ApONNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r"> According to natural law, our physical body should have one day of rest each week. By resting in this way we can work more effectively the other six days. However, it does not matter whether this day of rest is the seventh day or the first day of the week. If we apply this to Christ, we shall see that to Him every day is the same. This was Paul’s realization in his Epistles. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1Q_STbxRVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM">TAKING CARE OF WEAKER BELIEVERS</h2><p data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCAFepPeNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi"> Nevertheless, Paul knew that we need to take care of the weaker believers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80465" data-verses="Romans 14:1-2">Romans 14:1 and 2</span> he said, “Now him who is weak in faith receive, not with a view to passing judgment on reasonings. One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables.” Those who are strong must take care of the weaker ones. Although you may regard every day the same and believe that all things are good to eat, others who are weak in faith may observe certain days and eat only vegetables. On the one hand, we need to realize that so many physical things and special days are types and shadows of Christ. If we see this, we shall not be concerned about eating or the keeping of days. However, on <span class="pg" data-page-id="487" id="487">[487]</span> the other hand, many genuine Christians are not strong in their faith concerning these matters. We must remain open to all of them. Otherwise, we shall be divisive. </p>

<p data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q9pGv6RhIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI"> The key verse in the book of Romans is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80467" data-verses="Romans 5:10">5:10</span>; “For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.” Reconciliation to God through Christ has been accomplished already, but salvation in His life from so many negative things is still a daily matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_jlC6d_N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> The death of Christ on the cross has already dealt with all negative things. This is the reason we refer to Christ’s death as the all-inclusive death. Since Christ’s death has already dealt with the negative things, why do we still need to be saved in His life? We need such a salvation because we need to experience what Christ has accomplished for us. All that Christ has accomplished on the cross is an objective fact, but we need a subjective experience of this fact, an experience in life. Christ died on the cross as our substitute, but furthermore there is the need for us to be identified with Him in His death. The only way Christ’s accomplishment in substitution can be applied to us in experience is by our having Christ as our life. This is the identification that brings us into the reality of the fact. </p>
<p data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGzk42GHZ_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv"> In previous messages we have covered five items from which we need to be saved in Christ’s life: the law of sin, worldliness, naturalness, individualism, and divisiveness. In this message we shall cover the sixth item, which is self-likeness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGBoyHFEDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO">THE EXPRESSION OF THE SELF</h2><p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvNi7gif0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80468" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> the Lord Jesus spoke about denying the self immediately after He had said to Peter, “Get behind Me, <span class="pg" data-page-id="492" id="492">[492]</span> Satan!” Although Peter was speaking out of his love for the Lord, in the eyes of God Peter was Satan at that moment. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80469" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span>, Satan is the reality of the self. Self is the incarnation of Satan. As Christ is the embodiment and expression of God, so self is the embodiment and expression of Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtL9Mj6GFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> Every human being is a self. Not only were we born with the self and in the self, but we were born a self. As long as we are natural, we express the self. Whether we love others or hate them, what we express is the expression of self. A certain person may be very good, but he may be only good in a natural way. Although this one may be full of love, his love is natural. In essence, he is no different from someone who is full of hatred. In the eyes of God, someone who is naturally loving has the same essence as one who is naturally full of hatred. Do not think that your natural love expresses Christ and only your hatred does not. As long as you are natural and in the self, what you express is the self, not Christ. The expression of Christ comes only out of the life of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSISW9VzokAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> When we speak of being saved in the life of Christ from self-likeness, we mean being saved from the self. Self-likeness is the expression, the appearance, of the self. The expression of your self is your self-likeness. We need to be saved in the life of Christ from such a self-expression. When Christ died on the cross, He pronounced the sentence of judgment on the self, but this judgment still needs to be executed. Christ has judged the self objectively; we need to execute this judgment subjectively in our experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYYdEvYLOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm">CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE<br/>OF THE SON OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWalOBNvAmavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na"> To be saved from the self is to be conformed to the image of the Son of God. This means that to be saved from the self is to be made truly a son of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80470" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> speaks of children of God, sons of God, and heirs of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80471" data-verses="Romans 8:16">vv. 16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80472" data-verses="Romans 8:14">14</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80473" data-verses="Romans 8:17">17</span>). We are children in the initial stage, sons in a more advanced stage, and heirs in the stage of maturity. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80474" data-verses="Romans 8:14">Romans 8:14</span> says, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="493" id="493">[493]</span> Not until we have the leading of the Spirit of God can we be considered sons of God. Until then, we are simply children, those who can cry “Abba Father” and who have the witness of the Spirit with their spirit. In order to be an heir, we must be both matured and qualified. Our concern in this message is not with the children nor the heirs, but with the sons. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80475" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Romans 8:29</span> does not say that we shall be conformed to the image of the children of God or to the image of the heirs of God; it says that we shall be conformed to the image of the Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7SWm-HcUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> Through this process of conformation, the firstborn Son will have many brothers. As the Son of God, Christ was the unique, only begotten Son. Now through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ has become the firstborn Son, and the many sons, who are the brothers of Christ, are being conformed to His image. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80476" data-verses="Romans 1:3-4">Romans 1:3 and 4</span> say, “Concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, Who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.” In these verses Christ, the Son of God, is the prototype, whereas in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80477" data-verses="Romans 8:29">8:29</span> the many brothers are those who have been “mass-produced” from the prototype. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80478" data-verses="Romans 1:4">1:4</span> the one Son is designated, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80479" data-verses="Romans 8:29">8:29</span> the many sons are conformed. The designation of the one Son is related to the prototype; the conformation of the many sons is the work of “mass production.” Having gained the prototype, God is now seeking to have the “mass production” in order to produce many sons in the image of the Firstborn. </p>
<p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_3IzBh1sEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> Do you look like a son of God? Although you may look like a son of God in some respects, in most respects you probably do not. How much we need to be saved from the self in order to bear the appearance of God’s sons! In the church life we are in the process of becoming sons of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYpgX_QEKtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg">SANCTIFICATION, TRANSFORMATION,<br/>AND GLORIFICATION</h2><p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8AeisifvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> We have pointed out in some of the foregoing messages <span class="pg" data-page-id="494" id="494">[494]</span> that the central concept of the book of Romans is not justification by faith, but that God is making sons out of sinners in order to form the Body to express Christ. God’s goal is not justification; it is the Body. In the book of Romans there are sections on justification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80480" data-verses="Romans 3:21">3:21—5:11</span>), sanctification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80481" data-verses="Romans 5:12">5:12—8:13</span>), and glorification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80482" data-verses="Romans 8:14-39">8:14-39</span>). There is also a section on transformation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80483" data-verses="Romans 12:1">12:1—15:13</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80484" data-verses="Romans 8:30">Romans 8:30</span> says, “And whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.” In this verse Paul does not mention redemption or reconciliation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80485" data-verses="Romans 3:1">chapters three</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80486" data-verses="Romans 4:1">four</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80487" data-verses="Romans 5:1">five</span> he does speak of propitiation, redemption, justification, and reconciliation. Propitiation is for redemption, redemption is for justification, and justification issues in reconciliation. The reason Paul does not mention propitiation, redemption, or reconciliation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80488" data-verses="Romans 8:30">8:30</span> is that they are all included in justification. For this reason, there are not separate sections in this book for propitiation, redemption, nor reconciliation. All are covered in the section on justification. In the same principle, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80489" data-verses="Romans 8:30">8:30</span> Paul does not mention sanctification or transformation because both are included in glorification. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3s8z89XgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> In this verse Paul says that we have been predestinated and called by God. Before the foundation of the world, God, according to His divine foresight, marked us out. He predestinated us in eternity past. Then, in time, He called us. Thus, those whom He foreknew and predestinated, He called. When God called us, He justified us. Through God’s justification, our problems with Him have been solved. This does not mean, however, that justification marks the end of God’s dealing with us. After justification, we still need to be sanctified, transformed, and ultimately, glorified. Hence, sanctification and transformation are for glorification. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80490" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">Second Corinthians 3:18</span> says that we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory. This proves that transformation is for glorification. </p>

No one had vision that could penetrate through His flesh to see that He was the glorious Son of God. But after He had passed through the process of death and resurrection, He was designated the Son of God, that is, He was marked out and manifested to be the Son of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYpgW_QZGtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg">DESIGNATED ACCORDING TO<br/>THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS</h2><p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8Afis7SvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> This designation was according to the Spirit of holiness. The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast to the flesh in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80500" data-verses="Romans 1:3">verse 3</span>, which speaks of Christ as the seed of David according to the flesh. As the flesh in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80501" data-verses="Romans 1:3">verse 3</span> refers to the human essence of Christ, so the Spirit in this verse does not refer to the Person of the Holy Spirit of God, but to the divine essence of Christ, which is “the fulness of the Godhead” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80502" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80503" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span>), is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy. Therefore, in the flesh Christ was designated or marked out through resurrection according to this holy and divine essence. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3s9z8YVgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> Through His resurrection, Christ became the firstborn Son of God, full of the essence of God’s holiness, not only in His spirit, but also in His body. Before His death and resurrection the holiness of God was in Christ’s spirit, but this holy essence had not been manifested in His flesh. In other <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> words, it had not permeated His flesh. It was through death and resurrection that God’s holy essence saturated the physical body of the Lord Jesus. </p>

As we shall see, God causes all things to work together for our designation as sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_3Lzn6Zet51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7"> We have seen that Christ was designated the Son of God according to the divine essence of holiness through the process of death and resurrection. As saved ones, we have the Son of God in our spirit. At the very moment we were saved, He was sown into us. Once again, the Son of God is concealed in humanity, this time in our human life, in our humanity, in our flesh. There is no doubt that the Son of God as the divine essence of holiness is within every believer. But this holy essence is concealed and confined within our natural man. For this reason, God causes all things to work together for good on our behalf. In this way we are processed, that is, we are transformed metabolically. Our wife or husband, our children, and our environment are all the best for this processing. The Lord Jesus was processed through death and resurrection, and now we are being processed through the working together of all things. </p>
<p data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-nZcKLHkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc"> All things are working together to transform us metabolically. Christ as the organic seed, the organic essence, in our spirit must permeate and saturate our whole being. Eventually our humanity will be saturated with this divine essence. This saturation is sanctification and also a type of designation. An organic element is working within us to transform us by permeating and saturating us with the divine essence of holiness, which is actually the Son of God Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="501" id="501">[501]</span> </p>

The concept of outward change is ethical and religious. The divine concept is not to correct us outwardly; it is to transform us inwardly and organically with Christ Himself as the holy essence. This process of spiritual metabolism involves permeation and saturation. Whether we realize it or not, a metabolic process is taking place within our being. For example, after we eat a meal, our stomach begins to work on the food organically to digest it so that it can then be assimilated. This takes place whether we sense it or not and whether we agree with it or not. In the same principle, we are all undergoing the process of God’s sanctification, whether we are conscious of it or not. The longer we stay in the church life and the more we stand one with the church, the more we are sanctified. Eventually, through this sanctifying process, we shall all be in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3b6qmG-alY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> There is no need to pray desperately that the Lord will transform you. Such a desperate prayer may help your spiritual digestion, but it does not actually affect the process of saturation. Simply stay in the church life, and eventually you will be transformed into precious stone. </p>

Because this holy essence is still concealed within our humanity, we need to pass through a process under God’s sovereign arrangement that will enable this essence to saturate our entire being. For the completion of this process, we need many things to work together for our good. In the church life we are helping to process one another. You all are part of the process to me, and I am part of the process to you. In order to be processed, we need one another. Apart from the Lord’s mercy and grace, it would be difficult for us to bear one another. Praise the Lord that together we are processing one another in order to be designated sons of God! </p>
<p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkTqPfx4l-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> When I met a certain brother many years ago, he was quite kind and loving in a natural way. Some years later, I noticed that a real change had taken place within him. Today, after many years of being processed, this brother is not only a kind man, but a permeated and saturated man. Such a change has taken place in this brother through his being processed in the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJV55OlXtbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> None of us can stay in the church life and remain the same, for in the church we are undergoing the process of sanctification, transformation, and designation. We are being transformed and conformed to the image of the Son of God, not according to teachings, regulations, or forms, but according to the Spirit of holiness. This divine essence, which is the very Son of God Himself, is working within us organically to transform us by permeating and saturating our whole being. </p>

Now we proceed to the matter of reigning in life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8yzUGTa5JuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo">GRACE REIGNING UNTO ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822Fkk6eSTifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80518" data-verses="Romans 5:17">Romans 5:17</span> says, “For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.” This is the only verse in the Bible that speaks of reigning in life. Going along with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80519" data-verses="Romans 5:17">verse 17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80520" data-verses="Romans 5:21">verse 21</span> says, “That as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Perhaps you have heard that grace abounds, but probably you have not had the concept of grace reigning. But grace is a king reigning over all things. Although in the text <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80521" data-verses="Romans 5:21">verse 21</span> comes after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80522" data-verses="Romans 5:17">verse 17</span>, in experience it comes before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80523" data-verses="Romans 5:17">verse 17</span>. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80524" data-verses="Romans 5:21">verse 21</span>, grace reigns unto eternal life, which means that the reign of grace results in eternal life. It is in this eternal life that we shall reign. </p>
<p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmg82QszAO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> Although there are many Christian books on victory and overcoming, I do not know of any books on reigning in life. A number of books have been written about reigning with Christ in the millennial kingdom. However, reigning in life should not be a matter only for the future. This should be our experience today. I am not content with promises about being a king in the future; I desire to reign in life as a king today. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80525" data-verses="Romans 5:17">5:17</span> Paul does not refer to the millennial kingdom. <span class="pg" data-page-id="506" id="506">[506]</span> If you consider this verse in its context, you will realize that Paul is speaking about our present daily life. Praise the Lord that even today we can be kings in life! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJdMMh_bV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM">A CONTINUATION OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p data-content-id="hoPGAKCjyReE3jTK36DLxQlpsbyuYQyTD22BFHBhVNAcZ4CopGqxWdODu-9xdw8R1"> Before we explore further the matter of reigning in life, we need to consider the relationship between the Gospel of John and the book of Romans. Romans is a continuation of John. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80526" data-verses="John 1:4">John 1:4</span> says, “In Him was life,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80527" data-verses="John 1:14">verse 14</span> of the same chapter says, “The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80528" data-verses="John 1:16">Verse 16</span> continues, “For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.” Hence, in the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80529" data-verses="John 1:1">first chapter of the Gospel of John</span>, we have life and grace. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80530" data-verses="John 10:10">John 10:10</span> the Lord Jesus says, “I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80531" data-verses="John 8:1">John 8</span> speaks of certain negative things, such as sin and death. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80532" data-verses="John 8:24">Verse 24</span> says, “Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins.” This means that those who do not believe in the Lord Jesus will remain in death. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80533" data-verses="John 8:34">verse 34</span> the Lord has a word about being slaves of sin: “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80534" data-verses="John 8:36">verse 36</span> the Lord speaks about being set free: “If then the Son shall set you free, you shall be really free.” Those under the bondage of sin and in death can be set free by the living Son of God, the One who is the living reality. Therefore, in the Gospel of John we have life, grace, abundance of life, sin, death, slavery, and being set free from sin and death. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3s-z89fgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> All these matters are also found in Romans, where the truth concerning them is developed further. Although both John and Romans cover many of the same subjects and even use a number of the same terms, the Gospel of John does not speak of grace reigning, nor of reigning in life. The use of the word “reign” in Romans with respect to grace and life shows a significant development over what is covered in the Gospel of John. Although the Gospel of John is rich and deep and although it speaks of the abundance of life, it says nothing about the reign of grace nor about the reign of life. Because Paul was one reigning in grace and in life, he could speak <span class="pg" data-page-id="507" id="507">[507]</span> of such things in Romans. In contrast to many Christians today, Paul was not waiting for the millennium in order to reign with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJgnnKk-10stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80535" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> we are told that grace reigns and that those who receive abundance of grace can reign in life. Because grace reigns unto life eternal, we also can reign in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HPafrgar0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> To reign is to be a king; it is to subdue something and rule over it. To reign also means to have a dominion or a kingdom. Our Christian life today should be not only a victorious and overcoming life; it should also be a kingly life, a reigning life. Day by day we can be kings. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EKStomoiB0TVgGaB81D2toARJCkQefxo1786oQtaQs3phAEmsIsEHfDkTPzIJOxrQ">RULING OVER THE THREE MAJOR ENEMIES</h2><p data-content-id="D5w8-kFdQxmkmF1GzR6U5rrTqKPPWrkUq03mqLc30FIAV31DN5B-3O4zuykkIOmJX"> As kings reigning in life, we must subdue the enemies and rule over them. Do not regard your wife or husband as an enemy over whom you must rule. According to both the Gospel of John and the book of Romans, our major enemies are sin, death, and Satan. Not even your temper is one of the primary enemies. If sin, death, and Satan are defeated, your temper will also be defeated and even become something of comeliness. Sin is what makes your temper so distasteful. In the same principle, the reason the self is so ugly is that sin, death, and Satan make their abode within us. If these things were subdued, even our self would be beautiful. Therefore, we have just three major enemies—sin, death, and Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6WurcH7evTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> Paul deals with these enemies in the book of Romans. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80536" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span>, which speaks of the law of sin and death, we see two of the enemies, sin and death. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80537" data-verses="Romans 16:20">16:20</span> Paul refers to Satan: “Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.” Do not expect to be a king over your wife or husband. Husbands, the Lord has appointed you to be the head with respect to your wife, but not to be a king ruling over her. Parents should not be kings over their children. But we are to reign as kings over sin, death, and Satan. With respect to the members of our family and to the brothers and sisters in the church, we are servants. But with respect to sin, death, and Satan, we are kings. <span class="pg" data-page-id="508" id="508">[508]</span> </p>

Grace is God Himself given to us in Christ and dispensed into our spirit to be our portion. If we have a thorough understanding of the Bible, we shall realize that God has no intention to give us anything other than Himself. All things other than God are vanity. Solomon, the wise king, said, “Vanity of vanities; all is vanity” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80538" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 1:2">Eccl. 1:2</span>). In the words of the Apostle Paul, all things apart from Christ are dung (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80539" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">Phil. 3:8</span>). Our unique portion is God Himself, and grace is God as our portion for our participation, experience, and enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822Fkk6ePRifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n"> If we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80540" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80541" data-verses="John 1:14">1:14</span> in context, we shall see that grace is God coming to us to be dispensed into us for our enjoyment. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80542" data-verses="John 1:16">John 1:16</span> says, “For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80543" data-verses="Romans 5:17">Romans 5:17</span> Paul speaks of receiving not only grace, but the abundance of grace. Because grace is living and growing, it abounds. This abounding grace also reigns. Grace is not a lifeless element; it is a living Person, even God Himself. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmg82QsqDO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB">TWO KINGS</h2><p data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJdMMhWRV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80544" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> both sin and grace are personified. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80545" data-verses="Romans 5:21">verse 21</span> indicates, either sin or grace may reign, grace positively or sin negatively. Sin is the embodiment of the evil nature of Satan in our flesh, and grace is God in Christ embodied in our spirit. Therefore, we have two kings—sin and grace—within us. In our flesh we have the king of sin, and in our spirit we have the king of grace. Within us a warfare is raging between these two kings. </p>

This means that God intends that man enjoy Him as life and reign in this life. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80552" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, man is to reign over the earth and especially over the creeping things, over the serpent in particular. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80553" data-verses="Genesis 1:28">Genesis 1:28</span> says that God commissioned man to subdue the earth, to conquer it. To conquer something involves defeating an enemy and seizing his possessions. By defeating the enemy and taking his possessions, we reign over him. Therefore, in the beginning, God intended man to be a king in His life over Satan, the creeping one. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaf8Rwfob3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4">GRACE AND SIN</h2><p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qlyiPhnPLZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> Satan once was God’s unique enemy. At a certain point, this enemy injected himself as sin into man in an illegal and evil way. When Satan injected his evil nature into man, Satan became sin. Sin is something originated by Satan. It is actually Satan himself injected into man and incarnated in man. </p>
<p data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoSqVsvAsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El"> It is helpful to see the difference between sin and evil, both of which are mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80554" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80555" data-verses="Romans 7:20">7:20</span> Paul says, “But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.” In our flesh something called sin is dwelling. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80556" data-verses="Romans 7:21">verse 21</span> Paul says, “I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80557" data-verses="Romans 7:20">verse 20</span> Paul speaks of sin, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80558" data-verses="Romans 7:21">verse 21</span>, of evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PJRgU2kjprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> To understand the difference between sin and evil, we need to see that before the creation of man God had a unique <span class="pg" data-page-id="512" id="512">[512]</span> enemy, Satan, the Devil. Then God created man. At the time of creation, man was pure, clean, and innocent. Then Satan injected himself into man and became sin in man. As we have pointed out, sin is Satan incarnated in man. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ANzUA-iUjeJrXG0OumdClK9XqeqVJQuX5wL_kKU5dq3C7vF1_YQpuJ09rnAq0MJO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80559" data-verses="Romans 5:21">Romans 5:21</span> speaks of sin, grace, death, and life: “That as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” According to this verse, sin reigns in death and grace reigns unto eternal life. Here we see a vivid contrast between the reigning of sin and the reigning of grace. There is also a contrast here between death and life. Just as sin is Satan incarnated, so grace is God incarnated. This is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80560" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, which says that the Word, which is God, became flesh, full of grace and reality. Hence, grace is God incarnated in us. Grace is God coming into man. If God remains outside of man, there is no grace. Although other divine attributes exist apart from God’s coming into man, there is no grace apart from God’s being incarnated in man. When God and man come together in the way of mingling, there is grace. Although it is difficult to find a verse in the Bible which speaks of grace apart from the relationship between God and man, there are many verses in the Bible that show that grace is a matter of God’s relationship with man. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxVpjxOgt3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> In the same principle, when Satan is separate from man, there is no sin. But once Satan comes into us, there is sin in us. Therefore, sin is Satan related to man subjectively. How precious is this understanding of grace and sin! </p>

When sin lies dormant within us, it is merely sin. But whenever we make up our mind to do good by keeping the law in order to please God, sin is aroused and becomes evil. Evil is sin acting within us. Whenever the indwelling sin becomes active, sin becomes the evil that is present with us. Sin is the indwelling one, but evil is the present, active one. Sin is Satan dwelling in us, but evil is Satan acting in us. Therefore, both sin and <span class="pg" data-page-id="513" id="513">[513]</span> evil are Satan himself. Dwelling in us, Satan is sin, and acting in us, Satan is evil. Satan, sin, and evil denote one thing in three stages. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80562" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>, the one who has the power of death is the Devil. These two verses indicate that sin and death are related to Satan. Satan, sin, and death are God’s three enemies. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80563" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:26">First Corinthians 15:26</span> speaks of death being the last enemy.

If we are not in life, then we are surely in death. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80566" data-verses="Romans 8:6">Romans 8:6</span> also proves that we can be in death today: “For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.” </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Th4QfYZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4">THE WORK OF GOD’S ENEMY</h2><p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbZ5SeG9fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> In the book of Romans we cannot find that God has any other enemies in addition to Satan, sin, and death. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80574" data-verses="Romans 16:20">Romans 16:20</span> says, “Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.” After speaking of Satan being crushed under our feet by the God of peace, Paul immediately says, in the very same verse, “The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.” When Satan is crushed, grace is with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocfhryGwnWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> In a sense, God’s enemy, Satan, is prevailing today as sin and as evil to bring people into death and to keep them there. This is the evil work of God’s enemy. Satan is not content merely to provoke us in such matters as losing our temper. His intention is to bring us into death. But God is working as life to defeat sin, death, and Satan. The result of God’s defeating these three enemies is that we reign in life. </p>

As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80576" data-verses="Romans 5:17">verse 17</span> points out, we who receive an abundance of grace shall reign in life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80577" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Chapters six through sixteen</span> define for us the meaning of reigning in life. To reign in life is to walk in newness of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80578" data-verses="Romans 6:4">6:4</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80579" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span> we see a picture of one troubled by sin and evil and a captive in death. This one cries in desperation, “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80580" data-verses="Romans 7:24">v. 24</span>). But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80581" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> this one is set free from the law of sin and death by the law of the Spirit of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80582" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span> there is warfare, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80583" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> there is both victory and reigning. Even in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80584" data-verses="Romans 6:14">6:14</span> we are told that sin should not lord it over us, for we are not under law but under grace. Because we are under grace, sin should no longer reign as a king over us. Sin should not lord it over us now that God has come into us as grace. <span class="pg" data-page-id="515" id="515">[515]</span> </p>

In this message we shall consider the matter of reigning in life over death. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1Q0STK8RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM"> Before we do this, however, let us review the difference between sin and evil and that between grace and the Spirit. Sin is the nature of Satan injected into man, and evil is sin in action. When Satan injects himself into man, that is sin. But when sin is present and active in us, that is evil. In the same principle, grace is God coming into man and being embodied in man. But when grace is present and active, it becomes the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCAOepScNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi">THE PRESENT WORKING OF DEATH</h2><p data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_3GznjSet51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7"> The Bible reveals that death comes from sin. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80589" data-verses="Romans 6:23">6:23</span> says, “The wages of sin is death.” This means that death is the result of sin. It is possible that our understanding of death may merely be doctrinal. When I was young, I was taught that there were two deaths: man’s physical death and the lake of fire, which is the second death. I did not regard death as something in which I was subjectively involved daily. Gradually, however, I discovered that in the Bible a number of verses indicate that death is presently working in us. Death is like a worm that is constantly eating us. Sin ruins us, but it does not eat us. Death is the “worm” that is devouring us day by day. </p>
<p data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-nUcKuPkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc"> Death has a number of aspects, the present aspect and the future aspect, the subjective aspect and the objective aspect. After the millennium, all the unbelieving dead will be raised and will stand before the white throne to be judged <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80590" data-verses="Revelation 20:12">Rev. 20:12</span>). Those whose names are not found in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80591" data-verses="Revelation 20:15">Rev. 20:15</span>). Our burden in this message is not with this future, objective aspect of death; it is with the present, subjective aspect. At this very moment, the element of death is within our being, endeavoring to kill us. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK31SmTdGzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80592" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapters five through eight</span> of Romans the subject of death is covered in a full way. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80593" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> we see that death entered the world through sin and then passed to all men. Furthermore, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80594" data-verses="Romans 5:14">verse 14</span> makes clear, death also reigns. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80595" data-verses="Romans 6:21">6:21</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80596" data-verses="Romans 6:23">23</span> Paul says that the end of the things of which we now are ashamed is death and that death is the wages of sin. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80597" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> is a chapter not only on law, but also on death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80598" data-verses="Romans 7:10-11">verses 10 and 11</span> Paul declares, “And the commandment which was unto life, this was found to me to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80599" data-verses="Romans 7:13">verse 13</span> Paul says that sin works “death to me through that which is good.” Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80600" data-verses="Romans 7:24">verse 24</span> he cried out, “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” The death that Paul is speaking about in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80601" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span> is not the death coming in the future; it is the death working within us right now. </p>
<p data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822Fkq6ePZifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n"> Paul’s situation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80602" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> was very different from David’s in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80603" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psalm 51</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80604" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psalm 51</span> is a psalm of repentance that followed a particular act of sinning. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80605" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>, however, Paul was not repenting because he had sinned. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80606" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> is concerned not with repentance, but with death, with the continual working of death within him. Repentance was of great help to David in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80607" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psalm 51</span>, but it would have been no help to Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80608" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. It could not have delivered him from the death in his mortal body. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmg84QsqLO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB">THE STING OF DEATH</h2><p data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJdCMhaTV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80609" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:55-56">1 Corinthians 15:55 and 56</span> Paul says, “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.” Death is likened to a scorpion, and sin is likened to the scorpion’s sting. <span class="pg" data-page-id="521" id="521">[521]</span> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80610" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>, the one who has the power of death is the Devil. Once we are stung by the “scorpion” of death, the Devil exercises his power to kill us. Thus, Satan has the power of death, and sin is the sting of death. Whenever we are stung by sin, the poison of death gets into us. The result is spiritual killing, spiritual death. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hoPGAKCjyReE3jTK36DL_QlIlbyuYQyTD22BFHBhVNAcZ4CopGqxWdODu-9xdw8R1">A CONTRAST</h2><p data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417OJYJzw1xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8"> At this point it may be helpful to see a sharp contrast between the negative side and the positive side. Satan is opposed to God. When Satan injects himself into man, the nature of Satan in man becomes sin. On the contrary, God wrought into man becomes grace. Hence, sin is opposed to grace. When sin is present and active within us, it becomes evil. But when grace is present and active, it becomes the Spirit. The result of the activity of evil is death, whereas the result of the activity of the Spirit is life. Therefore, Satan, sin, evil, and death are opposed to God, grace, Spirit, and life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLdi7_ApoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP">THE SPIRIT AND THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVepsmFa4ZQ8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80611" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span>, putting the Spirit and life together, speaks of the Spirit of life. In the same principle, we may speak of “the evil of death.” Life is God living in us. The very God who lives in us is the Spirit. When God is far from us as the source, He is the Father. But when this very God comes to live in us in a practical way, He is the Spirit. However, if the Spirit is merely in us but does not work within us, we shall not experience life. As believers, we all know that the Spirit is within us. However, not many of us have a rich experience of the divine life. Hence, although we have the Spirit, we still may be short of life. The reason for this is that the Spirit who dwells in us does not have much opportunity to live in us. We have the Spirit within us, but we may not care for Him adequately. Sometimes we are so fully occupied with our jobs that we have no time for anything else. In like manner, we may be so occupied in our being that we have no time nor heart for the Spirit. It seems that we have hardly <span class="pg" data-page-id="522" id="522">[522]</span> any capacity to give ground to the indwelling Spirit. It seems that we say to the Spirit, “I realize that You are very dear to me, but I simply don’t have the heart for You.” </p>
<p data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XIXrd-3C0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0"> Many Christians hold the mistaken concept that if they neglect the Spirit, the Spirit will depart from them. According to the Bible, however, the Spirit will never leave us once He has come into us. The Spirit does not regard Himself as a guest within us, but as the Dweller, as the Owner of the dwelling. </p>
<p data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvM4WAXk573NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr"> Many years ago I read a book in which pictures were used to signify the work of the Spirit. A dove, representing the Spirit, was pictured as coming into people when they believed in the Lord and flying away when they sinned. Because many seeking Chinese Christians received something from this book, we spent a great deal of time to refute the incorrect teaching that the Spirit will leave a believer if he sins. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80612" data-verses="Ephesians 4:30">Ephesians 4:30</span> says, “Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.” The Spirit may be grieved within us, but He will never leave us. The Spirit remains in us, but He may not be given the opportunity to live in us as He desires. Hence, we have the Spirit, but we may not have life in our experience. </p>

In this message we shall consider the matter of reigning in life over Satan. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkTqDfxpm-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4">SATAN, SIN, AND THE FLESH</h2><p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJV51OlGnbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> Satan is the source of sin. As we have pointed out a number of times, sin is the nature of Satan injected into man. According to the revelation of the Bible, Satan as sin is in our flesh, in our fallen, contaminated body. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80615" data-verses="Romans 7:18">Romans 7:18</span> says, “For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, nothing good dwells.” When God created man, He created him with a body that was pure. But when Satan injected himself as sin into man’s body, the body became corrupted. Hence, in the Bible man’s body is called the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeFTx0jzjT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> In our flesh we are one with Satan, for the flesh is Satan’s dwelling place in man. In the same principle, our spirit is the Lord’s dwelling place in us. A saved person is rather complicated because Satan as sin is in his flesh and the Lord as the life-giving Spirit is in his spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomWWxmMs65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> Satan, sin, and the flesh go together. When Satan injected his evil nature into man, Satan became sin in man. When the nature of sin was injected into man’s body, the body was transmuted into flesh. Hence, Satan, sin, and the flesh are mutually related within man. If we would overcome Satan and reign in life over him, we need to recognize that Satan as sin dwells in our flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVs_jh-gwxl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> Because Satan is the source of both sin and death, he is the greatest enemy of all. It is not sufficient to reign over sin and death without subduing Satan. We must also defeat the <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> source of sin and death. Then we shall truly be able to reign in life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Tv4QfQZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4">THE WAY TO OVERCOME SATAN</h2><p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbZ3SeG1fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> Now we must consider the way to overcome Satan. In her writings, Mrs. Jesse Penn-Lewis had a great deal to say about overcoming Satan. However, although I put her suggestions into practice, what she suggested did not work for me. What Mrs. Penn-Lewis wrote regarding this matter was correct, but I had no way to apply it. Since the time Mrs. Penn-Lewis wrote her best books, more than fifty years have gone by. By the Lord’s mercy and grace, the saints have gone on during these years to see two important matters related to spiritual warfare: the Body and life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocfvryKynWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu">A MATTER OF LIFE AND THE BODY</h2><p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwIyoYlWqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> In the early 1940s Brother Nee gave a number of messages in Shanghai on the subject of the Body. He told us that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter, but a Body matter. Satan is the enemy of the Body. Hence, in order to overcome him, we must stand with the Body. <em>The Spiritual Man,</em> completed in 1928, presented spiritual warfare as an individual matter, not as a Body matter. For this reason, after he had come to see the Body, Brother Nee told some of us that he did not want to have it reprinted. </p>
<p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZ04vyY-Pm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> We have not only seen the Body, but we have also seen the place of the divine life in dealing with God’s enemy. Life is nothing less than the Triune God dispensed into us to be our content. According to the book of Romans, life and the Body are one; they are inseparable. If there is no life, then there can be no Body. Life is the content, and the Body is the expression. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYW3m38nydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs">SATAN CRUSHED UNDER OUR FEET</h2><p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52xypYAca2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> In Romans Paul does not mention Satan by name until <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80616" data-verses="Romans 16:20">16:20</span>. In this verse Paul says, “Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.” The Greek word rendered “your” in this verse is plural; this points to the Body. God will <span class="pg" data-page-id="529" id="529">[529]</span> crush Satan under the feet of the Body. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80617" data-verses="Romans 16:1">Romans 16</span> does not refer to the Body in a universal sense, but it refers to the local and practical expression of the Body. This means that Satan can only be crushed under the feet of the practical expression of the Body in the local churches. If we speak about the Body in a doctrinal way, we have nothing but terminology. It is only when we have a proper local church as the practical expression of the Body that Satan is crushed under our feet. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q9pLv6AsIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI"> This practical expression of the Body is possible only through the divine life. We may have the experience of redemption and salvation, but if we do not experience the divine life, it is impossible to have the practical expression of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is built up with Christ as life. Satan is overcome by life and by the Body. </p>

In contrast to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80619" data-verses="1John 3:9">1 John 3:9</span>, which speaks of “whosoever,” or every one who is born of God, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80620" data-verses="1John 5:4">1 John 5:4</span> speaks of “whatsoever,” or every thing that is born of God. If we understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80621" data-verses="1John 5:4">1 John 5:4</span> in the light of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80622" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>, we shall realize that what is born of God is the human spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80623" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span> says, “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” Hence, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80624" data-verses="1John 5:4">1 John 5:4</span> refers to our regenerated spirit. It is the reborn spirit that does not sin, and it is the reborn spirit that overcomes the world. </p>

Who is the “he” that is begotten of God, and who is the “him” who is kept? This verse is saying that he who is born of God keeps me. There is something within me born of God that is keeping me. All believers have something within them that has been born of God. In the same principle, all of us have something evil within us born of Satan. After Adam fell, he became one <span class="pg" data-page-id="530" id="530">[530]</span> with Satan. But praise the Lord that we can now proclaim with confidence that we also have something within us born of God! </p>

We are protected. Our protection from the evil one is that part within us which is born of God. As we have pointed out, it is our human spirit that has been born of God, born of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, our regenerated spirit is our protection. </p>
<p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSISb9V_qkAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> Because we have the Son, we have life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80626" data-verses="1John 5:11-12">1 John 5:11-12</span>). Do you know where the Son of God is within you? He is in your spirit. Thus, your spirit is a place of protection, a high tower. The very life in which and with which we overcome Satan is now in our regenerated spirit. As long as we remain in our regenerated spirit, Satan, the evil one, cannot touch us. This is the way to overcome Satan. </p>

Whenever we are in the flesh, we have Satan as our companion. But when we are in the spirit, Christ is our companion. Satan as sin is in our flesh, but Christ as the Spirit is in our spirit. Therefore, we should choose to stay in our spirit with Christ. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbd-SeP-fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X">THE FLESH AND THE SPIRIT</h1><p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9Mwdocbmryf6nWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> In the foregoing messages we have seen that we need to reign in life over sin, death, and Satan, our three main enemies. As the gospel of God, the book of Romans deals with these three negative things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80630" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapters five through eight</span> sin and death are covered in a full way. Where there is sin, there is death, because sin brings in death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80631" data-verses="Romans 16:20">16:20</span> Paul speaks of Satan; he says that the God of peace will soon crush Satan under our feet. The reason Paul did not mention Satan by name before the end of the book is that dealing with Satan is a Body matter, not an individual matter. If you try on your own to subdue Satan, you will be defeated. Satan, the enemy of the Body, can be defeated only by the Body. Therefore, it is through the local churches as the practical expression of the Body of Christ that Satan is dealt with. Only after Paul has covered the church in a very practical way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80632" data-verses="Romans 15:1">chapters fifteen and sixteen</span>, does he speak of the crushing of Satan; he indicates thereby that Satan is crushed under the feet of local churches. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwM7oY0fqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2">SATAN, SIN, AND DEATH MEETING<br/>IN MAN’S FLESH</h2><p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZwxvyFwPm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> My burden in this message is to point out that the three main enemies—sin, death, and Satan—are centered in man’s flesh. Sin, death, and Satan meet together in the “meeting place” of our flesh. Sin, death, and Satan are always together. There is a place in our constitution where these three enemies can meet, and that place is the flesh. <span class="pg" data-page-id="534" id="534">[534]</span> From the time of man’s fall, they have been holding a continuous meeting in the flesh of man. </p>
<p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYS-m3loydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> Throughout my Christian life, nothing has troubled me more than the flesh. We should not condemn sin, death, and Satan without realizing that the very center of our problem is the flesh. We simply cannot get away from the flesh; we are unable to walk away from it in the way we can walk out of a building. The reason we cannot get away from the flesh is that it has become part of our being. A number of times I have said to the Lord, “Lord, You are wonderful, and You have done so much for us. Lord, why don’t You take the flesh away from us?” According to my economy, it would be much better for the flesh to be gone. </p>
<p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52x2gYA5W2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> Perhaps you are bothered by your temper. But the source of temper is the flesh. All our problems originate with the flesh. If it were not for the flesh, we would not have a troublesome temper. Therefore, we may want the Lord to get rid of our flesh. We may think that if the flesh were taken away, we would immediately become very spiritual. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q9tCv6hhIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI">OUR FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM</h2><p data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvM8eAXkx73NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr"> But the Lord’s way is not our way. Consider Adam’s situation in the garden before the fall. At that time, there was no flesh, for sin had not yet entered into Adam’s body to transmute it into the flesh. One day the Lord showed me that it would not be adequate to be like Adam in the garden without the problem of the flesh. I saw that my main problem was not with the flesh; it was with the shortage of the Spirit. Yes, in the garden of Eden Adam did not have the flesh, but neither did he have the Spirit of God in him. He was innocent, but he was also empty. This emptiness gave opportunity for the enemy to come in. If the Lord were to take away our flesh and leave us empty, we would not be able to keep ourselves pure very long. Satan, the subtle one, would eventually creep in. Therefore, we need to realize that our fundamental problem is the lack of the Spirit on the positive side, not the presence of the flesh on the negative side. <span class="pg" data-page-id="535" id="535">[535]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGab7RwOjb3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4">THE FLESH IN CHAPTERS SEVEN AND EIGHT</h2><p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qlymIhnSDZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> In Romans the flesh is exposed in a full way. Using the word “flesh” with a meaning different from that found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80633" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapters five through eight</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80634" data-verses="Romans 3:20">3:20</span> says, “By the works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him.” Here, “flesh” refers to a person, a human being. In the eyes of God every fallen person is flesh. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80635" data-verses="Romans 3:20">3:20</span> “flesh” denotes the totality of man’s fallen being. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80636" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>, on the contrary, “flesh” refers only to a part of man’s being, not to the whole person. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80637" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span> “flesh” denotes the sinful, wicked part of us, the part indwelt by sin. Our concern in this message is not with the flesh as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80638" data-verses="Romans 3:20">3:20</span>, but with the flesh as covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80639" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapters seven</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80640" data-verses="Romans 8:1">eight</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoWtVs2JsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80641" data-verses="Romans 7:18">Romans 7:18</span> says, “For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, nothing good dwells.” Our flesh is the place where evil things make their abode. No matter how good a person may seem to be, at least one part of him, the flesh, is evil. Do not be deceived by a person who is seemingly gentle, kind, honest, humble, and sympathetic. It is still true of him, as it is of everyone else, that in his flesh nothing good dwells. </p>
<p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PNWgUTqjprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> Throughout the years, I have learned that everyone regards himself as better than others. A husband may consider himself superior to his wife, and a wife may view herself as higher than her husband. Because of false humility, we may not say that we are better than others, but inwardly this is the way we often feel. But no matter how good we may be, we still have the flesh. Through the Lord’s mercy I have come to see His holy teaching that in my flesh there is nothing good. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6ANzUA-iUjeJrXG0OumZFlKcYqeqVJQuX5wL_kKU5dq3C7vF1_YQpuJ09rnAq0MJO">A SINFUL COMPOUND</h2><p data-content-id="RRUrZa0dvyz7r8k3lCUlc1IaLLT7GZHs7O9Lgyqlqhw7CeO8ACPd1Y2-5rrPSFRGa"> We need to emphasize that there is nothing good in the flesh in order to help seeking Christians who often become disappointed with their spiritual progress. The more they desire to be holy, the less holy they seem to become. They long to be one with the Lord, but end up doing many things that are not of the Lord. They also desire to overcome their besetting sin, but it seems that sin overcomes them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="536" id="536">[536]</span> Therefore, they become discouraged with their situation and disgusted with themselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="sTrENaXmH-QUV41dS8DI4-RY2afIOwXHPvMDWR4kxnQD3MSPXqGO1AtiIimI5PGDO"> It is necessary for Christians to seek the Lord, to aspire to be spiritual, and to overcome all negative things. Nevertheless, we are hindered and frustrated by a sinful compound: our flesh compounded with sin, death, and Satan. It is extremely difficult to deal with this evil compound. When sin, death, and Satan are added to the human body, the result is the flesh. This compound is not merely in us; it is part of our very being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="w_QXt_moIy43U-iBdBHSkUzaZmL7iM3CET_8qgPLZCAY5YjmkXjovKLmYef-__VX0">DESPERATE TO TURN TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKC1mRZkI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx"> Perhaps you are wondering, as I have in the past, why the Lord would not simply take this sinful compound away from us. The Lord is wise and knows what He is doing. Although the flesh is sinful and ugly, the Lord purposely refuses to take it away. The Lord does not leave the flesh with us in order to constantly disappoint us. He allows the flesh to remain so that we shall be compelled to seek Him for help. If it were not for the flesh, we would not be so desperate to call on the name of the Lord. If it were not for the problem of the flesh, I doubt that we would pray very much. </p>
<p data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcNZ0AlINNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r"> We all know that it is wrong to lose our temper with our husband or wife or with our children. However, if we love the Lord and seek Him, even losing our temper will work on our behalf, for it will force us to go to the Lord. After we lose our temper, we may feel ashamed for several hours, unwilling to pray because we are too ashamed to pray. Eventually, however, our intense desire for the Lord will compel us to pray, and we shall pray in a very good way. In this regard we are actually helped by the flesh. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvJn7gKf0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd">SERVING IN THE GOSPEL OF HIS SON</h1><p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtP4MjvMFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80644" data-verses="Romans 1:9">Romans 1:9</span> Paul says, “For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.” Many Christians think that the gospel is simply the good news of how Christ is the Savior who died that sinners may be forgiven and one day go to heaven. But the gospel is much richer and more profound than this. The gospel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80645" data-verses="Romans 1:9">1:9</span> includes the whole book of Romans. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSIWT9VijkAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m">THE GOSPEL IN ROMANS</h2><p data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYcYEvFDOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm"> In the very first verse of Romans Paul says that as a slave of Christ and a called apostle, he was “separated to the gospel of God.” This indicates that Paul’s intention in this book is to write concerning the gospel; the gospel is the theme of this Epistle. The entire book unfolds the gospel, the glad tidings of God, in its fullest way. </p>
<p data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWalKENvZvavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na"> In Romans Paul mentions the gospel much more than he does in any of his other Epistles. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80646" data-verses="Romans 2:16">2:16</span> he says, “God shall judge the secrets of men according to my gospel by Jesus Christ.” According to the natural, religious concept, God will judge people according to the law. But here Paul says that God will judge them according to his gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7WTm-iSUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> The gospel is to be not only believed, but also obeyed. This is proved in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80647" data-verses="Romans 10:16">10:16</span>, where Paul says that “not all obeyed the gospel.” Those who do not obey the gospel may become enemies of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80648" data-verses="Romans 11:28">11:28</span>). It is our attitude toward the gospel that determines whether we are obedient or disobedient and whether or not we are enemies. </p>
<p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_zNzBA6sEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> The gospel that Paul proclaimed in Romans was to be preached not only to unbelievers, but also to the believers in the Lord. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80649" data-verses="Romans 1:15">1:15</span> Paul says, “So, as far as depends on me, I <span class="pg" data-page-id="542" id="542">[542]</span> am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.” Furthermore, Paul believed that God would establish the saints according to his gospel: “Now to Him Who is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80650" data-verses="Romans 16:25">16:25</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_ngC6A1N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80651" data-verses="Romans 15:16">Romans 15:16</span> says, “That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.” For Paul, the preaching of the gospel was a priestly ministry, a priestly service. As priests, we all must serve God in the gospel of His Son. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGzg92GeS_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv">PROMISED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGFtyHgMDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO"> Now we must ask a basic and fundamental question: What is the gospel? What Paul speaks regarding the gospel in the book of Romans is deep and profound. The word “gospel” means good news, or glad tidings. The gospel is news that gladdens those who hear it. It is good news from God, from the heavens. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80652" data-verses="Romans 1:2">1:2</span> Paul says that the gospel of God was “promised before through His prophets in the holy scriptures.” This indicates that if we would understand the content of the gospel as the good news, we must know the Old Testament. The Old Testament is not merely a record of creation and history. In it are revealed some crucial elements pertaining to the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvJn7gDW0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> The first of these elements is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80653" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>, where we are told that man was created in the image of God. The image of God is part of the content of the gospel. How marvelous that we men of clay can bear the image of God! What good news this is! Whose heart would not be gladdened by such good news? If we truly saw what it means to be in the image of God, we would praise the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtP4Mj6CFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> A second matter related to the gospel is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80654" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>. Here we see that the man created by God was placed in front of the tree of life. This indicates that not only do we have the image outwardly, but that we also may have the divine life inwardly. <span class="pg" data-page-id="543" id="543">[543]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSIWT9VzskAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80655" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> the serpent came in to seduce man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But this chapter also tells us good news. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80656" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Verse 15</span> says that the seed of the woman will crush the head of the serpent. Although the serpent has come in, this verse prophesies that the seed of the woman will come to deal with the serpent. </p>
<p data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYcYEvYPOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm"> A fourth element is found in the next chapter. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80657" data-verses="Genesis 4:4">Genesis 4:4</span> says that Abel “brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering.” This indicates that by the proper offerings we, the fallen sinners, are accepted by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWalKENvAiavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80658" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span> of Genesis there are more aspects of the content of the gospel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80659" data-verses="Genesis 1:9">Verse 9</span> says that the waters were gathered together into one place and that the dry land appeared. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80660" data-verses="Genesis 1:11">Verse 11</span> continues, “And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.” Many kinds of life—vegetable, animal, and even the human life—are related to this land, which typifies the all-inclusive Christ. This is part of God’s good news. </p>
<p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7WTm-HQUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80661" data-verses="Genesis 2:18">Genesis 2:18</span> the Lord said, “It is not good that the man should be alone.” Man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80662" data-verses="Genesis 2:18">Genesis 2:18</span> is a type of Christ. To say that it is not good for man to be alone means that it is not good for Christ to be alone. As the Bridegroom, Christ is longing for a bride, someone to match Him. The matter of God’s producing a bride for Christ is also an element of the gospel promised in the Old Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_zNzBh5sEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb">CONCERNING A WONDERFUL PERSON</h2><p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYpkS_QIMtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80663" data-verses="Romans 1:3">1:3</span> Paul says that the gospel is concerning God’s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. The main concern of the gospel is not forgiveness nor the winning of souls nor the saving of sinners for heaven; it is the very Person of Christ, the Son of God. The gospel is not a doctrine nor a teaching nor a religion. It is a wonderful Person. </p>
<p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8EbisuZvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> This wonderful Person has two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80664" data-verses="Romans 1:3">verse 3</span> Paul speaks of Christ as the Son. This indicates His divine nature. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="544" id="544">[544]</span> Paul also says in this verse that Christ “came out of the seed of David according to the flesh.” This points to His human nature. By incarnation, the Son of God became a man, a descendant of David according to the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3o5z8xdgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80665" data-verses="Romans 1:4">Verse 4</span> says that He was “designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.” The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast with the flesh in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80666" data-verses="Romans 1:3">verse 3</span>. As the flesh in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80667" data-verses="Romans 1:3">verse 3</span> refers to the human essence of Christ, so the Spirit in this verse refers not to the Person of the Holy Spirit of God, but to the divine essence of Christ, which is “the fullness of the Godhead” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80668" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80669" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span>), is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy. According to such a Spirit, Christ was designated, marked out, the Son of God in power out of the resurrection of the dead. By incarnation Christ, the Son of God, became a man in the flesh, but by resurrection, as a man in the flesh, He was designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJgjgKky30stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q"> The gospel is concerned with a wonderful Person who became flesh and was designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness. For Christ to be designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness is different from the fact that He was the Son of God in eternity. As the eternal Son of God, He did not have the human nature. But His being designated the Son of God in resurrection has much to do with His human nature. Jesus Christ, a man in the flesh, was designated the Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HLdfrscr0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> The central message of the book of Romans is that sinful, fleshly people are made sons of God and conformed to the image of the Son of God. In this way Christ becomes the Firstborn among many brothers. Thus, the central point of the gospel is not forgiveness of sins. It is the producing of the sons of God, many brothers of the Son of God. </p>

The central thought of Romans is not condemnation nor justification; it is not even sanctification nor glorification. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80682" data-verses="Romans 1:1">1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80683" data-verses="Romans 1:3">3</span> Paul says that he was separated unto the gospel of God concerning God’s Son. This indicates that the central concept of the gospel of God is related to the Son of God. God’s intention is to bring many sons into glory. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EKStomoiB0TVgGaB81DypoAAACkQefxo1786oQtaQs3phAEmsIsEHfDkTPzIJOxrQ">GOD’S DESIRE TO HAVE MANY SONS</h2><p data-content-id="D5w8-kFdQxmkmF1GzR6Q9rrOkKPPWrkUq03mqLc30FIAV31DN5B-3O4zuykkIOmJX"> According to the Bible, the spiritual significance of sonship is that a son is the expression of his father. God desires to have many sons because His intention is to have Himself expressed in a corporate way. He does not want simply an individual expression in the only begotten Son, but a Body expression, a corporate expression, in many sons. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80684" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span> says, “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” Although God’s expression in the only begotten Son is marvelous, God still desires an expression in many sons. His intention is to make the only begotten Son the Firstborn among many brothers. Before the resurrection of Christ, God had just one Son; that is, He had an individual expression. But by means of Christ’s resurrection, God now has a multitude of sons; that is, He has a corporate expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6WqvcHiRvTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> Many of us were taught that we were sinners, that God loved us, and that God sent His Son to die on the cross for our redemption. Furthermore, we were told that as Christians <span class="pg" data-page-id="550" id="550">[550]</span> we should live for the glory of God and seek to enjoy fellowship with Him. Then we were taught that we shall eventually be taken to heaven. Very few of us had heard about God’s goal to produce many sons for His corporate expression. For eternity, God will be expressed through a corporate Body of glorified sons. This is His intention. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gTWF_O-VusFLsBnICnGME1lm5HlcJrTjqrrJfkDlEYM2QChTjzMfb7iFBzHc2B8W3">CHRIST AS THE MODEL AND PATTERN</h2><p data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8y3QGTq5JuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo"> According to the book of Romans, the gospel of God is a gospel of sonship. The central aim of God’s gospel is to produce many sons conformed to His Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80685" data-verses="Romans 8:29">8:29</span>). His only begotten Son is a pattern, a model, for the producing of the many sons. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80686" data-verses="Romans 1:3-4">Romans 1:3 and 4</span> describe this model, whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80687" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> reveals the mass production. Eventually, the only begotten Son—the model—will become the Firstborn among many brothers—the mass production. </p>
<p data-content-id="w_QXt_moIy43U-iBdBHSmUzaRmL7iM3CET_8qgPLZCAY5YjmkXjovKLmYef-__VX0"> As the model, Christ has two natures: the nature according to the flesh and the nature according to the Spirit of holiness. “Holiness” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80688" data-verses="Romans 1:4">verse 4</span> refers to the essence, the substance, of God. Before His incarnation, Christ did not have humanity, the nature according to the flesh. Through incarnation He put on human nature. However, when He put on the human nature, He did not lose the divine nature. Thus, when He was on earth, He was a mystery. According to His outward appearance, He was altogether a human being. But many of the things He said and did were extraordinary, things which no ordinary human being could possibly say or do. For example, in the Gospel of John the Lord said that He was the life and that He was the truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80689" data-verses="John 14:6">14:6</span>). He also said, “I am the light” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80690" data-verses="John 8:12">8:12</span>), and, “I am the bread of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80691" data-verses="John 6:35">6:35</span>). Furthermore, He said that anyone who did not believe in Him could not have eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80692" data-verses="John 3:36">3:36</span>). No philosopher would dare make such a statement. Because Christ is both divine and human, people wondered about His identity when He was on earth. They knew His family, but they could not explain how He was able to do certain things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80693" data-verses="Matthew 13:54-56">Matt. 13:54-56</span>). The reason for their perplexity was that the Son of God had clothed Himself with humanity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="551" id="551">[551]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKC3mRZsI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx"> Those responsible for the crucifixion of Christ did not realize that crucifixion was the best way for Him to be designated, to be glorified. We may use a carnation seed to illustrate this point. If the seed is put to an end by being buried in the soil, it will eventually sprout, grow, and blossom. In the same principle, through death and resurrection Christ “blossomed” as the Son of God. Satan expected the crucifixion of Christ to mark His termination, but the Lord Jesus knew that this was actually the beginning, that it would lead to His designation according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection from the dead. Without death, there can be no resurrection. Hallelujah, in resurrection Christ was designated the Son of God in power! </p>
<p data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcNb0ApKNNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r"> As the designated Son of God, Christ still has two natures, both that of divinity and that of humanity. However, the humanity He has now is not the natural humanity, but the humanity uplifted in resurrection. Even His flesh has been designated the Son of God. Hence, He has been designated the Son of God with both divinity and humanity. As such a marvelous Person, He has become the model, the pattern, of all those who are being designated sons of God. A son of God must have both the divine nature and the resurrected, glorified, uplifted human nature. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1U-STb1RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM">THE TWO NATURES OF THE MANY SONS</h2><p data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCEEepPSNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi"> God does not intend that we lose our humanity. On the contrary, we shall bear our humanity for eternity. But our humanity in eternity will not be natural; it will be resurrected, glorified, and uplifted. This is proved by the contrast between the natural body and the spiritual body, the resurrection body, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80694" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:1">1 Corinthians 15</span>. Today our physical body is like a seed. But one day this “seed” will be resurrected and glorified. </p>
<p data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs_zMzn6det51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7"> How can we have divinity? We have it by being regenerated in our spirit by the Spirit of Christ. Through incarnation Christ put humanity upon Himself and thereafter had two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. Through His resurrection and through coming into us as the Spirit, <span class="pg" data-page-id="552" id="552">[552]</span> Christ has brought divinity into us. Therefore, we also have two natures, the human nature and the divine nature. By being born of the Spirit we have become partakers of the divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80695" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>). We can say, “Lord, just as You have two natures, so we have two natures also. You are divine and human, and we are human and divine. Hallelujah, we are the same as You! Lord, You have our nature, and we have Yours. You are both divine and human, and we are both human and divine. You are the Head of the Body, and we are the members of the Body. Lord, You are the Son of God, and we are sons of God also.” The Lord appreciates it when we speak to Him in this way. He enjoys it when we declare the fact that God no longer has just one Son, the only begotten Son, but many sons, Christ as the Firstborn and us as the many sons of God. Christ has already been designated the Son of God, but we are still in the process of designation. One day this process will be completed, and for eternity we shall be the same as Christ, God’s firstborn Son. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80696" data-verses="Romans 1:3-4">Romans 1:3 and 4</span> contain many key words. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80697" data-verses="Romans 1:3">Verse 3</span> has the phrase “according to the flesh,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80698" data-verses="Romans 1:4">verse 4</span>, the phrase “according to the Spirit.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80699" data-verses="Romans 8:4">8:4</span> Paul speaks about walking “according to spirit” and not “according to flesh.” This is one example of how the key words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80700" data-verses="Romans 1:4-5">1:3 and 4</span> are used again by Paul later in this book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-jecKLDkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc">DESIGNATED BY RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK3xYmT8LzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> An especially marvelous word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80701" data-verses="Romans 1:4">1:4</span> is “resurrection.” Christ was designated the Son of God “out of the resurrection of the dead.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80702" data-verses="Romans 6:5">6:5</span> Paul says that “we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.” Christ was designated by resurrection, and we shall be in the likeness of this resurrection. As we share Christ’s resurrection, we undergo the process of being designated the sons of God. We are designated, in fact, by resurrection. </p>

This indicates that we all should serve God in the gospel of Christ. In order to do this, however, we need to know what the gospel is. </p>
<p data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLZp7_RmoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP"> The gospel does not simply involve matters such as redemption, forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, cleansing, and regeneration. All these are aspects of God’s salvation. But God’s salvation has a goal, and that goal is sonship. This means that redemption, forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, cleansing, and regeneration are all for the fulfillment of God’s desire to have many sons to be His expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVepsiOa4Ec8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> God’s eternal intention is that He be expressed through a Body constituted of glorified sons. Originally, God had just one Son, His only begotten Son. But now that the resurrection of Jesus Christ has been accomplished, He has many sons. Through the death and resurrection of Christ, millions of sinners have been made sons of God. This is God’s eternal purpose. Hence, the book of Romans reveals that the goal of the gospel is sonship, the producing of the many sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XITgd-uP0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0"> The first four verses of Romans are extremely important. In the very first verse Paul says, “Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God.” The fact that Romans opens with a word about the gospel of God indicates that the gospel is the subject of this book. The gospel of God is not concerned with religion, doctrine, or forms; moreover, it is not concerned merely with redemption, forgiveness, or justification. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80711" data-verses="Romans 1:3">verse 3</span> makes clear, the gospel of God is concerned with God’s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. This indicates that the gospel is concerned with <span class="pg" data-page-id="558" id="558">[558]</span> sonship. God’s delight, desire, and pleasure are all related to His Son. It is His intention to produce many sons conformed to the pattern, the model, of the Firstborn. Through Him, in Him, and with Him many sons are being produced. Thus, the gospel of God is concerned with this producing of many sons conformed to the image of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvM8dAXB773NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr">CHRIST DESIGNATED THE SON OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGab4Rwvob3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> In His incarnation Christ came as the seed of David according to the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80712" data-verses="Romans 1:3">1:3</span>). In the Bible the word “flesh” is not a positive word. Nevertheless, the Gospel of John declares that the Word became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80713" data-verses="John 1:14">1:14</span>). The gospel of God concerns the Son of God who became flesh, who became the seed of a man according to the flesh. In Romans we see that this flesh has been designated the Son of God! </p>
<p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7WRm-HYUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> Through this designation the Christ who was already the Son of God before His incarnation became the Son of God in a new way. Before His incarnation, He was the Son of God only with divinity. But now, through His resurrection, He has been designated the Son of God both with divinity and in humanity. If Christ had never put on human nature, there would have been no need for Him to be designated the Son of God, for in His divinity He was already the Son of God, even from eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg_zPzBhxsEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80714" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. This indicates that Christ did not have the sinfulness of the flesh; He had only the likeness of the flesh of sin. In this respect, He was like the brass serpent lifted up on a pole in the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80715" data-verses="Numbers 21:8-9">Num. 21:8-9</span>). The brass serpent had the form of a serpent, but it did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent. In the same principle, Christ had the form, the appearance, the likeness, of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the sinful nature of the flesh of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYpkQ_QEOtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> Because Christ, the Son of God, had clothed Himself with the flesh, He needed His human nature to be designated the Son of God in power by resurrection. Death in Adam is terrible. The death of Christ, however, is wonderful. This is because His death terminated all the negative things and <span class="pg" data-page-id="559" id="559">[559]</span> opened the way for resurrection. Through resurrection Christ was transfigured and designated the Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8EZisibvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80716" data-verses="Psalms 2:7">Psalm 2:7</span> says, “Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.” Since Christ was already the Son of God, how could there have been the need for Him to be begotten as the Son of God? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80717" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>, which quotes from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80718" data-verses="Psalms 2:7">Psalm 2:7</span>, indicates that Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of His resurrection. But was He not the Son of God before that day? Certainly He was. Nevertheless, He still needed to be begotten by resurrection because He had put on humanity. As to His divinity, there was no need for Him to be begotten. But as to His humanity, there was the need for this. On the day of His resurrection, Christ’s flesh was uplifted and transfigured into a glorious substance. This is the begetting in power by resurrection. This begetting is also the designation. In this way, Jesus, the Man in the flesh, was begotten and designated the Son of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3o7z89bgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ">ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS</h2><p data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJgjiKk-x0stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80719" data-verses="Romans 1:4">Verse 4</span> says that this designation was according to the Spirit of holiness. The illustration of a carnation seed will help us understand the meaning of this. When a carnation seed is put into the soil, the seed dies. But this death prepares the way for resurrection. Eventually, the seed sprouts and grows into a mature plant that produces carnation flowers. When the carnation plant blossoms, it is designated. The carnation flower is the designation of the carnation seed. A carnation seed is designated, not by being labeled, but by being buried into the ground and by growing into a blossoming carnation plant. This indicates that the carnation seed is designated according to the life which is within it; that is, it is designated according to life. If I put a stone into some soil, nothing will happen because there is no life in the stone. But after a carnation seed is placed in the earth, it will be designated according to the life within it. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HLffrger0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> In the same principle, when Christ was resurrected from among the dead, He was designated in power by resurrection according to the Spirit of holiness that was in Him. Now <span class="pg" data-page-id="560" id="560">[560]</span> He is the Son of God in a way that is more wonderful than before, for now He has both the divine nature and the resurrected, transformed, uplifted, glorified, and designated human nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKStomoiB0TVgGaB81DyooARNCkQefxo1786oQtaQs3phAEmsIsEHfDkTPzIJOxrQ"> As the Son of God with both divinity and humanity, Christ is now the pattern and model for the mass production of the many sons of God. We have seen that God does not want just one Son, the only begotten Son; He desires many sons, all of whom are the mass production of the Firstborn. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80720" data-verses="Romans 1:1">chapter one</span> we have the pattern, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80721" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> we have the mass production. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80722" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Chapter eight</span> clearly reveals that the only begotten Son has become the Firstborn among many brothers. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="D5w8-kFdQxmkmF1GzR6Q8rrTmKPPWrkUq03mqLc30FIAV31DN5B-3O4zuykkIOmJX">HOW THE MANY SONS ARE BROUGHT INTO BEING</h2><p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6WqucH7SvTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> Now we need to consider how these many sons are brought into being. The key to understanding this is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80723" data-verses="Romans 1:3-4">1:3 and 4</span>. In these verses there are a number of crucial terms: according to flesh, according to the Spirit, the Spirit of holiness, power, resurrection, and Son of God. In a sense, the entire book of Romans is structured around these phrases. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80724" data-verses="Romans 1:3-4">Verses 3 and 4</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80725" data-verses="Romans 1:1">chapter one</span> actually summarize the whole book. The book of Romans is a record of sinners in the flesh becoming sons of God in power and by resurrection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80726" data-verses="Romans 3:20">3:20</span> we read that “by the works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him.” This indicates that the flesh, the fallen man, is hopeless. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80727" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Chapter seven</span> reveals how ugly and troublesome the flesh is. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80728" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Chapter eight</span> then describes the utter inability of the flesh to keep the law of God. Before we were saved, we were just flesh; we were hopeless, troublesome, and weak. But Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and in His crucifixion He brought this flesh to the cross and terminated it. </p>

This indicates that the gospel of God is a gospel of sonship. The goal of this gospel is to transform sinners into sons of God for the formation of the Body of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sTrENaXmH-QUV41dS8DI8-RJ7afIOwXHPvMDWR4kxnQD3MSPXqGO1AtiIimI5PGDO">THE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="w_QXt_moIy43U-iBdBHSgUzHbmL7iM3CET_8qgPLZCAY5YjmkXjovKLmYef-__VX0"> As we consider this matter of sonship, certain important words command our attention: designation, resurrection, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation. We are being designated sons of God through the process of resurrection. In this process a number of steps are involved. These steps include sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. This glorification will also be the manifestation. Today people may not realize that we are Christians. But on the day of our glorification, no one will need to ask us whether or not we are Christians, for we shall be manifested as sons of God. That manifestation will be the consummation of the process of designation by resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKCxmRAnI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx"> Sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification are not four altogether separate steps. Rather, as sanctification is going on, we are also being transformed. Moreover, as we are being transformed, the process of conformation begins to take place. Eventually, as the spontaneous continuation and consummation of these processes, we shall reach the stage of glorification or manifestation. When sanctification, transformation, and conformation reach their peak, that will be the time of our glorification. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="566" id="566">[566]</span> glorification will be our manifestation as sons of God. We are presently undergoing the process of designation by resurrection, a process which will ultimately bring us to the point of manifestation. The key to this process is resurrection. Therefore, we speak of designation by resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcNd0AMCNNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r">THE EXPERIENCE OF RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1U4ST68RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM"> In this message we need to consider the matter of resurrection in some detail. We shall not look at it objectively, from the standpoint of doctrine, but subjectively, from the standpoint of the experience of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80740" data-verses="Romans 6:5">Romans 6:5</span> speaks of the experience of resurrection. This verse says that we share in the likeness of Christ’s resurrection. Some students of the Word have said that the resurrection mentioned here is the first resurrection spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80741" data-verses="Revelation 20:4-5">Revelation 20:4 and 5</span>. But I do not believe that this is Paul’s understanding of resurrection here. Paul is not saying that we must wait until the millennium to participate in the resurrection of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80742" data-verses="Romans 6:5">6:5</span> Paul says that we have grown together with Christ in the likeness of His death and that we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection. This does not refer to a future, objective resurrection, but it refers to our present experience of Christ’s resurrection life. We should not regard the resurrection merely as a future event, as Martha did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80743" data-verses="John 11:1">John 11</span>. The Lord Jesus told her that He was the resurrection and the life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80744" data-verses="John 11:25">v. 25</span>). His word indicates that there is no need for us to wait until a future day to have Him as resurrection. Resurrection is not a matter of time or place; it is a matter of Christ. If we have Him, we have resurrection. But if we do not have Him, we do not have resurrection life, neither now nor in the future. Hallelujah, resurrection is Jesus, the Son of God! As long as we have Jesus Christ, we have resurrection, no matter where we may be. </p>
<p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kHTg-WD5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> What a difference there is between the doctrinal teaching regarding resurrection and the subjective revelation of Christ as resurrection! What we need today is not the objective teaching about resurrection, but the subjective, living, up-to-date experience of Christ as resurrection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="567" id="567">[567]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3b-rmG-elY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6">CHRIST AS LIFE-POWER</h2><p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRT44B4XOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> To say that Christ is resurrection means that Christ is the life-power. Resurrection is life-power. With life there are the life-essence, the life-shape, and the life-power. Firstly we have the life-essence and then we have the life-power. Following this, we have the life-shape, the life-form. Resurrection is Christ being the life-power to us. This is a very significant matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPPOQgTK1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> In 1936 I paid a visit to one of the leading universities in China. One of the students spoke to me about his difficulty in believing in resurrection. He told me that due to his modern scientific knowledge he could not believe. To him, resurrection was against scientific truth. Outside of the room where we were meeting there was a wheat field. Drawing his attention to the wheat growing in the field, I pointed out that the wheat was produced by some grains of seed that were buried in the earth. I told him that, in a sense, those seeds died, but that now they had come forth in resurrection as wheat. Through that illustration of death and resurrection, this young man was saved. Now he is one of the leading co-workers in Taiwan. This illustration shows that resurrection is a matter of life-power. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxVtgxOgp3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv">THE FUNCTIONS OF RESURRECTION</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkTuOfx4p-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4">Conquering Negative Things</h2>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJV94OlbrbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> This life-power has a number of functions. The first function is that of conquering. Resurrection is able to conquer every negative thing, including death. Apart from God Himself, the most powerful thing in the universe is death. Whenever death visits anyone, that one cannot resist it; he must yield to its power. Although death is so powerful, resurrection is even more powerful. Death cannot hold resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80745" data-verses="Acts 2:24">Acts 2:24</span>). On the contrary, resurrection conquers death and overcomes it. </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeBex06-jT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80746" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:26">1 Corinthians 15:26</span> Paul says, “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” This indicates that death is the strongest enemy. Such a strong enemy can be defeated only <span class="pg" data-page-id="568" id="568">[568]</span> by resurrection. Therefore, the first function of resurrection, of the life-power, is that of conquering the negative things, especially death. The more resurrection is placed in a situation of death, the more opportunity it has to function to conquer death. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomSbxmpu65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft">Swallowing Up Death</h2><p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVs7uh-Bzxl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> The second function of the life-power is to swallow up death. Resurrection not only conquers death and overcomes it, but it also devours it. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80747" data-verses="Numbers 14:9">Numbers 14:9</span> Caleb said that the enemies of the children of Israel would be their food. Death, the last and greatest enemy, is food for resurrection. Sometimes an enemy is conquered, but he is still present. Through the function of the life-power, death is not only conquered, but is swallowed up to the point that it disappears. When the life-power swallows death, death vanishes. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2GXk-lYS_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk">Producing Growth, Transformation,<br/>and Shaping</h2><p data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0Scu9EStPTsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx"> The functions of conquering and swallowing are negative functions. Resurrection, however, also has many positive functions. The first of these is to produce growth and transformation. The more something grows, the more it is changed, transformed. Once again the growth of a carnation flower illustrates this. The carnation begins as a small seed. But after the seed is sown into the soil, it begins to grow, firstly into a tender sprout and eventually into a full-grown, blossoming carnation plant. When the carnation is still a sprout, it is difficult to distinguish it from other types of plants. But the more it grows, the more it changes and is transformed. It is transformed by growth. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Xi4QTSZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4"> In principle, the same kind of change takes place in children. As a child grows, his body assumes a certain shape. As the life-power transforms, it also shapes. The more we grow, the more we are shaped. Hence, resurrection causes growth, change, and shaping. <span class="pg" data-page-id="569" id="569">[569]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbd6SeK3fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X">Releasing the Positive Things</h2><p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocbiryG0nWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> Resurrection also releases the positive things. Fruit-bearing is one kind of release brought about by the function of resurrection. In the bearing of fruit there is the release of the life-essence from within a certain tree. This indicates that through fruit-bearing the riches of the life within that tree are released. By the releasing function of the life-power all that is in a seed—the root, the stem, the branches, the leaves, the flower, and the fruit—is released. As the seed is resurrected, everything positive in it is released. </p>
<p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwM_oYpQqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> We often speak about the riches of Christ. Christ with all His riches has been sown into us as a seed. We see this in the parable of the sower in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80748" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>. According to this parable, Christ has sown Himself into us as a seed of life. This seed includes all kinds of positive things: love, holiness, righteousness, humility, patience, endurance. In this seed are both the divine attributes and the human virtues. The only thing that is needed is the release. Resurrection releases the essence of all the riches of Christ from within the seed. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZw1vyU8Pm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI">The Power to Rise Up</h2><p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYS6m3wlydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> With resurrection there is also the power to rise up. Resurrection, like the calamus used in making the anointing oil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80749" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>, rises above the “muddy” situations. This calamus is a picture of the power in Christ to rise up. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK3xfmT1GzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6">DESIGNATION BY THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS</h1><p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kHSg-DJ5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> In the foregoing message we considered seven significant words: designation, resurrection, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation. We are designated sons of God by resurrection. The process of resurrection includes sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. This glorification will also be our manifestation. </p>
<p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3b-qmGvVlY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> All these seven items take place by the Spirit and with life. God designates us and causes us to undergo the process of resurrection by means of His Spirit and with life. Also, God sanctifies us, transforms us, conforms us, glorifies us, and brings us into the full manifestation of sonship by the Spirit with life. In the book of Romans both the Spirit and the divine life are covered. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRT54BlfOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak">HOLINESS, THE DIVINE ESSENCE</h2><p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPPPQgKD1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80756" data-verses="Romans 1:4">1:4</span> why does Paul speak of the Spirit of holiness and not of the Holy Spirit? There is a distinction between the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of holiness. Holiness is the divine essence, the substance of God. Hence, the Spirit of holiness is the Spirit of the divine substance, whereas the Holy Spirit is the Person of the Spirit. As fallen ones, we are constituted with sinfulness. But as the Son of God, Christ is constituted with holiness. Holiness is His very element. Here holiness does not mean sinless perfection or positional separation; it denotes the divine essence, the very substance of God’s being. It was according to the Spirit of holiness that Christ was designated the Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxVthxOFn3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> Once again we may use the plant life as an illustration. When a carnation and a lily have just sprouted, they may <span class="pg" data-page-id="578" id="578">[578]</span> look very much alike. But as these plants grow, they are gradually designated according to the life-essence within them. In the same principle, the Spirit of holiness is the life-essence within the Lord Jesus. When He was living on earth in the flesh, He had this divine life-essence within Him. Because this life-essence was according to God’s being, it was also the essence of holiness. According to our understanding, the word holiness refers to being separated, distinct, from all common things. Because God’s essence is unique. God is separate from all things other than Himself. The holiness spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80757" data-verses="Romans 1:4">verse 4</span> is the divine essence that was in the Lord Jesus when He lived on earth. Just as a carnation flower is designated according to the life-essence within it, so the Lord Jesus was designated by resurrection through the divine life-essence within Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkTuPfxZm-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> We have pointed out that we all need to serve God in the gospel of His Son. To serve God in the gospel is to serve Him not only in the matters of redemption, justification, and forgiveness, but especially in the matter of sonship. All the service in the local churches should be the service in the gospel of sonship. According to this gospel, sinners in the flesh can be transformed into sons of God in the Spirit. What glad tidings! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="D5w8-kFdQxmkmF1GzR6Q6rrTuKPPWrkUq03mqLc30FIAV31DN5B-3O4zuykkIOmJX">THE APPLICATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6WqocH7avTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> In this message we need to see that designation, resurrection, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation are all realized by the Spirit of holiness. In order to understand this, we need to know that God’s economy is to dispense Himself into man. The fact that God is triune—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—is related to His economy, to His dispensing of Himself into us. God the Father is embodied in God the Son, and God the Son is realized, transmitted, experienced and gained by us in God the Spirit. The Spirit as the third in the Godhead is God being our realization and experience. This means that the application of the Triune God to us comes by <span class="pg" data-page-id="579" id="579">[579]</span> the Spirit of God. For this reason, in our experience the Triune God is the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="gTWF_O-VusFLsBnICnGMD1lDxHlcJrTjqrrJfkDlEYM2QChTjzMfb7iFBzHc2B8W3"> Electrical current is an illustration of the Spirit as the application of the Triune God. Apart from the current of electricity, electricity cannot be applied. In its application, electricity needs to become an electrical current. The current, however, is not something different from electricity itself. The current of electricity is simply electricity in motion. In the same principle, the application of the Triune God to us is the Spirit. The Spirit is the current of the Triune God for us to apply; He is the Triune God in motion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8y3XGTLwJuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo">CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822Fgn6ePdifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n"> The New Testament clearly reveals that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80758" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). This means that Christ is the Spirit who is the current of the Triune God for us to apply in our experience. This understanding may differ from traditional theology, but it corresponds to the pure Word of God. The New Testament reveals that Christ, God incarnated as a man, died on the cross for our sins, was resurrected from among the dead, ascended to the heavens, and has been glorified and enthroned as the King, the Head, and the Lord over all. This very Christ is also the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmg41QsqPO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> All the objective items of who Christ is and of what Christ is are recognized and taught by fundamental Christians today. However, the matter of Christ as the life-giving Spirit has been grossly neglected. This is due to Satan’s subtlety. A person may talk about what electricity is and what it can do, but he may neglect the current of electricity. What good is it to discuss electricity without applying it? I do not know very much about electricity, but by applying it I enjoy its benefits. In the same principle, our need today is not mainly the objective knowledge of doctrines; it is the subjective experience of the current of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="tMvanZpbbtE5qrkVWVJZPMhaXV1ZXNDzyn0zjddrEY1olA8XC1RkGdSpKcDxo1uSM"> Satan, the subtle enemy of God, may allow people to know that Christ is the Son of God who was incarnated as a man, who died on the cross for our redemption, who was <span class="pg" data-page-id="580" id="580">[580]</span> resurrected, and who has ascended to the right hand of God. But the enemy blinds the believers to the vital truth regarding Christ as the life-giving Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80759" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">Second Corinthians 3:6</span> says that the letter kills, but that the Spirit gives life. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80760" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span>, the Lord is this very Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80761" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">Verse 18</span> continues, “But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit” (Gk.). In this verse we see a compound title—Lord Spirit. Few Christians have paid attention to this title of the Lord. The understanding and experience of Christ as the Lord Spirit need to be recovered. I love to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, but I especially enjoy touching Him as the Lord Spirit. The Lord Jesus today is the wonderful life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="hoPGAKCjyReE3jTK36DPyQlIhbyuYQyTD22BFHBhVNAcZ4CopGqxWdODu-9xdw8R1"> This very point is also covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80762" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80763" data-verses="Romans 8:9">verse 9</span> of this chapter Paul speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us. Then he says, “But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.” This clearly indicates that today the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ. Furthermore, the next verse speaks of Christ being in us. The fact that these terms are used interchangeably indicates that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ and that the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself. The Spirit spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80764" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> is Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417KEYJz81xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8"> This Christ who is the life-giving Spirit is in our spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80765" data-verses="Romans 8:16">Romans 8:16</span> says, “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.” This reveals clearly that the Holy Spirit is one with our regenerated human spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, Christ today is the application and realization of the Triune God. Furthermore, this application and realization is in our spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLZv7_AloK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP">APPLYING THE HEAVENLY ELECTRICITY</h2><p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVepsiIa4VW8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> Our being is like a building. In this building Christ as the heavenly electricity has been installed. We praise the Lord that in this building the divine electrician has placed a switch—the human spirit. Our spirit can be compared to <span class="pg" data-page-id="581" id="581">[581]</span> a switch by which we apply the heavenly electricity. What a frustration it would be to us if electricity had been installed into this building, but there were no switch. Praise the Lord for the switch of our human spirit! Using this switch is the key to experiencing the Spirit as the application of the Triune God. Time and time again we need to remind ourselves that Christ as the realization of the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. </p>

This means that God’s intention is to produce many sons through the gospel. For the producing of these many sons, the economy of the three Persons of the Godhead is involved. The Father as the source is in the Son, who is the course, and the Son as the embodiment of the Father is now in the flow of the Spirit. The Spirit is thus the current of the Triune God. Just as electrical current is electricity in motion, so the Spirit of the Triune God is God in motion. Hence, the Spirit of God is for the application of God to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0Scu9GStSYsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx">THE FLOWING OF THE DIVINE CURRENT</h2><p data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Xg4QCaZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4"> Apart from the Spirit as the current, the flow, there is no way for God to be applied to us. God is rich and all His riches are for us; but there is the need of the Spirit as the current for the application of the riches of God to our experience. This flow of the Spirit is the anointing, the moving, of the ointment within us. All that God is in Christ and all that God has accomplished, obtained, and attained in Christ are in this current, this flow, this anointing. Now in our spirit we have the flowing of the divine current, the moving of the ointment. Within us there is something that is constantly in motion. This moving element includes divinity, humanity, Christ’s human living, the effectiveness of His death, the power of His resurrection, the fragrance of His resurrection, His ascension, enthronement, headship, lordship, authority, and kingdom. Thus, the anointing within us is an all-inclusive ointment. Praise the Lord that this current is flowing within us! <span class="pg" data-page-id="588" id="588">[588]</span> </p>

Our spirit is like a switch. By exercising our spirit, we switch on the heavenly electricity which has been installed into us. If we did not have a switch or did not know where the switch was, we would have no way of applying electricity. In the same principle, apart from the switch of our spirit, we have no way to apply the heavenly electricity. Praise the Lord that we have a switch and that we know where it is! The switch is in the inner chamber of our being, that is, in our spirit. The simplest way to switch on the current is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwM9oYEfqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomSZxmpm65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80782" data-verses="Romans 1:9">1:9</span> Paul said, “For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.” The place to serve God is not the mind; it is our spirit. People rarely say “my spirit.” They speak of their heart, their soul, their mind, their emotion, and their will, but not of their spirit. However, Paul was a person who served God in his spirit. We need to develop the habit of saying “my spirit” or “our spirit.” As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80783" data-verses="Romans 8:16">8:16</span> says, “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.” We need to speak more about our spirit, turn to our spirit, and use our spirit in all things. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVs7sh-B7xl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> The reason certain ones do not pray or function in the meetings is that they do not exercise their spirit. Many seem to leave their spirit at home when they come to the meetings. How different they are from Paul, who could attend a church meeting in his spirit even when he was not physically present (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80784" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:3">1 Cor. 5:3</span>). We do not function in the meetings because we do not exercise our spirit. Likewise, we have many failures in our daily living because we fail to use our spirit. For example, we lose our temper or become depressed because we do not exercise our spirit. In the same principle, we may be unable to know the will of God or to obtain life from the Word because our spirit is dull from lack of exercise. All our problems are solved and all our needs are met through the exercise of our spirit. All that God is and all <span class="pg" data-page-id="589" id="589">[589]</span> that He has accomplished are in the all-inclusive Spirit who has been installed in our spirit. Therefore, by turning to our spirit and by exercising our spirit, we may obtain the full supply to meet our need. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2GXm-lUQ_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk">WHAT WE NEED TODAY</h2><p data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0Scu9GStDRsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx"> Through many years of experience and suffering, I have learned that what we need today is not the knowledge of doctrine, but the exercise of our spirit so that we may experience the application of the Triune God in the flow of the Holy Spirit. After I was saved, I joined a group of Christians who emphasized the objective study of the Bible. I remained under their influence as a willing learner for more than seven years. But one day as I was walking on the street, the Spirit within said to me, “You know so many teachings, but look how dead and unfruitful you are. In the past several years you have brought almost no one to the Lord.” My heart was smitten, and I cried to the Lord for His mercy. I admitted that I was wrong. Early the next day, I climbed a mountain near my home, and there I cried out to the Lord to have mercy on me because of my deadness. The Lord was merciful, and from that time He caused me to seek Him in a consistent way. After that, brother Watchman Nee visited my home town and stayed with me for a while. His visit was a turning point in my life. My eyes were opened to see that the Christian life is not a matter of knowledge, but absolutely a matter of life and the Spirit. However, it took me a long time to become entirely free from the influence of dead knowledge. Once this kind of knowledge gets into us, it is hard to get it out. Therefore, when I say that what we need today is not mere knowledge but the contact with the living Spirit, I know what I am talking about. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24Xg4QfUZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4"> All that Christ is, all that He has accomplished, and all that He has obtained and attained are in the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit contains everything we need: resurrection, power, life, guidance, light, love, humility. Furthermore, this wonderful all-inclusive Spirit has been installed in our spirit. Hallelujah, the living Christ who is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="590" id="590">[590]</span> all-inclusive Spirit is in our spirit! We can apply this wonderfully rich One simply by using our spirit. </p>

Now we shall consider another ten items to impress us with the richness of the indwelling Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwM9oYlSqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2">Freedom</h2><p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZw3vyYyPm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> In the Spirit we have freedom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80785" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80786" data-verses="Romans 8:21">Verse 21</span> of the same chapter speaks of the freedom of the glory of the children of God. Today we are in the process of becoming free. The entire universe with everything in it is in a state of slavery. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80787" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> this slavery, this bondage, is called the slavery of corruption. Things die because they are held by this slavery of corruption. But the Spirit is setting us free from this slavery. One day we shall be fully out of the slavery of corruption and fully into the freedom of glory. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYS4m38rydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs">Foretaste</h2><p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52x2mYAQc2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> Today we also enjoy the Spirit as a foretaste (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80788" data-verses="Romans 8:23">8:23</span>). We need to learn to have a greater appreciation for the Spirit as a foretaste. How sweet, tender, and enjoyable this foretaste is to us! </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q9tEv6MqIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI">Sonship</h2><p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_nnC6M3N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> The sonship we have in the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80789" data-verses="Romans 8:15">8:15</span>) includes a number of items: the life of the son, the sphere of the son, the position of the son, the living of the son, the enjoyment of the son, the birthright of the son, the inheritance of the son, and the manifestation of the son. We have such an all-inclusive sonship in our spirit. If we stay away from the spirit, we are kept from the enjoyment of the sonship. <span class="pg" data-page-id="591" id="591">[591]</span> However, as we are waiting for the full sonship, we should daily enjoy the sonship by exercising our spirit. </p>

However, in this book another important matter is covered, and that is the matter of righteousness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80802" data-verses="Romans 1:16-17">1:16 and 17</span> Paul says that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, because the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel. In this message we shall see why righteousness is the power of the gospel and why righteousness is necessary in order for God to produce many sons through the gospel. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGzg72GPZ_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv">THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD’S RIGHTEOUSNESS<br/> FULFILLED BY CHRIST’S DEATH<br/>ON THE CROSS</h2><p data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGFryH9EDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO"> In eternity past God predestinated us to be His sons. However, although we were the predestinated ones, we became fallen and involved with sin. This brings in the matter of God’s righteousness. If we had not fallen, we would not need to be concerned with righteousness. But because we are fallen, God must deal with us according to His righteousness. What should God do with those He has predestinated to become His sons? Some may say that because God loves us, He cannot cast us all into the lake of fire. Yes, God loves us, but He hates sin. God does not desire to give us up or to cast us into the lake of fire. However, He cannot forgive us unless His righteousness has been satisfied. If God would forgive us in a light manner, He would <span class="pg" data-page-id="598" id="598">[598]</span> place Himself in a position of being unrighteous. As a righteous God and a just God, He cannot forgive sinful people without meeting the demands of His righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvJh7gaf0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> In order that God might be able to forgive us, Christ, the Son of God, became flesh. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80803" data-verses="Romans 8:3">8:3</span> says, God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. By incarnation, the Lord took upon Himself the likeness of the flesh of sin and became identified with sinners in the flesh. For the sake of God’s righteousness, the Lord Jesus was put to death on the cross. There, on the cross, He was made sin for us, and God condemned sin in the flesh. By dying on our behalf the Lord accomplished redemption and fulfilled all of God’s righteous requirements. Now God has the position righteously to forgive us. In fact, He not only can forgive us, but, for the sake of His righteousness, He must forgive us. God forgives not primarily because He loves us, but because He is bound by His righteousness to do so. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtP-MjfMFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80804" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> says that because God loved us, He gave His only begotten Son so that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life. This verse indicates that God saves us because He loves us. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80805" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80806" data-verses="Ephesians 2:8">8</span> we are told that we are saved by grace. The book of Romans, however, reveals that we are saved not by grace nor by love, but by righteousness. Neither love nor grace is a legal matter. You cannot claim that, according to law, a person is required to love you or to show grace to you. Only with those things which are related to righteousness do we have the position to claim something in a legal way. </p>
<p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSIWV9VSjkAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> For example, suppose you are a landlord and I am one of your tenants. Each month I am required to pay you a certain amount of money as rent. If I fail to pay rent for two months, you have the position to righteously claim from me the payment of the rent. On my part, I must pay the rent, not out of love nor out of grace, but out of righteousness. I am legally obligated to pay the rent. If I pay it, I am righteous. But if I do not pay it, I am not righteous. </p>
<p data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417KGYJz01xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8"> In one sense, the Lord Jesus was put to death by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="599" id="599">[599]</span> Jews and Romans. But in another sense, He was put to death by God. The Lord was on the cross for six hours. During the first three hours, He suffered the persecution of men, who did many evil things to Him. But during the last three hours, God laid all our sins upon Him, and then He judged Him, punished Him, and put Him to death. This is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80807" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span>. God put Christ to death because, during the last three hours on the cross, Christ took our place. Through Christ’s death, God’s righteous requirements were fulfilled. Therefore, the Lord could utter the words, “It is finished” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80808" data-verses="John 19:30">John 19:30</span>). By saying this, the Lord was indicating that the work of redemption was accomplished. As proof of this, the veil in the temple was torn from top to bottom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80809" data-verses="Matthew 27:51">Matt. 27:51</span>). Furthermore, the entire scene surrounding the place of Christ’s death became serene and peaceful. A wealthy man asked for the body of Jesus and buried Him in a tomb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80810" data-verses="John 19:38">John 19:38</span>). Thus, with His suffering over, the Lord rested in the tomb. The requirements of God’s righteousness had been fulfilled by Christ’s death, and God was satisfied. Three days later, as proof of this satisfaction, God raised Christ from among the dead. Hence, the resurrection of Christ is the proof that God is satisfied with His death on our behalf. </p>
<p data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLZt7_AtoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP"> Before Christ died on the cross, it was still possible for God to change His mind about forgiving us of our sins. He could righteously have cast us all aside. But after Christ’s death on the cross under the judgment of God, God cannot do this. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVepsiKa4ZU8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6">IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD TO CHANGE HIS MIND</h2><p data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XITkd-3G0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0"> Now that Christ has died and has been raised from among the dead, it is impossible for God to change His mind about forgiving us. Rather, we have the ground to say to Him, “O God, whether You love me or not, You must forgive me. Before Christ died on the cross, You could have changed Your mind. But because He has died and because You have raised Him from among the dead, You have no legal standing to refuse to forgive me. O God, You must forgive me <span class="pg" data-page-id="600" id="600">[600]</span> now, for You have no right to change in this matter. You are bound by Your righteousness.” In this way, righteousness is the power of the gospel. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvM8ZAXk173NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr">THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGab8RwOnb3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> Both love and grace may change, but righteousness is solid and steadfast. God is free either to love us or not to love us. However, He is bound by His righteousness. Now that Christ has died to fulfill God’s righteous requirements, God has put Himself into a position where He is legally bound. Whether He loves us or not, He is bound by His own righteousness to forgive us. Thus, the foundation of our salvation is righteousness, not love or grace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80811" data-verses="Psalms 89:14">Psalm 89:14</span> says, “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne” (Heb.). The very foundation of God’s throne is also the foundation of our salvation. Can the foundation of God’s throne be shaken? Certainly not. Likewise, the foundation of our salvation cannot be shaken, for this foundation is not love nor grace, but righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qlymPhnSHZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> The Bible does not say that love is the power of the gospel; neither does it say that grace is the power of the gospel. But it does reveal that the righteousness of God is the power of the gospel. If we consider ourselves, we shall realize that we are not lovable nor worthy of God’s grace. We simply do not deserve anything from God. But God is righteous. He put Christ to death on our behalf, and He has recognized the death of Christ as the full payment of our debt. Furthermore, the resurrected Christ sitting at God’s right hand is the receipt of payment. Since God has already issued this receipt, how could He righteously claim payment again from us? If He would do so, we could point Him to Christ and remind Him that He must take care of His righteous position, even the foundation of His throne. </p>

This gospel includes many wonderful items: sonship, designation, resurrection, justification, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation. In this message we shall consider a further item—the selection of grace. If we would know the gospel of the Son of God thoroughly, we need to see that God’s selection is included in it. This selection is the selection of grace. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80822" data-verses="Romans 11:5">11:5</span> says, “So then at the present time also there is a remnant according to the selection of grace.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8ESiszSvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V">GOD’S SELECTION</h2><p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3owz8gVgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> In society, selection is related to birth, upbringing, education, and success in the world. Divine selection is absolutely different. We were selected even before we were born, in fact, before the foundation of the world. Human selection depends upon what people are in themselves. Those who are good, promising, or successful are likely to be selected. God’s selection, on the contrary, does not depend upon what we are; it depends entirely upon God and His desire. </p>
<p data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJgjpKkn-0stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80823" data-verses="Romans 9:1">chapter nine</span> Paul used the case of Jacob and Esau as an illustration of God’s selection. Before they were born, God had told Rebecca, “The greater shall serve the less” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80824" data-verses="Romans 9:12">9:12</span>). God’s choice was made before the children were born, before they had done anything good or bad. This was so that the “purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works, but of Him Who calls” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80825" data-verses="Romans 9:11">v. 11</span>). Nevertheless, when he was in the womb, Jacob was struggling to be born first. It was of God’s mercy that Jacob was not successful. If he had succeeded, he would not have received God’s selection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="610" id="610">[610]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HLUfrFSr0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> In a very real sense, we all are Jacobs struggling to be first. From our very birth, we have had the concept that we must struggle in order to gain something for ourselves. Even though we may fail again and again, we keep on striving. We are just like Jacob, the supplanter, whom God predestined to be second but who still struggled to be first. Praise God for the restraining hand of His mercy that has kept us from succeeding in our endeavors! He restrains us because He had already selected us long before we were born. </p>

Of the three, selection is first, followed by predestination and calling. Firstly, God selected us. Then He marked us out, that is, predestinated us. Both selection and predestination took place before we were born. Then at a certain point in our life, God came in to call us. </p>
<p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYS2m38jydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80826" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4-5">Ephesians 1:4 and 5</span> prove that God’s selection and predestination took place in eternity past: “According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love, having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.” Before the universe came into existence, God selected us and predestinated us unto sonship. We need to exercise our spirit in faith to believe this word written in the Scripture. On the day appointed by God, we were born. Eventually, also at the time appointed by Him, we were saved. Even though we may have had no intention of believing in the Lord Jesus, we came to believe in Him, because we had been selected and predestinated by God. This is the selection of grace in which God’s mercy is manifested. As Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80827" data-verses="Romans 9:16">9:16</span>, “So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One Who shows mercy.” </p>

We shall realize that our steps have been not of ourselves, <span class="pg" data-page-id="611" id="611">[611]</span> but of Him. Before we were born, He selected us and predestinated us and arranged everything related to us, including the time and place of our birth. Moreover, He appointed all our days and all the places where we are to be. According to God’s arrangement, I was born in the twentieth century. Furthermore, I was born in an area where it was easy to have contact with Christians. This was altogether of God. Furthermore, my life with the Lord proves that our way is determined by Him, and my experience testifies it is not of the one who wills nor of the one who runs, but of the One who shows mercy. Everything that happens to us is a matter of divine mercy. </p>

I simply desire to emphasize the fact of God’s selection. We all have become Christians because of this selection. Many of us do not even know why we became Christians in the first place. Some of us may even have tried to stop believing in the Lord, but we were not successful in doing so. On the one hand, it is wonderful to be a Christian; but on the other hand, it is extremely trying and difficult. We Christians are not only Jacobs, but also Jobs. Due to God’s selection, we had no choice except to become Christians. Now that we have believed into the Lord Jesus, we simply cannot escape from Him. This proves that we have been selected by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGFkyHgIDqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO"> Within us there is something that causes us to believe in the Lord, whether we want to believe in Him or not. This comes from the selection of grace. We may want to get a “divorce” from the Lord, but He refuses to sign the certificate of divorce. God is not afraid of any attempt we might make to escape from Him. He knows that however hard we may try, we cannot get away. This is the strongest proof that we have been selected by God. How marvelous is the divine selection of grace! <span class="pg" data-page-id="612" id="612">[612]</span> </p>

A number of unbelievers may attend the same meeting and hear the same message; however, only certain ones respond. This is difficult to explain.

One day a student expressed the concern that through his preaching of the gospel someone could be saved who had not been selected by God. Moody told him not to be troubled, but to simply continue to preach the gospel. Furthermore, Moody said that he should allow anyone who is willing to believe to receive the Lord. Moody went on to say that over the entrance of heaven there will be written the words, “Whosoever will may come,” but that after a person passes through the entrance, he will see inscribed upon the inside of it these words: “Chosen from before the foundation of the world.” </p>

The gospel is wholly a matter of God’s sovereign mercy. Many years ago, I had some realization of this, but my realization is much stronger today. Through many years of experience, I have become strongly and deeply convinced that everything that happens to us is of God. All is a matter of God’s mercy. The more we see this, the more we shall spontaneously bear our responsibility before the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7Wam-LaUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> However, even the bearing of responsibility is of God’s mercy. Why is it that some believers are willing to bear their responsibility and that others are not? The answer lies in God’s mercy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80828" data-verses="Romans 9:15">9:15</span> Paul quotes the Lord’s words, “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.” Because of God’s mercy in His selection of grace, we responded to the gospel when others did not respond; we received a word about Christ as our life when others refused to receive it; and we took the way of the Lord’s recovery today when others drew <span class="pg" data-page-id="613" id="613">[613]</span> back from taking this way. Some can testify that although they are in the Lord’s recovery today, those who brought them to this way did not come this way themselves. </p>

This gospel is a gospel of sonship. Sonship includes designation, resurrection, justification, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation. We are presently undergoing the process of designation; that is, we are being designated sons of God by the power of resurrection. Sonship is for the Body. In order to be members of the Body of Christ, we must be sons of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="hoPGAKCjyReE3jTK36DP-QlRsbyuYQyTD22BFHBhVNAcZ4CopGqxWdODu-9xdw8R1"> We have pointed out that, in a very real sense, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80832" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span> is the direct continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80833" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span>, with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80834" data-verses="Romans 9:1">chapters nine through eleven</span> as a parenthetical insertion regarding the selection of grace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80835" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Chapter eight</span> reveals that we are being conformed to the image of the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80836" data-verses="Romans 8:29">v. 29</span>).

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80838" data-verses="Romans 12:1">verse 1</span> he says, “I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.” Our physical bodies must be presented to the Lord for His purpose of having the Body. Someone may have a heart for the Body life, but if he does not present his body, he is not for the Body life in a practical way. You may care for the meetings, but what does this accomplish if your body remains at home? If we fail to present our bodies to the Lord for the church life, we cannot have a practical meeting life. If you say that you have a heart for the church meetings, you need to ask yourself if you have presented your body to the Lord for the meetings. Where is your body at meeting time? The body is the container of our being, for the spirit is within the soul and the soul is within the body. We must present this container to the Lord for the sake of His Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ANzUA-iUjeJrXG0OumZMlKccqeqVJQuX5wL_kKU5dq3C7vF1_YQpuJ09rnAq0MJO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80839" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Verse 2</span> speaks of the mind, which is the main part of the soul: “And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.” When our mind is renewed, our soul will be transformed. Hence, our body needs to be presented, and our soul needs to be transformed. </p>
<p data-content-id="RRUrZa0dvyz7r8k3lCUlV1IaPLT7GZHs7O9Lgyqlqhw7CeO8ACPd1Y2-5rrPSFRGa"> In this verse Paul beseeches us not to be conformed to this age. The world, Satan’s system, is a cosmos composed of many ages. The nineteenth century was one age, and the twentieth century is another age. Actually, there have been several distinct ages within the twentieth century itself. The present age is a section of Satan’s world system. This age includes not only the secular world, but also the religious world. If we are conformed to today’s religion, we shall be useless as far as the practice of the Body life is concerned. </p>
<p data-content-id="sTrENaXmH-QUV41dS8DIx-RYyafIOwXHPvMDWR4kxnQD3MSPXqGO1AtiIimI5PGDO"> For Paul in his day to be conformed to the present age was primarily a matter of being conformed to Judaism. Judaism was a serious hindrance to the practice of the Body life in the first century. Just as Judaism was part of the age in Paul’s time, so Christianity as an organized religion is part of today’s age. If you are conformed to organized Christianity, you will be conformed to this age. Instead of being <span class="pg" data-page-id="619" id="619">[619]</span> conformed to this age, we need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. </p>

For example, some have seen that in the Body of Christ we are “members one of another” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80842" data-verses="Romans 12:5">12:5</span>). However, they cannot name any members to whom they are specifically related. Thus, their word about being members one of another is mere talk. We are not here for talk about the Body life; we are for the practice of the Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1U1STbxRVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM"> The teaching in Romans concerning the Body life is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80843" data-verses="Romans 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, but the practice is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80844" data-verses="Romans 14:1">chapters fourteen</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80845" data-verses="Romans 15:1">fifteen</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80846" data-verses="Romans 16:1">sixteen</span>.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80849" data-verses="Romans 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> Paul addresses the problem of receiving believers whose opinions and practices differ from ours. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80850" data-verses="Romans 14:1">14:1</span> Paul says, “Now him who is weak in faith receive, not with a view to passing judgment on reasonings.” Then Paul proceeds to give two examples of matters about which believers may have different views. The first example concerns eating: “One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80851" data-verses="Romans 14:2">v. 2</span>). The second concerns observing days: “One judges one day above another, another judges every day alike” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80852" data-verses="Romans 14:5">v. 5</span>). These two matters are illustrations of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="620" id="620">[620]</span> many things which have divided Christians. Take the example of baptism. Some insist on immersion, whereas others insist on sprinkling. If we have the proper practice of the Body life, we shall receive all true believers in Christ, whether they practice immersion or sprinkling. </p>
<p data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-jVcKHFkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc"> Some say that we in the Lord’s recovery are narrow. However, we are willing to receive all kinds of Christians. We receive those who practice immersion and those who practice sprinkling. Who then are the narrow ones—those in the Lord’s recovery or those who accept into their fellowship only those who meet special requirements related to doctrine or practice? </p>
<p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK3xTmTwNzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> The divisions among Christians come from differences over doctrine or practice. For example, believers have been divided over such things as head covering, foot-washing, and the observance of the Lord’s day or the Sabbath day. This fact should turn us afresh to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80853" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans 14</span>, where Paul instructs us to receive those who have the faith in Christ and not to judge them concerning secondary matters. If someone comes to us with a different opinion regarding a particular matter, we must still receive him as a brother in the Lord. As Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80854" data-verses="Romans 15:7">15:7</span>, “Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.” </p>

This Body is the universal church. The universal church needs to be expressed in various localities in local churches. The dispensation of the Triune God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose has much to do with the local churches.

The best way is to pour the juice into cups and then distribute it among the people present. The juice used to be in the container, but now it is in the people into whom it has been dispensed. When we speak of the dispensation of the Triune God, we mean that God distributes Himself to us and then dispenses Himself into our being just as the juice is dispensed from the container into those who drink it. In His dispensation, God actually enters into our being, fills our vessel, and becomes one with us. This is the dispensation of the Triune God for the fulfillment of His purpose. </p>

Christ is God’s Son. How can we explain, then, that the unique God sent His own Son when Christ is both the Son of God and God Himself? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80871" data-verses="Romans 9:5">9:5</span>, Christ is God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80872" data-verses="Romans 8:3">8:3</span>, God sent His own Son, who is Christ. This indicates that Christ is both God and the Son of God. This reminds us of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80873" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>. This verse says that a child is called the mighty God and that a son is called the eternal Father. Here we see the mystery of the Triune God: God is three, yet He remains one. </p>

This verse indicates that the Son of God once died. But how is it possible for the Son of God to die? To me, this verse would be more understandable if it spoke of the death of Jesus. However, it speaks of the death of God’s Son. Whether we can understand this or not, it is a fact that, even when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the wonderful death of the Son of God. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80875" data-verses="Romans 5:10">5:10</span>, now we are being saved in His life. This indicates that the One who died still has life.

It was for dispensation that the Son of God needed to be a man (Jesus) and to be the anointed One (Christ). Furthermore, only through dispensation could the Son of God, Jesus Christ, become our Lord. Because Christ has been dispensed into us, He is not only <em>the</em> Lord, but <em>our</em> Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="628" id="628">[628]</span> </p>

In this verse there are a number of things difficult to explain: law, Spirit, life, and Christ Jesus. Notice that here Paul does not say Jesus Christ, but Christ Jesus. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80882" data-verses="Romans 8:7-8">verses 7 and 8</span> Paul mentions God. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80883" data-verses="Romans 8:9">verse 9</span> he goes on to speak of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ.

In the same principle, the term the Spirit of God means that the Spirit is God. The same is true regarding the Spirit of <span class="pg" data-page-id="629" id="629">[629]</span> Christ.

In this message we shall consider the matter of the dispensation of the Triune God according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto His glory. Here we have four important words: dispensation, righteousness, holiness, and glory. As we pointed out in the foregoing message, Paul does not use the word dispensation in Romans. Nevertheless, the fact of God’s dispensation is implied throughout this book. righteousness, holiness, and glory, on the contrary, are dealt with by Paul explicitly. God’s dispensation is according to His righteousness; that is, it is based upon His righteousness. Furthermore, it is through His holiness. This means that His dispensation is processed through holiness. Finally, this dispensation is unto God’s glory. It issues in the glory of God. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80903" data-verses="Romans 1:17">1:17</span> Paul says that the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80904" data-verses="Romans 3:21">3:21</span> he says that the righteousness of God has been manifested, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80905" data-verses="Romans 3:25-26">3:25 and 26</span> he speaks of the showing forth of the righteousness of God.

<p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK39bmTlGzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> These verses indicate that in the book of Romans righteousness is a footing, a standing, a base, for God’s dispensation. The dispensation of the Triune God into us is according to God’s righteousness. It is not according to the law nor according to virtue. It is uniquely according to the righteousness of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80909" data-verses="Psalms 89:14">Psalm 89:14</span> says that righteousness and justice are the foundation of God’s throne (ASV). God’s throne is based upon His righteousness. Without righteousness, even God’s throne would have no footing. Therefore, righteousness is crucial. </p>
<p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kLWg-zJ5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> The entire universe rests upon God’s righteousness. If suddenly there were no righteousness, the universe would collapse. Furthermore, the Bible reveals that God’s kingdom is built upon righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80910" data-verses="Hebrews 1:8">Heb. 1:8</span>). Human government is also based on at least some measure of righteousness. For example, if there were no righteousness in this country, the government would fall. In the same principle, if there were no righteousness in society or in our personal life, both society and our personal life would collapse. Righteousness is the supporting base upon which all things rest. The heavens, the earth, and everything in the universe are based upon God’s righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3byumGfVlY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> In His economy the Triune God desires to dispense Himself into the three parts of man, into man’s spirit, soul, and body. However, if God does not meet the requirements of His righteousness, He cannot carry out the dispensation of Himself into us. His dispensation must be according to His righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCIHepPWNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi"> The Bible reveals that there is a relationship between God and man. In this relationship a number of transactions take place. These transactions must always be based upon righteousness. Therefore, for God’s dispensation, the first basic requirement is God’s righteousness. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs__Pzn6Zet51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7">THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD’S RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br/>HOLINESS, AND GLORY</h2><p data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-vdcKLHkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc"> Three of the divine attributes—righteousness, holiness, and glory—place requirements upon us. Righteousness is <span class="pg" data-page-id="637" id="637">[637]</span> versus sin. I believe that we all are aware of the requirement of God’s righteousness. But we may not be aware of the demands of God’s holiness and glory; we may have no realization that glory is one of God’s requirements. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80911" data-verses="Romans 3:23">3:23</span> Paul points out that we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. This means that we have not fulfilled the requirement of God’s glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK39bmT8PzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80912" data-verses="Genesis 3:24">Genesis 3:24</span> indicates that as soon as man fell, he could not meet the requirements of God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory. This verse says that God “placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.” The sword signifies God’s righteousness; the flame, God’s holiness; and the cherubim, God’s glory. The sword kills, the fire consumes, and the cherubim observe. Because man had fallen and had become sinful, the way to the tree of life was barred by God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory. Praise the Lord that through Christ’s redemption the requirements of God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory have been fulfilled and the way to the tree of life has been opened once again. In order for man to have a proper relationship with God, these three requirements had to be fulfilled. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kLWg-WH5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl">THREE SECTIONS</h2><p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3byumG-alY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory form the basic structure of the book of Romans. Romans can be divided into several sections. After the introduction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80913" data-verses="Romans 1:1-17">1:1-17</span>) and the section on condemnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80914" data-verses="Romans 1:18">1:18—3:20</span>), there are sections on justification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80915" data-verses="Romans 3:21">3:21—5:11</span>), sanctification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80916" data-verses="Romans 5:12">5:12—8:13</span>), and glorification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80917" data-verses="Romans 8:14-39">8:14-39</span>). These sections are related respectively to God’s righteousness, holiness, and glory. Therefore, these three divine attributes are related to the very structure of the book of Romans. </p>
<p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRf94B4TOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> In which of these three sections are we today? The correct answer is that we are in the section of sanctification. We have passed through justification, but we are not yet in glorification. We all are destined to spend the whole of our Christian life on earth in the section on sanctification. I <span class="pg" data-page-id="638" id="638">[638]</span> have been in this section for more than fifty years. Do not be disappointed by the length of time you must spend in this section. The time may seem long to you, but it is not to the Lord, with whom a thousand years are as one day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80918" data-verses="2Peter 3:8">2 Pet. 3:8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="W6M7Oy32WPXJ9oEfDVPDLQgTO1hwFBh-DPDpiglJ06Fz2tkvXU9eln1tSuOOiwciq"> Although we are not yet in the section on glorification, we may nonetheless enjoy something of glorification while we are in the section on sanctification. We may enjoy the foretaste or firstfruit of glorification. Sometimes when I am alone with the Lord, I experience a foretaste of the glorification to come. Every proper Christian should have experiences like this. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxVhlxOgl3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> God’s dispensation must be according to His righteousness. If Christ had not become a man with flesh and blood and if He had not died on the cross to take away our sins, it would have been impossible for God to dispense Himself into us. When some hear this, they may argue, “To say this is to be too legal and strict. Don’t you know that God is love? He is not that strict and legal. Because God the Father loves me, He can simply come to me and dispense Himself to me, no matter how sinful I may be.” Such a concept ignores the fact that God is a God of righteousness. As such a righteous One, He is more strict and more legal than any of us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkTiLfx4l-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> Yes, God is the Father and He does love us. However, according to the parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80919" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span>, we cannot come directly to the Father. The prodigal needs the shepherd (the Son) to seek him and to find him, and he needs the woman (the Spirit) to enlighten him so that he can wake up, repent, and decide to come home to the Father. Only through the Son’s seeking and finding and through the Spirit’s enlightening can sinners return to the Father. Without the Son’s redemption and the Spirit’s enlightenment, we cannot come home to Him. Furthermore, if the Son had not died for us, the Father would not have the ground to receive us. However, because of the redemptive death of His Son, the Father has the ground to receive all who come to Him through Christ. This indicates that the Father’s receiving of us must be according to His righteousness. Apart from <span class="pg" data-page-id="639" id="639">[639]</span> the incarnation and crucifixion of Christ, there is no way for the righteous God to receive us and to impart Himself into us. If God were to dispense Himself into us without the requirement of His righteousness being fulfilled, He would place Himself in an unrighteous position. Therefore, the dispensation of the Triune God must be according to His righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVx9OlXtbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> God’s righteousness required that we die because of our sin. However, if we had died, we would have perished. Because God does not want us to perish, He provided Christ as our substitute. Christ died on the cross for us according to God’s righteousness to fulfill God’s requirements. The purpose of Christ’s death on the cross was not to enable us to go to heaven when we die; it was to fulfill God’s righteous requirements so that He could dispense Himself into us. </p>

We have seen that righteousness is God’s procedure, holiness is God’s nature, and glory is God’s expression. God’s dispensation, therefore, is according to His righteous way, through His holy nature, and unto the expression of Himself. God’s expression is mainly in the church. Thus, the goal of the dispensation of the Triune God is that God may be expressed in the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeNYx0rzjT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-">THE HIGHEST RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomedxm0s65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that God’s righteousness is related to the death of Christ, which terminated all negative things. Because of the fall of man, everything in creation has become unrighteous. For example, it is unrighteous for mosquitoes to pester us. Furthermore, there is unrighteousness in every aspect of society. Adam was the head of the old creation. When he fell, everything under his headship became unrighteous in the eyes of God. The death of Christ terminated these unrighteous things and fulfilled the requirements of the righteousness of God. Hence, the death of Christ is the highest righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVs3oh-Ywxl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> When Christ died on the cross, we died also, for we died in Him. We were identified with Christ in His death.

Moreover, with the resurrection of Christ there is the function of sanctifying, which includes transforming and conforming. Eventually, we by this process of sanctification shall be conformed to the image of the Son of God. This is the subjective experience of sanctification. Sanctification is the subjective activity of holiness; it is holiness in action. Sanctification is actually the resurrected Christ working God’s holy nature into our being. This is vastly different from the concept of holiness found among so-called holiness people. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3k6z89fgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ">GLORIFICATION,<br/>THE ISSUE OF SANCTIFICATION</h2><p data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJgvjKk-10stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q"> The issue of sanctification is glorification, the expression of God.

<p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HHefrgar0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> Glorification began on the day of Pentecost.

When He was resurrected, the one grain of wheat became the many grains to form the loaf, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80933" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80934" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:17">1 Cor. 10:17</span>). Hence, the church was brought forth on the day of resurrection. But what was it that happened on the day of Pentecost? On that day the church was glorified. If we had been present at the meeting of the church on the day of Pentecost, we would have exclaimed, “What glory!” We would not have spoken about righteousness or sanctification, for we would have had an overwhelming sense of glory. </p>

How does the Son glorify the Father? He glorifies the Father in oneness. The oneness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80937" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span> is the church. The oneness of the saints is the proper church life. When the oneness is realized in a thorough way, <span class="pg" data-page-id="647" id="647">[647]</span> the Son glorifies the Father in the church. This indicates that wherever there is the proper church life, there is the glorification of the Father, for the church life expresses the Father. Therefore, if we gather together as the church in a normal way, we should have the sense that there is glory in our meetings. The church life is altogether a matter of glorification. The church is God’s goal; it is not God’s procedure or His way. God’s intention is to be glorified in the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="D5w8-kFdQxmkmF1GzR6c9rrTqKPPWrkUq03mqLc30FIAV31DN5B-3O4zuykkIOmJX">THE MORE SANCTIFICATION, THE MORE GLORY</h2><p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6WmvcH7evTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> The glorification of the church that began at Pentecost has not yet reached its consummation. On the contrary, the process of glorification is still taking place. According to the condition of the church, there may be more glory at certain times than at others. How much glory is manifested in the church depends upon our degree of sanctification. The spectators at the basketball game may be very enthusiastic. However, with them there is no glory; there is only excitement, because there is no sanctification. The more we are sanctified through Christ’s saturating our being with His holy nature, the more we shall express God when we come together as the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="gTWF_O-VusFLsBnICnGAE1lD1HlcJrTjqrrJfkDlEYM2QChTjzMfb7iFBzHc2B8W3"> Sanctification is primarily an individual matter, whereas glorification is mainly a corporate matter. Suppose I lose my temper with my wife during the day. This damages my personal sanctification. Although I confess to the Lord and receive His cleansing, I may have no sense of the glory in the meeting that night, even though everyone else is conscious of it. Because I am short of sanctification, I cannot sense the glory which others can sense. I do not have the sanctification in my personal life to give me a sense of glory in the meeting. However, suppose I stay in fellowship with the Lord all day, even when my wife gives me a difficult time. Everything that happens during the day only helps the process of sanctification. Therefore, in the meetings, I will be able to sense the glory. This illustrates the fact that the more sanctification we experience, the more we shall participate in the glorification. <span class="pg" data-page-id="648" id="648">[648]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8y7QGTL0JuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo"> Glory, the expression of God in the church, is God’s goal in His dispensation. However, sanctification is the process, and righteousness is the supporting ground. Therefore, the dispensation of the Triune God is according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto the goal of His glory. </p>

Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80940" data-verses="Romans 8:6">verse 6</span>, this life can be dispensed into our mind and can cause our mind to be life also. Ultimately, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80941" data-verses="Romans 8:11">verse 11</span> discloses, the divine life can even be imparted into our mortal bodies. In these verses we see the three parts of man: the spirit, the soul (represented by the mind), and the body. The spirit is the center, the body is the circumference, and the mind is in between. From the center through the middle to the circumference, the life of the Triune God is being dispensed into our entire being. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80942" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span> Paul speaks of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus. In this phrase the Triune God is implied. The Spirit and Christ, the Son, are mentioned explicitly, whereas God the Father is implied by the fact that the Spirit is the Spirit of God. Hence, here we have God, Christ, and the Spirit. However, the main point is not the Triune God, but life. To speak of the Spirit of life is actually to say that the Spirit is life. The life here is the very life of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLVo7_MvoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP"> When we were regenerated, we received another life, a life in addition to our natural life. There are various kinds of life: plant life, animal life, human life, and divine life. As <span class="pg" data-page-id="649" id="649">[649]</span> humans, we all have a physical life and a psychological life. The physical life and the psychological life are indicated by the Greek words <em>bios</em> and <em>psuche</em> respectively. When Paul speaks of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80943" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, however, he uses still another Greek word, the word <em>zoe.</em> In the Bible <em>zoe</em> denotes God’s life, the divine, infinite, uncreated, eternal life. This is the life we receive by believing in the Lord Jesus. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80944" data-verses="John 3:36">John 3:36</span> says, “He who believes in the Son has eternal life.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80945" data-verses="Romans 8:2">verses 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80946" data-verses="Romans 8:6">6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80947" data-verses="Romans 8:10">10</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80948" data-verses="Romans 8:11">11</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80949" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, Paul uses this Greek word for life to indicate that the dispensation of God is to dispense <em>zoe</em> into our being. In other words, God desires to dispense Himself as <em>zoe</em> into all three parts of man’s being. </p>

As a result of this dispensation, we, the chosen people of God, have both the human life and the divine life. Every kind of life, even the lowest plant life, is a mystery. No scientist can fully explain how a little seed grows into a beautiful flower. Within the seed there is an element of life that brings forth a flower with a certain shape and color. How wonderful! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYe9m3toydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs">THE MOST WONDERFUL CREATED LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52x6jYABW2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH"> Among the various forms of created life, the most wonderful is the human life. Contrary to the opinion of many, the angelic life is not more wonderful than the human life. It is wrong to think that angelic life is better than human life. God did not ordain the angelic life to contain the divine life. Rather, He created the human life to be the vessel for the divine life. Although you may consider yourself inferior to the angels, God considers you better than angels. Nevertheless, subconsciously some, especially sisters, may desire to be angels. The Bible, however, does not speak of God’s love for angels, but it reveals His love for man. Angels are simply God’s servants. In His eyes, the most wonderful life among all His creatures is the human life. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q9hBv6ZhIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80955" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span> says, “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” Hence, the angels were not created in the image and likeness of God, but man was. Do you realize that you were made in the image of God and according to God’s likeness? We are not descendants of apes, but are descendants of the man created in the image of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="656" id="656">[656]</span> Simply by having the image of God and by bearing the likeness of God, we look like God. This is the clear revelation in the holy Word. Because man was created according to God, the human life is the best of all created lives. Therefore, we can be proud of the fact that we are human beings. Praise the Lord that we are men and not angels! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_riC6l_N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB">IMAGE, LIKENESS, AND REALITY</h2><p data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGzs_2G_Z_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv"> One day, through the incarnation of Christ, God Himself became a man. In this way God identified Himself with man. Jesus, God incarnate, was both God and man. The incarnation of Christ not only brought God down to man’s level, but it also uplifted man to God’s level. By creation man had both the image of God and the likeness of God, but he did not have in him the reality of God. The incarnation brought the reality of God into man. The Lord Jesus had not only God’s image and likeness; He also embodied the reality of God, for God was in Him. In principle, the same is true of everyone who has been regenerated. As regenerated persons, we not only bear the image of God and have the likeness of God, but we also have within us the reality of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxVhnxOgt3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv">A VESSEL TO CONTAIN GOD</h2><p data-content-id="ulj2QtwtmY3coQnBmkTiJfx4t-_lStW0CklyG_bwLOmNh_ZJH8XyK5AePf0CTaRJ4"> The Bible reveals that man was created as a vessel to contain God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80956" data-verses="Romans 9:21">9:21</span> Paul speaks of vessels to honor and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80957" data-verses="Romans 9:23">9:23</span>, of vessels of mercy prepared unto glory. God Himself is the real honor and glory. Therefore, the fact that we are vessels to honor prepared unto glory means that we have been designed to contain God as our honor and glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="fgW6Wai0G5aaLXpbAJVx_OlbvbuCdsmWgE9wB7qKLnQKhSg8wAz_4k5AwMkTlY_Av"> We may use a glove as an illustration of man as a vessel, a container, of God. Because the purpose of a glove is to contain the hand, the glove is made in the likeness of the hand. The hand has a thumb and four fingers, and the glove also has a thumb and four fingers. Although the glove is not the hand, it is made in the likeness of the hand in order to contain the hand. In the same principle, man is a vessel to <span class="pg" data-page-id="657" id="657">[657]</span> contain God. For this reason, he was made according to the likeness of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeNZx066jT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> If you put your hand into a glove designed for it, your hand will feel comfortable in the glove. In like manner, God feels comfortable in man. However, He would not feel comfortable in an animal or even in an angel. Only in man does God feel at home, at rest. Heaven may be God’s temporary dwelling place, but His real home is man. </p>
<p data-content-id="HW9i2wmEWYqFrJ4rhomecxmpi65lktIqDjo9SYfcuyFdby4qHNSpP1Cn1Voh_Nrft"> We are all “gloves” designed to contain God as the divine hand. We were made in a form that is suitable to be the place of God’s dwelling. God has a mind, a will, and emotions, and we do too. As humans, we should not be jellyfish, beings without a strong will. A proper human being must not only have a mind and a will, but also be full of emotion. We should find it easy to laugh or to weep. We should not be like statues incapable of expressing feeling no matter what the situation may be. The Bible reveals that God is rich in emotion. He hates, He loves, and He becomes angry. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80958" data-verses="John 11:35">John 11:35</span>, the Lord Jesus, God incarnate, wept. Therefore, to be a vessel to contain God, man was created with emotions. Emotion is extremely important, for God Himself is rich in emotion; He is not a God of stone. </p>
<p data-content-id="XaV63Rx9SxbwrDL9KVs3ph-B_xl_JxfaGxR5ghCLgAXpQCJ_9oTiThGQlYg1itVtA"> All of man’s virtues are created according to God’s attributes. For example, human kindness is an image of God’s kindness. The same is true of gentleness. Man’s gentleness is according to the likeness of the gentleness of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kDRTATbch64DjIAOZ2Gbj-lUU_1IEI5QM97xIRbx_qUxOGtcCIc5vmI89JkocQ9dk">THE CAPACITY TO BE GODLY</h2><p data-content-id="J6LkSTesbhIsvZM0ScuxDStDVsvI7vdfmO6GlyS7SY-SF-_DHUhWpg2O4tqvfjiYx"> We are “gloves” in the likeness of the divine hand. This means that we do not have the thumb, but the form of the thumb; not the fingers, but the likeness of the fingers. For example, our gentleness is a container for God’s gentleness. Our gentleness is only the form, whereas God’s gentleness is the substance, the reality. Because we were created according to the likeness of God, we have the capacity to be godly, that is, to be like God. Animals can never be godly, for they are not in the likeness of God and cannot contain Him. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="658" id="658">[658]</span> in our love, kindness, and gentleness we can show forth godliness, God-likeness. </p>
<p data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24bl4QfYZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4"> In His creation of man, God made man as a vessel to contain Him with the intention of coming into this vessel and filling it with Himself. When God enters into the vessels created by Him, He finds that the vessels are a proper match for Him. He has emotion, and His container has emotion also. Therefore, in the container God has a place to put, to dispense, His own emotion. In this way human emotion and divine emotion become one. The divine emotion is the content, and the human emotion is the container and the expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbR9SeG9fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> Although this revelation is in the Bible, not many have seen it. We praise the Lord that in His recovery this revelation has been made more than clear. No more are we veiled to the fact that man is a vessel to contain God and that God feels at home in such a wonderful vessel. If we see this, then we shall be able to understand the subject of this message: not an exchanged life, but a grafted life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocXlryGwnWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu">DISPENSATION, NOT EXCHANGE</h2><p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwA4oYpUqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> We have seen that when the divine life enters into the human life, the divine life becomes the content and the human life becomes the container and the expression. But there is no exchange, or trade, of lives. This means that we do not exchange the human life for the divine life. Instead of exchange, there is a dispensation. The empty glove is filled with the hand. Using another figure of speech, we may say that man is like a tire that needs to be filled with air. The air is dispensed into the tire and fills it, but the air is not exchanged for the tire. In like manner, the divine air, the heavenly <em>pneuma,</em> is dispensed into us, but it is not exchanged for our human life. Rather, as we shall see, it is dispensed into us and mingled with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZ8yvyU4Pm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> Some Christian teachers regard the Christian life as an exchanged life. According to this concept, our life is poor and Christ’s life is superior. Therefore, the Lord asks us to give up our life in exchange for His. We yield our life to Him, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="659" id="659">[659]</span> He replaces it with His own life. However, our Christian life is not an exchanged life. It is altogether a matter of the divine life dispensed, infused, into our human life. This is a basic concept in the Scriptures. </p>

In this message we shall consider the function of the grafted life. In order to see this, we need to ask the Lord to remove all the veils that keep us from receiving a true understanding of this book. We may read the book of Romans again and again, but we may not know that we are covered by layer upon layer of veils. Because many readers of this book are veiled, they do not see the dispensation of the life of the Triune God, the grafted life, nor even the tripartite man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80973" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80974" data-verses="Romans 12:2">12:2</span> Paul speaks of transformation: “And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.” The world, the satanic system, is composed of various ages, each with a certain pattern and style. Satan’s design is to conform us to this present age. Although Paul mentions Satan’s goal of conformation on the negative side, he does not here speak of the object of transformation. He simply exhorts us to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYpoX_QhGtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> The goal of transformation is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80975" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80976" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Verse 29</span> says, “Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the <span class="pg" data-page-id="668" id="668">[668]</span> firstborn among many brothers.” As the called and justified ones, our destiny has been determined beforehand by God. Before the foundation of the world God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son. This means that conformation to Christ is our destiny and also our destination. Do you know where we are going? Our destination is the image of the Son of God. Our destiny is not heaven—it is to be conformed to the image of the Son of God. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80977" data-verses="Romans 11:24">11:24</span> Paul speaks of the grafting of two olive trees, not of two entirely different kinds of trees. Hence, the grafting in Romans is that between two trees of the same family. The difference is that one is a cultivated olive tree and that the other is a wild olive tree. </p>
<p data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmg00QsqLO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80978" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapter five</span> of Romans, Paul begins to speak about life.

This grafting can be effective only if the lives to be grafted are similar. That there is a similarity between the human life and the divine life is proved by the fact that God created man in His image and according to His likeness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80987" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). He did this purposely so that the human life would be very <span class="pg" data-page-id="669" id="669">[669]</span> much like the divine life. Once again we use a glove as an illustration. In form, in likeness, and in function the glove is the same as the hand. Otherwise, the hand could not fit into the glove. We are all gloves made according to the likeness of the divine hand. How we need to worship God for making us in His image and according to His likeness. Praise Him for making us vessels to contain Him! God created us in this way intentionally so that He could put His Son into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="UqBgSATZFzjMzgEp417GFYJzw1xgKXvUQyEWJUYS-TXP1nS_wiU97iWTTyfIBgHn8"> Because the human life and the divine life are similar, it is possible for them to be put together. This means that the divine life and the human life can be “married.” On the day we were saved we were married to Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80988" data-verses="Romans 7:4">Rom. 7:4</span>). Hence, to be a Christian is not only a matter of salvation or regeneration, but also of being married to Christ. The life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80989" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> is a grafted life, a mingling of two different yet similar lives. Transformation and conformation are by such a grafted life. Through my more than fifty years as a Christian, I have learned that the life which is transforming me and conforming me to the image of the Son of God is a grafted life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MzlP5jPtdKoQogPXIaLVu7_ApoK0XP8VXKQ2Amlr8-5gUX4ygtSvRasg1JNIx-6YP">QUALIFIED TO COME INTO US</h2><p data-content-id="V1g3B3M1YtKPMdIVepsuJa4ZQ8vmK9-mV96xCmBgtax0zFr0tacLZkPkBIknH3eX6"> From the time God created us in His image and according to His likeness, we were ready to receive Him into us as life. We had a spirit to receive Him and a soul to express Him. Although we were ready, God was not yet ready. He was not yet qualified to come into man. In order to become qualified for this, He had to put on humanity; that is, He had to be incarnated. In Old Testament times, God could come upon the prophets, but He could not come into them. Many Christians today only know how God comes upon people, not how He enters into them. In a very real sense, they are Old Testament believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="i_dHfnGm4FvIls7i1XIfnd-3C0V9n7bLaF0kyEi3JnbGMF4jJw0bkyhOzrpf0Im-0"> The New Testament reveals that through the incarnation of Christ, God came into humanity. He entered into mankind through a narrow gate, having been born of a virgin in a manger in Bethlehem. For thirty years He lived in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="670" id="670">[670]</span> home of a carpenter. One day He came forth to begin His ministry. No one could recognize that this man was God Himself. Contacting some young fishermen in Galilee, He said, “Follow Me,” and they followed Him, although He seemingly had nothing. He had such drawing power that His followers were beside themselves with love for Him. They were drawn to Him because there was something magnetic about Him. They had a marvelous time the three and a half years they were with Him. However, one day He suddenly told His disciples that He was going to leave them by being crucified. This word deeply troubled them, especially Peter. Then the Lord told them that it was profitable for them that He go away. Otherwise, the Spirit of reality could not come to be in them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80990" data-verses="John 16:7">John 16:7</span>). Up until that time, the Lord had only been among them; He had not yet come into them. After His resurrection, He could be in them, and they could be in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="80991" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span>). Nevertheless, Peter and the other disciples probably preferred to have the Lord remain among them rather than have Him go so that in resurrection He could come into them. </p>

<p data-content-id="SYIWDKewcSSFw8aKi6WmocHqRvTET3G9s2wfZYbMVigg3U7MKm03zsL3Qa658RF6P"> As believers in Christ, our relationship with the Lord is wholly a matter of life. Beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80995" data-verses="Romans 5:10">5:10</span>, Paul has much to say about life. In this verse he says that “we shall be saved in His life,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80996" data-verses="Romans 5:17">5:17</span>, that we “shall reign in life.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80997" data-verses="Romans 6:4">6:4</span> he says, “Even so we also should walk in newness of life.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80998" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span> Paul speaks of the Spirit of life, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="80999" data-verses="Romans 8:10">8:10</span> he says that our “spirit is life because of righteousness.” Furthermore, the mind set on the spirit is life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81000" data-verses="Romans 8:6">8:6</span>), and the divine life is imparted into our mortal bodies through the Spirit of Him who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81001" data-verses="Romans 8:11">8:11</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gTWF_O-VusFLsBnICnGAD1le5HlcJrTjqrrJfkDlEYM2QChTjzMfb7iFBzHc2B8W3">GOD’S GOAL</h2><p data-content-id="eYZFWFYl3hdVSoHRn8y7XGTS5JuwGkBzvU_EN_g3avWcTkP7eSF3JpmIdXqSBM5eo"> Through the growth and function of the divine life within us, God will reach His goal to produce many sons to form the Body to express Christ. Today Christ, the Son of God, is no longer simply the only begotten Son, but also the firstborn among many brothers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81002" data-verses="Romans 8:29">8:29</span>). As the firstborn Son, He is the prototype and pattern of sonship for all who believe in Him. Eventually, all the sons of God will form a living organism, the Body, to express Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="5-2b1UA37EfmJDg822Fsn6eqTifM-n62obkVi4QG-r8WoAXYLydr3GGuNOJVf4c_n"> Through the expression of Christ in the Body, the Father is glorified. This is related to righteousness and sanctification. Righteousness is the beginning, the foundation, sanctification is the process, and glory is the consummation. The process by which we are brought fully into glory is altogether a matter of transformation in life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="676" id="676">[676]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NG-MIug9KfqNRIUOGmg01QsLAO0qYP_o1SVm72wGSY4fFaUn915arg8Fmp9Gb5rHB">THE HUMAN LIFE AND THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="ziHR8n_PindtiOIcr24bj4QfQZn91SbNtgwyNiF8IIQSL5wc-70CYM8j6TMV8Brt4"> The life by which we are transformed is a grafted life, the mingling of the human life with the divine life. According to God’s sovereignty in creation, the human life is similar to the divine life, just as a glove is similar to a hand. Unless there is a hand, the glove has no purpose and is useless. In the same principle, unless it contains God, the human life is purposeless and useless. The human life was created in the image of the divine life and according to the likeness of the divine life for the purpose of containing the divine life. If it does not contain the divine life, the human life is like an empty glove that has no purpose. The meaning of human life is to contain the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbR7SeG1fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> The human life is complicated. Not only was it created by God, but it has become fallen, corrupted, and mixed with devilish, satanic things. Nevertheless, the good element created by God remains. For this reason, God loves the complicated human life. </p>
<p data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocXjryKynWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu"> In order to be received by the human life, the divine life had to pass through a process involving incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Through incarnation Christ put on a physical body so that He could shed His blood for our sins on the cross. On the cross, He not only accomplished redemption, but also terminated all the negative things in the universe. After crucifixion and burial, He entered into resurrection with His divine elements and was then able to germinate, generate, and transform us. Furthermore, in His ascension Christ has been exalted, glorified, and enthroned and has been given the headship, the lordship, and the kingship. Now the divine life is fully qualified and prepared to be received by the human life. </p>
<p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwA-oYlWqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> On the day we received the divine life into us, a wonderful marriage took place in our being. This was the marriage of the human life and the divine life. By means of this marriage we have become very special people. This is the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81003" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> Paul tells us that all things are ours. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. We who have a life that is married to the divine life are the <span class="pg" data-page-id="677" id="677">[677]</span> center, the focal point, of the universe. Within our being we have experienced the grafting of the human life to the divine life. The mingling of these two lives will produce proper sons for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Through this mingled and grafted life we shall be fully transformed and conformed to the image of God’s firstborn Son. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZ80vyY-Pm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI">THE PROCESS AND THE GOAL</h2><p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYe7m38nydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> Transformation and conformation are two very significant words. They are windows through which we can see into the depths of the revelation implied in the book of Romans. Transformation is related to the life process, and conformation is related to the life goal. It is crucial that we all have a full understanding of this process and this goal. What I intend to share regarding this is the product of more than fifty years of Christian experience considered in the light of God’s holy Word. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0wqcsQe2BLqZcgGT52x6lYAca2nlhsKGWgX0TE-TNQxqFp_MYcM-R9h-fDxCJKhWH">THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="7wPymQ8a__ZTM1nG4Q9hHv6AsIyRTBwsdqu1LPfqxrySdf1iMOmzJVgLAHkIf3vqI"> The New Testament says explicitly that we have been crucified with Christ and resurrected with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81004" data-verses="Romans 6:6">6:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81005" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81006" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5-6">Eph. 2:5-6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81007" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">Col. 3:1</span>). When I was young, I tried to figure out how I could have been crucified with Christ and buried with Him when His crucifixion and burial took place more than nineteen hundred years ago. Eventually, I read a book that pointed out that with God there is no time element. We are bound by time, but God, being eternal, is not bound in this way. Although it was helpful for me to see this, it had no practical effect on my life. I could believe that I had been crucified and resurrected with Christ, but I was troubled and dissatisfied by the fact that there was still no practical effect in my living. I simply could not be satisfied with doctrine or theory. </p>
<p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_rkC6A9N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> Later, I began to see that in the life-giving Spirit there are many elements, many ingredients. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81008" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> we have the compound ointment, an ointment composed of olive oil, which signifies the Holy Spirit, compounded with four spices. These spices mainly signify Christ’s humanity, death, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="678" id="678">[678]</span> resurrection. In Old Testament times, before the Spirit was compounded, the Spirit was merely the Spirit of God, signified by the oil. The Spirit had not yet become the ointment, the compound Spirit produced through the addition of the spices. But through the process of Christ’s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ’s humanity, death, and resurrection have all been compounded with the Spirit of God. Therefore, the Holy Spirit today is the compound Spirit, the compound ointment with the elements of humanity, death, and resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGzs52Gea_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv">AN ALL-INCLUSIVE DOSE</h2><p data-content-id="xkG1-o0pBqTvDucoFmGJpyHsODqVtwFhqqe40KRYXUMufd9ja525_zAGs4syFSkfO"> Suppose you have a glass of plain water. Then a number of nourishing ingredients are added to the water to form a delicious drink. Thereafter, it is impossible to take in the water without drinking these ingredients. Sometimes a mother may add medicine to such a drink for a sick child. Although the child may refuse to take the medicine itself, the child will drink it when it is part of such a compound beverage. In this way, the medicine, added to a sweet-tasting drink, gets into him and spontaneously works within him. </p>
<p data-content-id="rJSeGWKOHdfaHmnHMNvFj7gPU0s2ITiK0ohdopi2dqKWoq-_NCrzVVynmOGSnbpLd"> Today the life-giving Spirit is an all-inclusive dose of divine “medicine,” full of ingredients. This dose is actually the processed Triune God Himself as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. In this Spirit are divinity, humanity, and Christ’s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Therefore, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, this all-inclusive Spirit with all these marvelous ingredients comes into us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtD8Mj2EFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF">GROWING TOGETHER WITH CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSIaX9V_qkAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> Now we come to a crucial point. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81009" data-verses="Romans 6:5">6:5</span> Paul says, “For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.” As believers in Christ, we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death. The likeness of Christ’s death refers to baptism. Furthermore, we shall also be in the likeness of Christ’s resurrection. This also implies the matter of <span class="pg" data-page-id="679" id="679">[679]</span> growing together with Christ, as understood from the first part of this verse. Therefore, Paul is saying that if we have grown together with Christ in the likeness of His death, we shall also be growing together in the likeness of His resurrection, that is, in the newness of life mentioned in the previous verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYQcEvUNOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81010" data-verses="Romans 6:5">Romans 6:5</span> includes two steps of our growth in Christ. The first step has already taken place, whereas the second is progressive. On the one hand, we have grown together with Christ, but, on the other hand, we shall be growing in the likeness of His resurrection. We have grown in baptism, and we shall be growing in the newness of life. </p>

<p data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvMwYAX5773NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr"> In this message we shall consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81023" data-verses="Romans 8:1-11">8:1-11</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81024" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8:1</span> Paul says, “There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.” It is easy for us to take this verse for granted and assume that we understand it, perhaps thinking that the condemnation here is the same as that spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81025" data-verses="Romans 3:1">chapter three</span>. But the condemnation described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81026" data-verses="Romans 2:1">chapters two and three</span> has been removed before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81027" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8:1</span>. Hence, the condemnation in this verse is of another kind, a condemnation that is within us. The condemnation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81028" data-verses="Romans 2:1">chapters two and three</span> is something before God, not something according to our inward sense or consciousness. It is an objective condemnation, a condemnation according to God’s law. Before we were saved, we probably did not have any realization that in the sight of God we were condemned according to His righteous law. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, that condemnation was removed by Christ’s redeeming blood. Hallelujah, this condemnation has been washed away by the blood of Jesus! Therefore, we no longer have this condemnation. </p>
<p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaX9RwXob3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> We should not confuse the condemnation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81029" data-verses="Romans 2:1">chapters two and three</span> with that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81030" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8:1</span>. The condemnation in this verse is subjective; it is something inward that is according to our inner sense and also according to our Christian conscience. This is clear when we realize that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81031" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8:1</span> immediately follows <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81032" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span>. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81033" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span> carefully, we shall see that it describes a war within the various parts of our being. We know that as human beings we are made of more <span class="pg" data-page-id="688" id="688">[688]</span> than one basic part. As a result of the fall, the various parts of our being are not in harmony with one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qlyqOhn3LZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81034" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span> Paul, the writer of the book of Romans, tells us that a war is raging among his inward parts. One part wills to keep the law of God perfectly and to the uttermost. This part desires to delight in God, to please God, and to satisfy God. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81035" data-verses="Romans 7:22">7:22</span> Paul says, “For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man.” However, when this part of our being is exercised to do good and fulfill the law, another part rises up to fight. This part always defeats that part which delights in the law of God. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81036" data-verses="Romans 7:23">7:23</span> says, “But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive in the law of sin which is in my members.” The good part is defeated every time. We may take sides with this good part and stand with it against the other part, but we always suffer defeat and lose the battle. </p>
<p data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoarVsXAsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El"> We have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81037" data-verses="Romans 7:23">7:23</span> Paul speaks of being made a captive in the law of sin which is in his members. Is it not a pitiful situation to become a captive in this way? Yet we must realize that as Christians we may be captured every day by this law of sin. We are not captured by giant enemies outside of us, but by small enemies within us, for example, by our temper. Often we speak of losing our temper. Actually, it is more accurate to speak of being captured by the law of sin. It is not a matter of losing our temper; it is a matter of being a captive in the law of sin in our members. </p>
<p data-content-id="1UI9YbTGj9xXl5-SNvMwYAXkx73NHuSd0Po24SBAGtKJdS21NgE8Ie_46yu19-rRr"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81038" data-verses="Romans 7:24">Romans 7:24</span> says, “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” This cry is related to the condemnation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81039" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8:1</span>. This is not the condemnation that is objective and before God; it is the condemnation that is subjective, the condemnation within us. Furthermore, this condemnation is not a problem to God, but it becomes a problem to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="9LR_S6LwGCYJOeVfjGaX9RwOjb3CviwqjgP22eFDLMnGLXp1yWRXoVZR1f3DoGpL4"> Not many unbelievers experience this kind of condemnation. However, nearly all seeking Christians have a problem with it. When you did not seek the Lord but instead loved <span class="pg" data-page-id="689" id="689">[689]</span> the world, you did not have this problem. But when you began to love the Lord and seek Him, you spontaneously made up your mind to improve, even to be perfect and love the Lord to the uttermost. This decision gives rise to the war described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81040" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. Making up our mind to do good or to improve ourselves stirs up the law of sin in our members. It causes all the little enemies within to rise up and fight against us. There are many enemies within us. However, if a Christian does not love the Lord very much, or if he does not make up his mind to please the Lord, these enemies will not bother him. But as soon as he makes up his mind to do good, the enemies rise up. </p>
<p data-content-id="jH3Bzib3z705H1C0qlyqOhnSDZaIuDBGTLLUVCbYU8Yb329qSFzXZNMUxFexL4cqV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81041" data-verses="Romans 7:25">verse 25</span> Paul goes on to say, “Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve as a slave the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.” This is the conclusion of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81042" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span>. In this chapter we are not given the way to be delivered from subjective condemnation. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81043" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> is necessary. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Teq-X_A7lhgeTjpsrMoarVs2JsCd1m71FQpOTtemrKJgrjZ6AOmLKZqXS_HmOI9El">NO CONDEMNATION</h2><p data-content-id="nv_qRqddmz67yRxCN1PBQgUTqjprCBCu6V-xveNOMqiE0YTXAjDzq-hTNA3BW32BT"> Paul begins <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81044" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> with a word concerning condemnation: “There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.” Once again I would say that the condemnation here is inward. Here the writer can praise and declare that there is no longer any condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. When some read this verse, they may say, “I am in Christ Jesus. But how come I don’t have such a cry of victory? Instead, I am still sighing and moaning.” The reason is that actually and practically we may be in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81045" data-verses="Romans 7:24">7:24</span> and not in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81046" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8:1</span>. When we enjoy the Lord in a church meeting, we may have a sense of victory. We are then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81047" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8:1</span>. But after the meeting, we may be defeated again and find ourselves once more in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81048" data-verses="Romans 7:24">7:24</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="6ANzUA-iUjeJrXG0OumVDlKcYqeqVJQuX5wL_kKU5dq3C7vF1_YQpuJ09rnAq0MJO"> We need to pay attention to the tense of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81049" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8:1</span>. This verse is in the present tense, not in the future. Paul does not say, “There will be no condemnation”; he says that there is now no condemnation. When a problem comes up, we should remember this and declare, “There is now no condemnation.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="690" id="690">[690]</span> For example, when you come home after a meeting and your husband or wife is about to bring up a troublesome matter, you need to remember that at that very moment there is no condemnation. If we declare <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81050" data-verses="Romans 8:1">8:1</span> in the midst of our daily situations, we shall see how effective the word of God is. </p>
<p data-content-id="RRUrZa0dvyz7r8k3lCUpa1IaLLT7GZHs7O9Lgyqlqhw7CeO8ACPd1Y2-5rrPSFRGa"> We need to proclaim God’s word to the enemy, to the demons. Wherever we go, we must declare the word of God. In particular, we must declare that there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ. Satan will lie to us and say that we are defeated, even though we are in Christ. Do not accept this lie, and do not believe it. Instead, declare the word of God. Declare that to those who are in Christ there is now no condemnation. </p>

He has a definite base, ground, to make such a statement. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81052" data-verses="Romans 8:2">verse 2</span> he says, “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.” In the next verse he goes on to say, “For, the law being impossible in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.” According to this verse, God sent His own Son not only in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He also sent Him concerning sin. </p>

It is important that we learn how this law works, how it frees us from the law of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcBe0A0CNNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r"> All that Paul covers in the remainder of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81082" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> is related to the working of the law of the Spirit of life.

<p data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1Y7STC8RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM"> Many Christian teachers say that the Spirit is the subject of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81083" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. This understanding is too shallow. Actually, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81084" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> talks about the law of the Spirit of life. This will become clear to us if we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81085" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> carefully in the light of what Paul says concerning the law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81086" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81087" data-verses="Romans 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81088" data-verses="Romans 7:1">seven</span>. It would also be helpful to trace Paul’s thought concerning this matter backward from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81089" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81090" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapter five</span>. The revelation in these chapters is marvelous. It is crucial for us to see that the subject, the topic, of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81091" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> is not merely the Spirit, but the law of the Spirit of life. </p>

We must even go on to ask this crucial question: Who is this law? If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81092" data-verses="Romans 8:1">chapter eight</span> carefully and compare it with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81093" data-verses="Romans 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81094" data-verses="Romans 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81095" data-verses="Romans 7:1">seven</span>, we shall see that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="696" id="696">[696]</span> law of the Spirit of life is the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us. This means that the processed Triune God is Himself the law of the Spirit of life. Just as sin is a person—Satan—so this law is also a Person—the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="_9QBA933oHeiswgPTE_rmC6A1N_jbOxP1UbyLmOwA6_xLIPWpVJLOZxTBQldsrCnB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81096" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> speaks of the process, even the processes, through which the Triune God has passed to become the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81097" data-verses="Romans 8:3">verse 3</span> Paul refers to incarnation and crucifixion: “God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.” The phrase, “God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin,” is related to incarnation. God’s sending His Son concerning sin and condemning sin in the flesh point to Christ’s crucifixion. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81098" data-verses="Romans 8:11">verse 11</span> also implies crucifixion, for it speaks of the Lord Jesus being raised from among the dead. However, what this verse clearly reveals is the process of resurrection: “But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81099" data-verses="Romans 8:34">verse 34</span> Paul refers to the ascension when he tells us that Christ is at the right hand of God interceding for us. Therefore, in this chapter we have four processes through which the Triune God has passed: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="BZKY4OKCmwZYwX5eGGzs72GeS_RmaiPjp9o0S_T97oXbgFsRDP8KKOzfc4adBNMWv"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81100" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> also reveals the Triune God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81101" data-verses="Romans 8:2">verse 2</span> we have the Spirit of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81102" data-verses="Romans 8:3">verse 3</span> we have God, the Father, sending His Son. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81103" data-verses="Romans 8:2-3">verses 2 and 3</span> we have the Spirit, the Father, and the Son. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81104" data-verses="Romans 8:9-10">Verses 9 and 10</span> speak of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81105" data-verses="Romans 8:11">Verse 11</span> mentions all three of the Triune God: the Spirit, He (the Father) who raised Christ Jesus, and Christ, the Son. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81106" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> is a chapter concerning the processed Triune God. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81108" data-verses="Romans 8:11">verse 11</span> Paul clearly says that the One who raised Christ from among the dead gives life to our mortal bodies “through His Spirit Who indwells you.” This Spirit now dwells in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="dLW4-LNlvoeE8R_eIBtD-Mj6CFHhKujPE8NL2mhc8BXyQFgQmjCpGGwOObxDLPRmF"> As the life-giving Spirit, the processed Triune God dwells in us to give us life in a threefold way. The first aspect of this giving of life is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81109" data-verses="Romans 8:10">verse 10</span>: “And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.” This verse says that if Christ is in us, our spirit is life. Christ here is the very Triune God who has become the indwelling Spirit. Because this Christ is in us, our spirit is life, for as the life-giving Spirit, Christ dwells in our spirit, and His indwelling makes our spirit life. This is the first aspect of the giving of life revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81110" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="QgIYVvgNOtkKPvzzBSIaV9VzskAXN11e_slGJIew1bG_2sknTy3KnieMXxPnba73m"> The second aspect is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81111" data-verses="Romans 8:6">verse 6</span>: “For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.” The mind is the leading part of our soul. As such, it represents our soul. This means that when the mind becomes life, our soul becomes life. First our spirit is life, and then our soul also becomes life. </p>
<p data-content-id="KnI9YGwPrJ7ckWfcxrYQeEvYPOhzR6oFpQ8jGYqU-s7aEUzwZeSieXxA8a2QTSKCm"> Finally, life is imparted to our mortal bodies. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81112" data-verses="Romans 8:11">verse 11</span>, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead gives life to our mortal bodies through the indwelling Spirit. Therefore, life is imparted to us in a threefold way: Our spirit becomes life, our mind becomes life, and life is imparted to our mortal bodies. For this reason we can say that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81113" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, the Triune God is dispensed into the tripartite man and gives life to man’s spirit, soul, and body. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="l-PuTMu8HKITNGecWalGCNvAiavMLDNR8I4Ng60cy7M-m4XChuoiNRHeE-szXf7Na">A SCIENTIFIC CONCEPT OF LAW</h2><p data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7aVm-HQUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx"> The Triune God, who has been processed and who has dispensed Himself into us as tripartite human beings, is Himself the law of the Spirit of life. When Paul speaks of law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81114" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, he uses this term in a scientific way, even though, when the book of Romans was written, science had not yet developed. By law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81115" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span> Paul denotes a working principle which operates spontaneously. <span class="pg" data-page-id="698" id="698">[698]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg__LzBh5sEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> This concept of law is also found throughout <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81116" data-verses="Romans 7:1">chapter seven</span>. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81117" data-verses="Romans 7:21">7:21</span> Paul says, “I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me.” Here law denotes a principle which works automatically and naturally. This understanding of law is scientific. </p>
<p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYpoU_QIMtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81118" data-verses="Romans 7:1-2">Romans 7 and 8</span> there are two scientific laws: the first, an evil law, is called the law of sin and of death; the second, a good law, a marvelous law, is called the law of the Spirit of life. These two laws are mentioned in one verse, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81119" data-verses="Romans 8:2">8:2</span>, where Paul says, “The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.” These two laws are actually two persons. The law of sin and of death is the person of Satan, and the law of the Spirit of life is the Person of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8IdisuZvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> In order to become the law of the Spirit of life operating in us, the Triune God had to be processed and dispensed into us, and then He had to dwell, reside, in us. The Greek word for dwells in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81120" data-verses="Romans 8:9">8:9</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81121" data-verses="Romans 8:11">11</span> comes from a root which means house. The Triune God has been processed and dispensed into us, and now He houses Himself in our tripartite being. Now this One is a wonderful, positive law, the law of the Spirit of life. The negative law, the law of sin and death, is also a person—Satan, the Devil, the one who has the power of death. He is the evil law. Therefore, these two laws are two persons. </p>
<p data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3k_z8xdgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ"> In order for Satan and the Triune God to become, respectively, the negative and positive laws operating in us, it was necessary for both persons to enter our being. If Satan had not come into man, he could not be the law of sin and death within man. In the same principle, if the Triune God had remained outside of us, He could not be to us the law of the Spirit of life. Praise Him that because He has been processed and dispensed into us, and He houses Himself in us, He has become to us the law of the Spirit of life! Hallelujah, we have such a marvelous law within us! </p>

Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81124" data-verses="Romans 8:3">verse 3</span> the subject is not the Son of God; the subject is God. In this verse Paul does not say that the Son of God came in the likeness of the flesh of sin. Rather, he says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. This means that, according to this verse, it is God who takes this action. He sent His Son through incarnation in the likeness of the flesh of sin. </p>
<p data-content-id="2W9xA1eAIl4E8SILwxVhsxO9n3sAXputgO3iVNMBKgGZVOctatuUIQomWtwMueUEv"> Following the first step of this process, incarnation, God went on to condemn sin by crucifixion. When the Son was crucified in the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin, God condemned sin in the flesh. Therefore, the death of the Son on the cross was God’s condemnation of sin. </p>

God sent His Son and condemned sin in the flesh for a particular purpose. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="704" id="704">[704]</span> means that something has issued from the incarnation and crucifixion. The issue, the result, of these two steps is that the righteous requirement of the law is spontaneously fulfilled in us. There is no need for us to try to keep the requirements of the law. The fulfillment of the righteous requirements of the law is an issue of the incarnation and crucifixion of Christ. Because the incarnate Christ has been crucified on the cross, the requirements of the law can be fulfilled in us automatically. </p>
<p data-content-id="IJNROswpKH5k7hMNeNeNSx0bzjT0a27FKLEqoteXo5k-BpQc3G3Hhl5TKi_bvZP6-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81126" data-verses="Romans 8:4">verse 4</span> Paul says that the requirements of the law are fulfilled “in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.” This indicates that God sent His Son and condemned sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fulfilled in a people who do not walk according to flesh, but walk according to spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="w_QXt_moIy43U-iBdBHesUzaRmL7iM3CET_8qgPLZCAY5YjmkXjovKLmYef-__VX0"> In eternity God intended to accomplish His purpose. We may say that God had an open highway set before Him and that He would move on this highway to fulfill His intention. However, an enemy called sin came in to block the way. Therefore, God sent His Son and condemned sin in the flesh in order to remove this obstacle from the highway. Through the incarnation and crucifixion of Christ, God condemned sin and removed it. As a result, the highway was opened again. The result, the issue, of the removing of sin and the reopening of the highway is that the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Lfx1wKzbliQSx16TKBKO9mRZsI30YBHHrY44NSzl6f4IERMTlybG5vKEKcg_8yytx"> Notice that here Paul does not say that the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in the Son of God. On the contrary, he says that they are fulfilled in us, the people who have been chosen, redeemed, visited, reached, and touched by God. Those designated by the pronoun “us” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81127" data-verses="Romans 8:4">verse 4</span> are all very important people because the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in them. Who are these people? They are God’s chosen ones, His selected ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="m_dk1X1M4f8yVl7b4CcBR0ApKNNw7j0w95epecPadutNopWnW4YgLkHQ_IvuAiZ-r"> Do you realize that God has selected you? Out of the billions of people who have lived on earth from the time of Adam, God has selected you. We may use a simple illustration to help us understand God’s selection. You may go to a <span class="pg" data-page-id="705" id="705">[705]</span> supermarket to shop for apples. There you may find a large pile of apples. Out of the many apples in this pile, you choose a dozen for purchase, selecting the apples you like. In a somewhat similar way, God has selected us. Instead of placing a high value on ourselves and thinking of ourselves as precious, we may despise ourselves and hate ourselves. God, however, does not hate us. In eternity He liked you and selected you. If you were to ask Him why He likes you, He may reply, “I simply like you.” We are God’s selected people. Furthermore, we are those whom He has redeemed, reached, and touched. According to the four Gospels, it is a great matter to be touched by God. Being touched by Him makes us different. I can testify that He touched me more than fifty years ago, and immediately I became a different person. We are among the “us” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81128" data-verses="Romans 8:4">verse 4</span>; we have been touched by God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZE2Xo_hDM4IaEOskwC1Y0STb1RVjFESE49bfOcTJw2KBluKcLW8qjrH40MQ5Hk4fM">WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="AASSCtDmK1f9-TowajCIOepPSNQqwjvVXcuThoSfSNPosHYtTOBx3QecotHxzuYbi"> We must believe God’s word and not consider our situation or look at ourselves. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81129" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Romans 8:4</span> says “fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.” When we read these words, we may say, “Most of the time I walk according to flesh, not according to spirit.” If someone asked you if you are walking according to spirit or according to flesh, you probably would not have the boldness to say that you walk according to spirit. In your realization, you do not have sufficient ground to say with confidence, “I walk according to spirit.” Instead, after hesitating you would probably reply, “Sometimes I walk according to spirit, but most of the time I walk according to flesh.” </p>
<p data-content-id="FlarFxm77vy39vIyjs__Gzn6det51xrT2YMcKellNBivSydYFFEOnULS16KVy66o7"> With respect to the matter of walking according to spirit, we need to remember that there are two worlds, two realms, the physical realm and the spiritual realm. In the spiritual realm God does everything by speaking. Once God speaks a certain thing, the matter is settled. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81130" data-verses="Romans 4:17">4:17</span> we are told that God calls things not being as being. This means that by speaking He calls things into being. For example, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81131" data-verses="Genesis 1:3">Genesis 1:3</span>, God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. <span class="pg" data-page-id="706" id="706">[706]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Crcabd22mNfUv4Pa26-vUcKLDkT9rEXUzzeTNLrKt0tm3ybW3oPCuTRz_4kSTJbKc">SPEAKING IN FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="PKNygk9fy05qBZMkpK39SmT8LzmTXbVTYDH5JSWTxfPlKVCnHhZ7JX43dKsj5lal6"> As children of God, we need to realize that when we speak something out of a sincere heart, our situation will be according to our speaking. Suppose someone asks you if you have been saved. You should answer definitely, “Yes, I am saved.” You should not hesitate and say, “Let me think about this for a while. According to certain evidences, maybe I am saved.” If you say that you may be saved, then perhaps you are saved. But if you say that signs indicate that you may not be saved, then perhaps there may be some question. Now that we are children of God, we should be careful of our speaking, for we are what we say we are. In a previous message I pointed out that we are what we eat. Now I wish to point out that we are what we say. </p>
<p data-content-id="-4STl3n-3zICiWDVK3kLfg-WL5Q5QJA8rcLF0AgCPfr2kpxjt_q8-MBrtTeHwSfQl"> The Bible refers to the believers as saints. Are you a saint? If you consider this question and say, “Well, I’m not a saint like Theresa or Francis. I really don’t think I’m very holy. How can I say that I am a saint?” If you talk like this, your condition is still that of a pitiful sinner. But if you answer by declaring, “Yes, I am a saint!” then you are truly a saint. </p>
<p data-content-id="p-HjAzkL6KAVG-u_I3bynmG-WlY1_JwSK0GOaB-EdF0NE4EiI0qBlGVwydGWrBDK6"> We must learn to speak not in our natural sincerity, but in faith. Paul tells us that we speak because we have a spirit of faith: “And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="81132" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:13">2 Cor. 4:13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="v3E8A9njhA75Yhd2gyRf04B0VOLi8H92f3jyWEaWGEMl-1M7NPIugkaqFT5XRv2Ak"> We Christians are good at hesitating, doubting, considering, and thinking matters over again and again. Suppose someone asks you if you love the Lord. You may be very slow to give an answer. You may ponder the question, not wanting to say anything that is not according to what you really are. You may think that you are being careful and humble. Actually you are being deceived by the enemy and cheated by him. In faith, we need to declare with boldness that we love the Lord. </p>

<p data-content-id="aiaGETS7fI8NwsgndKbR3SeX-fe62nfQwEWt890USj0vPS4d80AWOiuUAuK26lg3X"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81144" data-verses="Romans 8:9">8:9</span> Paul says, “But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.” In the foregoing message we pointed out that to be of Christ is a matter of position, but to be in spirit is a matter of condition. The position that we are of Christ is settled once for all; however, the condition of being in spirit may fluctuate. For this reason, we need to consider how to stabilize our condition of being in the spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bTrz6Fc2ucQmX9MwdocXvryX6nWBgTs8VA15tdM_SJgTIDAEMiOe6QZk-MHhxx9Vu">DECLARING THAT WE ARE IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="qgmCwFbT3SfjwGE9hHwAyoY8fqrC-kwvNxteDpBVCsd3AIDFtbrkXl93H35PeRym2"> One way to stabilize this condition is to declare that we are in the spirit. Learn to say, “I am in spirit!” In the past I encouraged you to call, “O Lord Jesus.” Now I am encouraging you to say, “I am in spirit.” Sometimes we can contact the Lord simply by saying “O”; it is not always necessary to say, “O Lord Jesus.” In the same principle, we do not always need to say, “I am in spirit,” for it may be adequate simply to say the word “in.” If you are about to lose your temper, exercise yourself to say “O” or “in.” This will help you to remain in the spirit. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81145" data-verses="Romans 8:9">verse 9</span>, we are in the spirit since the Spirit of God dwells in us. Now we can remain in this condition by declaring the fact that we are in the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="yphkdLoY5yM4WsliEDZ84vy9wPm8BWQzH9uPk036F4mD_g5TbOvAdal_byBRjkufI"> Among Christians today, there are many teachings concerning how to experience the Spirit. I can testify that these teachings may hinder us from experiencing the work of the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81146" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span> Paul does not say, “In order to be freed from the law of sin and death, you must fast and pray. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="712" id="712">[712]</span> law of sin is terrible, and it is too powerful for you to overcome. That is why I cried out, ‘Wretched man that I am. Who can deliver me?’” Paul did not teach the believers in this way. Neither did he teach that believers must confess all their sins to both God and man before they can experience the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="8zOxi_1FASn5273HeRYe3m3doydjbw7qBGcJORI_qHPr5y-7e1JFwVDuhxX0RuFCs"> To understand the matter of being in the spirit as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81147" data-verses="Romans 8:9">verse 9</span>, it will be helpful to consider how we were saved. When we heard the proclamation of the gospel, we recognized it and acknowledged it. There was no need for us to say, “From now on I must behave myself in a way that pleases God. In the past I have done many sinful things. If I confess my sins and make up my mind to improve my behavior, then I’ll be saved.” This is wrong. This mistaken concept can affect a person’s Christian life for years. After a person hears the proclamation of the gospel, he should simply utter a strong, “Amen!” and say, “Thank You, Lord Jesus.” Anyone who has the heart to accept, to acknowledge, what has been proclaimed to him through the preaching of the gospel will certainly be saved. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OCI_KN4GYiTY2O0Cpe7abm-HYUttGJ2ccYa7KczfVVyzrZqG1-9FH3kdmqYZdKUMx">ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROCLAMATION<br/>OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="4eHSgiiECRYj9Iiiwg__FzBhxsEFpjt3G75o_RYEK1Bvdl6Piwoqy5V_8yr393XMb"> Such an acknowledgment of God’s salvation not only helps a person to be saved; it is also a great help to that one’s Christian life in the future. Every aspect of the Christian life requires this kind of acknowledgment. Whenever a person acknowledges God’s salvation, says amen to the gospel, and thanks the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God enters into him immediately. This is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81148" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81149" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14">14</span>: “In Whom you also, hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise, Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of His glory.” Here we see that when the gospel is preached, proclaimed to us, and we acknowledge it, we are immediately sealed with the Spirit of God. From that time onward, the Spirit enters us and <span class="pg" data-page-id="713" id="713">[713]</span> dwells in us. This means that the fact of being indwelt by the Spirit of God begins from the time we acknowledge the gospel. This is true even if a person in a weak way makes this acknowledgment, says amen, and thanks the Lord for the proclamation of His salvation. At that very moment, the Spirit of God comes into him and begins to dwell in him. </p>
<p data-content-id="oT1dV8jdDerfF39gZYpoa_QEOtmvvhgZfUUqcM2_7PDHQQTxK4c74w82axGLFlxUg"> If a preacher of the gospel is one with God and according to God, he will go on to explain to a newly saved one that, since he has believed in Christ and received the Spirit, he should remain in the spirit. He may tell the new believer, “Right now you are not only of Christ and of the Spirit, but you are also in the spirit. Just stay in the spirit from now on. Whenever the thought or the desire comes to you to do something that is contrary to the Lord, you should declare, ‘I am in the spirit.’ This will be a great help to you in your Christian life.” </p>
<p data-content-id="3tKBsP8shoeNMiG16U8ITisibvFwBpNaUMsJR0LGdc8IYITGf0sEBKspRGcNn9k-V"> The well-known chorus of a gospel song says, “This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all the day long.” If we speak the fact that we are in the spirit, our story and song will be that we are in spirit. All day long we may praise the Savior that, because the Spirit of God dwells in us, we are now in the spirit. This will be a very effective inoculation against all the “bugs” sent by the enemy to trouble us in the Christian life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="G_rXVqFaknzBn_Nar_3kxz89bgCAz5s2tvNwnk0W3a0E1UJ4z4LnqbOTX8t1vdscJ">DISTRACTED FROM THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="carZaSsFYgix-JPzFJgvoKk-x0stAxcJwqrsldxLZREzY0Kv6lAEW1hJVWvmjwv5q"> Many Christians have received teachings that distract them from the spirit. Some have been taught in this way: “Now that you are a child of God, you must behave yourself and glorify God. The Devil, however, is busy. He never sleeps. He will tempt you, seduce you, and cause you to do many evil things. Formerly, you were under his control. Now that you have become a child of God, he will not let you go. Instead, he will do many things to trouble you. Therefore, you need to fast, pray, and exert all your effort to live a proper Christian life.” We have learned from experience that this kind of teaching distracts us from the spirit. The more we make up our mind to behave ourselves for the glory of <span class="pg" data-page-id="714" id="714">[714]</span> God, the more we become like the wretched man described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="81150" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Y-SwVAaLP2kExvYX31HHVfrger0xZ01CeA81PVuTO_ag0IZhDzVGSuqJ7jNcwnIXY"> Defeated Christians who seek the advice of preachers may be exhorted to pray more or to read the Bible more. But even these activities, when they are simply our own doings, can cause us to “switch off” the spirit. The divine electricity has been installed into us. Once it has been switched on, we should not turn the switch off. However, by their innocent doings, many Christians have turned off the switch. As a result, some begin to doubt if they have truly been saved, or if they really have the Spirit. This may cause them to go from one Christian group to another seeking help. This is the situation among many of today’s Christians. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKStomoiB0TVgGaB81D-ioARNCkQefxo1786oQtaQs3phAEmsIsEHfDkTPzIJOxrQ"> This kind of situation is very different from the good news of the gospel. The gospel is this: God selected us, predestinated us, and marked us out in eternity. Then one day the Son of God came to accomplish everything for our salvation. He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection and has become the life-giving Spirit. When you heard the proclamation of the good news and acknowledged it, this life-giving Spirit entered into you and began to dwell in your spirit. Now just stay in the spirit. Do not do anything that will take you away from the spirit. On the contrary, just declare that you are in the spirit. Proclaim this wonderful fact: “The gospel was a proclamation, and I have acknowledged it. Now the Spirit of God dwells in me, and I am in the spirit.” If we declare this in faith, nothing will be able to defeat us. On the contrary, everything will be under our feet. This is the glad tidings, the gospel of Christ, and the gospel of God. How marvelous! </p>
