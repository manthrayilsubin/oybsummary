<p data-content-id="GVl6hL1RbdLtgoiIWrfZMWaFeEfwV_FaMN07DfmDLeqfwYaggvoz0g-MHC6FX535n"> The subject of the book of Philemon is an illustration of the believers’ equal status in the new man. In the new man all the believers, whether masters such as Philemon or slaves such as Onesimus, have the same status. </p>

INTRODUCTION</h2><p data-content-id="Y7FV0FGHD8JqX6sEluhw894rZc6swsmoL9S7dndz7XZENkElJT6gA_zUYgRa8f8Qh"> The book of Philemon opens with the words, “Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-worker.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96178" data-verses="Philemon 1:2">verse 2</span> Paul refers to Apphia the sister and to Archippus and to the church in Philemon’s house. According to the family nature of this Epistle, Apphia must be Philemon’s wife, and Archippus, his son. Philemon lived in Colosse (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96179" data-verses="Philemon 1:2">v. 2</span>, see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96180" data-verses="Colossians 4:17">Col. 4:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96181" data-verses="Philemon 1:10">v. 10</span>, see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96182" data-verses="Colossians 1:2">Col. 1:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96183" data-verses="Colossians 4:9">4:9</span>). According to history, he was an elder of the church in Colosse. It should be that the church in Colosse met in his house. Hence, it was the church in his house. </p>
<p data-content-id="EnVfcd2SKWpHHtf6tqN6ElarWPwhAYcF4k4CZT4ozNLj29YQysE9Yc3hIww4BlyXW"> The introduction to this Epistle concludes with Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96184" data-verses="Philemon 1:3">verse 3</span>: “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="glw1Eyjj_mtEs1MGmataOWdMjTSP1_8HwHFCD7YfalW-UIB02jZzfl5mQBctkaOog">III. A SLAVE REBORN TO BE A BROTHER</h2><p data-content-id="et7n-cGtHRQA9B-KIT3Bneb4XZjOEppg0tKAner7AS5E28-HcWESXTnfDdT6fgHtJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96185" data-verses="Philemon 1:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> Paul goes on to say, “I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, hearing of your love and the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all the saints.” Notice that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96186" data-verses="Philemon 1:5">verse 5</span> Paul speaks first of love and then of faith. In the initial stage <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> faith came first, and then love was produced by faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96187" data-verses="Galatians 5:6">Gal. 5:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96188" data-verses="Ephesians 1:15">Eph. 1:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96189" data-verses="Colossians 1:4">Col. 1:4</span>). But here love is referred to first and then faith, because what is dealt with in this Epistle concerning the equal status of believers is a matter of love, which comes out of faith. In the new man the members love one another in faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96190" data-verses="Titus 3:15">Titus 3:15</span>). The relationship is of love through faith. The apostle appreciates the fellowship of Philemon’s faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96191" data-verses="Philemon 1:6">v. 6</span>) and is encouraged by his love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96192" data-verses="Philemon 1:7">v. 7</span>); thus he entreats him to receive Onesimus because of this love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96193" data-verses="Philemon 1:9">v. 9</span>). These two virtues are referred to in a combined way. Philemon has both of them, not only toward the Lord, but also toward all the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="5BjP6fQqxBttAN2bnauKAE-4BnmeH0RvCbbu_mef__4SFmgyy-WlUFMdg92gLJA5r"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96194" data-verses="Philemon 1:6">verse 6</span> Paul continues, “That the fellowship of your faith may become operative in the full knowledge of every good thing which is in us for Christ.” This verse is actually the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96195" data-verses="Philemon 1:4">verse 4</span>. Full knowledge here means full acknowledgment, entire appreciation, and experiential recognition. By “every good thing” Paul does not mean natural things (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96196" data-verses="Romans 7:18">Rom. 7:18</span>), but spiritual and divinely good things, such as eternal life, the divine nature, and spiritual gifts, which are in us, the regenerated believers, not in natural men. </p>
<p data-content-id="NYdvq_Y-DSDQezox-pZhtrebo0UwGn5PPwHTN13oXGIDk9z_fXa5rCxf7K0XXC3eq"> The Greek word rendered “for” in the phrase “for Christ” literally means unto, toward. All the spiritual and divinely good things in us are unto Christ, toward Christ, for Christ. The apostle prays that the fellowship, the communication, the sharing, of Philemon’s faith toward all the saints may operate in them in the element and sphere of the full knowledge, the full realization, of all the good things in us for Christ, causing them to acknowledge, appreciate, and recognize all the spiritual and divinely good things which are in the believers for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="t18pDbEit4-6eEvOlFaVDbDiWU-rTffqDaB98jdiyJKSGEzTObUpbT_pg38miAcMA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96197" data-verses="Philemon 1:7">verse 7</span> Paul says, “For I had much joy and encouragement over your love, because the inward parts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.” The word “for” introduces the reason the apostle prays for Philemon’s faith to operate in the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96198" data-verses="Philemon 1:6">v. 6</span>). It is because his love has refreshed the inward parts of the saints and has hence <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> rendered the apostle much joy and encouragement. The Greek word rendered refreshed also means soothed, cheered. </p>
<p data-content-id="hO_0rMKeLkjFRL81wR0ICUy0Vbawh1IF34rA82Ey7A1ID7uA4jFxYQlfxySPXst26"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96199" data-verses="Philemon 1:8-9">Verses 8 and 9</span> continue, “Wherefore, having much boldness in Christ to charge you what is fitting, because of love I rather entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.” The Greek word for aged here may also be translated an ambassador (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96200" data-verses="Ephesians 6:20">Eph. 6:20</span>). Prisoner here and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96201" data-verses="Philemon 1:23">verse 23</span>, and bonds in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96202" data-verses="Philemon 1:13">verse 13</span>, indicate that this Epistle was written during imprisonment, the apostle’s first imprisonment in Rome. </p>
<p data-content-id="U39TfqIJeRgWtV4QCxNkENa-Z_OMpGeAk22xus__1ibr6ar4oAFWkNwruVG-QYh6f"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96203" data-verses="Philemon 1:10-11">verses 10 and 11</span> Paul says, “I entreat you concerning my child whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.” During his imprisonment, Paul begot Onesimus through the Spirit with the eternal life of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96204" data-verses="John 3:3">John 3:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96205" data-verses="John 1:13">1:13</span>). In Greek the name Onesimus means profitable, useful, helpful; it was a common name for slaves. He was Philemon’s purchased bondslave, who, according to Roman law, had no human rights. He ran away from his master, committing a crime which could bring the death penalty. While he was in prison at Rome with the apostle, he was saved through him. Now the apostle sends him back with this Epistle to his master. </p>
<p data-content-id="MM3RzSmHj8dEzqnBjECDhs7lCYCErO0z5nihw7xwjyNoJHjiqCPaAAPx3ylg49XZd"> The word useless in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96206" data-verses="Philemon 1:11">verse 11</span> also means not of service, profitless. This refers to Onesimus’s running away from Philemon. The word useful also means of service, profitable. Onesimus became of service because he had been converted and was willing to return to Philemon. </p>
<p data-content-id="VMXbJmbwV5aUWTiJRcgPzKPIr3Zf1wq4slOHrKYlQdvyJ5o-jA3J3seqBta2ScUGJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96207" data-verses="Philemon 1:12">Verse 12</span> continues, “Whom I have sent back to you—him, that is, my very heart.” Literally, the Greek word for heart means bowels, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96208" data-verses="Philemon 1:7">verses 7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96209" data-verses="Philemon 1:20">20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96210" data-verses="Philippians 1:8">Philippians 1:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96211" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">2:1</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96212" data-verses="Colossians 3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>. It signifies inward affection, tenderheartedness, compassions. Paul’s inward affection and compassions went with Onesimus to Philemon. </p>
<p data-content-id="iK4b0NUMsIs0RmCTK-HDinprApxgudmKJA5WIEQw0RKsPBBYDwBA1z8SC_vgD1y4o"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96213" data-verses="Philemon 1:13-14">Verses 13 and 14</span> say, “Whom I resolved to keep with myself, that on your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel, but without your mind I did not want to do anything, that your goodness should not be as of <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> necessity, but voluntary.” Just as the Lord would not do anything without our consent, Paul would not keep Onesimus with him without Philemon’s consent. </p>
<p data-content-id="1laJx55aYcLKVaWuGFuvps1goUDL-3bHbA-ZG_FC2mM_EB52GJrOFDHA2M4mgcq3_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96214" data-verses="Philemon 1:15-16">verses 15 and 16</span> Paul says, “For perhaps therefore he was separated from you for an hour that you might fully have him forever, no longer as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.” The word “for” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96215" data-verses="Philemon 1:15">verse 15</span> introduces the reason for the sending in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96216" data-verses="Philemon 1:12">verse 12</span>. The word perhaps here is not only an expression of humility, but also one which shows no prejudice. </p>
<p data-content-id="9VYpn20Gu0GpgJvJGH8ylUHDVFhZKx3W1cmgNNUftPWcReXp11Eqx7pZn52Ajkfg8"> This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members in the Body of Christ. In the age of Paul the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery. Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated. Because of the divine birth and living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ, with no discrimination between free and bond (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96217" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">Col. 3:10-11</span>). This is based on three facts. First, Christ’s death on the cross has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life for the creation of the one new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96218" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">Eph. 2:15</span>). Second, we all have been baptized into Christ and made one in Him without any difference (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96219" data-verses="Galatians 3:27-28">Gal. 3:27-28</span>). Third, in the new man Christ is all and in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96220" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Col. 3:11</span>). Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church (in Titus), carry out God’s economy concerning the church (in 1 Timothy), and stand against the tide of the church’s decline (in 2 Timothy). It is of the Lord’s sovereignty that this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books in the arrangement of the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="j3ddlcXrbF0ymPaubNTzKWdkscFXQoBjMo7dMC_oPbqH9YBzWCnQMHSfl6G0Dgp8f"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96221" data-verses="Philemon 1:16">verse 16</span>, Onesimus was above a slave, or more than a slave. He was even more than a free man; he was a beloved brother. <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="TabXsfe9lAqx0HIZGJypP5Hig-hrI5WSk1rNFXEeKjxGdRN4M-W3mecCu6Ik03T1O"> There are a number of intimate terms in this Epistle: a beloved brother, the sister (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96222" data-verses="Philemon 1:2">v. 2</span>), the beloved and our fellow-worker (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96223" data-verses="Philemon 1:1">v. 1</span>), our fellow-soldier (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96224" data-verses="Philemon 1:2">v. 2</span>), my fellow-workers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96225" data-verses="Philemon 1:24">v. 24</span>), my fellow-prisoner (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96226" data-verses="Philemon 1:23">v. 23</span>), and a partner (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="96227" data-verses="Philemon 1:17">v. 17</span>).

Apparently this Epistle does not say anything concerning the status of the believers. Actually, this book touches the heart of this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="t18pDbEit4-6eEvOlFaVDbDuWVKTTffqDaB98jdiyJKSGEzTObUpbT_pg38miAcMA"> When Paul wrote to Philemon, Philemon was in Colosse and Paul was far away, a prisoner in Rome. One of his co-prisoners, Onesimus, was brought to the Lord and begotten by Paul in the Spirit to become not only a believer in Christ and a child of God, but also a dear child to Paul himself. Since there was a church in Rome, why did Paul not recommend this newly saved one to the local church there? Paul did not do this, because Onesimus was a runaway slave and his master, Philemon, lived in Colosse. </p>
<p data-content-id="hO_0rMKeLkjFRL81wR0ICUy4Va-Mh1IF34rA82Ey7A1ID7uA4jFxYQlfxySPXst26"> The fact that there were churches in Rome and in Colosse indicates that the churches as the expression of the Body of Christ are universal. This was true in ancient times just as it is true today. The first church, the church in Jerusalem, came into existence approximately A.D. 34 or 35. The Epistle to Philemon was written about thirty years later. Even during the comparatively short time of thirty years, churches had been established not only in Judea, but also in the Gentile world. Thus, the church was universal. This was according to the Lord’s sovereignty to carry out the commission He had given to Paul. It also was the fulfillment of Paul’s desire to see a new man on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="U39TfqIJeRgWtV4QCxNkENayZ9a8pGeAk22xus__1ibr6ar4oAFWkNwruVG-QYh6f"> By the spreading of the Roman Empire the various nations and peoples around the Mediterranean Sea were <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> brought into contact with one another and were even unified politically. There was a great deal of traffic and communication between people in various parts of the empire. This communication was altogether related to the old man. But at the time Paul wrote to Philemon, another man had come into existence on earth. In the midst of the old man, the new man had come into being. This is fully revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96235" data-verses="Colossians 3:10">Colossians 3:10</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96236" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">11</span>: “And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him; where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.” Philemon was an elder of the church in Colosse. In the Epistle to the Colossians Paul emphasized that all the believers are part of the new man. Furthermore, in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, slave and freeman. Philemon was a freeman, and Onesimus was his bondservant. But in the new man they were of equal status. </p>
<p data-content-id="MM3RzSmHj8dEzqnBjECDhs7pCaGwrO0z5nihw7xwjyNoJHjiqCPaAAPx3ylg49XZd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96237" data-verses="Colossians 4:1">Colossians 4</span> we have a record of the fellowship of the new man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96238" data-verses="Colossians 4:9">Colossians 4:9</span> speaks of Onesimus, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96239" data-verses="Colossians 4:17">verse 17</span>, of Archippus, the son of Philemon. A freeman and a slave who were members of the same household were also part of the church as the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="kvqYvAI32z9voMw8FJJXLPqGL1TZTeCY9osx8p9wA9CpgLnhT7H6tYig98hhN_nWw"> The Epistle to Philemon should be regarded as a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96240" data-verses="Colossians 4:1">Colossians 4</span> and considered an illustration of how in the new man all social rank is put aside. In the previous message we pointed out that this short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members in the Body of Christ. The distinction of social rank and status among the believers is nullified not by an outward legal act, but by an inward change of constitution. Ranks have been abolished because the believers have been constituted of Christ’s life. Christ’s life had been constituted into Philemon, and the same life with the same divine element had been constituted into his slave, Onesimus. According to the flesh, Philemon was a master and was free, and Onesimus was a slave and was not free. But according to the inner constitution, both were the <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> same. Because of the divine birth and a living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ have equal status in the church, which is the new man in Christ, with no discrimination between free and bond. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jlax0O-0qHuq-yZHDxO-7oWQmJG8yUpRd309U8EX7478MQSrLtSdig82ne27LB2Zj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96241" data-verses="Titus 2:9-15">Titus 2:9-15</span> Paul charges the slaves to behave well in the social system of slavery. He instructed them to live a Jesusly human life in the midst of such a social system. But in the Epistle to Philemon he gives the churches an illustration of how slaves and masters alike have been reconstituted of the life of Christ. As a result, they all are part of the new man. In the old social system, which belongs to the living of the old man, the distinction between master and slave exists. Paul did not touch this social system in the way of trying to reform it. On the contrary, on the one hand he instructed the slaves to live a Jesusly human life under this social system; on the other hand, he illustrated how both slaves and masters are brothers in the Lord and, as members of the new man, share the same status. </p>
<p data-content-id="zYalV0XGfIFvhEBgTOysyXB_StJxvE6zWoUqQwdTUxhu1pCnyXgHTMjZgzCO25IOe"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96242" data-verses="Philemon 1:16">Philemon 16</span> makes this relationship very clear. Concerning Onesimus Paul says, “No longer as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.” Through regeneration Onesimus had become more than a slave and even more than a free man, for he had become a beloved brother. Now Onesimus had a relationship with Philemon “both in the flesh and in the Lord”: in the flesh as a slave and in the Lord as a brother. In the flesh Onesimus was a brother as a slave, and in the Lord he was a slave as a brother. Philemon, therefore, had to receive Onesimus and embrace him in a loving, intimate way. Of course, he was to receive him not in the old man, the old social system, but in Christ and in the new man. Although Onesimus was still Philemon’s slave, in Christ he had become Philemon’s brother. Now, in the new man, Philemon had to receive Onesimus as a brother and one of equal status. Here we see Paul’s recommendation of a brother for acceptance in the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="azJMehelsvXiBut6BBrnFhqjgrZAYS4NWHxQLOg0JcbFAY-D8gKIgkI-QqCEsdsyF"> In the book of Philemon there is no mention of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> expression “the new man.” But as we examine the situation portrayed in this book, we see that Paul was recommending a brother not to a local church in the city where he was at the time, but to a local church in a remote city. This indicates that Paul’s recommendation took place within the sphere of the new man. As we have already indicated, this can be proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="96243" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>, where we are told that in the new man there is no bond or free. As Paul was writing to Philemon, he may have been thinking something like this: “Onesimus has become a dear brother in the Lord. Now I wish to recommend him, a slave, to a brother who is a free man. I want to help them both realize that as brothers they are equal. One should be received, and the other must be willing to receive him.” This is what I mean in saying that the Epistle to Philemon is an illustration of the equal status of the believers in the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="baftPHFTk-9mlGSw-0bvTIC1B-ByBDsZEErI4E45YCD5ZdQOcpwU7X8wO3a0HhFmJ"> As long as we see that the believers have an equal status in the new man, there will be no problems among us concerning social rank, nationality, or race. We shall have no problems with different peoples. Those who discriminate among people in any way do not practice the proper church life. If we would have the genuine church life, we must receive all the saints regardless of race, nationality, or social rank. It is a fact that in many places believers are not willing to do this. As a result, they cannot have the proper church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="qSRQfJzvSqEK4EWA3Oo3MKGgR7QRgtw2clPe4ZX-T2f3uMOk8He3P6XAS1wCDGJ9t"> We should never speak of a church according to race or color—there is no white church, yellow church, black church, or brown church. The church has only one color, and that color is heavenly blue. After you come into the church life, there must not be deep in your being any discrimination between believers on the basis of race or color. As long as such a discrimination exists within you, as far as you are concerned, you are nullifying the church life. The colors which represent the different races have already been nullified by the cross. Now we must be willing to pay the price to have them nullified in the real and genuine church life. <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> </p>
