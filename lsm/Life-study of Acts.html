<h1 class="title" data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5jUnZWuvsITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb">THE POSITION OF THE BOOK</h1><p class="scripture" data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvEB6w8Gc_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74294" data-verses="Luke 24:44-49">Luke 24:44-49</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74295" data-verses="Mark 16:15-16">Mark 16:15-16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74296" data-verses="Mark 16:19-20">19-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74297" data-verses="Matthew 28:18-20">Matt. 28:18-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74298" data-verses="Acts 1:1-2">Acts 1:1-2</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBJRN1R2mnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> With this message we begin the Life-study of the Acts of the apostles. As we come to the book of Acts, we need to realize that both this book and the Gospel of Luke were written by the same person. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74299" data-verses="Luke 1:3">Luke 1:3</span> says, “It seemed good to me also, having followed all things accurately from the first, to write to you a consecutive account, most excellent Theophilus.” The first two verses of Acts indicate that this book is the continuation of Luke’s Gospel: “The first account I made, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach, until the day in which He was taken up, having given command through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He chose.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBYoKDzkwHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa">AN EXTRACT OF THE GOSPEL OF LUKE</h2><p data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGiBM6qanUZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L"> Before we go further, let us review some of the things that were covered in the Life-study of Luke. In this Gospel we have the Man-Savior, and we see that our Redeemer, the Savior, is the God-man. Luke gives us a clear record not only of the Man-Savior’s birth but also of His conception. Luke describes the Lord’s conception, birth, youth, life, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension. Therefore, the Gospel of Luke has a broad span covering all the matters of the wonderful Person of the God-man from His conception to His ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyetIDvP7RqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> We may say that the Man-Savior’s conception was His coming down not only from the heavens but also from God the Father. Likewise, His ascension was His going back not only to the heavens but also to the Father. The Man-Savior’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> conception was His coming down to earth, and His ascension was His going up to the heavens. By this coming and going the Lord Jesus became a wonderful Being. Through His conception and birth He became a Person who is both divine and human, both God the Creator and man, a creature. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74300" data-verses="Luke 2:13-14">Luke 2:13 and 14</span>, the angels exulted at the birth of the Man-Savior for our salvation. The angels praised God and said, “Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure.” </p>
<p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo8lCpG-kl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> As such a wonderful Person, the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a man with all the human virtues expressing the divine attributes. This was the way He lived and ministered. Whatever He lived, He ministered, and He ministered what He lived even unto death. The Man-Savior suffered death, walking into, through, and out of death. After making a tour of death and Hades, He came forth in resurrection. On the one hand, the Lord raised Himself up; on the other hand, He was raised up by God. Therefore, He entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He ascended to the heavens. Now this One, the glorified Man-Savior, is in the heavens. This is a brief extract of the crucial contents of the Gospel of Luke. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvEB6w5U8_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP">THE LORD’S MINISTRY IN HIS ASCENSION</h2><p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBJRN1VkWnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> The Lord’s ascension was not the end of His activity. Rather, the Man-Savior’s ascension was another initiation. As we pointed out in the Life-study of Luke, Christ’s ascension was His inauguration, His initiation, into His heavenly ministry. The Lord’s conception was His first initiation, and His ascension was another initiation. His conception was the initiation of His life and ministry on earth; His ascension was the initiation of His living and ministry in the heavens. Hence, Christ’s ascension was not the termination of His activity; instead, it was His initiation into further activity—His ministry in the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBYoKD02wHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa"> The first book written by Luke, his Gospel, describes the Lord’s first initiation and His life and ministry on earth. Now there is the need of the second book, the book of Acts, to tell us into what kind of living and ministry the Lord has <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> been initiated through His ascension. Therefore, Luke had the burden to write a second book to unveil the living and ministry of the ascended Christ. In Acts we see how the Lord lives and ministers in His ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGiBM6sI3UZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L"> We would emphasize the fact that, according to the Gospel of Luke, the Lord lived on earth. That life and ministry were initiated by His conception and concluded by His resurrection. Then after His resurrection the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens. This ascension was not a termination but another initiation. This initiation brought Him into a new realm, that is, into the heavens, where He now has another living with another ministry. This living and ministry are carried out not by the Jesus who was merely conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a virgin and born in Bethlehem; it is carried out by the ascended Christ. The resurrected and ascended Christ is now living in the heavens and ministering there. The Lord’s living and ministry in the heavens are the content of the book of Acts. May we all be impressed with this picture at the outset of this Life-study of Acts. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyetIDvGoxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U">THE POSITION OF THE BOOK OF ACTS<br/>IN THE SCRIPTURES</h2><p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo8lCpOtUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> My burden in this message is to point out the position of the book of Acts in the arrangement of the contents of the Scriptures. We need to ask this question: where does the book of Acts stand among all the books of the Bible? The book of Acts is between the four Gospels and the Epistles, which include the book of Revelation. Hence, the book of Acts is a dividing line. Before Acts, we have the four Gospels as the continuation of the Old Testament. After Acts we have the Epistles with the book of Revelation as a conclusion. </p>
<p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZgaecDIDnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> The book of Acts can be compared to the backbone in the human body. The backbone divides the human body into two parts, the right side and the left side. Many problems in the body are caused by weakness in the backbone. If a person’s backbone is weak, he cannot be strong. We may say that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> book of Acts is the backbone of the New Testament dividing it into two parts: (1) the Gospels and (2) the Epistles with the book of Revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2eYwJ38mCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> When some hear us say that the book of Acts is the dividing line and “backbone” of the New Testament, they may say, “In the past you divided the books of the New Testament in a different way. Now you are arranging the New Testament books in another way.” We should not be bothered by this, since there are many different ways of dividing, or arranging, the books of the Bible. We should not be limited to one way. The present way of dividing the New Testament books emphasizes the crucial importance of the book of Acts in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_d9NyMEyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> The four Gospels speak of the Lord Jesus on earth. But where is Christ in the book of Acts? In this book Christ is in the heavens. Acts does not unveil to us a Christ on earth; it reveals a Christ who is in the heavens. Concerning the Lord’s ascension, we do well to consider the following stanzas from <em>Hymns,</em> #132: </p>

<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG7eU58eU8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that the book of Acts may be considered the dividing line, or the “backbone,” of the New Testament. This book divides the four Gospels from the Epistles, which include the book of Revelation. The Gospels present a completed Redeemer and His accomplished redemption. In Acts we have the propagation of the completed Redeemer and His accomplished redemption for the producing of the churches. Then in the Epistles we have the edifying of the believers and the building up of the churches. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip6PjJSwd8Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF">THE PROPAGATION OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tFxtInwy-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf"> Having seen the position of the book of Acts, let us now go on to see the subject of this book. The subject of Acts is the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension, by the Spirit, through the disciples, for the producing of the churches—the kingdom of God. Acts is concerned with the propagation of the resurrected Christ. Christ is carrying out this propagation in His ascension, by the Spirit, and through the disciples. The purpose of Christ’s propagation is the producing of the churches—the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ayDvwYGbF8kWY5F_4H1veCTv6UiHZVamrMqmbhtFN96IRxElNLGJfnroptl9R0_TX"> In Acts there is not a single verse that can be taken as a summary of the entire book. The best way to present a summary, or extract, of Acts is to describe its subject. Therefore, once again I would point out that the subject of the book of Acts concerns the propagation of the resurrected Christ. It is of great value for us to have such a phrase as “the propagation of the resurrected Christ.” I do not know of any book on <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> Acts that uses the word “propagation.” Nevertheless, the subject of Acts is the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension, by the Spirit, through the disciples, for the producing of the churches—the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IVyUto2ksFq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> The propagation in Acts is not the propagation of Jesus. In Acts we do not have the propagation merely of the One who lived in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth. Rather, in Acts we see the propagation of the resurrected One, the propagation of the resurrected Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1MQJs10L0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg">CHRIST’S ACTIVITY IN HIS ASCENSION</h2><p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2QU_f51tqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> The propagation of the resurrected Christ is carried out by Christ in His ascension. The Lord Jesus lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, but now He is in ascension. In His ascension the Lord is very active. We should never think that the ascended Christ is sitting passively on the throne, observing the pitiful situation on earth and feeling disappointed about it. No, in His ascension Christ is active in a very positive way. As the ascended One, He is now doing many things. </p>
<p data-content-id="SX_7dMl2HfxSBERUoGgTfNrFHdrM23w5gIng7aE_LX2argmuVZZVL0WFlWju6AxQa"> The case of the stoning of Stephen is an illustration of Christ’s activity in His ascension. Speaking of Stephen, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74313" data-verses="Acts 7:55-56">Acts 7:55 and 56</span> say, “Being full of the Holy Spirit, looking intently into heaven, he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.” As the Lord was looking at the situation on earth in His ascension, He stood up. Perhaps He was saying, “You persecutors may stone Stephen and put him to death. But I will gain one of you—Saul of Tarsus—and make him much stronger than Stephen. What can you do about this? You do your stoning, and I do My observing. Wait for a period of time, and you will be defeated.” Stephen’s case illustrates that the resurrected Christ is very active in His ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="g8IXFe6HuOguESGgkogOjuEbyypS3PnQmdHqw5ICsa7V_yGT9Yi4eMOByQVLvj_dD"> The fact that Christ is now in ascension means not only that He is in the heavens; it also means that He has power and authority. In His ascension Christ has all the power and <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> all the authority in the universe. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74314" data-verses="Matthew 28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>, the resurrected Christ said to His disciples, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.” Therefore, with such authority and power in His ascension the Lord is very active. What is He doing? The Lord, as the ascended One, is carrying out His universal and eternal propagation. </p>
<p data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZuQlHloMxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45"> Who can explain why the earth today is filled with Christians? Why are there so many believers in the world? Great men have tried to gain control of the earth, but they have failed. Hitler, for example, tried to do this, but eventually he lost everything. Napoleon, after he had been defeated, reportedly looked up to the heavens and confessed that Jesus had beaten him. Napoleon admitted that even though the Lord Jesus did not fight, He gained everything. The point here is that the whole earth is in the hands of the undefeatable One, and this One is carrying out His propagation. </p>
<p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc9dWptbQwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> As the ascended Christ is carrying out His propagation, His main work is not fighting. Instead of fighting, the ascended Lord’s work is mainly propagating Himself throughout the earth. In the Lord’s recovery we have people of different colors: black, white, brown, yellow, and red. We all are part of Christ’s propagation. We have been produced by the resurrected Christ in His ascension. </p>

To propagate, therefore, is to produce. The propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension produces the churches. The churches are the produce of the resurrected Christ in His ascension. Hence, the churches are the produce of Christ’s propagation. The first mention of the word “church” in Acts is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74315" data-verses="Acts 5:11">5:11</span>. Thereafter, this book speaks of the church many times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74316" data-verses="Acts 8:1">8:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74317" data-verses="Acts 8:3">3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74318" data-verses="Acts 9:31">9:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74319" data-verses="Acts 11:22">11:22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74320" data-verses="Acts 11:26">26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74321" data-verses="Acts 12:1">12:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74322" data-verses="Acts 12:5">5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74323" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74324" data-verses="Acts 14:23">14:23</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74325" data-verses="Acts 14:27">27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74326" data-verses="Acts 15:3">15:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74327" data-verses="Acts 15:4">4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74328" data-verses="Acts 15:22">22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74329" data-verses="Acts 15:41">41</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74330" data-verses="Acts 16:5">16:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74331" data-verses="Acts 18:22">18:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74332" data-verses="Acts 20:17">20:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74333" data-verses="Acts 20:28">28</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB6tyql1mKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> The churches produced by the resurrected Christ in His ascension are the kingdom of God. Concerning the kingdom, <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> we should not follow the teachings of those who claim that the kingdom of God is not present today. According to such teachings, the kingdom has been suspended and will come after the church age. In the book of Acts we see that the churches and the kingdom of God go together. In fact, the churches actually are the kingdom of God. In Acts the kingdom of God is first mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74334" data-verses="Acts 1:3">1:3</span>, and then in a number of other verses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74335" data-verses="Acts 8:12">8:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74336" data-verses="Acts 14:22">14:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74337" data-verses="Acts 19:8">19:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74338" data-verses="Acts 20:25">20:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74339" data-verses="Acts 28:23">28:23</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74340" data-verses="Acts 28:31">31</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqNyTb8BUdJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5"> By now we should be impressed with the subject of the book of Acts, a book that stands as the backbone of the New Testament. Acts unveils Christ in His ascension propagating Himself to produce the churches, which are the kingdom of God on earth today. Following the book of Acts, we have the Epistles. The Epistles, as the continuation of Acts, edify the saints so that the churches may be fully built up as the Body of Christ. The consummation of this edifying and building up will be the New Jerusalem. If we see the place occupied by the book of Acts in the New Testament, we shall realize that this book, the backbone of the New Testament, stands in a crucial position. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKls6L1LJTOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX">A WORK IN ASCENSION</h2><p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT59DaX2q1fvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> We have emphasized the fact that the subject of Acts is the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension, by the Spirit, through the disciples, for the producing of the churches—the kingdom of God. We have seen something concerning the propagation of the resurrected Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74341" data-verses="Acts 2:24">2:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74342" data-verses="Acts 3:15">3:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74343" data-verses="Acts 5:30">5:30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74344" data-verses="Acts 13:33">13:33</span>). Now we need to see that this propagation is carried out by the Lord from the throne in the heavens. This means that His work of propagation is in ascension. However, much of today’s so-called Christian work is not a work in ascension. We hope that the work in the Lord’s recovery will be in His ascension. The ascension is the nature and the sphere of the Lord’s work on earth. Therefore, the work of the Lord today should have a heavenly nature and should be in a heavenly sphere. </p>
<p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDQIhtsXY1r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> It is in His ascension that Christ is propagating Himself. We know that His ascension came after His death and <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> resurrection. Christ’s work in His ascension takes place in the nature of His resurrection. Therefore, this work is not natural; it does not have anything of the natural man. Rather, it is of the divine life in resurrection, and it is carried out in the atmosphere and condition of His ascension. Where are we working today? We all should be able to say that we are working in Christ’s ascension. </p>

<p data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKIXmTzyV5h9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG"> The book of Acts has three main sections: the introduction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74347" data-verses="Acts 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>), the preparation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74348" data-verses="Acts 1:3-26">1:3-26</span>), and the propagation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74349" data-verses="Acts 2:1">2:1—28:31</span>). The introduction is very brief, consisting of only two verses, and the preparation covers the remainder of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74350" data-verses="Acts 1:1">chapter one</span>. The section concerned with the propagation covers <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74351" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapter two through twenty-eight</span>. This section may be the longest section in all of the sixty-six books of the Bible. In this message we shall consider the introduction of Acts, and then go on to consider the preparation. In the introduction this book is presented to us. As we shall see, the preparation involves something both on the Lord’s side and on the side of His disciples. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1crV7w9I0En3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp">INTRODUCTION</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQW62cRiR3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_">By Luke </h2>
<p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGQOzd-IYzY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74352" data-verses="Acts 1:1-2">Acts 1:1 and 2</span> say, “The first account I made, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach, until the day in which He was taken up, having given command through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He chose.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74353" data-verses="Acts 1:1">verse 1</span> “I” refers to Luke, the writer of the book of Acts. The early church recognized Luke as the author both of the Gospel of Luke (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74354" data-verses="Luke 1:3">Luke 1:3</span>) and Acts. Luke’s authorship is evident from the style of composition of the two books. Luke was a Gentile (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74355" data-verses="Colossians 4:14">Col. 4:14</span>), and probably an Asiatic Greek, and a physician. Starting in Troas, he joined Paul in his ministry and accompanied him in his last three ministry journeys (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74356" data-verses="Acts 16:10-17">Acts 16:10-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74357" data-verses="Acts 20:5">20:5—21:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74358" data-verses="Acts 27:1">27:1—28:15</span>). He <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> was a faithful companion of Paul until his martyrdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74359" data-verses="Philemon 1:24">Philem. 24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74360" data-verses="2Timothy 4:11">2 Tim. 4:11</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_d9tyMGyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig">To Theophilus</h2><p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paTVqYr894ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> Both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts were written to a person named Theophilus. This name in Greek means “loved by God,” or “friend of God.” Theophilus was probably a Gentile believer who occupied some official position under the Roman Empire. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSTgucCR89bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057">The Continuation of the Gospel of Luke</h2><p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG7eE54ME8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> Acts is the continuation of the Gospel of Luke. This can be proved by comparing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74361" data-verses="Acts 1:1-2">1:1-2</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74362" data-verses="Luke 1:14">Luke 1:14</span>. The words “first account” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74363" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1:1</span> refer to the Gospel of Luke as a “consecutive account” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74364" data-verses="Luke 1:3">Luke 1:3</span>) written to Theophilus by Luke. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip6PzJVj98Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74365" data-verses="Acts 1:2">Acts 1:2</span> says that the Lord Jesus gave “command through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He chose.” The resurrected Christ has become the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74366" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>), yet still in resurrection He did things through the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74367" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tFx9IhjC-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf">THE PREPARATION</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ayDvwYGbF8kWY5F_4HlvXRTv6UiHZVamrMqmbhtFN96IRxElNLGJfnroptl9R0_TX">The Lord’s Training of His Disciples </h2>
<p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IVyU9o-38Fq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> As we have pointed out, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74368" data-verses="Acts 1:3-26">1:3-26</span> is concerned with preparation, a preparation both on the Lord’s side and the side of the disciples. In this section of Acts we see Christ’s preparation of the disciples in His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74369" data-verses="Acts 1:3-8">vv. 3-8</span>). He speaks to them things concerning the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74370" data-verses="Acts 1:3">v. 3</span>) and charges them to wait for the baptism in the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74371" data-verses="Acts 1:4-8">vv. 4-8</span>). After Christ’s ascension in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74372" data-verses="Acts 1:9-11">verses 9 through 11</span>, we have the disciples’ preparation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74373" data-verses="Acts 1:12-26">vv. 12-26</span>). The disciples persevered in prayer (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74374" data-verses="Acts 1:12-14">vv. 12-14</span>) and then chose Matthias (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74375" data-verses="Acts 1:15-26">vv. 15-26</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="q56ADhFm7_LcIoAPC1BFRjUPM8WaUIO8_vrnKMCsdpFo2iQHQ7PItJoxf0tRnNi13"> Before the Lord went to the heavens to carry out His propagation in His ascension, He did something further to prepare His disciples. Although they had been with Him for three and a half years, they still had not yet been fully <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> prepared. From this we see that we can not do a quick work to perfect the saints in the Lord’s recovery. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOYKz1RRk0YVQ9GDfqAAsbkC2xIcaMrEmSNYGfSmuuL0gRLldZ5UBQtK-b9YuTg7p"> We may say that the three and a half years the Lord Jesus spent with His disciples were nearly the equivalent of a college education, which usually lasts four years. Perhaps you are wondering about the last half year of the “college course” for the Lord’s disciples. This last half year took place after His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="8hEVLiYPHPDrLKUUCPhp-0sIdV-olxt5lp8YViQRgoFO6adHYqE9Xo2xECC72P9rr"> Throughout the centuries, people have learned that in order for a person to be educated properly, he needs to pass through kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school, high school, and four years of college. All the years from kindergarten through high school are a preparation for the college years. We may apply this principle to the Bible and find in the Scriptures various levels of spiritual education. In the Old Testament we go from “kindergarten” in Genesis to “high school” in the Psalms and the Prophets. In between, we have the “elementary school” beginning in Exodus, and “junior high” in the historical books. Coming to the New Testament, we may say that the Gospels are on a “college” level and that the Epistles are on the level of “graduate school.” </p>
<p data-content-id="01ti1r4uNODePuwq6ENe8xCbcI0Asch_5CI1PAYjW-KfNYvtApOjUcBbYG5vhQyHY"> The Lord Jesus spent three and a half years with the disciples to give them a “college education.” Although Peter, Andrew, James, and John were fishermen, the Lord’s calling uplifted them and made them “college students.” Gamaliel, however, remained in the Old Testament “high school.” As both “professor” and “chancellor,” the Lord Jesus first spent three and a half years with His “students.” The remainder of their “education” was completed in His resurrection. This means that the Lord was able to carry out three and a half years of education with His disciples when He was in the flesh. Then in His resurrection He completed their training. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAYkr-Moqjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC">Our Need of Heavenly Enlightenment</h2><p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsJlMLLofGFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> We need to read the Bible again and again. This means that we need to know the written Word and be filled with it. Then we need to pray, “Lord, show me what You intend to <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> speak in all the books of the New Testament.” If you pray like this, light will gradually come. </p>
<p data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKIXmTz2GZh9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG"> In order to have a more accurate understanding of the words in the New Testament, it is helpful to learn Greek. However, we should not think that to know the Bible it is sufficient to have an excellent knowledge of Greek. Someone may have a thorough knowledge of every word in the Greek New Testament, but still be spiritually blind and not know anything of what is revealed in the New Testament. Even if we have the knowledge of Greek, we still need heavenly enlightenment in order to see the divine revelation in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1crV7w4bEEn3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp"> Today we are fighting against spiritual blindness. Many have doctoral degrees in Greek, but, spiritually speaking, they are utterly blind. They know the Greek New Testament in the way of scholarship, but they do not know what the Lord is speaking in the New Testament. No matter how many degrees we may have or how great our scholarship may be, we still need to humble ourselves and say, “Lord, I do not know anything. I am nothing, Lord. Show me Your revelation.” If you pray like this, the Lord’s revelation will come to you. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQW62cbxR3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_">The Case of Peter</h2><p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGQOzd1bIzY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> In the Gospels the Lord Jesus spent three and a half years with His disciples. During those years He was very patient with them. We may say that the Lord was “playing heavenly music” to His disciples; however, they were not able to appreciate it. We see this especially in the case of Peter. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-Hi1tdP8ORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> Full of patience and sympathy, the Lord Jesus did what He could with Peter. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74376" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> Peter received a heavenly vision and declared, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74377" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">v. 16</span>). The Lord answered and said to him, “You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74378" data-verses="Matthew 16:17">v. 17</span>). After the Lord spoke about the church and the kingdom, He went on to “show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and <span class="pg" data-page-id="21" id="21">[21]</span> chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74379" data-verses="Matthew 16:21">v. 21</span>). But Peter began to rebuke Him saying, “God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74380" data-verses="Matthew 16:22">v. 22</span>). The Lord then turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74381" data-verses="Matthew 16:23">v. 23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3DzcEvfc3s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn"> We may feel sympathy for Peter as we read the account in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74382" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span>. Although Peter was pitiful, the Lord Jesus did not let him go. Peter was not a “dropout” from the Lord’s “college.” As the chancellor of this college, the Lord Jesus patiently kept Peter with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjRkjEKs23Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h"> The Lord Jesus was patient even when Peter denied Him. On the night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, Peter said to Him, “If all shall be stumbled in You, I will never be stumbled” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74383" data-verses="Matthew 26:33">Matt. 26:33</span>). The Lord said to him, “Truly I say to you, that this night, before a cock crows, you will deny Me three times” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74384" data-verses="Matthew 26:34">v. 34</span>). Later Peter did deny the Lord three times. Nevertheless, the Lord was not disappointed, for Peter’s experience was part of the “college course.” </p>

What did the Lord say about the kingdom during that time? Luke does not tell us. Instead of giving us a full record of what the Lord taught the disciples concerning the kingdom, Luke simply says that He spoke to them about the kingdom of God for forty days. </p>

In the Gospels the Lord Jesus taught the disciples a lot concerning the kingdom. I doubt that during the forty days after His resurrection, He gave the disciples something new concerning the kingdom. Rather, I believe that the Lord repeated what He taught them in the Gospels. When the Lord spoke regarding the kingdom in the Gospels, the disciples were not able to <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> understand what the Lord as their “professor” was teaching them. Therefore, I believe that the Lord Jesus repeated His teaching in the forty days between His resurrection and His ascension. </p>

His Gospel is a narrative of the ministry of the incarnated Jesus on earth. His Acts is a record of the succeeding ministry of the resurrected and ascended Christ in heaven carried out through His believers on earth. In the Gospels, the Lord’s ministry on earth, carried out by Himself, only sowed Himself as the seed of the kingdom of God into His believers, with no church built up yet. In Acts, the Lord’s ministry in heaven, carried out through His believers in His resurrection and ascension, spreads Him as the development of the kingdom of God for the building up of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74476" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matt. 16:18</span>) throughout the entire world to constitute His Body, His fullness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74477" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">Eph. 1:23</span>), to express Him, even the fullness of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74478" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">Eph. 3:19</span>) for God’s expression. </p>

This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven.” The Lord’s ascension points to His coming back. Between His ascension and His coming back there is the dispensation of grace so that He as the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74480" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>), may apply His all-inclusive redemption to God’s chosen people for their full salvation, that He may produce and build up the church, as His Body, for the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="q56ADhFm7_LcIoAPC0hFRhUPM8WaUIO8_vrnKMCsdpFo2iQHQ7PItJoxf0tRnNi13"> The vision of Christ’s ascension into heaven strengthened the disciples’ faith in Him and in what He had done for them through His death and resurrection. It broadened their view of God’s heavenly economy, which had brought them into cooperation with Christ’s ministry in the heavens for the carrying out of God’s New Testament economy on the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOYKz1RRk0YVQ9GDfrgAsZkC2xIcaMrEmSNYGfSmuuL0gRLldZ5UBQtK-b9YuTg7p"> After the Lord Jesus had spoken to His disciples for a period of forty days concerning the kingdom of God, He was taken up from them visibly.

<p data-content-id="8hEVLiYPHPDrLKUUCOBp90MIdV-olxt5lp8YViQRgoFO6adHYqE9Xo2xECC72P9rr"> The disciples must have been deeply impressed and very excited when they witnessed Christ’s ascension. As they were watching Him ascend, they certainly were not weeping. On the contrary, they must have been happy, realizing that they were seeing something marvelous. </p>
<p data-content-id="01ti1r4uNODePuwq6Fte_xibcI0Asch_5CI1PAYjW-KfNYvtApOjUcBbYG5vhQyHY"> As the disciples were looking intently into heaven, two men in white clothing stood beside them. These two men, who were actually angels, asked the disciples why they were standing looking into heaven. Then they went on to say that the very Jesus who was taken up from them into heaven would come in the same way as they had seen Him going into heaven. This indicates that just as the Lord Jesus ascended physically, He will also come back physically. Christ ascended into heaven by way of a cloud, visible to human sight, and He will come back on a cloud (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74481" data-verses="Matthew 24:30">Matt. 24:30</span>). Furthermore, He ascended from the top of Mount <span class="pg" data-page-id="37" id="37">[37]</span> Olivet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74482" data-verses="Acts 1:12">Acts 1:12</span>), and He will come back to the same mount (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74483" data-verses="Zechariah 14:4">Zech. 14:4</span>). We definitely believe that in His coming back the Lord Jesus will set His feet on Mount Olivet. </p>

They were all Galileans (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74487" data-verses="Acts 1:11">v. 11</span>).

But now, after the Lord’s resurrection and ascension, their spiritual condition radically changed.

We may infer that, as they persevered in prayer, they prayed for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. I believe that during those ten days they prayed for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWF_5rv1Q5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> The resurrected Christ had come back to the disciples and had breathed Himself into them as the life-giving Spirit to be their life and person. Then for a period of forty days spent with the disciples the resurrected Christ kept appearing and disappearing. During those days He taught them concerning the kingdom of God. Then He ascended to the heavens in a visible way. By that time the Lord had completed the education and preparation of His disciples. His ascension marked the completion of the disciples’ “four year course” in the “divine university.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh48tyW_wR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> As one who had completed this course, Peter was now another person. As we shall see, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74500" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> he was able to understand and interpret the prophecy in the Old Testament concerning Judas and to teach others according to the Scripture. Was Peter like this in the Gospels? Certainly not. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74501" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> Peter is very different from what he was in the Gospels, because the resurrected Christ had come into him to be his life and person. </p>

This section is concerned with propagation. We have seen that the subject of Acts is the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension, by the Spirit, through the disciples, for the producing of the churches—the kingdom of God. The propagation of the resurrected Christ begins in Jerusalem and then spreads to Judea, Samaria, and the entire world. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74535" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapter two</span> we have the beginning of the propagation in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria through the ministry of Peter’s company. </p>

It was the fiftieth day from the Lord’s resurrection, seven weeks in between, counting from the second day (the first day of the week—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74539" data-verses="Luke 23:54">Luke 23:54—24:1</span>) after the Passover on which the Lord was crucified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74540" data-verses="John 19:14">John 19:14</span>). It was the fulfillment of the feast of Weeks (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74541" data-verses="Deuteronomy 16:10">Deut. 16:10</span>), which was also called the feast of Harvest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74542" data-verses="Exodus 23:16">Exo. 23:16</span>), counting from the day of offering a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74543" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10-11">Lev. 23:10-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74544" data-verses="Leviticus 23:15-16">15-16</span>).

From that day to the day of Pentecost was exactly fifty days. </p>
<p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4BzXh_wFMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> The feast of Harvest typifies the enjoyment of the rich produce brought in by the resurrected Christ. This rich produce is the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God given by Him to His chosen people as the blessing of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74547" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Gal. 3:14</span>) so that they may enjoy the all-inclusive Christ (the very embodiment of the Triune God) as their good land. This signifies that the believers, through receiving the bountiful Spirit on the day of Pentecost, not only have entered into the good land, but also have participated in the bountiful riches of the all-inclusive Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74548" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Eph. 3:8</span>) in His resurrection and ascension as God’s full allotment in His New Testament economy. <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="LilxD0znUWS-9v83_4n0VAPuzl4KnJ-MfefbTNnzPPig5LWJWb9boygxWo-Q9W1s_"> We have seen that Pentecost was the fiftieth day from the Lord’s resurrection. The Lord’s resurrection was three days after His death. However, these were not three full days as we count days. Regarding these three days, a small part of a day was counted as a whole day. This means that the first of the three days, a Friday, was the day on which the Lord Jesus was crucified. The Lord was on the cross from nine o’clock in the morning until three o’clock in the afternoon. Then, in the evening, He was taken down from the cross and buried. According to the Jewish way of reckoning days, the remaining part of that day was counted as a whole day. Hence, the three days were counted from the last part of the first day. Furthermore, according to the Jewish way of counting days, a day began not in the morning but in the evening. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74549" data-verses="Genesis 1:5">Genesis 1:5</span> says, “And the evening and the morning were the first day.” </p>
<p data-content-id="mlcLhH-3w5KZuNDv_ydvCfSzmtunqHXxKV7NNVCdEbwgO3dnwE5vpipW8E4hgdOFK"> If we count part of a day as a whole day, then from the Friday evening when the Lord Jesus was buried to the morning of His resurrection would be three days. The last part of Friday is one day; the whole of Saturday is the second day; and part of what is today called Sunday is the third day. However, the actual time the Lord was in the tomb may be less than forty hours. In the early part of the third day, perhaps less than forty hours after He died, the Lord Jesus was resurrected. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuGjIAnEo5IafG53uBle39ypiGKgO2xOWEc6_4BynTJX3LLZmIC9oRziJLF_biW7b"> The day of the Lord’s resurrection, the Lord’s Day, was the first day after the Sabbath. The Jewish Sabbath, of course, was on Saturday. The Lord was resurrected on the first day of the week, which was the day after the Sabbath. If we count from the second day after the Passover on which the Lord was crucified, Pentecost was the fiftieth day from His resurrection. Therefore, there were seven weeks in between the Lord’s resurrection and Pentecost, which also was on the Lord’s Day, the first day of the week. </p>

Pentecost is very closely related to the harvest, to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> reaping of the rich produce of the good land. Pentecost was fifty days after the offering of a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest. Concerning the sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74551" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10-11">Leviticus 23:10 and 11</span> say, “Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.” Then the people were to count seven Sabbaths from the day of the offering of the sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest: “And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete: even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74552" data-verses="Leviticus 23:15-16">Lev. 23:15-16</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74553" data-verses="Leviticus 23:1">Leviticus 23</span>, a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest was offered to the Lord as a wave offering on the morrow after the Sabbath. That sheaf of the firstfruits was a type of Christ as the firstfruit in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74554" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:20">1 Cor. 15:20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74555" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:23">23</span>). In the Old Testament, when the harvest was ripe, a sheaf of the firstfruits of that harvest was offered to God. This sheaf is a type of the resurrected Christ offered to God on the day of His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5jVXZX8fsITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb"> The offering of Christ as the firstfruit in resurrection involves His secret ascension to the Father. When Mary wanted to touch Him, He said to her, “Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74556" data-verses="John 20:17">John 20:17</span>). On the day of His resurrection the Lord ascended to the Father. This was a secret ascension, forty days prior to His public ascension in the sight of His disciples. On the day of resurrection, early in the morning, He ascended to satisfy the Father. The freshness of His resurrection was first for the Father’s enjoyment, as the firstfruit of the harvest was brought first to God in type. <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvEAKw6Uc_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP"> Many Christians do not realize that Christ secretly ascended to the Father early in the morning on the day of His resurrection. Of course, He ascended openly forty days later. On the day of His resurrection the Lord went to the heavens to offer Himself as the firstfruit of God’s harvest for the satisfaction of God the Father. That was a secret ascension. The day of Pentecost was fifty days later. </p>

And suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.” In the Lord’s resurrection, the Spirit of resurrection life is likened to breath, breathed into the disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74565" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>) for their spiritual being and living essentially. In the Lord’s ascension, the Spirit of ascension power, poured upon the disciples, is symbolized here by the wind for the disciples’ ministry and move economically. The essential Spirit of resurrection life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of ascension power is for them to carry out His commission. </p>
<p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBJQt1d2mnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> We need to see clearly the difference between the breathing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74566" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> and the blowing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74567" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>. The breathing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74568" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> is for the imparting of the life-giving Spirit into the disciples essentially for their spiritual being and for their spiritual living. But the blowing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74569" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> is for the pouring out of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> economical Spirit of power upon the believers, who have already received the essential Spirit into them. The pouring out of the Spirit of power is not for the believers’ spiritual being or living; rather, the outpouring of the Spirit of power is for the believers’ ministry and move. Therefore, the essential aspect of the Spirit is for living, and the economical aspect is for ministry. It is important for us to differentiate these two aspects of the Spirit, for then we shall understand the Gospels and Acts in the right way. Otherwise, we shall be confused. </p>
<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQW72cYwx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> Many years ago, a certain highly respected minister said that the breathing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74570" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> was not a fact but was merely a performance that indicated that the fact was yet to come in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74571" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>. According to his understanding, after the performance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74572" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, it was necessary for the disciples to wait fifty days to receive the fact. In the view of this minister, both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74573" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74574" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> refer to the same thing, the difference being that one describes a performance and the other describes a fact. This concept is altogether wrong. As we have pointed out, there is a difference between the breathing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74575" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> and the blowing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74576" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>. Breathing is for life, but blowing is for power. </p>
<p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGQPzd2aozY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> In the Gospel of John the Spirit of life in resurrection is likened to water for us to drink. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74577" data-verses="John 4:14">John 4:14</span> says, “Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74578" data-verses="John 7:37-39">John 7:37-39</span> says, “Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74579" data-verses="Luke 24:49">Luke 24:49</span> the economical Spirit is likened to clothing that we put on: “And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.” Water is for life inwardly, and clothing is for work outwardly. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-Hj1teNcORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> Let us use a policeman as an illustration of the difference between the essential Spirit for life inwardly and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> economical Spirit for power outwardly. A policeman does not put on his uniform in order to quench his thirst. Thirst cannot be quenched by putting on a uniform. A policeman clothes himself with a uniform when he is about to go on duty, that is, when he is ready to work as a policeman. Suppose a policeman drank something to quench his thirst and then went to work without his uniform. If he did this, no one would pay attention to him as he tried to give orders on the street. No matter how much he may drink to quench his thirst, a policeman still must put on his uniform when he is about to work as a policeman. If he is clothed in his uniform, others will respect him. Through this illustration we can see the difference between drinking and being clothed. Drinking is inward, but being clothed is an outward matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3DycEsd83s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn"> It is a serious mistake to say, as did that minister years ago, that the breathing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74580" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> is a performance and the blowing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74581" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> is a fact. This kind of interpretation comes from the shortage of proper knowledge and leads to confusion. The proper knowledge we need requires not only the study of the Scriptures but also heavenly enlightenment along with adequate experience. It is not accurate to say that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74582" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span> Peter did not receive the Spirit of life into him. The Lord’s breathing in that chapter was certainly not a performance. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74583" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>, the Lord Jesus “breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.” This is not a performance—it is an accomplished fact.

This means that the One who was incarnated was the complete God, the Triune God, God the Father, God the Son, and God the <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> Spirit, not merely the Son. To say that the complete God was manifested in the flesh means that the complete God was incarnated. The Triune God became a man, lived on earth, ministered, entered into death, conquering and subduing death, and came forth from death in resurrection. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, the Triune God, who became incarnated, who lived on earth, and who entered into death and came out of death in resurrection, has become the life-giving Spirit. </p>

Concerning this, we do not care for councils, creeds, or traditional theology. We care only for the pure Word of God. The Word reveals that the Triune God became the last Adam, and this last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. Praise the Lord that the processed Triune God has reached us as the life-giving Spirit! On the day of the Lord’s resurrection, the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit was breathed into the disciples. </p>

Notice that there is a comma after “Holy Spirit.” This verse says, ”And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave them to speak out.” The comma after “Holy Spirit” may help us to see that “all” does not modify both “filled” and “began to speak.” Here we have two predicates: “were filled” and “began to speak.” We need to have the discernment to know whether the modifier “all” modifies both predicates or only the first predicate. If it modifies both predicates, then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74625" data-verses="Acts 2:4">verse 4</span> is saying that all spoke in tongues. But if it modifies only the first predicate, then this verse is saying that all were filled with the Holy Spirit, but not all spoke in tongues. If Luke’s meaning is that all spoke in tongues, he should have used the word “all” a second time, before the word “began.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvEDqw5V8_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP"> According to grammar, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74626" data-verses="Acts 2:4">verse 4</span> is not saying that all were filled with the Holy Spirit and that all began to speak in different tongues. For example, suppose we said, “All the saints came into the meeting, and they began to pray.” Does this mean that everyone prayed? No, this is not the meaning. Likewise, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74627" data-verses="Acts 2:4">verse 4</span> is not saying that all those who were filled with the Holy Spirit spoke in tongues. </p>
<p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBJTd1VlWnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> Those who promote today’s tongue-speaking may insist that “all” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74628" data-verses="Acts 2:4">2:4</span> modifies the second predicate as well as the first. Then they may go on to use this verse as a basis for claiming that on the day of Pentecost each of the one hundred and twenty spoke in tongues. However, after spending much time in studying this verse, I have the assurance to say that “all” does not modify the second predicate. On the contrary, this word indicates only that all of the one hundred and twenty were filled with the Holy Spirit. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74629" data-verses="Acts 2:4">verse 4</span> does not indicate that they all spoke in tongues. </p>

The disciples were Galileans (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74633" data-verses="Acts 2:7">v. 7</span>), yet they spoke the different foreign <span class="pg" data-page-id="61" id="61">[61]</span> dialects of the attendants who came from various parts of the world. This is strong proof that tongue-speaking must be an understandable language, not merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue. The Greek word rendered “speak out” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74634" data-verses="Acts 2:4">verse 4</span> is “a peculiar word, and purposely chosen to denote the clear, loud utterance” (Vincent). </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyetKTvGrxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> We have pointed out that the tongues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74635" data-verses="Acts 2:4">verse 4</span> were dialects. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74636" data-verses="Acts 2:5-8">verses 5 through 8</span> say, “Now there were Jews dwelling in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together and were confounded, because each one heard them speaking in his own dialect. And they were all amazed and marveled, saying, Look, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we each hear them in our own dialect in which we were born?” The Jews in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74637" data-verses="Acts 2:5">verse 5</span> were devout Jews who came from their dispersion to Jerusalem to keep the feast of Pentecost. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74638" data-verses="Acts 2:10">Verse 10</span> speaks of proselytes, Gentiles who were converted to Judaism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74639" data-verses="Acts 6:5">6:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74640" data-verses="Acts 13:43">13:43</span>). The word “dialect” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74641" data-verses="Acts 2:6">verses 6</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74642" data-verses="Acts 2:8">8</span> is synonymous with “tongues” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74643" data-verses="Acts 2:4">verse 4</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo8nSpOuUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74644" data-verses="Acts 2:11">verse 11</span>, the people exclaimed, “We hear them speaking in our own tongues the great things of God.” The Greek word for “tongues” here is <em>glossa.</em> In this chapter <em>glossa</em> is used for two things: the speaking organ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74645" data-verses="Acts 2:3">v. 3</span>) and dialects (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74646" data-verses="Acts 2:4">vv. 4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74647" data-verses="Acts 2:11">11</span>), referring to the dialects in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74648" data-verses="Acts 2:6">verses 6</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74649" data-verses="Acts 2:8">8</span>. This evidence affords no ground to say that tongue-speaking may be merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue, the speaking organ. Rather, tongue-speaking must be a dialect, because what the disciples spoke in tongues were all different dialects. In this sense, tongues and dialects are synonyms, interchangeably used in these verses. </p>
<p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZgYOcAJjnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> Those who promote tongue-speaking may insist that it is not necessary for the tongue that is spoken to be an understandable human language. They may claim that to speak in tongues is simply to utter some kind of sound. Promoters of tongue-speaking need to say this because much of today’s so-called tongues are not dialects but meaningless sounds. However, the tongues spoken on the day of Pentecost were a <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> miracle caused by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Galileans who spoke in tongues on the day of Pentecost did not speak with a Galilean accent. “Each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.” Although the tongues spoken on the day of Pentecost were dialects, it is not likely that you will hear any dialects spoken by today’s tongue-speakers in meetings held for that purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2eagJ09GCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> One day, in 1936, I had a talk with a leading Pentecostal missionary concerning these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74650" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>. Holding my Greek-English Interlinear New Testament in my hand, I pointed out to him that here <em>glossa</em> is used in two ways: to denote the tongue, the speaking organ, and to denote a dialect. He was not able to answer me, but instead patted me on the head and said, “Your head is too big.” </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_d_dyPGSB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> Although I myself had practiced so-called tongue-speaking and had led others to do so, I dropped this practice after speaking with that missionary. I came to realize that much of what is called tongue-speaking is not the miraculous speaking of a dialect, but something humanly manufactured. The point we are emphasizing here is that the tongues spoken on the day of Pentecost were genuine dialects and not merely sounds uttered by the tongue. </p>

The writer of that article said that he had contacted two hundred people who claimed to speak in tongues. Without exception, all of those two hundred doubted that the tongues they spoke were genuine. Then I asked the trainees if Peter and the others on the day of Pentecost had any doubt whether the tongues spoken by them were genuine. Certainly Peter and the others had no such doubts. However, the two hundred tongue-speakers mentioned in that magazine article had doubts because the tongues they spoke were not genuine. </p>
<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG7c057Nk8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> Earlier in 1963 I was invited to speak at a certain Christian group in San Diego. This group strongly emphasized <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> tongue-speaking. In one of the meetings a woman gave a short word in tongues. Then a young man gave a long interpretation of that word. After the meeting, I asked the leader of the group if he thought that the interpretation of the woman’s word in tongues was genuine. He told me that he doubted that the interpretation was genuine. Then I asked him why he engaged in such practices, since we have a rich Christ to minister to others. I said, “Brother, we have the all-inclusive Christ. Isn’t it sufficient for us to preach Him?” He had nothing to say in response to my question. </p>

In the foregoing message we covered Peter’s explanation of the economical filling of the Holy Spirit. Let us now go on to consider his witness concerning the Lord Jesus. </p>

Now Luke’s succeeding narrative goes on to tell us that this Man was preached by the apostles as the God-ordained Savior. <span class="pg" data-page-id="76" id="76">[76]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyesITvGpxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> The Greek word translated “demonstrated” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74777" data-verses="Acts 2:22">verse 22</span> literally means to point out, to exhibit, to show forth, in the sense of proving by demonstration, thus bringing about an approval. This indicates that the Lord’s work was God’s demonstration of Him, His exhibition of Him. While Christ was living and ministering, whatever He did was an exhibition of the fact that His work was done by God. In the four Gospels we have the exhibition of a wonderful Person, the God-man. The Gospels exhibit this God-man as the One who was fully tested, proved, and approved. Peter’s thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74778" data-verses="Acts 2:22">verse 22</span> is that Jesus was fully tested, proved, and approved by God. </p>

This was done according to God’s eternal purpose and plan, not accidentally.

Considering Him as God, it tells us that He Himself rose from the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74809" data-verses="Romans 14:9">Rom. 14:9</span>). In the same principle, regarding Him as a man, the New Testament tells us that He was killed by men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74810" data-verses="Mark 9:31">Mark 9:31</span>). But considering Him as God, it tells us that He laid down His life of Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74811" data-verses="John 10:18">John 10:18</span>). This also proves His dual status—human and divine. </p>

Because He is such an ever-living One, death is not able to hold Him. He delivered Himself to death, but death had no way to detain Him; rather, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it. </p>

But in the original Hebrew text the word for tongue is “glory,” which is a synonym of soul, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74824" data-verses="Genesis 49:6">Genesis 49:6</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74825" data-verses="Psalms 7:5">Psalm 7:5</span>.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74880" data-verses="Acts 2:36">verse 36</span> Peter declares, “Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified.” Jesus was made the Lord to possess all, and He was made the Christ to carry out God’s commission. As God, the Lord Jesus was already the Lord, and in His divinity there was no need for Him to be made Lord. Nevertheless, in His ascension He, as a man, was made the Lord of all by God. God made Jesus the Lord of all to possess all things, including us. </p>
<p data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZvQVHs7sxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45"> The Lord Jesus was also Christ, even from eternity. Furthermore, He was born as the Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74881" data-verses="Luke 2:11">Luke 2:11</span>). However, in His ascension He was officially made the Christ of God. This means that in His ascension God inaugurated Him officially into the office of the Christ. God had already appointed Him, but in His ascension He still inaugurated Him into His office as the Christ to carry out God’s commission. May we all be impressed with the fact that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74882" data-verses="Acts 2:36">2:36</span> “Lord” refers to possession, and “Christ” refers to commission. </p>
<p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc8dmplIgwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> The record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74883" data-verses="Acts 2:14-47">2:14-47</span> emphasizes Peter’s speaking concerning Christ. Peter spoke of Christ, and he even spoke forth <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> Christ. This is the first case of the speaking of Christ by the believers. In his speaking, Peter presents to us the Man Jesus and witnesses to us concerning Him. In particular, Peter speaks of the Lord Jesus in His work, death, resurrection, and ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZvQVHlpMxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45"> In his speaking concerning Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74884" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapters two through five</span> of Acts, Peter does not refer to Him as the Son of God. Peter’s emphasis here is not on the fact that Jesus is the Son of God. Rather, in these chapters Peter stresses that the Lord Jesus is a man. The reason for this emphasis is that the Jews crucified Christ as a man, regarding Him merely as a despised man, a Nazarene, a person of low estate. Therefore, Peter said that the One regarded by the Jews as a lowly Nazarene was approved by God in all that He did. </p>
<p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc8dmptaQwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> As we shall see, Peter’s speaking of Christ produced the propagation of Christ. On the day of Pentecost this propagation included the three thousand souls who were saved. Such a propagation was the result, the issue, of Peter’s speaking concerning Christ. From this we see that the speaking of Christ surely leads to the propagation of Christ in those who believe in Him. Furthermore, the believers as Christ’s propagation become the church. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74885" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapter two</span> we see that the speaking of Christ produced a church in Jerusalem. In this chapter we have both the propagation of Christ and the church life. </p>

<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB7tCql2mKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> After Peter spoke concerning the Lord Jesus in His work, death, resurrection, and ascension, he instructed and entreated the Spirit-moved ones to repent, to be baptized, and to be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74886" data-verses="Acts 2:37-41">vv. 37-41</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74887" data-verses="Acts 2:37-38">Acts 2:37 and 38</span> say, “And when they heard this, they were pierced in the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, What should we do, men, brothers? And Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized, each one of you, upon the name of Jesus Christ for the <span class="pg" data-page-id="85" id="85">[85]</span> forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” Here Peter first told the people to repent. To repent is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose. Literally, the Greek word for repent means to think differently afterward, that is, to have a change of mind. To repent is to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future. On the negative side, to repent before God is to repent not only of sins and wrongdoings, but also to repent of the world and its corruption that usurp and corrupt people whom God made for Himself, and to repent of our God-forsaking life in the past. On the positive side, to repent is to turn to God in every way and in every thing for the fulfilling of His purpose in making men. Therefore, it is a repentance unto God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74888" data-verses="Acts 20:21">20:21</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqMyjb8CUdJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5">Concerning Baptism upon the Name of Jesus Christ</h2><p data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlt671IIzOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX"> Peter also instructed the Spirit-moved ones to be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ. To baptize people is to immerse them, to bury them in water, signifying death. The command that a repentant one be baptized indicates that such a one is good only for burial. Baptism, therefore, signifies the termination of the old person so that a new beginning may be realized in resurrection by Christ as the Life-giver. Baptism in the Bible implies death and resurrection. To be baptized into the water is to be put into death and buried. To be raised up from the water means to be resurrected from death. </p>
<p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT58DqX1rVfvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74889" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> the resurrected Christ charged the disciples to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The purpose of baptism is to bring repentant people out of their old state into a new one by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ. After the Lord Jesus accomplished His ministry on earth, passed through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect <span class="pg" data-page-id="86" id="86">[86]</span> by the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74890" data-verses="Acts 2:38-41">Acts 2:38-41</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74891" data-verses="Acts 10:44-48">10:44-48</span>). The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect, whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible aspect by the Spirit, the visible aspect by water is vain; and without the visible aspect by water, the invisible aspect by the Spirit is abstract and impractical. Therefore, both are needed. </p>
<p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDRIRtvV41r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> Not long after the Lord Jesus charged the disciples to carry out this baptism, He baptized them and the entire church in the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74892" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Cor. 12:13</span>) on the day of Pentecost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74893" data-verses="Acts 1:5">Acts 1:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74894" data-verses="Acts 2:4">2:4</span>) and in the house of Cornelius (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74895" data-verses="Acts 11:15-17">11:15-17</span>). Then, based on this, the disciples baptized the new converts, not only visibly into water but also invisibly into the death of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74896" data-verses="Romans 6:3-4">Rom. 6:3-4</span>), into Christ Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74897" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>), into the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74898" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>), and into the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74899" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Cor. 12:13</span>). The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb to terminate the history of the baptized ones. Because the death of Christ is included in Christ and because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, who is one with the Body of Christ, to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do just one thing: on the negative side, to terminate their old life, and on the positive side to germinate them with new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ. Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord Jesus is to baptize people out of their life into the Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="1jNZ3Y6RNXScv8-BhiBPHzEFaFzfAIRX4Bba-Y8mPL_tBBhV44go-Yxey-xe-DJIo"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74900" data-verses="Mark 16:16">Mark 16:16</span> the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, “He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.” To believe is to receive the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74901" data-verses="John 1:12">John 1:12</span>) not only for forgiveness of sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74902" data-verses="Acts 10:43">Acts 10:43</span>) but also for regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74903" data-verses="1Peter 1:21">1 Pet. 1:21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74904" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">23</span>), so that those who believe may become the children of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74905" data-verses="John 1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span>) and the members of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74906" data-verses="Ephesians 5:30">Eph. 5:30</span>) in an organic union with the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74907" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>). To be baptized is to affirm this by being buried to terminate the old creation through the death of Christ and by being raised up to be the new creation of God through Christ’s resurrection. Such a baptism is much more advanced than the baptism of repentance <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> by John (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74908" data-verses="Mark 1:4">Mark 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74909" data-verses="Acts 19:3-5">Acts 19:3-5</span>). To believe and to be so baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving the full salvation of God. To be baptized without believing is merely an empty ritual; to believe without being baptized is to be saved only inwardly without an outward affirmation of the inward salvation. These two should go together. Moreover, water baptism should be accompanied by Spirit baptism, even as the children of Israel were baptized in the sea (water) and in the cloud (Spirit—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74910" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:2">1 Cor. 10:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74911" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">12:13</span>). </p>

Teaching is the unveiling of God’s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church. Fellowship is the communion and communication between the believers in their communion and communication with God the Father and Christ the Son. Breaking of bread is the remembrance of the Lord in His accomplishment of God’s full redemption. Prayer is cooperation with the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> in heaven for the carrying out of God’s New Testament economy on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="jHPCvHM6AJL14sHMtM3vw45ZKdllursp8MnQXFHjxCUMf5qoYcCmTHDm7GFZatUid"> The first two matters, teaching and fellowship, conjoined by “and” to be one group, are of the apostles, but breaking of bread and prayers are not of the apostles. This indicates that besides the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, the believers in Christ should not have any other teaching and fellowship. In God’s New Testament economy there is only one kind of teaching revealed and recognized by God—the teaching of the apostles. Likewise, there is only one kind of fellowship which is of God and acceptable to Him—the fellowship of the apostles, which is with the Father and the Son Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74960" data-verses="1John 1:3">1 John 1:3</span>) and which is the unique fellowship of the unique church, the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip7PjJVi98Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF"> The last two matters, the breaking of bread and prayer, conjoined also by “and” to be another group, are practices of the believers’ Christian life. These practices are not related directly to God’s economy for the keeping of the oneness of the church, the Body of Christ. Hence, they are not of the apostles, who brought in God’s New Testament revelation and His fellowship among all the believers in Christ. </p>

The only proper teaching in the New Testament is the apostles’ teaching. Any teaching other than the apostles’ teaching is not scriptural or orthodox. The orthodox teaching is that of the apostles recorded in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament from Matthew through Revelation. Therefore, Paul said to Timothy, “Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74961" data-verses="1Timothy 1:3">1 Tim. 1:3</span>). To teach differently is to teach differently from the teaching of the apostles. If we have different teachings, we shall be divided into different groups. But if we have only the teaching of the apostles, we shall be one. <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IVzUto-28Fq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS">The Fellowship of the Apostles</h2><p data-content-id="q56ADhFm7_LcIoAPD1RFRgUPM8WaUIO8_vrnKMCsdpFo2iQHQ7PItJoxf0tRnNi13"> Just as the teaching of the apostles is unique, so the fellowship of the apostles also is unique. From this we see that all Christians should have one fellowship, the unique fellowship, which is the fellowship of the apostles. This fellowship is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74962" data-verses="1John 1:3">1 John 1:3</span>: “That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.” The Greek word for fellowship is <em>koinonia,</em> meaning joint participation, common participation. It is the issue of eternal life, and it is actually the flow of eternal life within all the believers who have received and possess the divine life. It is illustrated by the flow of the water of life in the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74963" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Rev. 22:1</span>). Hence, as indicated by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74964" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>, all genuine believers are in this fellowship. It is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Therefore, it is called “the fellowship of the Holy Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74965" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>) and “fellowship of [our] spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74966" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">Phil. 2:1</span>). It is in this fellowship of eternal life that we, the believers, participate in all that the Father and the Son are and have done for us; that is, we enjoy the love of the Father and the grace of the Son by virtue of the fellowship of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="74967" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="yOYKz1RRk0YVQ9GDeqQAsYkC2xIcaMrEmSNYGfSmuuL0gRLldZ5UBQtK-b9YuTg7p"> Such a fellowship was first the apostles’ portion in enjoying the Father and the Son through the Spirit. For this reason it is called the fellowship of the apostles and “the fellowship which is ours [the apostles’]” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74968" data-verses="1John 1:3">1 John 1:3</span>, a fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. This fellowship is a divine mystery. </p>
<p data-content-id="8hEVLiYPHPDrLKUUDPxp91MIdV-olxt5lp8YViQRgoFO6adHYqE9Xo2xECC72P9rr"> The word “fellowship” used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74969" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74970" data-verses="1John 1:3">1 John 1:3</span> indicates the putting away of private interest and the joining with others for a certain common purpose. Hence, to have fellowship with the apostles, to be in the fellowship of the apostles, and to have fellowship with the Triune God in the apostles’ fellowship, is to put away our private interests and join with the apostles and the Triune God for the carrying out of God’s purpose. Our participation in the apostles’ <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> enjoyment of the Triune God is our joining with them and with the Triune God for His divine purpose, which is common to God, the apostles, and all the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="01ti1r4uNODePuwq7Ede_wibcI0Asch_5CI1PAYjW-KfNYvtApOjUcBbYG5vhQyHY"> Among Christians today there are not only different teachings but also different fellowships. Let me illustrate from my experience with the Southern Baptist denomination. Because my mother was a Southern Baptist, I attended Southern Baptist schools. Whenever a communion service was about to be held, the announcement was made that only those who had been baptized by that denomination could participate in the communion service. This means that this denomination had its own fellowship, and that fellowship was not the fellowship of the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAZk7-PqKjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC"> The fellowship of the apostles is open, receiving all kinds of genuine believers in Christ. For example, this fellowship receives believers who have been immersed and believers who have been sprinkled. Furthermore, those in this fellowship do not require that believers be immersed only by them. However, certain sects insist that only their baptism is valid. They may insist that a believer be baptized again if he wants to join their group. This is an illustration of a fellowship that is different from the fellowship of the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsIlcLIq_GFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> Do you know how to determine whether or not a particular Christian group is a sect? One way to determine this is to check whether or not that group receives all real believers in Christ. For example, suppose a brother in the Lord who is a Roman Catholic priest attends our Lord’s table meeting. We certainly would receive him because he is our brother in Christ. However, any group that does not receive all true believers is a sect and is not practicing the fellowship of the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKIWmDz2HZh9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG"> In certain places believers of one racial group are not received by Christians who are of a different race. Are those who reject believers because of their race in the fellowship of the apostles? Certainly not. Their fellowship is the fellowship of a particular race, not the fellowship of the apostles. The fellowship of the apostles surely includes believers of every race and nationality. We have an illustration of this in <span class="pg" data-page-id="95" id="95">[95]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="74971" data-verses="Acts 13:1">Acts 13:1</span>, where we see that among the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were those of different races and nationalities. </p>
<p data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1cqVrw4aEEn3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp"> Those who do not receive believers whose nationality differs from theirs are not practicing the fellowship of the apostles. Suppose certain brothers in the United States are not willing to receive brothers from Germany. They say, “These Germans are too strong. We simply cannot accept them.” If such were the case, those American brothers would be a sect. They would not have the fellowship of the apostles but some kind of so-called American style of fellowship. Let us also suppose that the German brothers react and say, “Since you Americans will not accept us, we will not accept you.” The result is that there are two so-called fellowships, a German fellowship and an American fellowship. The New Testament, however, knows only of one fellowship—the fellowship of the apostles. </p>

For this reason, according to their tradition and habit, they still went to the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="AY-SUR-EoOuNw4w4bhqDBwL0E3N7TuSXEOTbw_G2bv_OjbWVvXlpJAskEmK1oKtQB"> The early believers were not clear concerning God’s New Testament economy with respect to the Judaic temple. Not even the early apostles had a clear vision concerning God’s abandonment of the Judaic things. Hence, even after God’s pouring out the Spirit upon them on the day of Pentecost to initiate a new dispensation, they still did not separate themselves from the Judaic temple. At the initial stage God tolerated their ignorance in this matter. But this led to a mixture of the church with Judaism, a mixture that was not condemned by the early church in Jerusalem (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75003" data-verses="Acts 21:20-26">21:20-26</span>). Eventually the temple was destroyed by Titus with his <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> Roman army in A.D. 70, as prophesied by the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75004" data-verses="Matthew 23:38">Matthew 23:38</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75005" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">24:2</span>.

<p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDRIxtvX41r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> When Peter and John, who were about to go into the temple, saw a certain man who was lame from his mother’s womb, they gazed at him and said, “Look at us!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75006" data-verses="Acts 3:2-4">3:2-4</span>). The man “paid attention to them, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—walk! And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and his feet and ankles were instantly made strong” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75007" data-verses="Acts 3:5-7">vv. 5-7</span>). Peter did not possess silver and gold, but St. Peter’s Cathedral in Rome was constructed with a superabundance of gold. He did not have silver and gold, but he had the name, the Person, of Jesus Christ. He was poor in silver and gold, but he was rich in Christ. The Roman Church is filled with gold, but not with the Person of Christ. She is rich in gold but poor in Christ. </p>

But in his speaking Peter turned the attention of the people from the miracle to a Person, to the Lord Jesus. Although Peter and John had performed a miracle, Peter did not talk about the miracle. Instead, he used the miracle as a basis to turn his audience to Christ. He turned the people’s attention from the healing to the Healer. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVccoGrqMMnLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd"> Peter’s message was based on the miracle of the healing of the lame man.

<p data-content-id="63PjdVBPG51GyPm3WUWqIfmT1y1Uj-ESJwos787hQjcxafhitczkEPKKkKzBqHe70"> Peter’s burden was to speak Christ directly into others so they may become Christ’s propagation to be His living members in order that Christ may have a Body on earth. Pentecost is for the propagation of Christ, not for miracles, wonders, signs, and divine healing. All those things are minor. Even though a lame man was healed through Peter and John, Peter’s emphasis was not on healing but on the name of the Lord Jesus. First, Peter said to the lame man, “In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—walk!” Then in his message he went on to say, “By faith in His name, His name has made this man strong, whom you behold and know” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75011" data-verses="Acts 3:16">v. 16</span>). Therefore, Peter did not preach divine healing or miracles; he preached the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

Many of the so-called healings in Pentecostal meetings are not genuine. After the lame man was healed, “he stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75012" data-verses="Acts 3:8">v. 8</span>). This was a genuine healing. Nevertheless, Peter directed the people to the Healer, to the Lord Jesus. We also should turn our attention away from healing to the Healer. </p>

Or why are you gazing at us, as though by our own power or godliness we have made him to walk? The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75013" data-verses="Acts 3:12-13">vv. 12-13</span>). Some manuscripts add “the God of” before Isaac and Jacob. Why in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75014" data-verses="Acts 3:13">verse 13</span> did Peter speak of God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Why did he not speak simply of God?

According to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75016" data-verses="Matthew 22:1">Matthew 22</span>, this divine title implies resurrection: “Concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75017" data-verses="Matthew 22:31-32">vv. 31-32</span>).

In this verse “Holy” indicates that Jesus, the Nazarene, the One despised by the Jewish leaders, was absolutely for God and separated unto Him. Furthermore, He was absolutely one with God. According to the denotation of the word “holy” in the Bible, it signifies one who is absolutely unto God, who is absolutely for God, and who is absolutely one with God. In all of human history only the Lord Jesus is such a One. David was good, but at least in one instance he was for himself and not for God. However, throughout His entire life the Lord Jesus was absolutely separated unto God, for God, and one with God. There was never an instant when He was not absolutely for God and one with Him. Therefore, He is called the Holy One. He alone deserves the title “the Holy One.” </p>

In today’s religion there is little enjoyment of the Lord, if any. However, by the Lord’s mercy I can testify that for years I have been encouraging the Lord’s people to enjoy Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2fZgJ_v2Cwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> In 1965 we had a conference in Los Angeles on eating Jesus. During that conference, we covered the matter of eating throughout the Bible: the tree of life, the Passover lamb with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs, the manna, and the produce of the good land. We considered the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75051" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> concerning eating Him and the charge, given by Him when He established His table, to eat <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> His body. Furthermore, we considered the Lord’s promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75052" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Revelation 2:7</span> that the overcomers will eat of the tree of life. We also saw the promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75053" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">Revelation 22:14</span>, the promise that those who wash their robes may have the right to the tree of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAZlb-PoKjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC"> A certain preacher attended that conference. Afterward, he remarked that he had never heard about enjoying the Lord by eating Him. He wondered where I had learned all these things concerning eating the Lord and enjoying Him. I use this as an illustration of the need to realize that the Lord Jesus is enjoyable. </p>
<p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsIk8LIo_GFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> Some believers may not realize that Christ can be their enjoyment, because they are under the influence of traditional theological teaching in their reading of the Bible. Whenever they come to the Bible, they wear the “colored glasses” of tradition. We need to take off any such “glasses” and read the Bible according to its own color. If we do this, we shall pay attention to the Author of life and the seasons of refreshing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75054" data-verses="Acts 3:1">Acts 3</span>. </p>

We can enjoy a season of refreshing simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. Call “O Lord Jesus!” and you will be in a season of refreshing. </p>
<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQX7GcYxx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> We need to enjoy seasons of refreshing in our married life. For example, a sister may become angry with her husband. As a result, she is bound like the bent-doubled and Satan-bound woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75055" data-verses="Luke 13:10-17">Luke 13:10-17</span>. Often a wife may be “bent-double” because she is bound by the anger she feels for her husband. How can a sister be released from such bondage? She can be released simply by calling, “O Lord Jesus!” </p>
<p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGRPDd2bozY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> Whenever we are bound, we need to call on the Lord. Then we shall be able to say, “Amen, Lord Jesus! I am now in a season of refreshing.” I encourage you to enjoy a season of refreshing by calling on the Lord’s name. <span class="pg" data-page-id="111" id="111">[111]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-GjFteMcORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> Some who have a great deal of theological knowledge may be unwilling to call on the name of the Lord. They may be afraid of “losing face.” But we may need to lose our face in order to gain the Lord Jesus. What an enjoyment it is to call on His name! Sometimes I am beside myself with joy in the Lord when I call on Him and enjoy seasons of refreshing. Day by day, and throughout the day, we can enjoy seasons of refreshing simply by calling on the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3CysEsc83s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn"> Some criticize the practice of calling on the name of the Lord Jesus and claim that it is something we have invented. Calling on the Lord is a biblical practice; it certainly is not something invented by us. Calling on the name of the Lord is not a new practice in the New Testament. It began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75056" data-verses="Genesis 4:26">Gen. 4:26</span>) and was continued by many others (see note on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75057" data-verses="Acts 2:21">2:21</span> in the Recovery Version of Acts). </p>
<p data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjQlTEIu23Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h"> When some hear that calling on the Lord began with Enosh, they may claim that Enosh did not call the way we do today. To this I would reply, “How then, did Enosh call on the name of the Lord? Did he say, ‘O Lord, have mercy on me. Lord, I am in a pitiful situation and have many problems. Lord, what can I do?’” </p>
<p data-content-id="OxXT42mbN-_IwwC73JAB057lOD0YMzE-XjPYijEZ2-L3hEiePh0clDIYHsHVPlhJm"> We cannot understand the way to call on the name of the Lord by reading only one verse. Rather, we need to consider this matter throughout the Scriptures. If we read the Old Testament from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75058" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75059" data-verses="Isaiah 12:1">Isaiah 12</span>, we shall find out the way to call on the Lord. Isaiah, in particular, indicates that we need to call on the Lord joyfully: “Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon His name, declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75060" data-verses="Isaiah 12:3-4">Isa. 12:3-4</span>). We draw water out of the wells of salvation by joyfully calling on the name of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKbt09-vDzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO"> Suppose a certain brother has a number of problems. His wife is in the hospital, his older son has lost his job, and his younger son is not doing well in school. This brother should not say, “Lord, I need You to have mercy on me because I am in great need. Lord, my wife is in the hospital, my elder son <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> lost his job, and my younger son is failing in school. Lord, please help me.” Instead of praying in this way, the brother should call on the Lord and say, “Lord Jesus, You are the Lord! You are sovereign. Lord Jesus, I thank You that You know about my situation. You know, Lord, that my wife is in the hospital, that my older son lost his job, and that my younger son is failing in school. O Lord Jesus!” This is to call on the Lord strongly and joyfully. Surely this is the way the saints in both the Old Testament and in the New Testament called on the name of the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWE_prv0Q5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> The Greek word for “call” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75061" data-verses="Acts 2:21">2:21</span> is <em>epikaleo,</em> composed of <em>epi,</em> upon and <em>kaleo,</em> call by name, that is, to call out audibly, even loudly, as Stephen did (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75062" data-verses="Acts 7:59-60">7:59-60</span>). From this we see that to call on the name of the Lord is to call on Him audibly. This is not a teaching or practice invented by us; it is a scriptural fact. If you study the lengthy note on calling in the Recovery Version, you will see how scriptural this practice is. Calling on the Lord is fully grounded on the revelation in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. Furthermore, from experience we know that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we enjoy a season of refreshing. Whenever we call on Him, we are in a season of refreshing. This is a fact in the Word and in our experience, and I encourage you to try it. </p>

The Sadducees were a sect within Judaism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75084" data-verses="Acts 5:17">5:17</span>). They did not believe in the resurrection, nor in angels, nor in spirits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75085" data-verses="Matthew 22:23">Matt. 22:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75086" data-verses="Acts 23:8">Acts 23:8</span>).

This was a gathering of the Jewish Sanhedrin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75094" data-verses="Acts 4:15">v. 15</span>). It was this Sanhedrin composed of the Jewish leaders that became the strongest opponent of the Lord Jesus and His ministry in the four Gospels and condemned Him to death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75095" data-verses="Matthew 26:59">Matt. 26:59</span>). Now it was the same Sanhedrin with its constituents that began the persecution of the apostles and their ministry in Acts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75096" data-verses="Acts 5:21">5:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75097" data-verses="Acts 6:12">6:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75098" data-verses="Acts 22:30">22:30</span>). This indicates that Judaism had fallen into the hand of God’s enemy, Satan, the Devil, and was being used by him to frustrate and attempt to destroy God’s move in His New Testament economy for the carrying out of His eternal purpose, which is to bring His kingdom to the earth by the establishing and building up of the churches through the preaching of the gospel of Christ. </p>

Then Peter told them that the lame man was healed “in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene.” We have seen that the word “Nazarene” indicates the One despised by the Jewish leaders (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75107" data-verses="John 1:45-46">John 1:45-46</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75108" data-verses="Acts 22:8">Acts 22:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75109" data-verses="Acts 24:5">24:5</span>).

The Lord Jesus also quoted this verse in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75114" data-verses="Matthew 21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>, where He was indicating that He is the stone for God’s building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75115" data-verses="Isaiah 28:16">Isa. 28:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75116" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zech. 3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75117" data-verses="1Peter 2:4">1 Pet. 2:4</span>), and the “builders” were the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God’s building. His word unveiled the Jewish leaders’ rejection of Him and God’s honoring of Him for the building of His habitation among His people on earth. By this word Peter learned to know the Lord as the precious stone held in honor by God, as he expounded concerning Him in his first Epistle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75118" data-verses="1Peter 2:4-7">1 Pet. 2:4-7</span>). Peter’s quoting of this word indicates that he preached Christ not only as the Savior for the salvation of sinners, but also as the stone for God’s building. It is such a Christ who is the unique salvation to sinners and in whose unique name under heaven, a name despised and rejected by the Jewish leaders but honored and exalted by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75119" data-verses="Philippians 2:9-10">Phil. 2:9-10</span>), sinners must be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75120" data-verses="Acts 4:12">Acts 4:12</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBIQN1VmWnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75131" data-verses="Acts 4:24-26">Verses 24 through 26</span> continue, “And when they heard this, they lifted up their voice with one accord to God and said, O Lord, You who have made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things in them, who through the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of our father David Your servant, said, Why did the nations rage, and the peoples imagine vain things? The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ.” The Greek word rendered “Lord” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75132" data-verses="Acts 4:24">verse 24</span> is not <em>kurios,</em> the usual word for Lord, but <em>despotes,</em> which denotes the master of a slave, one who has absolute sovereign power, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75133" data-verses="Luke 2:29">Luke 2:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75134" data-verses="Jude 1:4">Jude 4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75135" data-verses="Revelation 6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75136" data-verses="1Timothy 6:1-2">1 Timothy 6:1-2</span>. Originally, the word rendered “rage” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75137" data-verses="Acts 4:25">verse 25</span> meant to snort like a horse; hence, to be haughty, insolent. </p>
<p data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBZpKD32QHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75138" data-verses="Acts 4:27-28">Verses 27 and 28</span> continue, “For truly in this city, there were gathered together against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You did anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the nations and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel predestined to take place.” The word “predestined” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75139" data-verses="Acts 4:28">verse 28</span> may remind us of the “determined counsel and foreknowledge of God” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75140" data-verses="Acts 2:23">2:23</span>. The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus was a purposeful fulfillment of the divine counsel determined by the Triune God. </p>

<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQX7mcfiR3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75178" data-verses="Acts 3:1">chapter three</span> of Acts Peter presents Christ, the Healer, as God’s Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, the Prophet, and the seed in whom all families of the earth will be blessed. Because this Healer is the Author of life, whenever we call on Him we enjoy a season of refreshing. As the Prophet, He speaks God to us, and in Him as the seed of Abraham we are blessed. All these aspects of Christ as the wonderful Healer are for us. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75179" data-verses="Acts 3:1">Acts 3</span> we do not see that this Healer is for God’s economy, God’s purpose, God’s building. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75180" data-verses="Acts 4:1">chapter four</span> Peter was given the opportunity to present this Healer in a further way, presenting Him as a stone for God’s building. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75181" data-verses="Acts 4:11-12">4:11 and 12</span> say, “This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. And there is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.” In this message we shall give a further word on Christ as the stone for God’s building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGRPjdwIYzY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-">THE CORNERSTONE OF GOD’S HABITATION</h2><p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-GjltXfcORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> God came in incarnation to be a stone for the building up of His universal habitation, but the Jewish leaders, who should have been the builders, despised this stone. However, God made Him the cornerstone. The more the Jewish leaders rejected Him, the more God used Him. First, He was a <span class="pg" data-page-id="128" id="128">[128]</span> stone only in a general way. But after the rejection by the Jewish leaders, God in resurrection made Him the cornerstone. At first He was a common stone. Then Jewish leaders rejected Him by killing Him. But God honored Him by raising Him up from among the dead and making Him a particular stone, the cornerstone, the very prominent stone that joins the walls of a building. Christ is the cornerstone of God’s habitation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3CyMEkPs3s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn">PETER’S KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST AS THE STONE</h2><p data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjQlzEIs23Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75182" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> we see that Andrew brought his brother, Simon Peter, to the Lord Jesus. “Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone)” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75183" data-verses="John 1:42">v. 42</span>). Later, in Caesarea Philippi, the Lord Jesus asked His disciples, “But you, who do you say that I am?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75184" data-verses="Matthew 16:15">Matt. 16:15</span>). Peter took the lead to declare, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75185" data-verses="Matthew 16:16">v. 16</span>). In His response to Peter, the Lord said, “I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75186" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">v. 18</span>). Here the name “Peter” means a stone, which is material for God’s building. The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, “You are Peter, a stone. I will build my church with stones.” </p>
<p data-content-id="OxXT42mbN-_IwwC73JgB077lOD0YMzE-XjPYijEZ2-L3hEiePh0clDIYHsHVPlhJm"> No doubt, the Lord’s word must have made a deep impression on Peter, even though it is not likely that he understood it at the time. However, after the life-giving Spirit had been breathed into him and after the economical Spirit had blown upon him, Peter became a man of Spirit, a man with the essential Spirit within him and the economical Spirit upon him. As such a man he surely began to understand the Lord’s word concerning him being a stone. Peter might have said to himself, “I recall that when I first met the Lord, He said that He would give me a new name, a name that means stone. Later He called me ‘Peter’ and said that He would build His church upon a rock. Now I understand what the Lord was saying.” </p>
<p data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKbtU99vjzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO"> Having this understanding, Peter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75187" data-verses="Acts 4:1">Acts 4</span> could present the Lord Jesus as the stone despised by the builders but <span class="pg" data-page-id="129" id="129">[129]</span> which has become the cornerstone. Later, when he had become old, he wrote his first Epistle, in which he spoke of the Lord as the living stone and of the believers as living stones for God’s building: “To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75188" data-verses="1Peter 2:4-5">1 Pet. 2:4-5a</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75189" data-verses="Acts 3:1-2">Acts 3 and 4</span>, Peter knew the Healer not only as God’s Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, the Prophet, and the seed in whom all the earth would be blessed; he also knew Him as the stone for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWE_Jrs0w5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> I do not believe that throughout the centuries many have taught from the Word that Jesus Christ is a stone for God’s building. He is not only the Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, the Prophet, and the seed; He is a stone for God’s building. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75190" data-verses="Acts 4:12">4:12</span>, this stone is the One in whom we can be saved. Hence, He is the Stone-Savior. As the Stone-Savior, He is solid, strong, and reliable. We can rely on Him and stand on Him. This stone is the rock, the foundation stone, and the cornerstone. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75191" data-verses="Zechariah 4:7">Zechariah 4:7</span> we see that He is even the topstone. Christ is the material for God’s building. God’s building is entirely of Christ. </p>

This is a false accusation. Yes, we say that Christ is our food, air, water, light, door, clothing, and dwelling place, although this certainly is not pantheism. Is Christ not qualified to be our food and drink? Is He not qualified to be our air, clothing, door, and dwelling place? Is He not the foundation stone, the cornerstone, the topstone, and all the stones for God’s building? Surely Christ is qualified to be all these things. However, today some detract from Christ’s qualifications and falsely accuse as pantheists those who teach from the Bible that Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="130" id="130">[130]</span> is all-inclusive, that He is all in all. The New Testament reveals that Christ is all in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75192" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Col. 3:11</span>), and we are the fullness of this One who is all in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75193" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">Eph. 1:23</span>). How wonderful that we are Christ’s fullness to express Him! </p>
<p data-content-id="clSZYpbJsMTyRlnc9CAjj82DUxpJYeKfy4Dt-eqWvnGgiKA6P3AKy7krljshseoz8"> It is in the name of Jesus Christ, the all-inclusive One, that we are saved. Do you know why His name is so powerful? His name is powerful because He is the wonderful, all-inclusive One. We have been saved in the name of Jesus Christ, and He is the all-inclusive One. As the all-inclusive One, Christ is God, man, the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the rock, the foundation, the cornerstone, the topstone, the door, our food, our drink, our clothing, our life, our strength, our ability, our function, our walk, our living, our words, our breath, our sight, our hearing. Oh, it is impossible to exhaust all that Christ is to us! </p>
<p data-content-id="YJs94s2aJDs7VNvpTj2WqvHDyQTQT1-VL5FhVS1mIG-dzYnTnvCO7bnb1cG2qXU2E"> Due to the influence of tradition, some say that we should not use new terms to express what Christ is. They claim that we should use only those terms used by the church fathers, the councils, and traditional teachings. This imposes a great restriction on God’s people. We need to break through this restriction and use new terms when necessary to convey the all-inclusiveness of Christ. We should not trust in traditional theology, for it restricts us and even misleads us. We need to see in the Word all the aspects of Christ. In particular, our Christ has the aspect of being a stone for God’s building. Hallelujah for this building stone! </p>

Concerning Himself as the stumbling stone and smiting stone, the Lord Jesus said, “He who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces, but on whomever it falls, it shall scatter him as chaff” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75194" data-verses="Matthew 21:44">Matt. 21:44</span>). To the believers, Christ is the foundation stone in whom we trust (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75195" data-verses="Isaiah 28:16">Isa. 28:16</span>). But to the unbelieving Jews, He is the stumbling stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75196" data-verses="Isaiah 8:14-15">Isa. 8:14-15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75197" data-verses="Romans 9:32-33">Rom. 9:32-33</span>), and to the nations He will be the smiting stone.

Barnabas, a Levite and a native of Cyprus, sold his property, brought the money from the sale, and placed it at the feet of the apostles for distribution among the saints according to need. This is part of the positive scene in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75249" data-verses="Acts 4:32-37">4:32-37</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="137" id="137">[137]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSShucBRc9bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057"> Following the positive scene at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75250" data-verses="Acts 4:1">chapter four</span>, Luke presents the negative scene in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75251" data-verses="Acts 5:1-11">5:1-11</span>. The negative scene involves a couple, Ananias and Sapphira: “But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property, and put aside for himself some of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it; and having brought a certain part, he laid it at the feet of the apostles” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75252" data-verses="Acts 5:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>). Ananias and Sapphira had an evil plan to deceive, to lie to, the indwelling Spirit. “But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart that you should lie to the Holy Spirit and put aside for yourself some of the proceeds of the land?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75253" data-verses="Acts 5:3">v. 3</span>). Ananias lied apparently to the apostles but actually to the Holy Spirit, who is God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75254" data-verses="Acts 5:4">v. 4</span>), because the Spirit and the apostles were one. </p>
<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG6fE57Mk8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> As we read these verses, we see that two persons were making their residence in this couple. First, the Spirit was no doubt dwelling in them. Because they were saved, the Holy Spirit had taken up His residence within them. Second, Satan was dwelling in them, for he had filled their hearts to lie to the Holy Spirit. Therefore, two residents—the Holy Spirit and Satan—were dwelling in Ananias and Sapphira. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip7OzJWid8Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF"> We need to realize that, as believers, we also have these two residents within us. However, some teachers of the Bible do not believe that Satan remains in the believers; neither do these teachers believe that saints can be possessed by demons. Because Jessie Penn-Lewis spoke about cases of demon possession of believers in her book <em>War on the Saints,</em> some went so far as to call her a “witch.” Although some may deny that believers can be possessed by demons, it is a fact that certain genuine believers have been demon possessed. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75255" data-verses="Acts 5:1">chapter five</span> of Acts is perhaps the first case of believers possessed by or deceived by Satan. Peter asked Ananias, “Why has Satan filled your heart?” This indicates that Satan was not merely outside them but was in their hearts deceiving them and seducing them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="138" id="138">[138]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tEw9Iiii-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf">The Problem of Ambition</h2><p data-content-id="ayDvwYGbF8kWY5F_5GlvURzv6UiHZVamrMqmbhtFN96IRxElNLGJfnroptl9R0_TX"> How could Satan have such ground within them? Satan had this ground because of their ambition. I have learned over the years that believers can be ambitious to have a name, position, title, and rank. This ambition can be found even among those in the church life. Both in the Orient and in the West I have seen those in the church who were ambitious concerning rank, position, title, and name. Even the young people may be ambitious to be leaders. </p>
<p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IVzV9o93cFq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> Recently in Taipei the Lord moved among us in such a way that we established more than four hundred small groups in the church. When we established similar groups in the past, we appointed a leader in every group and also assistants. However, we found out that those appointments became a factor of corruption. Therefore, this time we told the church that there would not be any designated leaders in the small groups. Rather, every one in every group could take the lead. </p>
<p data-content-id="q56ADhFm7_LcIoAPD0BFSg0PM8WaUIO8_vrnKMCsdpFo2iQHQ7PItJoxf0tRnNi13"> The ground in Ananias and Sapphira that was the basis for Satan’s deception of them was their desire to have a name. They wanted to have the reputation for having sold everything for the church. Because of their ambition, they formed a plan. They sold a piece of property, kept some of the proceeds for themselves, and then brought a certain part and laid it at the feet of the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOYKz1RRk0YVQ9GDerAAvYEC2xIcaMrEmSNYGfSmuuL0gRLldZ5UBQtK-b9YuTg7p"> As we have pointed out, Ananias and Sapphira lied to the Holy Spirit. Do you think that the Spirit to whom they lied was the Spirit in the heavens, the Spirit outside them? Do you think they lied merely to an objective Spirit? Ananias and Sapphira lied to the very Spirit who was within them. If the Holy Spirit had not been within them, why would Peter have said that they lied to the Holy Spirit? Both Satan and the Holy Spirit resided in Ananias and Sapphira at the same time. </p>
<p data-content-id="8hEVLiYPHPDrLKUUDOhp-2sIdV-olxt5lp8YViQRgoFO6adHYqE9Xo2xECC72P9rr"> Today there is a trend among Bible teachers to deny the fact that Satan, the Devil, dwells in man’s flesh. But consider Peter’s experience in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75256" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span>. Peter recognized that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. The Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="139" id="139">[139]</span> said to him, “You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75257" data-verses="Matthew 16:17">v. 17</span>). Later in the same chapter we see that Peter, the one who received a revelation from the Father, was also occupied by Satan. When Peter took the Lord and began to rebuke Him, “He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75258" data-verses="Matthew 16:23">v. 23</span>). Here we see that Satan was within Peter, not merely outside of him. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="01ti1r4uNODePuwq7FNe8zCbcI0Asch_5CI1PAYjW-KfNYvtApOjUcBbYG5vhQyHY">Ambition Resulting in Death</h2><p data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAZlr-NoKjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC"> Satan is not far from us, and we need to be careful lest we be deceived by him. If we would avoid Satan’s deception, we must reject, condemn, and abandon the ambition to be somebody in the church life. Whenever we have the thought of being somebody in the church life, Satan has the ground to deceive us and, spiritually speaking, to bring us into death. </p>

This section of Acts covers four matters: the Sanhedrin’s arrest of the apostles and the Lord’s rescue (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75285" data-verses="Acts 5:17-28">vv. 17-28</span>), the apostles’ testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75286" data-verses="Acts 5:29-32">vv. 29-32</span>), the Sanhedrin’s prohibition and release (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75287" data-verses="Acts 5:33-40">vv. 33-40</span>), and the apostles’ rejoicing and faithfulness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75288" data-verses="Acts 5:41-42">vv. 41-42</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqMwzb6RkdJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5">THE SANHEDRIN’S ARREST OF THE APOSTLES<br/>AND THE LORD’S RESCUE</h2><p data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlt4r1BbzOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75289" data-verses="Acts 5:14">Acts 5:14</span> says, “Believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and of women.” Because of this, “the high priest and all those with him (that is, the sect of the Sadducees) rose up and were filled with jealousy, and they laid their hands on the apostles and put them in public custody” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75290" data-verses="Acts 5:17-18">vv. 17-18</span>). The expression “public custody” denotes the outer prison house, not the inner prison used for serious cases. During the night, an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison and led the apostles out (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75291" data-verses="Acts 5:19">v. 19</span>). Those guarding the doors did not know what had happened. The next morning the Sanhedrin and the council of the elders of the sons of Israel sent deputies to the prison to get the apostles. “But when the deputies arrived, they did not find them in the prison; and when they returned, they reported, saying. The prison house we found locked with all security, and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened <span class="pg" data-page-id="144" id="144">[144]</span> the doors, we found no one inside” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75292" data-verses="Acts 5:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>). “The captain of the temple and the chief priests were utterly perplexed.” Then “someone came up and reported to them, Behold, the men whom you put in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75293" data-verses="Acts 5:24-25">vv. 24-25</span>). Although the religionists could not understand what had happened, the apostles had been rescued from prison and were in the temple teaching. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT58B6X94Ffvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj">THE WORDS OF THIS LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1NSps10L0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg"> When the angel of the Lord rescued the apostles from prison, he said to them, “Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75294" data-verses="Acts 5:20">v. 20</span>). We need to pay attention to the word “this,” for it indicates a particular life. The Greek word rendered “words” here is <em>rhema,</em> denoting the present spoken word, not the constant written word. Therefore, the angel was saying to the apostles, “Go and speak the present words of this life.” </p>
<p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2RWff51tqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> What life is indicated by “this life”? It is the divine life preached, ministered, and lived by Peter that overcame the Jewish leaders’ persecution, threatening, and imprisonment. This word indicates that Peter’s life and work made the divine life so real and present in his situation that even the angel saw it and pointed it out. </p>
<p data-content-id="SX_7dMl2HfxSBERUpEATfNrFHdrM23w5gIng7aE_LX2argmuVZZVL0WFlWju6AxQa"> The apostles were not told to speak of the divine life in a doctrinal way. Today certain Christians may talk about life, but their talk is altogether doctrinal. We need to seek mercy and grace from the Lord so that whenever we speak concerning the divine life, we speak the words of the very life we live. This means that the divine life becomes our daily life. It is this life that we should minister to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="g8IXFe6HuOguESGglqAOjuEbyypS3PnQmdHqw5ICsa7V_yGT9Yi4eMOByQVLvj_dD"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75295" data-verses="Acts 5:26">Acts 5:26</span> says, “Then the captain with the deputies went away and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.” The religious leaders did not know how to handle the situation. In particular, they did not know what to do with “this life.” Fearing the people, they did not do anything violent to the apostles. Instead, “having brought them, they stood them in the Sanhedrin. And the <span class="pg" data-page-id="145" id="145">[145]</span> high priest questioned them, saying, We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, and look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring upon us this man’s blood” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75296" data-verses="Acts 5:27-28">vv. 27-28</span>). Literally, the Greek words rendered “We strictly charged you” mean, “We charged you with a charge.” Those in the Sanhedrin charged the apostles not to speak anymore in the name of Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZvSFHloMxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45">THE APOSTLES’ TESTIMONY</h2><p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc8f2ptbQwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75297" data-verses="Acts 5:29-31">verses 29 through 31</span> “Peter and the apostles answered and said, It is necessary to obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you slew, hanging Him on a tree. This One God has exalted to His right hand as a Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.” Jesus’ incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man’s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader that He might be the Savior. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="NaxbvirwEM9IrWiLw2UgI1wpTMeYfdNPKigSWcaRtEc-jMmKUrEXcfIwob1MBGo1q">Concerning the Leader and the Savior</h2><p data-content-id="tGyva9892obRbw9l6K_IUTfOIjFQhBT0AQQVTHyEChz0auSMkGYTRa1jagwpmuJyF"> The Greek word rendered “Leader” is <em>archegos,</em> meaning author, origin, originator, chief leader, captain. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75298" data-verses="Acts 3:15">3:15</span> the same Greek word is translated “Author.” God exalted the Man Jesus, rejected and killed by the Jewish leaders, as the highest Leader, the Prince, the Ruler of the kings to rule over the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75299" data-verses="Revelation 1:5">Rev. 1:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75300" data-verses="Revelation 19:16">19:16</span>), and the Savior to save God’s chosen people. “Leader” is related to His authority, and “Savior” to His salvation. He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God’s chosen people to receive His salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75301" data-verses="Acts 17:26-27">Acts 17:26-27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75302" data-verses="John 17:2">John 17:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB7vSql1mKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> Who rules the earth today? We may say that the earth is ruled by kings and presidents, but the Lord Jesus as the highest Ruler is above them. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75303" data-verses="Revelation 1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>, He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth. Which title do you think is higher—ruler or king? Probably most people would say that a king is a higher title than a ruler. Nevertheless, <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> the New Testament speaks of Christ as the Ruler of the kings, and Peter says that He is the Leader, the chief Ruler. </p>
<p data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqMwzb8BUdJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5"> In a very real sense, Christ as the Ruler of the kings dethrones all the kings. Only He is the Ruler. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75304" data-verses="Revelation 19:16">Revelation 19:16</span>, He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. Christ is both the Ruler and the King. As the Ruler, He rules the entire earth. It may seem that kings and presidents rule the earth and that the Lord Jesus is not on the throne. Nevertheless, this One who seems not to be on the throne is the Ruler of all the enthroned ones. Today the entire world is under the Lord’s ruling. He is truly the Leader, the chief Ruler. </p>
<p data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlt4r1LJTOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX"> For what purpose is the Lord Jesus ruling the earth? As the Leader, the Ruler, He is ruling the earth for the purpose of our salvation. He is ruling so that we may be saved. Let us take as an illustration the case of Chinese immigrants to the United States. We have found that a great many of these immigrants are very open to the Lord. But if they had remained in China, it is not likely that they would be this open. The Lord Jesus exercises His authority to cause so many foreigners to come to this country. Then once they arrive, they become open to Him. This is an illustration of the Lord’s ruling the earth for the sake of saving people. </p>
<p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT58B6X2q1fvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> We believe that God has chosen us, and then at the right time the Lord Jesus, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, exercised His authority to produce a certain environment so that we had no choice except to believe in Him. In a sense, we have been “caught” by the Lord. A number of saints have testified that they have been caught by Him. We may not feel this way when we are in a season of refreshing. However, when the “sky” above us is not clear and we are in a “cloudy” situation spiritually speaking, we may begin to consider that the Lord has caught us, even trapped us. We may also believe that we are caught in the church life. There is no way for us to escape from the Lord’s “trap.” We have been caught by Christ and in Christ; furthermore, we have been caught in the church. In a sense, this is our situation. We have been caught by the Lord in His sovereignty. <span class="pg" data-page-id="147" id="147">[147]</span> </p>

At the very beginning of the practice of the church life, there was trouble caused by different languages. Proper care was taken to solve this problem. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_c_NyMGyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> Often there are problems in the church life. These problems are not caused by outsiders but by those in the church. The first problem recorded in Acts was caused by a couple, Ananias and Sapphira, who were ambitious and dishonest. That problem was solved by God’s sovereign judgment. From this we see that we may not need to do much about certain problems in the church, for those problems are taken care of by the Lord’s sovereignty. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75328" data-verses="Acts 6:1">chapter six</span> of Acts we have another kind of problem—the problem of language or of race. Apparently the problem in the church at Jerusalem <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> was a problem of language related to those who spoke Hebrew and those who spoke Greek. Actually, this was a problem not mainly of language but of race. </p>
<p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paSXKYr894ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75329" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> that Jews had come from their dispersion to Jerusalem to keep the feast of Pentecost. Those who had been dispersed among other races gradually came to speak the languages of those races. Thus, when they came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of Pentecost, they were not able to speak Hebrew but spoke their native languages. In particular, the Hellenists spoke Greek. The difference of language became a problem. Actually, the source of the trouble was not language but race. If all of mankind were of one race, there would probably be just one language. Different languages are the result of different races. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75330" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span>, the source of this problem was Babel. </p>

For example, among those saved through our gospel preaching on the island of Taiwan were those who spoke a number of different languages, including the local dialect. We certainly suffered from the problems caused by different languages. </p>

However, because it became possible for so many Chinese-speaking people to emigrate to this country, it became necessary to have a work among the Chinese-speaking ones. The Lord has blessed this work very much. We thank the Lord that although we have among us those of different languages and races, we do not have a problem concerning language or race. We are thankful to the Lord for His mercy and for all that we have learned in the past related to this. We praise Him that race and language are no longer a problem! </p>

To minister the word and pray are major matters, but to serve tables is a minor matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IVzWdo-38Fq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75333" data-verses="Acts 6:3-4">verses 3 and 4</span> the apostles went on to say, “Now brothers, select seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this need. But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.” The Greek word for “full” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75334" data-verses="Acts 6:3">verse 3</span> is <em>pleres,</em> an adjective form of <em>pleroo,</em> according to the usage here and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75335" data-verses="Acts 6:5">6:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75336" data-verses="Acts 7:55">7:55</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75337" data-verses="Acts 11:24">11:24</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75338" data-verses="Luke 4:1">Luke 4:1</span>.

This refers to life, not to work. The word “wisdom” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75340" data-verses="Acts 6:3">6:3</span> also indicates that in this verse to be full of the Spirit is for life, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75341" data-verses="Luke 2:52">Luke 2:52</span>. </p>

To pray is not only to entreat the Lord to do things for His move, but also to cause our spirit to be exercised and to be strengthened. Hence, prayer should precede the word just as the apostles practiced. Without such prayer, the ministry may not be enlivened and empowered. </p>

This is a pattern we need to follow today. According to this pattern, we should not keep all the responsibilities on our own shoulders, but distribute the responsibilities to all the saints. This is an important principle. We have learned much from the pattern in Acts, and we have been following this pattern in the church life for more than fifty years. </p>
<p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsInsLLofGFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> Allow me to testify concerning my experience of distributing responsibilities to others. Some may think that I am capable and able to do many things. Actually, I am not unusually capable. However, I have learned to distribute responsibility to other saints. For example, the Lord blessed the work in Chefoo. When it was time for me to leave that city, it was very easy to do so. There was no need to talk to the brothers about the work, the church service, and other things, because I had learned not to keep matters in my hands. For years, the things concerning the church and the work had been distributed to the saints, and they were bearing the responsibility for these things. Therefore, when the time came for me to leave, I simply left. </p>
<p data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKIWkzz2GZh9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG"> I had a similar experience in the church in Shanghai. Some had the concept that many things related to the church were in my hands. Actually, that was not the situation at all. When I received word from Brother Nee that I should leave Mainland China, I left within a couple of days. The things in the church had been distributed to the brothers. </p>
<p data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1cqXbw4bEEn3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp"> This has also been my practice in the church life in this country. If you inquire of the brothers who know the history among us, they will be able to tell you that I have not kept the matters of the church to myself. Once again, I have had the practice of distributing the responsibility to others. For <span class="pg" data-page-id="157" id="157">[157]</span> this reason, there are many things concerning the local churches that I do not know. If you ask me about these things, I would refer you to the elders or to the church service office. My point here is that by the Lord’s mercy we have learned to distribute responsibility to others. </p>

The word “synagogue” is the anglicized form of the Greek word <em>sunagoge,</em> composed of <em>sun,</em> together, and <em>ago,</em> to bring; hence, a collecting, gathering, congregation, assembly; by transition, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> place of gathering.

The Sanhedrin condemned the Lord Jesus to death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75386" data-verses="Matthew 26:59">Matt. 26:59</span>) and persecuted the believers.

The opposing Jews twisted the believers’ words, as they did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75398" data-verses="Matthew 27:40">Matthew 27:40</span> regarding the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75399" data-verses="John 2:19">John 2:19</span> when they crucified Him. Undoubtedly, the Jews’ opposition was instigated by Satan to frustrate God’s New Testament economy. But the ground used by Satan for his instigation was the change of dispensation, which contradicted the Judaic traditions. God’s New Testament economy is to have a new dispensation absolutely separated from Judaism. This offended the Jews by touching the traditions they had inherited for generations and stirred up their opposition, which began with the Lord’s ministry in the Gospels and grew more fierce toward the apostles’ ministry in the Acts, during which the Lord’s New Testament move was passing through a transitional period. </p>
<p data-content-id="9B3GelIP98ERinHYotK7LX0V_Tl3VD5C0GrAN_47CuFPIXBZ0UnuKxTnHsaPni2Fg"> According to Luke’s narration in Acts, the church among the Jews, including the early apostles, did not pass through this transition successfully due to the remaining influence of their Judaic background and the entangling opposition from their Judaic kinsmen. This trouble returned to them again and again in Acts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75400" data-verses="Acts 11:1-3">11:1-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75401" data-verses="Acts 15:1-5">15:1-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75402" data-verses="Acts 21:18-26">21:18-26</span>).

<p data-content-id="jHPCvHM6AJL14sHMuMXv4rpZKdllursp8MnQXFHjxCUMf5qoYcCmTHDm7GFZatUid"> In Acts the Jewish believers still practiced the keeping of the Old Testament law, as indicated by the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75404" data-verses="Acts 21:20">21:20</span> spoken to Paul by James and the elders in Jerusalem. James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers still remained in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law. They even advised Paul to practice such a semi-Judaic mixture (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75405" data-verses="Acts 21:17-26">21:17-26</span>). They were unaware that the dispensation of law was altogether over and that the dispensation of grace should be fully honored, and that any disregard of the distinction between these two dispensations would be against God’s dispensational administration <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> and would be a great damage to God’s economical plan for the building up of the church as the expression of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="T-2PL0pYEh4xbDc2-gvnQOxuN30o1T5sQX2Xs2X0xJS4o-7h7OkAAU9bwEGWRJ0lt"> The children of Israel had been given the law through Moses. They also had a system of worship involving the temple, the priests, and the offerings. With the children of Israel the two main things were the law and the temple as the center of their worship. Both the law and the temple were types of Christ. It is not God’s intention to have a written law and a material temple. God’s intention is to have the living Christ as the law of life and also to have Christ as the living temple for God’s New Testament economy. God desires to have Christ as the living law within us and as the living temple outside of us so that He may carry out His New Testament economy. This economy is absolutely a matter of the Triune God mingling Himself with His chosen people to produce a corporate entity for His expression. This was God’s intention from the very beginning in the book of Genesis. However, the children of Israel regarded the law and the temple in a traditional way according to dead letters. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVcfo2rqPMnLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd"> About fifteen hundred years after the law was given, the Triune God came in incarnation.

This indicates the termination of the Old Testament dispensation. Although the principles of the law cannot be terminated, the dispensation of the law was ended. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75408" data-verses="Matthew 23:38">verse 38</span> He said, “Behold, your house is left to you desolate.” Here “house” denotes the house of God, the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75409" data-verses="Matthew 21:12-13">Matt. 21:12-13</span>). This prophecy concerning the desolation of the temple corresponds to that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75410" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">Matthew 24:2</span>, where the Lord said concerning the temple, “Truly I say to you, A stone shall by no means be left upon a stone which shall not be thrown down.” This was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when Titus destroyed Jerusalem with the Roman army. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75411" data-verses="Matthew 23:38">Matthew 23:38</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75412" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">24:2</span> the Lord indicated to His disciples that the material temple, which <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> had become a frustration to God’s economy, would be destroyed. </p>
<p data-content-id="Rk893wdUx5BEGaMPM8EI_k_Y9RUXWC8S9x4OY1mdzGmnzTwz2JfO8yuVuuay8b7Zz"> The Lord Jesus indicated plainly that the law would be terminated and that the temple would be destroyed. No doubt, His word made a deep impression on the disciples. They must have had fellowship concerning the termination of the law and the destruction of the temple, since both the temple and law were great matters to the Jews. </p>
<p data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDp9Mdh0Mw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx"> After the Lord ascended to the heavens and the Spirit was poured out, there was a prevailing move among His disciples. The opposers began to twist the words that must have been circulating among the believers concerning the termination of the dispensation of the law and the destruction of the temple. In particular, the opposers accused Stephen of “speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God” and of saying that “Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75413" data-verses="Acts 6:11">Acts 6:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75414" data-verses="Acts 6:14">14</span>). To be sure, the opposers were twisting the truth. The Lord Jesus had spoken concerning the termination of the dispensation of law and the destruction of the temple. But the opposers twisted His word. </p>

<p data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tHxdIpwy-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf"> As Stephen testified before the Sanhedrin, he said, “Men, brothers, and fathers, listen! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, and said to him, Go out of your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75425" data-verses="Acts 7:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>). The glory spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75426" data-verses="Acts 7:2">verse 2</span> might have been visible glory (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75427" data-verses="Acts 7:55">v. 55</span>), as when the cloud and the fire appeared to Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75428" data-verses="Exodus 16:10">Exo. 16:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75429" data-verses="Exodus 24:16-17">24:16-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75430" data-verses="Leviticus 9:23">Lev. 9:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75431" data-verses="Numbers 14:10">Num. 14:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75432" data-verses="Numbers 16:19">16:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75433" data-verses="Numbers 20:6">20:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75434" data-verses="Deuteronomy 5:24">Deut. 5:24</span>) and filled the tabernacle and temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75435" data-verses="Exodus 40:35">Exo. 40:35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75436" data-verses="1Kings 8:11">1 Kings 8:11</span>). It was the God of such glory who appeared to Abraham and called him. His glory was a great attraction to Abraham. It separated, sanctified, him from the world unto God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75437" data-verses="Exodus 29:43">Exo. 29:43</span>), and it was a great encouragement and strength which enabled him to follow God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75438" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Gen. 12:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75439" data-verses="Genesis 12:4">4</span>). In the same principle, God also calls the New Testament believers by His invisible glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75440" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">2 Pet. 1:3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="q56ADhFm7_LcIoAPA1hFRhUPM8WaUIO8_vrnKMCsdpFo2iQHQ7PItJoxf0tRnNi13"> Stephen’s teaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75441" data-verses="Acts 7:1">Acts 7</span> begins with the word regarding the God of glory appearing to Abraham. We do not <span class="pg" data-page-id="170" id="170">[170]</span> know where Stephen gained this understanding, for in Genesis we are not told that the God of glory appeared to Abraham. But Stephen tells us that when God appeared to Abraham, He appeared as the God of glory. Although we do not know where Stephen learned this, we believe that his word was spoken according to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Stephen’s message, therefore, begins with the God of glory calling Abraham. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOYKz1RRk0YVQ9GDdqgAsZkC2xIcaMrEmSNYGfSmuuL0gRLldZ5UBQtK-b9YuTg7p"> Stephen’s word about the God of glory fits in with God’s New Testament economy. Peter in his second Epistle tells us that God has called us by His glory and to His glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75442" data-verses="2Peter 1:3">2 Pet. 1:3</span>). Because we have been called by God’s invisible glory, we eventually received the Lord Jesus, realizing that He is better than anything else and anyone else. For example, certain Chinese believers came to appreciate Jesus Christ more than Confucius. Because of this appreciation, they eventually believed in the Lord and received Him. This evaluation of Christ implies glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="8hEVLiYPHPDrLKUUAPBp90MIdV-olxt5lp8YViQRgoFO6adHYqE9Xo2xECC72P9rr"> The God of glory called Abraham, and Abraham was attracted and caught by that glory. The principle is the same with us today. We all have been caught by the Lord in His invisible glory. We have been captured by His glory, and we cannot escape. </p>

And from there, after his father died, He removed him into this land, in which you are now dwelling.” Apparently it was Abraham journeying into Canaan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75444" data-verses="Genesis 12:4-5">Gen. 12:4-5</span>), but actually it was God removing him into the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsLlsLIp_GFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75445" data-verses="Acts 7:5-6">Acts 7:5 and 6</span> continue, “And He did not give him an inheritance in it, not even a place to set his foot on; and while he had no child He promised to give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him. And God spoke to this effect, that his seed would be a sojourner in a land belonging to others, and they would enslave them and mistreat them four hundred years.” The land referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75446" data-verses="Acts 7:6">verse 6</span> is <span class="pg" data-page-id="171" id="171">[171]</span> Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75447" data-verses="Exodus 1:1">Exo. 1:1</span>), and the pronoun “they” denotes the Egyptians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75448" data-verses="Exodus 1:11">Exo. 1:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75449" data-verses="Exodus 1:13-14">13-14</span>). The word “them” refers to the seed. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75450" data-verses="Acts 7:6">verse 6</span>, Abraham’s seed was to be mistreated in Egypt for four hundred years. This differs from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75451" data-verses="Galatians 3:17">Galatians 3:17</span> which speaks of four hundred and thirty years. This is the length of time counted from the time God gave Abraham the promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75452" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12</span> to the time He gave the law through Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75453" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span>. This period was considered by God as the time of the children of Israel’s dwelling in Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75454" data-verses="Exodus 12:40-41">Exo. 12:40-41</span>). The four hundred years mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75455" data-verses="Genesis 15:13">Genesis 15:13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75456" data-verses="Acts 7:6">Acts 7:6</span> are counted from the time Ishmael mocked Isaac in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75457" data-verses="Genesis 21:1">Genesis 21</span> to the time the children of Israel came out of the Egyptian tyranny in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75458" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>. This is the period when Abraham’s descendants suffered the persecution of the Gentiles. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKIVmzz1G5h9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG">Jacob, Joseph, and Moses</h2><p data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1cpVbw7bkEn3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75459" data-verses="Acts 7:14-15">Acts 7:14 and 15</span> Stephen speaks of Jacob’s going down into Egypt: “Joseph sent and called for Jacob his father and all his relatives—seventy-five souls in all. And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he ended his days, he and our fathers.” We should compare the number seventy-five in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75460" data-verses="Acts 7:14">verse 14</span> with the number seventy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75461" data-verses="Genesis 46:27">Genesis 46:27</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75462" data-verses="Exodus 1:5">Exodus 1:5</span>. Stephen quoted this number from the Septuagint, which adds Joseph’s five descendants in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75463" data-verses="Genesis 46:20">Genesis 46:20</span>. Hence, the number he mentioned of the house of Jacob who came to Egypt was seventy-five instead of seventy. </p>
<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQU6WcYyx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75464" data-verses="Acts 7:18">Acts 7:18</span> Stephen says that “another king rose up over Egypt who did not know Joseph.” The Greek word rendered “another” also means different in character. The king referred to here was not only another king, but a king of a different character. </p>
<p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGSOTd2YozY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75465" data-verses="Acts 7:20-44">7:20 through 44</span> Stephen purposely gives a long narration in the most positive way concerning Moses. He did this to vindicate himself before his opposers, who had accused him of blaspheming Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75466" data-verses="Acts 6:11">6:11</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75467" data-verses="Acts 7:20">verse 20</span> Stephen says, “At which time Moses was born and was handsome to God; and he was nurtured three months in his father’s house.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> The Greek words translated “handsome to God” also mean “fair to God.” This is a Hebraism denoting fair in the sight of God; hence, exceedingly fair. </p>

F. Bruce). </p>
<p data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3Bz8Evdc3s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75469" data-verses="Acts 7:22">Acts 7:22</span> says, “And Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and deeds.” The wisdom mentioned here is wisdom in learning. </p>

In Jerusalem, the gospel preaching was carried out mainly by the apostles. Although this also is a pattern, it is not the unique pattern for our gospel preaching. If it were the unique pattern, then the preaching of the gospel would be limited. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75547" data-verses="Acts 8:4">8:4</span> we have another pattern of the preaching of the gospel—the preaching of the gospel through the scattering, the migrating, of the saints. <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="63PjdVBPG51GyPm3VUGqIemT1y1Uj-ESJwos787hQjcxafhitczkEPKKkKzBqHe70"> Before the scattering of the saints in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75549" data-verses="Acts 8:4">8:4</span>, there were many thousands of believers in Jerusalem. Like most people, they probably did not desire to move; instead, they may have wanted to settle there. But the Lord is sovereign, for He is the Leader, the Ruler of the kings. Although Satan instigated the persecution against the church, the Lord is over Satan, and whatever Satan does is under the Lord’s sovereignty. Therefore, the persecution in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75550" data-verses="Acts 8:1">chapter eight</span> actually worked out for the spreading of the gospel, because thousands of believers were scattered throughout the lands of Judea and Samaria. Through this scattering the good news was brought to many cities. Here we have the pattern of the preaching of the gospel through the migration of the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="Rk893wdUx5BEGaMPM8kI8kfY9RUXWC8S9x4OY1mdzGmnzTwz2JfO8yuVuuay8b7Zz"> For many years in the Lord’s recovery we have been practicing the matter of migration. For example, many saints were gathered to Los Angeles from 1962 until 1970. Then in 1970 we began to migrate, and the migration was a great success. When the saints migrate, the gospel goes out with them. The migrating saints bring the gospel wherever they may go. </p>
<p data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDp9sdi1sw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx"> All the churches should follow the pattern in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75551" data-verses="Acts 8:4">8:4</span> concerning migration. The saints should not stay in a certain place for too long. On the contrary, we all should be migrants, following in the footsteps of our father Abraham. Abraham was a river-crosser; he migrated from Chaldea to Canaan. Like Abraham, we should not be permanently settled. We all should learn to migrate. </p>

But we thank the Lord that recently the saints have begun to migrate again. In the last year a number of churches have been raised up through the migrating of the saints. <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="mlcLhH-3w5KZuNDv9zdvCfSzmtunqHXxKV7NNVCdEbwgO3dnwE5vpipW8E4hgdOFK"> The saints in all the churches should be encouraged to migrate. If the saints in a certain locality do not migrate, eventually that locality will become a “Dead Sea.” The Dead Sea is a reservoir for the water from the river Jordan. Once the water from the Jordan reaches the Dead Sea it does not proceed any farther. If the church in a particular locality is to avoid becoming such a Dead Sea, a “canal” must be dug to allow the “water” to flow out. Perhaps ten percent of the saints in a locality may migrate each year. This will allow for the necessary outflow without devastating the church. Furthermore, if water is allowed to flow out, more water will flow in. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuGjIAnEo5IafG53sAle39ypiGKgO2xOWEc6_4BynTJX3LLZmIC9oRziJLF_biW7b"> Using the illustration of a hose, we may say that every church should be like a hose that is open at both ends. When a hose is open in this way, water is able to flow in and out. But if water is not able to flow out of a hose, nothing more will be able to flow in. How much water flows in depends on how much flows out. If we want the church to increase, there must be the outflow. Only when there is an outflow can the church in a certain locality be preserved from becoming a Dead Sea. </p>
<p data-content-id="AY-SUR-EoOuNw4w4Yh6DJg70E3N7TuSXEOTbw_G2bv_OjbWVvXlpJAskEmK1oKtQB"> However, the migration of the saints is not a legality. The point we are making is that the churches need to follow the pattern in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75552" data-verses="Acts 8:4">8:4</span>. This means that, in principle, we should be willing to migrate. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97mfjfU7vK6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq"> From my own experience I can testify of the importance of migration. At first, I did not want to move but preferred to settle down in one place. But the Lord is the Ruler of the kings, and He did not allow me to settle down. Instead, He caused my life to be a life of traveling. I moved here and there, and eventually I came to the United States. After spending more than twenty years in this country, I am burdened to spend more time in Taiwan because of the need in the churches there. </p>

In following the Lord, Abraham had no lack. Likewise, as we migrate for the gospel’s sake the Lord will meet our needs.

For He had not yet fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.” In these verses we see a matter of great importance. The scattered saints had done a good job in preaching the gospel. They had migrated with the gospel, and Philip had strengthened their preaching of the gospel. As a result, a marvelous work was done. But although the Lord did much through the preaching of the scattered saints and Philip the evangelist, He reserved one thing—the economical Spirit. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75582" data-verses="Acts 8:14-16">8:14-16</span>, the Samaritan believers had not yet received the economical Spirit. Peter and John were sent to them and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit economically. </p>

From this pattern we see that the gospel <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> work should not be independent of the Body of Christ. The scattered saints and Philip the evangelist carried on a very good work. But if the Lord had not withheld something, they might have been encouraged to be independent. They might have said, “Peter and John, we are doing the same thing that you are doing in Jerusalem. Whatever you can do, we can do also.” In order to prevent such an attitude of independence, the Lord withheld the economical Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGSOzd2aozY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-">A Particular Case</h2><p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-Fi1teNcORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75583" data-verses="Acts 8:15">8:15</span>, Peter and John prayed for the Samaritan believers to receive the Holy Spirit. The situation here is different from that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75584" data-verses="Acts 2:38">2:38</span>. The apostles preached and ministered Christ, but when their hearers repented and believed in Him, they received the wonderful Spirit of the Triune God. This implies that this Spirit is just the resurrected and ascended Christ Himself. The receiving of the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75585" data-verses="Acts 2:38">2:38</span> is both essential and economical, in a general and all-inclusive sense. It differs from the receiving of the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75586" data-verses="Acts 8:15-17">8:15-17</span>, which is particularly the receiving of the Spirit falling upon the believers economically. </p>
<p data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3BzcEsd83s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75587" data-verses="Acts 8:16">Acts 8:16</span> tells us that before Peter and John came, the Holy Spirit had not fallen upon the believers in Samaria. This does not mean that those new believers had not received the Holy Spirit within them essentially when they believed in the Lord. According to the teaching of the New Testament in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75588" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75589" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">Galatians 3:2</span>, they should have received the Holy Spirit essentially when they believed for their regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75590" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75591" data-verses="John 3:36">36</span>). But they had not yet received the Spirit economically to identify them with the Body of Christ. The reason the Holy Spirit did not fall upon them outwardly and economically was that the apostles, through whom the practical establishment of the church was initiated in Jerusalem, might come to bring them into identification with the Body of Christ. This case is different from those in the house of Cornelius, who received the Holy Spirit when they believed in the Lord, both essentially within them for regeneration and economically upon them <span class="pg" data-page-id="189" id="189">[189]</span> for baptism into the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75592" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Cor. 12:13</span>) and identification with the Body of Christ. That was because the gospel was preached then directly by Peter, who played the main role in the initiation of the practical establishment of the church. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjTkjEIt23Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h">The Spreading of the Body of Christ</h2><p data-content-id="OxXT42mbN-_IwwC70IwB067lOD0YMzE-XjPYijEZ2-L3hEiePh0clDIYHsHVPlhJm"> We need to learn from the pattern presented here not to be independent of the Body in our gospel work. Suppose some migrate to a particular locality and begin a work there. If these saints think that they can do everything, they may become independent of the Body. This means that they actually become a division, a sect. </p>
<p data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKYsE99ujzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO"> The pattern in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75593" data-verses="Acts 8:1">chapter eight</span> reveals that the Head of the Body is sovereign. He gave many things to the believers in Samaria, but He did not give the economical Spirit until the apostles came and laid their hands on the believers. Only then did the economical Spirit come upon these new believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWH-Zrs1w5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> The situation among most believers today is very different from that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75594" data-verses="Acts 8:1">Acts 8</span>. Often Christian workers have the attitude that they are qualified to do everything. It seems that today it is as easy to open a so-called church as it is to open a restaurant, if not easier. Concerning this, the situation is deplorable. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh69NyV8QR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> When the migrants went out from Jerusalem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75595" data-verses="Acts 8:1">Acts 8</span>, they did not establish churches of their own. On the contrary, they spread the Body of Christ. The work done in Samaria needed to be confirmed by the apostles. Therefore, Peter and John confirmed the new believers and identified them with the Body by laying their hands on them. Then the Spirit came upon these believers economically for their identification with the Body of Christ. From this we see that the work done in Samaria was not an independent work, a separate work. Rather, what was produced in Samaria was truly the spreading of the Body of Christ. The church in that locality did not belong independently and separately to the migrated saints. Neither was it a work belonging to Philip <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> in a separate, independent way. No, it was part of the Body. This means that what came out through the migration and through Philip’s gospel preaching was part of the Body of Christ. Spontaneously, unlike the situation today, the oneness of the Body was maintained. </p>

But later, in practice, the believers were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus, both in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75598" data-verses="Acts 8:16">Acts 8:16</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75599" data-verses="Acts 19:5">19:5</span>, and into Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75600" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Romans 6:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75601" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Galatians 3:27</span>.

In this way the Samaritan believers received the Holy Spirit economically in addition to their receiving the Holy Spirit essentially when they believed in the Lord Jesus. </p>

In this case there are a number of patterns that we should follow in our gospel preaching today. </p>
<p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc_c2prIgwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75617" data-verses="Acts 8:27-28">Verses 27 and 28</span> say, “And he rose up and went. And behold, an Ethiopian man, a eunuch, a man in power under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, had come to worship in Jerusalem, and was returning and sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.” Ethiopia is Cush (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75618" data-verses="Isaiah 18:1">Isa. 18:1</span>), the land of the descendants of Cush, the son of Ham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75619" data-verses="Genesis 10:6">Gen. 10:6</span>). The gospel had spread from the racially pure Jews to the mixed Samaritans through Philip and Peter and John (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75620" data-verses="Acts 8:5-25">vv. 5-25</span>). Now the angel of the Lord directed Philip to contact a total Gentile from Ethiopia. Through this the gospel also spread southward to Africa. </p>
<p data-content-id="NaxbvirwEM9IrWiLz1UgBmwpTMeYfdNPKigSWcaRtEc-jMmKUrEXcfIwob1MBGo1q"> The Ethiopian man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75621" data-verses="Acts 8:27">verse 27</span> had come to worship in Jerusalem. This proves that the Ethiopian eunuch was seeking after God (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75622" data-verses="Acts 17:26-27">17:26-27</span>). According to the Lord’s sovereign arrangement, Philip came into contact with this God-seeking man, with one who was hungry and thirsty for God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> </p>

It was sovereign that the Ethiopian was reading from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75624" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span>: “Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He does not open His mouth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75625" data-verses="Acts 8:32">v. 32</span>). This verse, a quotation from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75626" data-verses="Isaiah 53:7">Isaiah 53:7</span>, refers to Christ the Redeemer. It must have been sovereignly of the Spirit’s leading that this passage concerning Christ as the sinner’s redeeming Lamb, a good passage for gospel preaching, was opened to the eunuch. Therefore, “Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture he brought the good news of Jesus to him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75627" data-verses="Acts 8:35">v. 35</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="AY-SUR-EoOuNw4w4YgaDJi70E3N7TuSXEOTbw_G2bv_OjbWVvXlpJAskEmK1oKtQB"> Here we see the principle that in preaching the gospel we need to use the best portions of the Bible. This means that in our gospel preaching we should not speak concerning peculiar things. For example, after learning that stone is a basic item in the Scriptures, you may want to take this as a subject for your gospel preaching. However, such a subject may not be appropriate for the preaching of the gospel. We should always use a proper portion of the Word in our gospel preaching. We should select a portion like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75628" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97mfi_U4vq6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq"> Under the Lord’s sovereignty, Philip used <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75629" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> to preach the gospel to a Gentile. This Gentile, a descendant of Cush, the son of Ham, a cursed man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75630" data-verses="Genesis 9:22-27">Gen. 9:22-27</span>), heard the complete gospel and was saved. This was the first step taken by the Lord in spreading His gospel to typical Gentiles. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75631" data-verses="Acts 8:29">8:29</span> “the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.” The Spirit here, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75632" data-verses="Acts 8:39">verse 39</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75633" data-verses="Acts 10:19">10:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75634" data-verses="Acts 13:2">13:2</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75635" data-verses="Acts 16:6-7">16:6-7</span>, indicates that the Lord’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="197" id="197">[197]</span> move in spreading His kingdom through the preaching of the gospel in Acts was by the Spirit’s leading and direction, not by man’s device and schedule. Hence, it was not the act of man but of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBLQd1VlWnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> We all should learn from this pattern to pray and to keep ourselves in fellowship with the Lord. If we maintain our fellowship with the Lord, we shall be able to sense His leading at any time. Then our move and our preaching of the gospel will be according to the Spirit’s direction. We need to follow the Spirit’s guidance, not our opinion, plan, and schedule. May we learn to have all our activity in preaching the gospel always under the direction and guidance of the Spirit. </p>

Today there is much debate among Christians concerning water baptism. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75637" data-verses="Acts 8:1">Acts 8</span> we have the case of a genuine Gentile believing in the Lord. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75638" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> Philip “brought the good news of Jesus to him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75639" data-verses="Acts 8:35">v. 35</span>). Then “as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch says, Look, water! What prevents me from being baptized?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75640" data-verses="Acts 8:36">v. 36</span>). The fact that the Ethiopian eunuch had such a reaction when seeing water indicates that Philip in his gospel preaching should have spoken to him about water baptism. If Philip had not said anything about baptism, it is not likely that the Ethiopian would have reacted in this way. Philip may still have been talking about water baptism when they came to the water in which the eunuch was baptized. </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyevJTvGrxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> It is important for us to see that in this case of water baptism, a typical case, nothing is said about Spirit baptism. In particular, there is no mention of the Ethiopian eunuch speaking in tongues. Certainly if the eunuch had spoken in tongues, Luke would have given an account of this in his record. Since he records this case of water baptism, he surely would have recorded the experience of speaking in tongues had it taken place here. Those who promote tongue-speaking <span class="pg" data-page-id="198" id="198">[198]</span> today need to pay attention to this case. This typical case of water baptism is a pattern, but in this pattern there is no mention at all of tongue-speaking. Luke’s record here emphasizes water baptism. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo-kSpOuUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk">WATER BAPTISM AND SPIRIT BAPTISM</h2><p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZibOcAJjnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> We have seen that the eunuch’s reaction to seeing water indicates that Philip had preached water baptism to him. In this gospel case water baptism is particularly emphasized, but no mention is made of Spirit baptism. This should give us strong instruction that we must pay attention to water baptism, which signifies the believers’ identification with Christ’s death and resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75641" data-verses="Romans 6:5">Rom. 6:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75642" data-verses="Colossians 2:12">Col. 2:12</span>), as well as to Spirit baptism. Spirit baptism signifies the reality of the believers’ union with Christ in life essentially and in power economically, whereas water baptism is the believers’ affirmation of the Spirit’s reality. Both are needed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75643" data-verses="Acts 10:47">10:47</span>), and neither can replace the other. All believers in Christ should properly have both, just as the children of Israel were baptized both in the cloud (signifying the Spirit) and in the sea (signifying water), as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75644" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:2">1 Corinthians 10:2</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2cZgJ09GCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> Concerning baptism, water signifies death and burial for the termination of repentant people, and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and resurrection for the germination of the terminated ones. The death-water, pointing to and signifying the all-inclusive death of Christ into which His believers are baptized, buries not only the baptized ones themselves but also their sins, the world, and their past. It also separates them from the God-forsaking world and its corruption. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75645" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Rom. 8:9</span>). Hence, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75646" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75647" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Rom. 6:3</span>), into the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75648" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>), and even into the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75649" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Cor. 12:13</span>), which is joined to Christ in the one Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75650" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). It is through baptism in such a water and in such a Spirit that the believers in Christ are regenerated into the kingdom of God, into the realm of the divine <span class="pg" data-page-id="199" id="199">[199]</span> life and the divine rule (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75651" data-verses="John 3:3">John 3:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75652" data-verses="John 3:5">5</span>), so that they may live by the eternal life of God in His eternal kingdom. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_f8dyPGSB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig">One Baptism</h2><p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paRUaYo8d4ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75653" data-verses="Acts 8:1">chapter eight</span> of Acts, the eunuch received water baptism and Spirit baptism at the same time. There are not two baptisms, a water baptism and a Spirit baptism. Water baptism and Spirit baptism are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSRhecBQc9bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057"> Bible teachers have debated whether the baptism in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75654" data-verses="Romans 6:1">Romans 6</span> refers to water baptism or Spirit baptism. Actually, there is no need for argument about this, because in God’s economy there is only one baptism. It would be wrong to ask whether this one baptism is water baptism or Spirit baptism. To ask such a question indicates a lack of knowledge. In the sight of God there is one baptism with two aspects—the aspect of water and the aspect of Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG5f057Nk8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> For God there is not the need of water, only of Spirit. However, as human beings, who are physical, we have the need for a material confirmation of spiritual things. Water baptism, therefore, is the outward affirmation of inward Spirit baptism. </p>

Saul, a persecutor, was a young man with a very strong sense of purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVcfpmrif8nLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd"> Saul was born in Tarsus, a highly cultured city, and received his Greek education at the university there. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75665" data-verses="Acts 22:3">22:3</span> he says that he studied “at the feet of Gamaliel, having been trained according to the strictness of the law.” This indicates that he received his religious education from Gamaliel, a great rabbi. No doubt, Saul was a scholar in both the Greek and Hebrew languages, and he was trained in both Greek culture and in Hebrew religion. Furthermore, he was a Roman citizen. With him we see the three main elements of Western culture: Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics. He was taught according to the Hebrew religion, he was trained in Greek culture, and he was a citizen of the Roman Empire. His parents or grandparents may have become Roman citizens, and Saul himself was born a Roman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75666" data-verses="Acts 22:25-28">22:25-28</span>). Therefore, Saul had a threefold qualification—in Greek culture, Hebrew religion, and Roman politics. <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh68tyV-QR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> The Lord is sovereign and all-knowing. Stephen seemed to be better educated than Peter and John, who were unlearned Galilean fishermen. But Stephen was not as qualified in the three elements of Western culture as Saul was. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75667" data-verses="Philippians 3:5">Philippians 3:5</span> he describes himself as “a Hebrew of Hebrews,” for he was born a Hebrew and was well educated in the Hebrew religion. No one else was as qualified as he to bear the commission to bring God’s New Testament economy to the Gentile world. </p>

Satan must have known that Saul was an important person. Satan not only gained Saul; he also instigated him to take a leading part in persecuting the followers of Jesus. When the persecutors were stoning Stephen, Saul took care of their garments. After the death of Stephen, “Saul was devastating the church, entering house after house; and dragging off both men and women, he delivered them to prison” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75668" data-verses="Acts 8:3">8:3</span>). It is significant that Luke purposely uses the word “devastating” to indicate that Saul wanted to destroy, to demolish, the entire church and all the followers of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="YJs94s2aJDs7VNvpQjGWquHDyQTQT1-VL5FhVS1mIG-dzYnTnvCO7bnb1cG2qXU2E"> Saul was not satisfied with persecuting the believers in Jerusalem. He went to the high priest and “asked for letters from him to Damascus, for the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75669" data-verses="Acts 9:2">9:2</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75670" data-verses="Acts 9:14">9:14</span>, Saul had authority to bind all those who called on the name of the Lord Jesus. Saul wanted to go to Damascus because a number of the scattered saints were there. He intended to go there to arrest all those who called on the Lord’s name. </p>

The way of truth is the path of the Christian life according to the truth, which is the reality of the contents of the New Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75676" data-verses="1Timothy 2:4">1 Tim. 2:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75677" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">3:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75678" data-verses="1Timothy 4:3">4:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75679" data-verses="2Timothy 2:15">2 Tim. 2:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75680" data-verses="2Timothy 2:18">18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75681" data-verses="Titus 1:1">Titus 1:1</span>).

It was slandered as the way of heresy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75693" data-verses="Acts 24:14">Acts 24:14</span>). </p>

He may have been excited and perhaps even was in an ecstasy. Saul may have said to himself, “I have obtained authority from the high priests to bind all those who call on the name of Jesus. I am going to Damascus to arrest all those who call on this name, bring them to Jerusalem, and put them in jail.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc_cmptYQwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58">A Heavenly Light and a Heavenly Voice</h2><p data-content-id="NaxbvirwEM9IrWiLz1EgL0QpTMeYfdNPKigSWcaRtEc-jMmKUrEXcfIwob1MBGo1q"> The Lord Jesus was watching over Saul as he was journeying toward Damascus. Instead of appearing to Saul immediately, the Lord waited until “he drew near to Damascus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75694" data-verses="Acts 9:3">9:3</span>). Then “suddenly a light from heaven shone around him; and he fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75695" data-verses="Acts 9:3-4">9:3b-4</span>). Saul must have been shocked by the light from heaven and by the voice that called him by name. Saul thought that he was <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> persecuting merely the followers of Jesus. Now a voice came from the heavens and told him that he was persecuting this One who is in the heavens. To Saul’s great surprise, he experienced a heavenly light, a heavenly voice, and a heavenly One. Spontaneously Saul said, “Who are You, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75696" data-verses="Acts 9:5">v. 5</span>). Saul called Him Lord, even without knowing Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="tGyva9892obRbw9l5JvIXS_OIjFQhBT0AQQVTHyEChz0auSMkGYTRa1jagwpmuJyF"> Saul may have said to himself, “I have never persecuted Jesus. Rather, I persecuted Stephen and other followers of Jesus. I thought that Jesus was in the tomb, but now He comes to me from the heavens.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB4sCqm3GKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar">A Corporate “Me”</h2><p data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqPzjb_D0dJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75697" data-verses="Acts 9:4">9:4</span>, the Lord Jesus asked Saul, “Why are you persecuting Me?” This is a corporate Me comprising Jesus the Lord and all His believers. Saul did not have this revelation, thinking that he was persecuting Stephen and other Jesus-followers who were in the Way, which he considered heresy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75698" data-verses="Acts 24:14">24:14</span>). He did not know that when he persecuted these he persecuted Jesus, for they were one with Him by being united to Him through their faith in Him. He considered that he was persecuting people on earth, never thinking that he touched anyone in heaven. To his great surprise, a voice from heaven told him that He was the One whom he was persecuting, and His name was Jesus. To him this was a unique revelation in the entire universe! By this he began to see that the Lord Jesus and His believers are one great person—the wonderful “Me.” This must have impressed him and affected him for his future ministry concerning Christ and the church as the great mystery of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75699" data-verses="Ephesians 5:32">Eph. 5:32</span>), and laid a solid foundation for his unique ministry. </p>

Nevertheless, we can see that the Lord Jesus preached an adequate gospel to Saul. Saul indeed heard the gospel. Some may wonder how we can say this. They may point out <span class="pg" data-page-id="207" id="207">[207]</span> that the voice from heaven did not say anything about the crucifixion, the redeeming blood, or the resurrection. However, we need to realize that the name Jesus is an adequate gospel. Saul was a sinner, an opponent, but he must have known the significance of this name, since he knew both Hebrew and Greek. He must have realized that Jesus means Jehovah, the Savior. Is this not the gospel? Do we not hear the gospel when we hear of Jesus? Who is Jehovah, the Savior? Paul surely knew the meaning of the name of Jesus. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AY-SUR-EoOuNw4w4Yg6DPwL0E3N7TuSXEOTbw_G2bv_OjbWVvXlpJAskEmK1oKtQB">PRAYING FOR THREE DAYS</h2><p data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97mfifUx9q6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq"> As Saul drew near to Damascus, “suddenly a light from heaven shone around him; and he fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75723" data-verses="Acts 9:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). After he rose from the ground, he saw nothing, even though his eyes were opened (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75724" data-verses="Acts 9:8">v. 8</span>). For three days Saul was not able to see. The Lord not only took away his sight; He also dealt with Saul’s clever mind. We have seen that Saul was learned in Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics. He was trained in the three basic elements of Western culture. In taking away Saul’s sight, the Lord Jesus wanted Saul to think about Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5hVXZcuvsITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75725" data-verses="Acts 9:9">Acts 9:9</span> says that Saul “was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank.” What did he do during those three days? The answer to this question is found in the Lord’s word to Ananias recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75726" data-verses="Acts 9:11">verse 11</span>: “Rise up and go to the lane called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas a man from Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying.” Here we see that in those three days Saul was praying. He did not see anything, and he did not eat or drink anything. All he could do was pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyevJzvGpxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> I believe that as Saul prayed he tried to analyze Jesus, seeking to know who He is. Saul may have said to himself, “I know that Jesus was buried, yet He spoke to me from <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> heaven. How can this be? Jesus said that I was persecuting Him. How could He have been among those I persecuted?” For three days Paul must have prayed about matters such as these. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo-kypOsUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk">RECEIVING THE FULL MESSAGE OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZibucDJDnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> It is likely that as Saul was praying, vision after vision and revelation after revelation came to him concerning Christ and the church. His experience during those days may have been one of watching a heavenly television in which he saw many things concerning the Lord Jesus. As he saw these things, Saul may have said, “Jesus the Nazarene is Jehovah. He is my Savior. No wonder that His followers testified strongly that He was resurrected. He surely has been resurrected, for He appeared to me from the heavens.” Saul may have gone on to consider the Lord’s ascension, which implies His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. Saul may have come to realize that as the One who is now in the heavens, the Lord passed through the process of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2cZAJ39mCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> We need to be impressed with the fact that for three days Saul did not eat or drink. All he did was pray. While he was praying, the revelation concerning Christ was “televised” into his being. Saul beheld a wonderful view of the Lord on this heavenly television. No longer did Saul have any doubt concerning Christ’s resurrection. He also came to believe in His incarnation and death. Through the visions that he saw during those days, Saul received the full message of the gospel. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_f89yMHyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig">JESUS AND THE CORPORATE “ME”</h2><p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paRU6Yr994ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> Saul not only saw that Jesus is Jehovah, the Savior, who died and was resurrected; he also saw that the Lord Jesus is one with His followers. Perhaps Saul said to himself, “I did not persecute Jesus—I persecuted His followers. But He told me that I persecuted Him. This must mean that He is one with His followers.” In this way Saul came to see the Body. <span class="pg" data-page-id="213" id="213">[213]</span> He heard a message not only concerning Christ’s salvation, but also concerning the Body of Christ. When the Lord appeared to Saul, He asked him, “Why are you persecuting Me?” The Lord seemed to be saying, “Saul, this ‘Me’ includes Me personally and My Body corporately. Personally I am in the heavens, but corporately the Body is on earth. When you persecuted My followers, you persecuted My Body. To persecute My Body is to persecute Me.” Therefore, the “Me” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75727" data-verses="Acts 9:4">9:4</span> is corporate, comprising the Lord Jesus and all His believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSRh-cCQ89bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75728" data-verses="Acts 9:5">9:5</span>, Saul said, “Who are You, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.” The “Me” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75729" data-verses="Acts 9:4">verse 4</span> and the name “Jesus” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75730" data-verses="Acts 9:5">verse 5</span> are of great significance, and Paul must have considered much concerning Jesus and this corporate “Me.” During those three days he might have analyzed the two words Me and Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG5fU54NE8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> When Paul said, “Who are You, Lord?” he must have gotten saved and received the essential Spirit. Later, in the book of Romans, he said, “Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75731" data-verses="Romans 10:13">Rom. 10:13</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75732" data-verses="Acts 9:5">Acts 9:5</span> Saul called Jesus Lord even without knowing Him. No doubt, Saul was shocked by the Lord’s appearing and speaking. At that time the essential Spirit should have entered into his being. Then he was able to pray for three days without eating and drinking. Under the inspiration of the essential Spirit, his only interest was to pray in order to know the significance of what he had seen and heard. During those days, Paul received the full gospel concerning salvation and the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip4OjJVg98Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF"> Saul’s experience of the corporate Me, Christ and the Body, must have made a deep impression on him and affected his future ministry regarding Christ and the church. That experience laid the foundation for his ministry. Therefore, he was very strong in teaching the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75733" data-verses="Romans 12:4-5">Rom. 12:4-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75734" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12-27">1 Cor. 12:12-27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75735" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Eph. 1:22-23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75736" data-verses="Ephesians 2:16">2:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75737" data-verses="Ephesians 4:4">4:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75738" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">16</span>). He is the only writer in the New Testament to use the term “the Body of Christ.” He placed great emphasis on the Body because at the time of his conversion he heard a message <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> concerning the corporate Me, a message concerning the Body of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tHwtIhgC-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf">CONFIRMED BY<br/>A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BODY</h2><p data-content-id="ayDvwYGbF8kWY5F_6G1vUQzv6UiHZVamrMqmbhtFN96IRxElNLGJfnroptl9R0_TX"> Immediately after Saul was saved, the Lord began to educate him concerning the Body. This was the reason He said to Saul, “Rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75739" data-verses="Acts 9:6">9:6</span>). Here the Lord seemed to be saying, “Saul, I shall not tell you what you need to do. You have been saved directly by Me, and no other person knows that you have been saved. Therefore, you need a representative of My Body to come to you and confirm the fact that I have saved you, chosen you, and called you. You also need such a representative of the Body to bring you into the identification with My Body.” As we shall see, when Saul came to Jerusalem and tried to join the disciples, “all feared him, not believing that he was a disciple” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75740" data-verses="Acts 9:26">v. 26</span>). Such a situation made it necessary for his salvation to be confirmed by a representative of the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IVwVto92cFq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> When the Lord told Ananias to seek Saul, Ananias replied, “Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75741" data-verses="Acts 9:13">v. 13</span>). Here we see that Ananias did not want to have anything to do with Saul. Then the Lord went on to say to Ananias, “Go, for this man is a chosen vessel to Me, to bear My name before both the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; for I will show him how much he must suffer on behalf of My name” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75742" data-verses="Acts 9:15-16">vv. 15-16</span>). Then Ananias went to contact Saul. In his contact with Saul, Ananias recognized him as a brother in the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75743" data-verses="Acts 9:17">v. 17</span>). If the Lord had not told Ananias to seek out Saul, none of the believers would have recognized Saul as a brother. Through Ananias the Lord gave Saul excellent instruction concerning the practice of the Body life. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZib-cEbDnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i">IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMING THIS ONE</h2><p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2cZQJxv2Cwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> Probably no one has ever turned to the Lord Jesus more quickly than Saul of Tarsus did. After Saul was baptized, “he was with the disciples in Damascus for some days” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75760" data-verses="Acts 9:19">9:19</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75761" data-verses="Acts 9:20">Verse 20</span> says, “And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that this One is the Son of God.” Here the word “immediately” is significant. It indicates that in a very short period of time his turn to the Lord was absolutely completed. Saul was a persecutor, but he turned to the Lord and became a vessel to contain Christ and minister Him to others. I believe that Luke inserted the word “immediately” with the purpose of showing that Saul’s turn took place very quickly. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_f8tyFUSB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75762" data-verses="Acts 9:1">chapter nine</span> Luke also gives us a short and simple record concerning Paul’s preaching. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75763" data-verses="Acts 9:20">verse 20</span>, Saul “proclaimed Jesus, that this One is the Son of God.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75764" data-verses="Acts 9:22">verse 22</span> Luke goes on to say that “Saul was all the more empowered and confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus, proving that this One is the Christ.” In these verses Luke twice uses the phrase “this One.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75765" data-verses="Acts 9:20">verse 20</span> we see that this One is the Son of God, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75766" data-verses="Acts 9:22">verse 22</span>, that this One is the Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paRUqYjuN4ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> The phrase “this One” is meaningful and rich in its implications. If we study Saul’s experience on the road to Damascus, we shall be able to understand why he used the term “this One.” This is the One whom he persecuted, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="220" id="220">[220]</span> One whom the authorities in the Jewish religion opposed and condemned. This One is also the One in whom many believed and whom they followed. The reason Saul used the expression of “this One” as his emphasis was that his audience knew about Jesus and about what was taking place with Saul and the believers. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75767" data-verses="Acts 9:21">Acts 9:21</span> indicates this: “And all those hearing him were amazed and said, Is not this man the one who ravaged those who call upon this name in Jerusalem, and he had come here for this, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests?” Because the people knew about this, Saul could simply speak of “this One.” The fact that Saul used this expression indicates that his audience knew about whom he was speaking. Therefore, when Saul began to speak about Jesus, he spoke concerning this One. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75770" data-verses="John 5:1">John 5</span>, the Jews realized that to say that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God is to say that He is God. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75771" data-verses="John 5:18">John 5:18</span> says, “For this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.” This indicates that for the Lord to be the Son of God means that He is God. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB4siql2mKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> The expression “the Son of God” refers to the Person of the Lord Jesus.

<p data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqPzDb8CUdJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5"> In the synagogues in Damascus Saul proclaimed Jesus as the Son of God. His audience was made up of those who were knowledgeable concerning Jesus. They knew that Jesus was the Nazarene who was opposed by the authorities in the Jewish religion. Now Saul declared that this One is the Son of God. He seemed to be saying, “This One whom you regard merely as a man is the Son of God. Yes, He came out of a human source, and He is the Son of Man. Nevertheless, this One is the Son of God.” Concerning this, Saul gave a strong testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlu7b1IIzOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX"> The Jews were not happy to hear Saul proclaim that Jesus is the Son of God. On the contrary, they could not tolerate hearing that Jesus has the unique divine source and that He is the Son of God. Therefore, they opposed Saul’s preaching. They regarded it as blasphemy to declare that a man is the Son of God. Because they regarded this as blasphemy, they opposed Saul and wanted to do away with him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75772" data-verses="Acts 9:24">9:24</span>). </p>

Christ means the anointed One. The Lord Jesus is God’s anointed One. As the anointed One of God, the Christ, He is the unique One. Only He has been anointed by God and appointed by Him to carry out His commission, to do work God assigned to Him. </p>

The revelation given to Peter includes the two aspects of the Lord Jesus, the aspects of His Person and His commission. Christ’s commission is to accomplish God’s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second coming. His Person embodies the Father and issues in the Spirit for a full expression of the Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> </p>

He saw the same thing Peter did in Caesarea Philippi; that is, he saw that Jesus the Nazarene is the Son of God and the Christ. </p>

He was truly a man, and His humanity was recognized by all. But the opposers did not see that Jesus is the Son of God. Therefore, immediately after Saul turned to the Lord, the first thing he testified concerning Him is that Jesus, the man from Nazareth, is the Son of God. As we have pointed out, this was blasphemy to the Jews, and they wanted to do away with Saul for proclaiming it. </p>
<p data-content-id="T-2PL0pYEh4xbDc2-hfnTMRuN30o1T5sQX2Xs2X0xJS4o-7h7OkAAU9bwEGWRJ0lt"> In addition to proclaiming that Jesus is the Son of God, Saul also testified that He is the Christ. He is unique, the only One anointed and appointed by God to carry out God’s commission. As the Christ, the Lord has been anointed and appointed to fulfill God’s purpose, to accomplish God’s plan. Only He is qualified to carry out God’s eternal redemption. As to His Person, He is divine. As to His work, He is the God-anointed and God-appointed One to carry out whatever God intends. </p>

No matter what portion of the Bible we may use in preaching the gospel and no matter what the subject of our preaching may be, we must always emphasize these two aspects of Christ. We need to preach both the Person of Christ and the work of Christ. However, much of today’s preaching does not place the proper emphasis on Christ’s Person and work. Instead, the gospel may be preached in a vague, general way. People may be told that Jesus is the Savior and the Redeemer, but there may not be <span class="pg" data-page-id="223" id="223">[223]</span> the needed emphasis on the two basic aspects of Christ. Our gospel preaching must be different. We need to emphasize the fact that the One we preach is divine. He is the Son of God, and His source is divine. We should also emphasize His work as the One anointed by God to carry out His commission. This means that we should preach the Son of God and the Christ. </p>

Judea was in the southern part of the Jewish land, Galilee was in the north, and Samaria was in between the south and the north. There were churches in all three of these provinces. Since at this time the church had spread only to the provinces of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, and the word “whole” covers all the places where the church existed, the “church” in singular is used in the universal sense. The church here is spoken of in the universal sense although there must have been a number of churches in the various cities of these three provinces, which may be called churches in the local sense. </p>

This verse speaks of “the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria.” I believe that the Spirit inspired Luke to write in this particular way in order to indicate that no matter how much Galilee was despised and Samaria was rejected by the Jews in Jerusalem, the churches raised up in those regions should all be considered one church. In the local sense, there were the churches, but in the universal sense, all these churches are the church.

However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75807" data-verses="Acts 9:32-43">9:32-43</span> we see that Peter is still in the scene, and these verses describe the spread of Peter’s ministry. His ministry has spread from Jerusalem to Lydda. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75808" data-verses="Acts 9:32">Acts 9:32</span> says, “Now it came about that as Peter was passing through all those parts, he came down also to the saints dwelling at Lydda.” Lydda was a town about eleven miles southeast of Joppa, called in the Old Testament, Lod (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75809" data-verses="1Chronicles 8:12">1 Chron. 8:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75810" data-verses="Ezra 2:33">Ezra 2:33</span>). While he was in Lydda, Peter healed a “certain man named Aeneas, who for eight years had been lying on a bed, for he was paralyzed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75811" data-verses="Acts 9:33">v. 33</span>). Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Rise up and make your own bed!” Immediately Aeneas rose up, and “all those dwelling in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75812" data-verses="Acts 9:34-35">vv. 34-35</span>). </p>

When the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, which was near to Joppa, “they sent two men to him, entreating him, Do not delay to come through to us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75815" data-verses="Acts 9:38">v. 38</span>). Peter came down to Joppa and healed Dorcas. It may be better to say that Dorcas was quickened. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-FgFtdM8ORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> Some may consider the quickening of Dorcas a case of resurrection. Dorcas may have been dead for a full day before Peter came to Joppa. Peter prayed and “turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, rise up! And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75816" data-verses="Acts 9:40">v. 40</span>). This may be considered an instance of resurrection. However, the term “resurrection,” a strong expression, is not used here. Therefore, instead of <span class="pg" data-page-id="230" id="230">[230]</span> speaking of the resurrection of Dorcas, I prefer to say that through Peter she was healed or quickened. </p>

When Peter was in Joppa, he was not far from Caesarea, which was a center for the Roman government. This means that Peter had moved away from Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish center, toward the city of Caesarea, the place where one of the Roman governors resided. Because Joppa was close to Caesarea, it became a stepping stone for Peter to open the door of the kingdom to the Gentiles. Peter’s stay in Joppa, therefore, was a preparation for him to go to the house of Cornelius and use the second key given him by the Lord to open the door so that the Gentiles may enter into the kingdom. As we shall see, in Caesarea Peter opened the door for typical Roman Gentiles to enter into the kingdom of God. </p>

In a vision the Lord appeared to Ananias: “Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75818" data-verses="Acts 9:10">9:10</span>). Before this, Saul of Tarsus had a vision of the Lord Himself. The Lord appeared to Saul and spoke to him. Following that, Saul had another vision, in which he saw Ananias laying his hands on him. The Lord told Ananias about this, saying that Saul “has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him, so that he may receive his sight” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75819" data-verses="Acts 9:12">9:12</span>). Therefore, with both Saul and Ananias there was a vision. Here we have the matter of visions related to the carrying out of the Lord’s work. </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWH8prv2Q5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> In the case of Cornelius the Lord also worked through visions. First, Cornelius “saw clearly in a vision about the <span class="pg" data-page-id="231" id="231">[231]</span> ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him and saying to him, Cornelius!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75820" data-verses="Acts 10:3">10:3</span>). On the next day, Peter saw a vision as he was praying on the housetop (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75821" data-verses="Acts 10:9-10">10:9-10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75822" data-verses="Acts 10:17">17</span>).

<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh6_9yX-QR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> We have pointed out that the cases of both Saul and Cornelius involve visions. A vision was given to Saul, and then to Ananias. Likewise, a vision was given to Cornelius, and then to Peter. In between these two cases, both of which involve visions, there are two miracles which took place through Peter. First we have the healing of Aeneas, and then the quickening of Dorcas. In our study of the book of Acts, we need to put together different cases such as these and then consider what is portrayed. We should not consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75823" data-verses="Acts 9:1">chapter nine</span> in isolation. Rather, we should study this chapter in relation to what precedes it and to what follows it. </p>

This indicated that Peter’s ministry in the propagation of the resurrected Christ was very successful in the Jewish land. This land included not only Judea but also Galilee and Samaria, a region in between Judea and Galilee. Through Peter’s ministry the territory called the holy land was filled with churches. </p>

As we shall see, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75857" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span> Peter used the second key to open the door of the kingdom of God to the Gentiles. </p>

It was composed of six hundred men. Cornelius, the Roman centurion, like the Ethiopian eunuch, was seeking God, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75859" data-verses="Acts 17:27">17:27</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="9B3GelIP98ERinHYova7LW0V_Tl3VD5C0GrAN_47CuFPIXBZ0UnuKxTnHsaPni2Fg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75860" data-verses="Acts 10:1">10:1</span> we see that the Lord now took a further step in His evangelical work. By this He reached another total Gentile, a man of Italy of the Roman Empire in Europe. Thus the door of the gospel was opened to all the Gentiles. It was a difficult thing for the Jewish apostles and disciples with their Jewish background and habit to approach the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75861" data-verses="Acts 10:28">v. 28</span>). Hence, it was an extraordinary move, needing an angel of God to take part in it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75862" data-verses="Acts 10:3">v. 3</span>), just as an angel did in the case of Philip approaching the Ethiopian from Africa in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75863" data-verses="Acts 8:26">8:26</span>.

<p data-content-id="jHPCvHM6AJL14sHMuOHv4qpZKdllursp8MnQXFHjxCUMf5qoYcCmTHDm7GFZatUid"> The Lord is sovereign over the entire situation of the world. What happened in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75866" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span> was surely according to the Lord’s sovereignty. In Caesarea, an important city for the Roman government, there was a certain centurion named Cornelius. Cornelius was not only a good man and a moral man, but was also a devout man, one seeking after God. From the beginning of mankind, there have always been devout men who sought God. Cornelius was in this category. He and all those of his household feared God and were devout. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75867" data-verses="Acts 10:7">Acts 10:7</span> even speaks of a devout soldier. This indicates that in Cornelius’ household there was a <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> devout atmosphere. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75868" data-verses="Acts 10:1">Acts 10</span> we see the kind of person used by God to open the way for the kingdom of God to the Gentile world. </p>

And looking intently at him and becoming terrified, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have ascended for a memorial before God.” Cornelius was one of fallen mankind, sinful and condemned before God as all others, yet God accepted his prayers and his alms, whereas Cain’s He rejected (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75870" data-verses="Genesis 4:3">Gen. 4:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75871" data-verses="Genesis 4:5">5</span>). This must have been due to the fact that God, based upon Christ’s eternal redemption and in view of his believing in Christ in the ensuing days, forgave him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75872" data-verses="Acts 10:43">v. 43</span>) according to His foreknowledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="63PjdVBPG51GyPm3VW2qIfmT1y1Uj-ESJwos787hQjcxafhitczkEPKKkKzBqHe70"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75873" data-verses="Acts 10:3">10:3</span>, an angel of God appeared to Cornelius and spoke to him. An angel was also used by God in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch. In that case “an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75874" data-verses="Acts 8:26">8:26</span>). The angels in these two cases indicate that these cases are extraordinary. The preaching of the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch was the bringing of the gospel to a Gentile. Likewise, the preaching of the gospel to the house of Cornelius was the preaching of the gospel to a Gentile family. Since this was an extraordinary case, an angel was involved. However, neither in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch nor in the case of Cornelius and his household was the angel commissioned to preach the gospel. The reason for this is that only human beings who are believers in the Lord Jesus have the privilege of bringing the good news to others. </p>

Man’s prayer is needed as a means of cooperation with God’s move. </p>
<p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4Dwnh_zFMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75881" data-verses="Acts 10:1">chapter ten</span> of Acts there is a strong emphasis on the importance of prayer. First we have Cornelius’ prayer and then Peter’s prayer. The prayers of these two men became the means for the Lord to come in to open the door for the Gentiles. While Cornelius, a devout man, was praying, a vision came to him. Likewise, it was while Peter was praying that the vision recorded in this chapter came to him. From this we see that we all need to learn to have a prayer life, for a prayer life always prepares the way for the Lord’s move and opens the gate for Him to spread. As those who are here for the Lord’s recovery, we must learn that the Lord can use only those who have a prayer life, a life of contacting Him in prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="LilxD0znUWS-9v8397X0WBvuzl4KnJ-MfefbTNnzPPig5LWJWb9boygxWo-Q9W1s_"> We are not told for what Cornelius and Peter were praying. The record does indicate, however, that they set aside certain times for prayer, that they prayed according to a schedule. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75882" data-verses="Acts 10:3">Acts 10:3</span> says that Cornelius was praying at the ninth hour, at three o’clock in the afternoon, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75883" data-verses="Acts 10:9">10:9</span> says that Peter was praying at the sixth hour, at twelve o’clock noon. From this we see that they had a prayer life and even prayed at scheduled times. If we in the Lord’s recovery have such a prayer life according to set times, we shall be used by Him in opening the way for the spread of His recovery. </p>

God fills this hunger (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75886" data-verses="Luke 1:53">Luke 1:53</span>).

Then he goes on to say that in every nation those who fear God and work righteousness are acceptable to Him. Those who fear God and work righteousness in every nation are still a part of fallen mankind. God accepts them in view of the redemption of Christ.

However, <span class="pg" data-page-id="246" id="246">[246]</span> strictly speaking the word “all” here denotes only persons, not things. This “all” refers to men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75933" data-verses="1Timothy 2:4">1 Tim. 2:4</span>), not only Jews but also Gentiles.

Cornelius was a devout man, but he still needed the forgiveness of sins. Although he was devout, he could not say that he had not sinned. Hence, he was devout yet still sinful.

No doubt, the Spirit here is the all-inclusive Spirit. After the all-inclusive Spirit fell upon <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> the house of Cornelius, they began to speak in tongues and magnify God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75952" data-verses="Acts 10:46">v. 46</span>). Here to magnify God is to praise Him. When Peter and those with him saw what happened, they knew that those in the house of Cornelius should not be prohibited from being baptized in water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75953" data-verses="Acts 10:47">v. 47</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="GKyQWo5hWTLmBf9JfiyBV4W1c46e937yRP_pDDoKx7RxQqXYuUV78sCkWbNBL0DfD"> The Holy Spirit fell upon those who heard the word in the house of Cornelius outwardly and economically. In the case of the house of Cornelius, the Holy Spirit’s entering into the believers essentially for life and falling upon them economically for power took place simultaneously when they believed in the Lord. However, only His falling upon them economically is noted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75954" data-verses="Acts 10:44">verse 44</span>, because it was outward and could be realized by others by their speaking in tongues and praising God, whereas His entering into them took place silently and invisibly. They received both aspects of the Holy Spirit directly from Christ the Head of the Body, without any mediatorial channel, before they were baptized in water by other members of the Body of Christ. This indicates emphatically that the spreading of the gospel of the kingdom of God to the Gentiles was of the Lord, and that the Head of the Body baptized the Gentile believers into His Body directly, without the laying on of hands of any member of His Body, as in the cases of the Samaritan believers and Saul of Tarsus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="75955" data-verses="Acts 8:17">8:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="75956" data-verses="Acts 9:17">9:17</span>). </p>

We shall see that in God’s economy certain things, in particular the baptism in the Holy Spirit, have been accomplished once for all. </p>

In addition to these four matters, we have the breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76004" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>) and the pouring out of the Spirit upon them. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="1jNZ3Y6RNXScv8-BjiBPPj0FaFzfAIRX4Bba-Y8mPL_tBBhV44go-Yxey-xe-DJIo">The Lamb Slain<br/>from the Foundation of the World</h2><p data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDo9cdi0sw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx"> The incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, the breathing of the Spirit into the disciples, the ascension, and the outpouring of the Spirit upon the disciples are all eternal. They are not temporal matters; that is, they are not limited by the element of time. Consider the crucifixion, for instance. According to our understanding, Christ was crucified nineteen hundred years ago. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76005" data-verses="Revelation 13:8">Revelation 13:8</span> speaks of “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” This indicates that in the sight of God Christ was slain from <span class="pg" data-page-id="254" id="254">[254]</span> the foundation of the world, from the time the created world came into being. Christ was crucified from the beginning of the existence of the material world because His redemption must cover the whole of the created universe. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76006" data-verses="Hebrews 9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span> indicates that Christ has accomplished an eternal redemption. His redemption is not temporal; it is eternal. </p>
<p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4Cynh_xFMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> Suppose we use a circle to signify eternity, and then at a certain place on the circle we place a cross signifying the crucifixion of Christ. Where in relation to the cross on the circle would you put Old Testament saints such as Abraham and Moses, and where would you put all the believers in Christ throughout the centuries? It would be difficult to say, according to such a diagram, who is before the cross and who is after. The point we are making here is that the crucifixion is eternal and covers the entire span of need that began from the existence of the universe, from the foundation of the world. Ever since created things came into being there has been the need of the death of Christ. Therefore, in the sight of God, Christ’s death began from the foundation of the world. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76007" data-verses="Revelation 13:8">Revelation 13:8</span> says that the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="LilxD0znUWS-9v8385X0VBPuzl4KnJ-MfefbTNnzPPig5LWJWb9boygxWo-Q9W1s_"> Concerning the Lamb being slain from the foundation of the world, we need to be very careful and accurate in our reading of the Scriptures. Although Christ was slain <em>from</em> the foundation of the world, He was foreknown by God <em>before</em> the foundation of the world. Regarding this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76008" data-verses="1Peter 1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span> says that Christ “was foreknown before the foundation of the world.” Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be the redeeming Lamb for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world. This means that Christ was foreknown and prepared in eternity. But His death was accomplished from the foundation of the world; that is, it was accomplished in time. Although it was accomplished in time, Christ’s redemption is eternal. Because what Christ accomplished through His death is eternal, it is called in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76009" data-verses="Hebrews 9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span> an eternal redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="mlcLhH-3w5KZuNDv8ztvCeSzmtunqHXxKV7NNVCdEbwgO3dnwE5vpipW8E4hgdOFK"> Before the crucifixion there was the incarnation, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="255" id="255">[255]</span> after the crucifixion there were the resurrection, the breathing of the Spirit into the disciples, the ascension, and the outpouring of the Spirit. All these things were accomplished in time, but without the element of time. Therefore, these things are eternal. (See the two inserted diagrams.) </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuGjIAnEo5IafG53tAVe3-ypiGKgO2xOWEc6_4BynTJX3LLZmIC9oRziJLF_biW7b"> Because the crucifixion of Christ is eternal, Paul could say, “I have been crucified with Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76010" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). With Paul, we can declare that we also have been crucified with Christ. This means that we were crucified with Christ long before we were born. When were we crucified with Christ? We were crucified with Him from the foundation of the world. Therefore, we were crucified before we were born. </p>
<p data-content-id="AY-SUR-EoOuNw4w4ZhKDJj70E3N7TuSXEOTbw_G2bv_OjbWVvXlpJAskEmK1oKtQB"> Since Christ was crucified from the foundation of the world, there is no need for a repentant sinner to ask the Lord Jesus to die for him. If this were necessary, then the Lord would need to die again and again. However, He was crucified once for all; He died once for all. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97mejvU4uq6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq">The Breathing of the Holy Spirit<br/>and the Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5gUnZU9_sITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb"> The principle is the same with Christ’s incarnation, resurrection, ascension, breathing of the Spirit into His disciples, and the pouring out of the Spirit upon His disciples. It is not the case that whenever someone believes in the Lord Jesus, it is necessary for Him to breathe the Spirit into that one, or pour out the Spirit upon him. On the contrary, the breathing of the Spirit into the believers has been accomplished once for all in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76011" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>. In the same principle, Christ, the Head of the Body, has baptized all His believers, every member of the Body, into the Spirit once for all in two steps. The first step was on the day of Pentecost, when the Jewish believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit. The second step was in the house of Cornelius, when the Gentile believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvHB6w5W8_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP"> Suppose we are about to baptize a new convert.

Therefore, we should not say to <span class="pg" data-page-id="256" id="256">[256]</span> </p>

After a while, the economical Spirit will fall upon you.” We should not understand the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit in this way. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGhBM6vIXUZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L">Accomplishment and Application</h2><p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyeuIDvFpRqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> Let us use the making and eating of a sandwich to illustrate how the incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, the breathing of the essential Spirit, the ascension, and the pouring out of the economical Spirit apply to us today. In preparing a sandwich we may take two slices of bread. We then may apply mayonnaise to the bread and put on turkey, cheese, tomato, and lettuce. In the preparation of such a sandwich we go step by step. But in the eating of the sandwich, we do not take first the bread, then the turkey, and then the other elements of the sandwich. Instead, we take all the ingredients of the sandwich at once. In like manner, the six matters of Christ’s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, breathing of the Spirit, ascension, and outpouring of the Spirit are applied to us at the same time. They were accomplished step by step, but they are applied to us simultaneously. Using the illustration of the sandwich, we may say that the incarnation is the bread, that the crucifixion is the turkey, and the resurrection, the breathing of the Spirit, the ascension, and the pouring out of the Spirit are yet other ingredients. When we come to eat this all-inclusive “sandwich,” we do not first “eat” the “bread” of the incarnation and then the “turkey” of the crucifixion. Rather, we take the whole sandwich at one time. We do not consider which item comes first and which comes last. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo_lCpNs0l_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> We have given many messages in the effort to point out what the Triune God has accomplished. The Triune God in the Son became flesh. That was the incarnation. The incarnation has been accomplished once for all, and there is no need for it to be repeated. Likewise, Christ was crucified and died once for all. Furthermore, He was resurrected, He breathed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into His disciples, He ascended, and He poured out Himself as the all-inclusive <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> Spirit once for all. Christ has accomplished all these things, and He has accomplished them once for all. Now all these matters are included in the Lord’s name. Therefore, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive all these things. </p>

We should not ask ourselves, “Have I received the essential Spirit? Has the economical Spirit fallen upon me? Perhaps I have the essential Spirit within me, but I wonder if I have the economical Spirit. Maybe the economical Spirit will leave me, although the essential Spirit will not leave. If the economical Spirit leaves, when will He come back?” It is not a healthy practice to analyze these matters in this way. </p>

<p data-content-id="YJs94s2aJDs7VNvpRi2WqvHDyQTQT1-VL5FhVS1mIG-dzYnTnvCO7bnb1cG2qXU2E"> The book of Acts is very dispensational. The word “dispensational” is, of course, the adjective form of the noun “dispensation.” The reason the book of Acts is dispensational <span class="pg" data-page-id="269" id="269">[269]</span> is that it describes a great transfer that is accomplished during a period of transition. This is the transfer from the Old Testament economy to the New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1PQJs12L0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg"> “Economy” is an anglicized form of the Greek word <em>oikonomia,</em> which means dispensation. Hence, economy and dispensation are synonyms, with dispensation being the English equivalent of the Greek word <em>oikonomia.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2TU_f53tqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> In the New Testament the word <em>oikonomia</em> denotes an arrangement. God has an arrangement, a household government, a family administration. God’s household government, or family arrangement, is what we call His economy. The transfer in the book of Acts is from God’s Old Testament arrangement to His New Testament arrangement. </p>

In other words, the Old Testament arrangement of God was not in reality. Rather, it was a shadow waiting for its fulfillment. </p>
<p data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZtQlHmpsxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45"> When the Triune God became a man in the incarnation, the transfer from shadow to reality began. Everything in God’s old dispensation, or arrangement, was a shadow. But in God’s New Testament arrangement we have reality. The transfer from the shadow to the reality began with God’s incarnation, that is, with the conception of Jesus, and was completed on the day of Pentecost with the outpouring of the economical Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc-dWpuawwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58">Problems concerning the Experience<br/>of the Transfer</h2><p data-content-id="NaxbvirwEM9IrWiLy00gL1QpTMeYfdNPKigSWcaRtEc-jMmKUrEXcfIwob1MBGo1q"> Since this dispensational transfer was fully accomplished with the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, all the shadows should have been over. But those whom God chose and used had been raised in the Old Testament dispensation, and they had been saturated with and even constituted of God’s Old Testament arrangement. As a result, it was very difficult for them to forsake those things in an absolute way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="270" id="270">[270]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="tGyva9892obRbw9l4IfIXT_OIjFQhBT0AQQVTHyEChz0auSMkGYTRa1jagwpmuJyF"> Let us take the case of Peter as an illustration. Peter was chosen by the Lord and used by Him to carry out His New Testament economy after He Himself had accomplished the transfer. Peter, however, was saturated with and constituted of the things of the old dispensation. For this reason, when Peter saw the vision of the great sheet in which were four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds, and when a voice told him to rise up, slay, and eat, Peter said, “By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76056" data-verses="Acts 10:14">10:14</span>). Knowing what the situation would be the Lord had sent an angel to Cornelius with a word concerning Peter. Furthermore, “while Peter was pondering concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are seeking you. But rise up and go down and go with them, doubting nothing, because I have sent them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76057" data-verses="Acts 10:19-20">10:19-20</span>). Peter loved the Lord, and eventually he went to the house of Cornelius. But this was a very difficult thing for Peter to do. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB5tyqm2GKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> According to the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76058" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span>, Peter later had further problems concerning the dispensational transfer. Paul tells us that before certain ones came from James, Peter “ate with those of the nations; but when they came, he shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76059" data-verses="Galatians 2:12-13">Gal. 2:12-13a</span>). Here we see that even after the situation recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76060" data-verses="Acts 10:1">chapters ten and eleven</span> of Acts, Peter still practiced hypocrisy in not daring to eat with Gentile believers openly in the presence of the brothers who had come from James in Jerusalem. From this we see how difficult it was for Peter to fully experience the dispensational transfer. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqOyTb_C0dJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5">A Word Related to the Dispensational Transfer</h2><p data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlv6L1LLTOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX"> We have pointed out that Acts is a dispensational book. One verse related to the dispensational element in Acts is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76061" data-verses="Acts 1:8">1:8</span>, where the Lord tells the disciples, “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.” Before the Lord spoke these words, the disciples asked Him, <span class="pg" data-page-id="271" id="271">[271]</span> “Lord, are You at this time restoring the kingdom to Israel?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76062" data-verses="Acts 1:6">1:6</span>). The Lord replied, “It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in His own authority” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76063" data-verses="Acts 1:7">v. 7</span>). Then the Lord went on to say that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit had come upon them and they would be His witnesses unto the remotest part of the earth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76064" data-verses="Acts 1:8">1:8</span> the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He would use them as His witnesses not only among the Jews in Jerusalem and in all Judea but among those in Samaria, and even among all the Gentiles in the remotest part of the earth. Although the disciples heard this word, they did not realize what the Lord was saying. In this simple word the Lord Jesus was indicating that the disciples would need to break through the Old Testament dispensation. From the disciples’ experience we see that to hear is one thing, but to realize and experience what we hear is another. Peter, for example, heard the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76065" data-verses="Acts 1:8">1:8</span>, but he nevertheless had difficulty with the Lord’s fulfillment of this word. </p>

This condition continued even after Peter’s preaching to <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> Cornelius, an Italian.

<p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo_lipOtUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> Saul was saved by the Lord directly without any preaching channel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76091" data-verses="Acts 9:3-6">9:3-6</span>), and he was brought into identification with the Body of Christ through Ananias, a member of the Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76092" data-verses="Acts 9:10-19">9:10-19</span>). However, Saul was introduced to practical fellowship with the disciples in Jerusalem through Barnabas (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76093" data-verses="Acts 9:26-28">9:26-28</span>).

This grace is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76097" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>) to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply so that we may live in resurrection. Therefore, grace is the Triune God becoming life and everything to us.

And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.” The Greek word rendered “Christians” is <em>Christianos,</em> a word of Latin formation. The ending <em>ianos,</em> denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire. Those who worshipped the emperor, the Caesar—<em>Kaisar</em>—were called <em>Kaisarianos,</em> which means adherents of <em>Kaisar,</em> the people belonging to <em>Kaisar.</em> When people believed in Christ and became His <span class="pg" data-page-id="278" id="278">[278]</span> followers, this caused some in the Empire to consider Christ as a rival of the <em>Kaisar.</em> At Antioch they began to call the followers of Christ <em>Christianos</em> (Christians), adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach. That the disciples in Antioch were given such a nickname as a term of reproach indicates that they must have borne a strong testimony for the Lord, a testimony that made them distinct and peculiar in the eyes of the unbelievers. </p>

<p data-content-id="ayDvwYGbF8kWY5F_7GVveCTv6UiHZVamrMqmbhtFN96IRxElNLGJfnroptl9R0_TX"> Why is there the need for such a parenthetical section as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76160" data-verses="Acts 12:1-24">12:1-24</span> to be inserted here? All the writers of the New Testament were inspired by the Spirit to select the proper material for their composition so that their writing might reach the goal. Based upon this principle, we need to consider why Luke, the writer of the book of Acts, inserted the instance recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76161" data-verses="Acts 12:1-24">12:1-24</span> at this point. Surely the Holy Spirit within Luke must have had a goal in doing this. </p>
<p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IVxVNo2ksFq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76162" data-verses="Acts 11:1-18">11:1-18</span> Peter related to those in Jerusalem how the door was opened for the Gentiles to come into the kingdom of God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76163" data-verses="Acts 11:18">11:18</span>, those who heard these things were silent and glorified God. They could only say, “Then also to the Gentiles God has given repentance unto life.” In the remainder of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76164" data-verses="Acts 11:1">chapter eleven</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76165" data-verses="Acts 11:19-30">vv. 19-30</span>) Luke tells us about the spread of the gospel to Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch through the scattered disciples and about the communication between the church in Antioch and the churches in Judea. Barnabas was sent out from Jerusalem to visit the places where the Lord’s work was spreading. When he came to Antioch, he realized that there was the need for ministry. <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span> Therefore, he brought Saul to Antioch to help in meeting the need there. It was through this that Saul was brought into the service in the church and was initiated into his ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1PRps10L0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg"> Saul’s preaching in Damascus was quite prevailing, and he even had disciples. But that was not the right time for him to be fully initiated into the New Testament ministry. We may say that Saul’s preaching in Damascus was something done on his own. </p>
<p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2TVff51tqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> Three brothers were especially related to Saul: Stephen, Ananias, and Barnabas. Through Stephen Saul heard the gospel for the first time. Through Ananias he was brought into the identification with the Body. Then through Barnabas Saul was brought into the fellowship in Jerusalem. Although he was brought into the fellowship at that time, he was not yet brought into the ministry. He was not at that time fully initiated into the New Testament economy. Sometime after Saul left Jerusalem for Tarsus, the time became right for Barnabas to find him and bring him to Antioch. Only when Saul was brought to Antioch by Barnabas was he brought into the service for the churches in an absolute way. We see this in the disciples in Antioch sending their material gift to the brothers in Judea through the hand of Barnabas and Saul. Here we see that Barnabas and Saul were assigned to bring the gifts from Antioch to help the saints in Judea. In this way Saul was brought into a service that was recognized by all the churches. Furthermore, after Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch from Jerusalem, Saul entered fully into the New Testament ministry. Therefore, Saul’s initiation into the service of the churches and fully into the New Testament ministry took place in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76166" data-verses="Acts 11:19">11:19 through 12:25</span>, with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76167" data-verses="Acts 12:1-24">12:1-24</span> being a parenthetical section related to Peter, not Saul, inserted in the record. </p>

Actually, this section has nothing to do with Peter’s ministry. Rather, it records a miracle through which Peter was rescued from prison. What is the reason for this insertion? What was Luke’s goal in recording it? </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc-c2ptbQwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58">To Strengthen the Positive Impression<br/>concerning Peter and His Ministry</h2><p data-content-id="NaxbvirwEM9IrWiLy1UgI1wpTMeYfdNPKigSWcaRtEc-jMmKUrEXcfIwob1MBGo1q"> Suppose the account concerning Peter and his ministry ended at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76172" data-verses="Acts 11:18">11:18</span>. What kind of impression would we have of Peter? Peter was not bold in relating what took place in the house of Cornelius. If Peter had been bold, he might have said, “Brothers, the Lord Jesus told us that we should be His witnesses to the remotest part of the earth. What, then, was wrong for me to go into the house of a Roman centurion in Caesarea?” But instead of being bold, Peter was very cautious. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76173" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span> confirms the fact that Peter had a problem concerning the association of Jewish and Gentile believers. In this matter he was not strong. Therefore, when he was asked concerning it, he was not bold to answer. </p>
<p data-content-id="tGyva9892obRbw9l4J_IUTfOIjFQhBT0AQQVTHyEChz0auSMkGYTRa1jagwpmuJyF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76174" data-verses="Acts 1:8">Acts 1:8</span> the Lord Jesus prophesied and commanded, saying, “You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.” Paul may have endeavored to fulfill this word when he intended to go to Spain. In his heart there may have been the thought that if he could go to Spain, he would reach the uttermost part of the earth. Paul’s intention was to fulfill the Lord’s commandment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76175" data-verses="Acts 1:8">Acts 1:8</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB5sSql1mKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> Peter should have remembered the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76176" data-verses="Acts 1:8">1:8</span> when he was speaking with those of the circumcision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76177" data-verses="Acts 11:1">Acts 11</span>. That word would have given him the ground to be bold in his speaking. However, Peter did not give a bold testimony. Rather, he spoke in a nice, cautious way, and even used six brothers to cover him. </p>
<p data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqOzzb8BUdJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5"> Without the insertion of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76178" data-verses="Acts 12:1-24">12:1-24</span>, we may not have a <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> favorable impression of Peter, especially of his ministry. We perhaps would have doubts concerning him. Therefore, as he was writing about the initiation of Paul’s ministry, Luke took up the burden to insert something in order to strengthen the positive impression he has given his readers regarding Peter. This, I believe, is the first reason for this insertion. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlv7r1LJTOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX">To Show the Two Sources of Persecution</h2><p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT5-C6X2q1fvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> A second reason for this insertion is to show that the persecution of the church and the apostles came not only from the source of Jewish religion but also from Roman politics. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76179" data-verses="Acts 12:1-2">Acts 12:1 and 2</span> say, “Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some from the church to mistreat them. And he did away with James, the brother of John, with the sword.” This was Herod, Agrippa I, whose successor was King Agrippa (II) in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76180" data-verses="Acts 25:13">25:13</span>. Both were different from Herod the tetrarch in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76181" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span>. Thus far the church suffered persecution only from the Jewish religion. Now Gentile politics began to participate in the persecution in cooperation with the Jewish religion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76182" data-verses="Acts 12:11">v. 11</span>). The Jewish religion joined with the Roman government to execute the Lord Jesus. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76183" data-verses="Acts 12:1">chapter twelve</span> of Acts Luke shows us that the persecution now comes from Roman politics as well as from the Jewish religion. Luke’s insertion of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76184" data-verses="Acts 12:1-24">12:1-24</span> indicates this. </p>
<p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDTJBtsXY1r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76185" data-verses="Acts 12:1">Acts 12</span>, Herod mistreated a number of the saints. In particular, he slew James, the brother of John. “And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also....And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him....Peter therefore was kept in the prison” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76186" data-verses="Acts 12:3-5">vv. 3-5</span>). When the Sanhedrin arrested Peter and the other apostles, they were put into the outer prison. Herod, however, put Peter into the inner prison where he was guarded by four squads of soldiers. Literally, the Greek word for “squads” means quaternions. A quaternion was a group of four soldiers. Luke’s intention is to show us that Roman politics joined the Jewish religion to persecute the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="291" id="291">[291]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="1jNZ3Y6RNXScv8-BjjRPExkFaFzfAIRX4Bba-Y8mPL_tBBhV44go-Yxey-xe-DJIo">To Present Peter as a Hero</h2><p data-content-id="9B3GelIP98ERinHYpsK7IXUV_Tl3VD5C0GrAN_47CuFPIXBZ0UnuKxTnHsaPni2Fg"> Furthermore, Luke’s narration in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76187" data-verses="Acts 12:1-24">12:1-24</span> makes Peter a hero. This Christian hero suffered persecution both from the Jewish religion and from Roman politics. This leaves us with a very positive impression concerning Peter. As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76188" data-verses="Acts 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, we receive the impression that Peter was a hero. </p>

As such a center, Antioch was strategic. Therefore, this city was chosen by the Lord for a new turn of His move on earth, the turn to the Gentile world. </p>

They sometimes speak with inspired prediction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76242" data-verses="Acts 11:27-28">11:27-28</span>). Teachers are those who teach the truths according to the apostles’ teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76243" data-verses="Acts 2:42">2:42</span>) and the prophets’ revelation. Both prophets and teachers are universal as well as local (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76244" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">Eph. 4:11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip5OTJVj98Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF"> When the flow started with the one hundred twenty in Jerusalem, only typical Jews were involved. But according to the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76245" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span>, the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were from a number of different sources. Barnabas was a Levite, a Cyprian by birth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76246" data-verses="Acts 4:36">4:36</span>). Niger, whose name means black and should denote a Negro, was probably of African origin. Lucius the Cyrenian was from Cyrene in North Africa. He may have been a Jew if he was the Lucius in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76247" data-verses="Romans 16:21">Romans 16:21</span>, who was Paul’s kinsman. Manaen was the foster brother of Herod and was governmentally related to the Romans. Hence, Manaen must have been Europeanized. The Herod in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76248" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span> was the one who killed John the Baptist <span class="pg" data-page-id="299" id="299">[299]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76249" data-verses="Luke 9:7-9">Luke 9:7-9</span>). It was the Lord’s sovereign doing that the foster brother of John the Baptist’s murderer became one of the leading functioning members in the church. Finally, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76250" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span> mentions Saul, a Jew born in Tarsus and taught by Gamaliel according to the law of Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76251" data-verses="Acts 22:3">22:3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tGwdIhjC-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf"> The five prophets and teachers recorded here were composed of Jewish and Gentile peoples with different backgrounds, education, and status. This indicates that the church is composed of all races and classes of people regardless of their background, and that the spiritual gifts and functions given to the members of the Body of Christ are not based upon their natural status. </p>
<p data-content-id="ayDvwYGbF8kWY5F_7GFvXRTv6UiHZVamrMqmbhtFN96IRxElNLGJfnroptl9R0_TX"> Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76252" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span> the Lord set up a pattern. From Antioch the Lord’s move turned to reach the Gentile world, and in the Gentile world there are many different kinds of people, people of different cultures, races, and status. Therefore, at the very beginning of this turn the pattern was established to indicate that the churches are composed of all races and classes of people. </p>
<p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IVxVdo-38Fq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> Among Christians today, boards and committees are appointed to raise funds to support certain activities. In addition, there is a great deal of organization. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76253" data-verses="Acts 13:1">Acts 13</span> the situation is very different. Here we do not see boards, committees, fund raising, or organization. </p>

We need to find out in what way these prophets and teachers were produced. There was neither seminary nor ordination. How, then, were Barnabas, Niger, Lucius, Manean, and Saul produced as prophets and teachers? </p>

These gifts are raised up by the Head and given by Him to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> Body. They are not produced in a human way by education, selection, or ordination. Rather, among the saints who love the Lord and seek Him, some are gradually manifested to be evangelists, prophets, or teachers. They are produced by their manifestation in their Christian life and living. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76256" data-verses="Acts 7:1">chapter seven</span> Stephen was manifested to be a great teacher, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76257" data-verses="Acts 8:1">chapter eight</span> Philip was manifested to be an evangelist. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76258" data-verses="Acts 9:1">chapter nine</span> Paul was manifested first as an evangelist and then as a teacher. However, when he was in the church in Antioch, he was not carrying out an evangelical work but was doing a teaching work. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76259" data-verses="Acts 11:26">Acts 11:26</span> says that he and Barnabas “were gathered in the church and taught a considerable number.” This indicates that both Barnabas and Saul were teachers. Perhaps the other three named in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76260" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span>—Niger, Lucius, and Manean—were prophets. Paul, of course, also had the gift of preaching, but in Antioch he functioned as a teacher. </p>
<p data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAblL-Moqjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC"> The five mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76261" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span> were not produced as gifts in a human way. On the contrary, they were produced by their gradual manifestation among the saints. Eventually, the saints recognized that these ones had certain gifts. Then by their gifts they became gifted persons. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsKksLLofGFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0">The Organic Way of the Body</h2><p data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKIUnzz2GZh9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG"> In the Lord’s recovery today we should follow the pattern in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76262" data-verses="Acts 13:1">Acts 13</span> not to have a human way of producing preachers. We do not take the way of human selection or organization. Instead, we look to the Lord that He would produce something out from His Body. The way we take is not organization—it is organic. If some brothers and sisters serve the Lord full time, this should be done not in the way of organization, but in the organic way of the Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1coUbw4bEEn3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp"> Recently, hundreds of saints in Taipei consecrated themselves to serve the Lord full time. We told these saints that we do not follow the way of organization. Our way in the Lord’s recovery is organic; it is the way of life. What matters is how the saints grow in the Lord and how the divine life develops within them to produce a certain ability for <span class="pg" data-page-id="301" id="301">[301]</span> functioning. This is the organic way based on the growth and development of the divine life within us. We all need to see this. </p>

To do that would be to fall back into the practice of traditional Christianity. Therefore, we should abandon that organizational way, the way of human control and methods of raising money. The Lord’s ministry is to be carried out apart from organization and human methods of finance. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-EjVtdP8ORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> Not long ago, I told the saints in Taipei who had given themselves to serve the Lord full time not to discuss the matter of finances or fund raising. In 1949 when the co-workers under the leadership of Brother Nee decided to send me away from mainland China, no funds were given to me, and I did not know where to go. Eventually, according to the Lord’s leading, I went to Taiwan, and I went there without any human means of support. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76267" data-verses="Acts 13:1-4">13:1-4a</span> we see that Barnabas and Paul were set apart and sent by the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76268" data-verses="Acts 13:4-12">Acts 13:4b-12</span> describes their journey to Paphos of Cyprus. </p>

And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Here we see that these prophets and teachers were not conferring with men and organizing; rather, they were ministering to the Lord and fasting. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB5syql3mKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> These five were ministering to the Lord directly. This means that, spiritually speaking, they were not at the altar in the outer court, but were at the incense altar in the Holy Place. In the Old Testament the priests ministered at two places. When they served the people, they ministered at the altar in the outer court, offering sacrifices to God for the people. But when they served the Lord directly, they were at another place—at the altar in the Holy Place burning <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> incense. These five brothers in Antioch were at the incense altar in the Holy Place ministering directly to the Lord through their prayers. </p>

<p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT5-CaX1qVfvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> However, many Christians think that the Spirit is separate from the Lord. Some even say that the Spirit is the agent or representative of the Lord. If the Spirit is merely the Lord’s representative, then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76270" data-verses="Acts 13:2">13:2</span> the Holy Spirit should not have said, “Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul.” Instead, the Spirit should have said, “I, the Spirit, am an agent of the Lord. I represent the Lord and work for Him. Therefore, I do not say that you should set apart Barnabas and Saul unto Me. I tell you to separate Barnabas and Saul unto the Lord, for whom I am working.” </p>

As they were ministering, the Lord as the Holy Spirit spoke to them. This corresponds to Paul’s word: “And the Lord is the Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76272" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). Hence, the Spirit could tell them to separate Barnabas and Saul “for Me.” This Me is both the Lord and the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we should not think that the Holy Spirit is separate from the Lord. No, the Holy Spirit is the Lord to whom we minister. When we minister, we minister to the Lord. But when the Lord responds to us, He responds as the Holy Spirit. Because He is the Lord, He could say as the Holy Spirit, “Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul.” </p>

This was a giant step taken by the Lord for the spread of the gospel of His kingdom to the Gentile world. It was begun from Antioch, a Gentile center in Syria, without organizing a mission, without raising funds, without human ordination, and without any human plan and method. It was initiated by five faithful and seeking members of the Body, who afforded an opportunity, through their ministering and fasting, to the Head of the Body that He, as the Spirit, might set them apart to carry out His great commission to spread His kingdom for the establishment of His church in the Gentile world through the preaching of His gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="T-2PL0pYEh4xbDc2_hPnQOxuN30o1T5sQX2Xs2X0xJS4o-7h7OkAAU9bwEGWRJ0lt"> This major step had nothing to do with the church in Jerusalem organizationally, and it was not under the authority and direction of Peter and the other eleven apostles in Jerusalem. It was begun solely and purely from a Gentile center, far away from the atmosphere and influence of any Judaic background and practice, and even from the practice and influence of the church in Jerusalem. It was absolutely a move by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit through the coordination of the faithful and seeking members of the Body on earth with the Head in the heavens. This was not a religious movement with a human schedule. From Antioch the Lord’s move on the earth for God’s New Testament economy had an entirely new start. Although the flow of the Lord’s move began from Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, and later came to Antioch and went on from Antioch to the Gentile world, it had a purified start by the Spirit at its turn in Antioch. </p>

But here it says that they were sent out by the Spirit. This proves that the three were one with the Spirit in the Lord’s move, and the Spirit honored their sending as His. </p>

The three who laid hands on Barnabas and Saul were not members of a mission board or religious organization who were assuring the sent ones of their financial support. That is the practice in many Christian groups today. Someone who is being sent out to the mission field may think that unless the members of the board lay hands on him, he will not be assured of their financial support. But if they lay hands on him, he will know that he will have the money he needs. Such a situation is common today. </p>

Rather, in the laying on of hands we should be one with the Triune God not to ordain the sent ones but to identify ourselves with them. Therefore, the laying on of hands signifies that our spirit, our prayers, and all that is within us go out with the sent ones. This is not ordination—it is identification. </p>

Rather, their purpose was to grasp the opportunity for preaching the gospel. As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76325" data-verses="Acts 13:5">13:5</span>, they did not go to attend the Jewish synagogue gathering, but to take advantage of the gathering to announce the word of God, just as the Lord Jesus did in His ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76326" data-verses="Matthew 4:23">Matt. 4:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76327" data-verses="Luke 4:16">Luke 4:16</span>). </p>

In going to the synagogue, Paul was following in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="314" id="314">[314]</span> steps of the Lord Jesus, who taught in the synagogue. If there was a synagogue in a particular city, Paul would go there, not because he was Judaic or intended to keep the Sabbath or learn the word of God. On the contrary, Paul went to the synagogue to take advantage of the opportunity to speak the word of God’s gospel. In every synagogue the holy Scriptures were taught, and there were a number of people, both Jews and Gentiles, who were seeking God. Therefore, it was wise of Paul to go to the synagogues. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOYKz1RRk0YVQ9GDcrAAsZkC2xIcaMrEmSNYGfSmuuL0gRLldZ5UBQtK-b9YuTg7p"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76329" data-verses="Acts 13:15">13:15</span> we see that in the synagogue at Antioch of Pisidia Paul was given the opportunity to speak: “And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent to them, saying, Men, brother, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.” Literally, the Greek words translated “if you have any word” mean “if there is in you any word.” When Paul rose up to speak, he addressed those in the synagogue, saying, “Men, Israelites, and those who fear God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76330" data-verses="Acts 13:16">v. 16</span>). Here the ones who fear God are Gentile seekers after God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8hEVLiYPHPDrLKUUBOhp90MIdV-olxt5lp8YViQRgoFO6adHYqE9Xo2xECC72P9rr"> Paul’s going to the synagogue also matches the basic principle that God’s gospel should go first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76331" data-verses="Romans 1:16">Rom. 1:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="01ti1r4uNODePuwq5FNe_xibcI0Asch_5CI1PAYjW-KfNYvtApOjUcBbYG5vhQyHY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76332" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> the Lord Jesus indicates that of both Jews and Gentiles are sheep that make up the unique flock. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76333" data-verses="John 10:16">John 10:16</span> He says, “I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.” Here the other sheep are the Gentile believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76334" data-verses="Acts 11:18">Acts 11:18</span>). The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76335" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14-16">Eph. 2:14-16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76336" data-verses="Ephesians 3:6">3:6</span>), brought forth by life, which is the Lord imparted into His members through His death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76337" data-verses="John 10:10-18">John 10:10-18</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76338" data-verses="John 10:16">John 10:16</span> the fold is Judaism, and the flock is the church. Outside the fold of Judaism, there were other sheep, the Gentile believers, who would be gathered together to be one flock with the Jewish believers. As we have pointed out, this one flock is the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAblr-PpKjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC"> Certain hymns have been written in which the church is regarded as the fold. This is a mistaken concept. The church <span class="pg" data-page-id="315" id="315">[315]</span> is not a fold that keeps the sheep. Rather, the church is a flock, that is, the totality of the sheep. The fold and the flock are two things, but the church and the flock are one thing. Judaism was a fold used by God to keep His sheep temporarily. A fold is used to keep sheep during the winter, bad weather, and the night. The Old Testament time was the nighttime. The Lord’s sheep were kept in this fold until the day dawned with the coming of the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76339" data-verses="Luke 1:78-79">Luke 1:78-79</span>). As the Shepherd, the Lord Jesus called the sheep out of the fold; that is, He called them out of the Jewish religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsKkMLIp_GFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> Christians today may regard denominations as churches. Actually, the denominations are folds that keep the believers, who are members of the church. Whereas every denomination is a fold, the church is the flock. </p>
<p data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKIUnTz1G5h9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG"> In the ancient times the synagogues in Judaism were folds, and many of God’s sheep were kept in these folds. When the Lord Jesus came, He called God’s chosen people out of the fold of Judaism. Paul followed Him to do the same thing. Whenever he came to a city, he would go to the fold, the synagogue, in that place, for he knew that a number of God’s sheep were held there. For this reason, when Paul preached in a synagogue, a number of the people believed. Among the believing ones were some Greeks. The ministry of the apostle Paul was not only to call out God’s chosen people from the Jewish religion, but also to gain Gentile believers. Then the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers were put together to form the church, the one flock. Today in the Lord’s recovery we are not building up a fold; rather, we are taking care of God’s flock. </p>

And when He had removed him, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will.” David was a man according to God’s heart, that is, according to the desire of God’s heart, not only according to God’s words.

We have seen that Paul went to the synagogue to speak the word of God to both the Jews and the Gentile seekers after God. Paul’s speaking is focused on Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76376" data-verses="Acts 13:27-35">13:27-35</span> he speaks in particular concerning Christ’s death and resurrection. We have seen that resurrection was a birth to the Lord Jesus. Although He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76377" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76378" data-verses="John 3:16">3:16</span>), after incarnation and through resurrection He was begotten of God in His humanity to be God’s firstborn Son. As the only begotten Son Christ is the embodiment of the divine life, but as the firstborn Son He is the propagation of this life. </p>

God promised to give Him to His people, and this resurrected One is the holy and faithful things of David. The phrase “the holy and faithful things of David” indicates that Christ was of David, for it was out of David’s seed that God raised up such a One. To God, the resurrected Christ is the firstborn Son, but to us He is the Savior. Moreover, He is a great gift given by God to His chosen people, and this gift is entitled “the holy and faithful things.” </p>

The same word <em>(hosios)</em> is used for “Holy One” in the next verse, but in the singular. But it is not the regular word for holy, which is <em>hagios. Hosios</em> is a Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word <em>chesed,</em> which is translated “mercies” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76382" data-verses="Isaiah 55:3">Isaiah 55:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76383" data-verses="2Chronicles 6:42">2 Chronicles 6:42</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76384" data-verses="Psalms 89:1">Psalm 89:1</span>, both in the Septuagint and in the King James Version.

This Holy One is Christ, the Son of David, in whom God’s mercies are centered and conveyed. Hence, the holy and faithful things of David refer to the resurrected Christ. This is fully proved by the context, especially by “Your Holy One” in the following verse (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76388" data-verses="Acts 13:35">Acts 13:35</span>), and by the verse following <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76389" data-verses="Isaiah 55:3">Isaiah 55:3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVceq2rqNMnLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd"> Paul’s thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76390" data-verses="Acts 13:33-34">13:33 and 34</span> is very deep. The resurrected Christ, who is God’s firstborn Son brought forth through His second birth, His resurrection, is the holy and faithful things. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76391" data-verses="Acts 13:34">verse 34</span> the word “faithful” means trustworthy. The resurrected Christ is the holy and trustworthy things God gives to us. Here Paul indicates that the resurrected Christ is not only our Savior bringing us God’s salvation, and He is not only the firstborn Son of God. This resurrected One is also the holy and faithful things as a gift given to us by God. </p>

Many of us have never been taught that the resurrected Christ is the holy and trustworthy things given to us by God. The holy and faithful things cover a wide span, a span much wider than that covered by the titles “Savior” and “firstborn Son.” The phrase “the holy and faithful things” is actually a divine title, a title of Christ. In these verses Christ is called the holy and trustworthy things. The Savior God raised up out of the seed of David has become the holy and trustworthy things. </p>

They are all the aspects of what Christ is. According to the New Testament, Christ is life, light, grace, righteousness, holiness, sanctification, and justification. He is also the bread of life and the living water. Furthermore, the holy and trustworthy things include all the aspects of Christ unveiled in 1 Corinthians: power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, glory, the depths of God, the unique foundation of God’s building, the Passover, the unleavened bread, the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, the spiritual rock, the Head, the Body, the firstfruit, the second Man, and the last Adam. We see many more aspects of Christ in the Gospel of John, such as the Shepherd and the pasture. Oh, how much Christ is to us as the holy and trustworthy things! As the resurrected One, He is the firstborn Son, the Savior, and all the holy and trustworthy things. </p>

Mercy implies both love and grace, but it reaches further than love. Where love and grace cannot reach, mercy can reach. All the holy and faithful things are Christ Himself as <span class="pg" data-page-id="324" id="324">[324]</span> mercies to us. Life is a mercy, and light is also a mercy.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76395" data-verses="John 10:1">chapter ten</span> of the Gospel of John we have the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd, all of which are mercies.

What a mercy that I can speak the word inexhaustibly. In the past I spent a few months every year in the Philippines ministering the word. An elderly sister, who was my hostess, was greatly surprised that I always had something new to say. She thought that after some years I would have nothing further to minister. One day after a conference meeting, she said, “I thought that by now you would be exhausted and have nothing to say. But your ministry is even fresher and richer now than before. Where do you get all these things to speak?” If I were asked this question today, I would say that my speaking the word is Christ as a mercy to me. This is not a matter of my ability or gift.

This is wholly due to Christ being a mercy to me in speaking the word of God. </p>

For example, I am not burdened to speak on such a matter as David being a man according to God’s heart. Rather, my burden in this Life-study is to cover all the crucial points regarding God’s New Testament economy. In other words, I am concerned with all the things in Acts that bear a dispensational significance. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvHD6wwGc_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP"> I do not use the word “dispensational” to refer to an age or to God’s way of dealing with people during a certain period of time. Rather, in these messages the word “dispensation” denotes the divine arrangement in God’s eternal economy. In the book of Acts there is much to see concerning this divine arrangement. Acts, therefore, is a book of God’s economy. Many Christians do not have this understanding of Acts. Acts is not merely concerned with acts. This is a book showing us God’s dispensation, God’s economy, God’s arrangement in His eternal economy. My burden in these Life-study Messages is to cover the matter of God’s economy in the book of Acts. </p>
<p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBKTN1d2mnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> As I come to a particular chapter in Acts, my goal is to see something concerning the divine arrangement of God’s economy in that chapter. This is my goal as we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76433" data-verses="Acts 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="332" id="332">[332]</span>. It may seem that in this chapter we cannot see anything concerning the divine arrangement in God’s economy. But if we study this chapter carefully, we shall be able to see some matters related to this divine arrangement. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQV4WcYwx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_">TO ICONIUM</h2><p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGTMTd2aozY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76434" data-verses="Acts 14:1">Acts 14:1</span> says, “Now it came about in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.” As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76435" data-verses="Acts 13:5">13:5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76436" data-verses="Acts 13:14">14</span>, they did not go to attend the Jewish synagogue gathering, but to take advantage of that gathering to announce the word of God’s grace. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76437" data-verses="Acts 14:2">Verse 2</span> continues, “But the Jews who disobeyed stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers.” Here the Greek word rendered “minds” literally means “souls.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-EgVteNcORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_">The Word of God’s Grace</h2><p data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3Ax8Esd83s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76438" data-verses="Acts 14:3">Acts 14:3</span> goes on to say, “Therefore they stayed a considerable time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be done through their hands.” As we have pointed out, the Lord’s grace is the Triune God received and enjoyed by the believers and expressed in their salvation, change in life, and holy living. </p>
<p data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjSmDEIt23Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h"> As the Lord testified to the word of His grace, He granted signs and wonders to be done through the hands of Paul and Barnabas. Wonders and signs are not part of God’s central testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ; neither are they part of His full salvation. Rather, signs and wonders are only evidences that what the apostles preached and ministered was absolutely of God, not of man. </p>
<p data-content-id="OxXT42mbN-_IwwC71KQB067lOD0YMzE-XjPYijEZ2-L3hEiePh0clDIYHsHVPlhJm"> The phrase “the word of His grace” denotes certain dispensational points. In the synagogues the Jewish people did not read the Old Testament in order to know the word of the Lord’s grace. Rather, they read the Scriptures in order to know the word of God’s law, a word belonging to the old dispensation, to the former divine arrangement of God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="333" id="333">[333]</span> economy. But the word of the Lord’s grace replaces the law. The minds of the Jewish people in the synagogues were occupied with the law. But Paul preached Christ as grace to them. They edified the new believers by testifying the word of life and the word of the Lord’s grace. The word “testified” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76439" data-verses="Acts 14:3">verse 3</span> implies that the word of grace already existed and that it had already been preached. Because the word of grace had been preached, testimony was borne to it. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKZuk99ujzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO">The Word of Grace in the Old Testament</h2><p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWG85rs1w5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> The apostles could testify of the word of the Lord’s grace even though they had only the Old Testament. Can we find the word of grace in the Old Testament? Instead of finding the word of grace, the Jewish people paid attention to the word of the law with all the commandments. What they had was the word of God’s law, not the word of the Lord’s grace. Nevertheless, the word of the Lord’s grace existed already in the Old Testament. This made it possible for the apostles to testify concerning it. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh7_tyV8QR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> Let us consider some examples of the word of the Lord’s grace found in the Old Testament. Consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76440" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>: “I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” Here we see that the seed of the woman will bruise the serpent’s head. Is this not a word of the Lord’s grace? Certainly it is. After Adam and Eve had eaten of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they tried to hide from God. The voice of the Lord sounded out to Adam and said, “Where art thou?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76441" data-verses="Genesis 3:9">Gen. 3:9</span>). Adam and Eve were frightened, perhaps thinking that God would sentence them to death. But instead of speaking a word of condemnation or judgment, the Lord spoke a word of grace. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76442" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> He condemned the serpent and gave Adam and Eve a word of grace. Adam and Eve must have been very happy when they heard the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76443" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>. They must have hated the serpent, and now the Lord was telling them that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent. This surely is a word of grace. <span class="pg" data-page-id="334" id="334">[334]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="GKyQWo5hWTLmBf9JfgiBW621c46e937yRP_pDDoKx7RxQqXYuUV78sCkWbNBL0DfD"> Another example of a word of grace found in the Old Testament is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76444" data-verses="Genesis 12:2-3">Genesis 12:2 and 3</span>, where God says to Abraham, “I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing...and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” This certainly is not a word of law; it is a word of grace. The Jews in the synagogues were spiritually blind and could not see the word of the Lord’s grace in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="clSZYpbJsMTyRlnc_Bwjg9WDUxpJYeKfy4Dt-eqWvnGgiKA6P3AKy7krljshseoz8"> Other examples of the word of the Lord’s grace are found in the book of Isaiah. Consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76445" data-verses="Isaiah 7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span>: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” This is a word of grace. Another word of grace is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76446" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>: “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” This also is an example of the many words of the Lord’s grace in the Old Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="YJs94s2aJDs7VNvpRgGWpunDyQTQT1-VL5FhVS1mIG-dzYnTnvCO7bnb1cG2qXU2E">The Preaching of Peter and Paul</h2><p data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1PS5s20r0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76447" data-verses="Acts 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> of Acts Paul applied the “holy and faithful things of David” to the resurrected Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76448" data-verses="Acts 13:33-35">vv. 33-35</span>). Paul understood these as referring to Christ in resurrection. Who other than Paul would be able to understand that the holy and faithful things of David refer to the resurrected Christ? To be sure, Paul was the best “miner,” the one most able to dig into the depths of the Old Testament in order to find the riches of the word of the Lord’s grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2TWPf61NqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76449" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> Peter gave an excellent message concerning the resurrected Christ. When you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76450" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapter two</span> of Acts, you may be quite impressed with Peter’s message. But have you previously had an adequate appreciation of Paul’s preaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76451" data-verses="Acts 13:1">Acts 13</span>? Many readers of Acts do not appreciate this message properly because they have not seen what is revealed in it concerning Christ in resurrection. Yes, Peter’s preaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76452" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapter two</span> is excellent but it is somewhat <span class="pg" data-page-id="335" id="335">[335]</span> superficial. But Paul’s preaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76453" data-verses="Acts 13:1">Acts 13</span> is very deep and marvelous. </p>

This is not the Antioch from which they were sent out on this journey of ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76481" data-verses="Acts 13:1">13:1</span>); rather, it is the Antioch in Pisidia, the Antioch in Asia Minor. </p>

Man’s soul is composed of man’s mind, emotion, and will. To establish the souls of the disciples is to establish them in their mind, that they may know and understand the Lord and the things concerning Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76483" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:16">1 Cor. 2:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76484" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>); in their emotion, that they may love the Lord and have a heart for the Lord’s interest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76485" data-verses="Mark 12:30">Mark 12:30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76486" data-verses="Romans 16:4">Rom. 16:4</span>); and in their will, that they may be strong to remain with the Lord and do the things that please the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76487" data-verses="Acts 11:23">Acts 11:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76488" data-verses="Colossians 1:10">Col. 1:10</span>; <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76489" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:1">1 Thes. 4:1</span>).

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76491" data-verses="Acts 13:43">13:43</span> they appealed to the believers to continue in the grace of God, but here they entreated them to continue in the faith.

<p data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5nU3ZU8_sITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb"> As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76492" data-verses="Acts 6:7">6:7</span>, the faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76493" data-verses="Acts 14:22">14:22</span> is the objective faith. It refers to what the believers believe in concerning Christ’s Person and work. The entire revelation of the New Testament concerning Christ and His redemptive work is considered the faith of God’s New Testament economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76494" data-verses="Romans 16:26">Rom. 16:26</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvABqw5V8_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP"> If we understand what the faith is, then we shall realize that continuing in the faith is a deeper matter than continuing in the grace. To continue in the grace of God is to enjoy the Triune God.

We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76497" data-verses="Acts 13:43">13:43</span> the believers were persuaded to continue in the grace of God; that is, they were encouraged to continue in the enjoyment of the Triune God as grace.

When Paul and Barnabas first <span class="pg" data-page-id="341" id="341">[341]</span> visited those cities, churches were raised up. Then Paul and Barnabas left for other places and eventually returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch. As we have seen, they entreated the disciples there to continue not only in the grace but also in the faith. The word about continuing in the grace of God was given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76499" data-verses="Acts 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> to new converts. Immediately after they were saved, they were persuaded by the apostles to stay in the enjoyment of the Triune God. The believers at Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch must have continued in the grace of God for some time. According to what is indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76500" data-verses="Acts 14:1">Acts 14</span>, they must have learned quite much of God’s New Testament economy during that period of time.

It is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76512" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>), and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76513" data-verses="Galatians 5:21">Gal. 5:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76514" data-verses="Ephesians 5:5">Eph. 5:5</span>) to the overcoming saints in the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76515" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">Rev. 20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76516" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>). Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God’s eternal life for all God’s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76517" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-4">Rev. 21:1-4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76518" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-5">22:1-5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76519" data-verses="Revelation 22:14">14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSXgecBQc9bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76520" data-verses="Acts 14:22">Acts 14:22</span> Paul entreated the believers who were continuing in the faith to realize that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God. Do you think that Paul regarded the kingdom of God only as a realm where God’s people are under His ruling, and that to enter into this realm we must pass through tribulation? Paul may have had the thought that the kingdom of God is a realm in which God rules over His people, but this certainly was not his main thought concerning the kingdom of God. We need to remember that Paul was entreating disciples who were somewhat advanced. They were continuing not only in the grace of God but also in the faith. The charge to continue in the faith is both deeper and higher than that to continue in the grace. Therefore, those whom Paul was entreating in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76521" data-verses="Acts 14:22">14:22</span> were somewhat learned in divine things. In telling them that they must enter the kingdom of God through much tribulation, Paul certainly regarded the kingdom as something more than an objective realm in which God rules as the King. </p>
<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG_e057Nk8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> What, then, was Paul’s main thought concerning the kingdom of God? If we would know this, we need to realize that according to the New Testament the kingdom of God is not a visible, material realm. Actually, the kingdom of God is a Person, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. When He was questioned by the Pharisees about the kingdom, “He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come <span class="pg" data-page-id="343" id="343">[343]</span> with observation; nor will they say, Look, here! Or, There! For behold, the kingdom of God is among you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76522" data-verses="Luke 17:20-21">Luke 17:20-21</span>). As the context proves, the kingdom of God is the Savior Himself, who was among the Pharisees. Wherever the Savior is, there is the kingdom of God. This was the reason He could say that the kingdom was among the Pharisees. As the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76523" data-verses="Luke 17:20">Luke 17:20</span> indicates, this kingdom does not come with observation; that is, it is spiritual, not material and visible. </p>

<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh89tyV-QR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> The claim that unless one is circumcised according to the custom of Moses he cannot be saved is an annulling of the faith in God’s New Testament economy, and it is a real heresy. Hence, the “certain men” who taught the Christian brothers this heresy might have been those who were considered by Paul false brothers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76557" data-verses="Galatians 2:4">Galatians 2:4</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="GKyQWo5hWTLmBf9JYiiBW421c46e937yRP_pDDoKx7RxQqXYuUV78sCkWbNBL0DfD"> Circumcision was an outward ordinance inherited by the Jews from their forefathers, beginning from Abraham <span class="pg" data-page-id="350" id="350">[350]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76558" data-verses="Genesis 17:9-14">Gen. 17:9-14</span>). This ordinance made the Jews distinct and separate from the Gentiles. Circumcision became a dead traditional formality, a mere mark on the flesh without any spiritual significance, and it became a great obstacle to the spread of God’s gospel according to His New Testament economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76559" data-verses="Galatians 2:3-4">Gal. 2:3-4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76560" data-verses="Galatians 6:12-13">6:12-13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76561" data-verses="Philippians 3:2">Phil. 3:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="clSZYpbJsMTyRlnc4Dwjj92DUxpJYeKfy4Dt-eqWvnGgiKA6P3AKy7krljshseoz8"> Circumcision, Sabbath-keeping, and a particular diet are the three strongest ordinances according to the law of Moses that caused the Jews to be distinct and separate from the Gentiles, who are regarded by them as unclean. All these scriptural ordinances of the Old Testament dispensation became an obstacle to the spreading of the gospel to the Gentiles according to God’s New Testament dispensation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76562" data-verses="Colossians 2:16">Col. 2:16</span>). To be circumcised in God’s New Testament economy is to make Christ of no profit to the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76563" data-verses="Galatians 5:2">Gal. 5:2</span>). </p>

Therefore, Paul and Barnabas could not tolerate this heresy, and they “had no little dissension and discussion” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76568" data-verses="Acts 15:2">Acts 15:2</span>) with those who had come down from Judea and taught it to the Christian brothers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76569" data-verses="Acts 15:2">verse 2</span> Paul and Barnabas were contending for the faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76570" data-verses="Jude 1:3">Jude 3</span>) against one of the greatest heresies so that the truth of the gospel might remain with the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76571" data-verses="Galatians 2:5">Gal. 2:5</span>). </p>

That <span class="pg" data-page-id="351" id="351">[351]</span> heresy should never have reached Antioch. Before those heretical teachers went to Antioch, they must have spread their teaching in Jerusalem. But there is no indication that Peter and James did anything to deal with that heresy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZqQVHlrMxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45">The Responsibility of Peter and James</h2><p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc5dmptYQwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> The source of the trouble described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76572" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> was Jerusalem. The first group of apostles and elders in Jerusalem should have taken care of this heretical teaching before it had the opportunity to spread to the Gentile churches. The fact that it was not dealt with in Jerusalem indicates that there were certain shortcomings with Peter and James. They must be held responsible for the situation. By the time this heresy spread to Antioch, it was too late for Paul and Barnabas to deal with it. This made it necessary for them to go up to Jerusalem in order to touch the source of the problem. </p>
<p data-content-id="NaxbvirwEM9IrWiL10EgL0QpTMeYfdNPKigSWcaRtEc-jMmKUrEXcfIwob1MBGo1q"> As we read the book of Acts, we may not have an accurate concept concerning Peter and James. We may regard Peter and James too highly. We may uplift Peter too much, and consider James very godly and pious. If we have such a concept of Peter and James, we shall not have the proper view of the situation recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76573" data-verses="Acts 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>. In other words, because of our inaccurate concept and understanding, we shall not have the proper insight into the heart of the problem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76574" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span>. Actually, the heart of the problem is not with the heretical Judaizers that went down to Antioch; it is with Peter and James. To say this is fair. </p>
<p data-content-id="tGyva9892obRbw9l_IvIXS_OIjFQhBT0AQQVTHyEChz0auSMkGYTRa1jagwpmuJyF"> Peter was present in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76575" data-verses="Acts 1:1">Acts 1</span> when the Lord Jesus gave the apostles further preparation for their ministry. As part of that preparation, He said to them, “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76576" data-verses="Acts 1:8">1:8</span>). Here the Lord appointed them to be His witnesses not only to those in Jerusalem and Judea and to the people of mixed blood in Samaria, but also to the remotest part of the earth, indicating all the lands of the Gentiles. The Lord’s word is <span class="pg" data-page-id="352" id="352">[352]</span> very clear. If James, a flesh brother of the Lord Jesus, was not present when this word was spoken, he certainly must have been familiar with it. Luke, the writer of the book of Acts, came to know this word. Surely James knew about it before Luke did. Peter and James should have taken the Lord’s word concerning being witnesses to the remotest part of the earth as the basis to deal with the heretical teaching that the Gentiles must be circumcised in order to be saved. Since the Lord had spoken this word, there was no need for discussion or argument. Peter and James should have done a thorough job to eliminate the heretical teaching, killing it at the source in Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB-tCqm3GKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> If we are fair-minded and have the proper insight as we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76577" data-verses="Acts 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, we shall realize that the trouble was due to the negligence of Peter and James. They did not do their duty; they did not carry out their responsibility. As a result, this heretical teaching existed in Jerusalem and was even prevailing there. If it had not been prevailing in Jerusalem, how could it have spread to Antioch? In ancient times communication to a faraway city was very slow. Hence, it was a great matter for something to spread from Jerusalem to Antioch. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqJyjb_D0dJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5">Not Guarding the Truth</h2><p data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlo671LITOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX"> The Judaizers were so zealous that, in spite of the difficulty in traveling, they went down to Antioch for the purpose of spreading their heretical teaching. They boldly taught the people, saying, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76578" data-verses="Acts 15:1">15:1</span>). As we have pointed out, this kind of teaching nullifies the entire New Testament. It nullifies Christ’s redeeming death, His resurrection, His ascension, and everything He taught. </p>
<p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT55DqX2r1fvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> It is very difficult to understand how Peter and James could have tolerated such a heresy in Jerusalem.

Peter and James deserve to be blamed for the problem, for they did not guard the truth and contend for it adequately. Because of this <span class="pg" data-page-id="353" id="353">[353]</span> shortage, the problem of heresy existed in Jerusalem and then spread to the Gentile churches. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76583" data-verses="Acts 15:26">verse 26</span>, Paul and Barnabas were regarded as those who had “given up their lives for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.” The church in Antioch decided to send them to Jerusalem. </p>

Peter’s word about the cleansing of our hearts by faith indicates that God does not care for outward legalistic ordinances which cannot cleanse man’s inward being; rather, He cares for the inward cleansing of man’s heart. This corresponds to the Lord’s emphasis in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76617" data-verses="Mark 7:1-23">Mark 7:1-23</span>.

Peter and the Jewish believers were saved by this grace, not by keeping the law of Moses.

Actually, Peter should not have allowed all that discussion. Immediately he should have said, “Brothers, let me remind you of what the Lord Jesus said to us. He told us that we would be His witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and even unto the remotest part of the earth. Do you think that the Lord meant that we need to circumcise all the Gentiles? Certainly He did not mean this.” If Peter had spoken in this way, those attending the conference would have listened to him. </p>

Why did he not refer to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76625" data-verses="Acts 1:8">1:8</span>? Why did he simply remind them that God had chosen that through him the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe? Peter should have said, “You know that from the early days the Lord Jesus told us that we should be His witnesses even to the remotest part of the earth.” In <span class="pg" data-page-id="359" id="359">[359]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76626" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> Peter may still have been somewhat fearful. He was not bold, and he did not exercise the authority assigned to him by the Head. If Peter had exercised this authority, he would have solved the problem and cut off the flow of the “poison” of heresy. He would have dealt with the very source of this flow. Peter, however, failed to do his job adequately. </p>
<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG_eU54NE8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76627" data-verses="Acts 15:8">15:8</span> Peter refers to God as the Knower of hearts. This is a rather weak expression. Peter should have said that God is the Planner of His economy, the One who formed His economy, His dispensation. Paul, who was bolder than Peter, spoke of God in this way in his Epistles. Was God’s giving the Holy Spirit to the Gentiles only due to the fact that He knew their hearts? Was this the only reason that He cleansed their hearts by faith? Did the Lord give Peter the keys merely that God may come in to cleanse the hearts of the Gentiles? No doubt, Peter makes a number of good points here, but his presentation is too weak. This weakness may cause us to question whether he really knew God’s economy adequately. </p>

Once again, Peter’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76629" data-verses="Acts 15:10">verse 10</span> was good, but it was still weak. Peter was the leading apostle, and the Lord had given him a measure of authority. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76630" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> he did not exercise this authority. Nevertheless, we praise the Lord for Peter’s testimony and fellowship. </p>

Peter should also have testified to them concerning the vision he saw in Joppa (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76632" data-verses="Acts 10:9-16">10:9-16</span>). He should have said, “Let me tell you what happened to me in Joppa. While I was praying, I saw a vision of a vessel like a great sheet in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven. Then the Lord told me to slay and eat. When I refused to do this, the Lord told me a second and a third time to slay and eat. The Lord told me that what God has cleansed I should not consider common. After seeing this vision, I went to Caesarea. As I was speaking, the Holy Spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="360" id="360">[360]</span> fell upon those in the house.” Peter should have testified concerning the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76633" data-verses="Acts 1:8">1:8</span>, the vision he saw, and what happened in the house of Cornelius. Peter should have taken these things as the ground to tell those at the conference to forget about the law, circumcision, and the Levitical dietary regulations. But Peter lacked the boldness to do this. </p>

In contrast to the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76635" data-verses="Luke 4:1">Luke 4</span>, Peter was very cautious, not daring to mention the vision he had seen. The fact that Peter did not mention the vision given to him by the Lord may indicate not only that he was lacking in boldness but also that the atmosphere in Jerusalem was very heavy. </p>

If he had done this, the Judaic heresy would have been cut off at the very beginning in Jerusalem and would not have spread to the churches in the Gentile world. But he failed to do this, so Paul had to rise up to perform the surgery to cut off the racial cancer that could have destroyed God’s New Testament economy and killed the Body of Christ. </p>

And there arose a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking along Mark, sailed away to Cyprus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76694" data-verses="Mark 15:38-39">vv. 38-39</span>). Barnabas and Paul were men who had given up their lives for the name of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76695" data-verses="Acts 15:26">v. 26</span>), yet immediately after their victory in contending for the faith against the heresy concerning circumcision, there arose such a sharp contention between them concerning a relative of one of them that they separated from each other. </p>

The reason for his failure may have been his natural relationship with Mark, his cousin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76696" data-verses="Colossians 4:10">Col. 4:10</span>), who had left Barnabas and Paul in their first ministry journey in a negative way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76697" data-verses="Acts 13:13">Acts 13:13</span>).

<p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc5dGptaQwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> Regarding Mark, Paul was very strict.

However, Barnabas, whose name means son of encouragement (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76700" data-verses="Acts 4:36">4:36</span>), wanted to take Mark with them on the second journey. Barnabas, who may have been a very kind and patient person, wanted to give Mark another opportunity. Furthermore, because Mark was Barnabas’ cousin, he and Barnabas had a relationship in the flesh. Because Paul was strict in not letting Mark go on the second journey, there arose a sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas. </p>

You may be very kind and patient, but when you come into the Lord’s work, you need to forget your natural kindness and patience and take care of the strict, divine regulations and principles. You should not sacrifice the divine principles for the sake of your natural being. If you are naturally nice, kind, patient, and tolerant, this will cause problems in the Lord’s work. If you hold on to such natural virtues, you will sacrifice the divine principles for the sake of your virtues. </p>

It is a terrible thing for this to take place. Barnabas was mistaken both in the matter of exercising his natural virtues in the Lord’s work and probably also in <span class="pg" data-page-id="371" id="371">[371]</span> allowing the fleshly relationship with Mark to come into the work. </p>

He certainly was one who had much experience in the Lord. Surely there must have been some basic principles involved with the question of taking Mark along with them on the second ministry journey, and Paul felt that he could not break these principles. Eventually, Barnabas went his way, taking Mark with him. After this, there is no further mention of Barnabas in the divine record of God’s move in His New Testament economy. This indicates that Barnabas was wrong. </p>

Paul wanted this one to go forth with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76706" data-verses="Acts 15:1-3">vv. 1b-3</span>). Paul’s circumcising Timothy because of the Jews indicates the strong influence of the Judaic background that still remained among the Jewish believers. This disturbed and frustrated the move of the Lord’s gospel. </p>

Considering Timothy good material for the work, Paul wanted him to go forth with him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76711" data-verses="Acts 16:3">16:3</span>). We are told that Paul “took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places.” In circumcising Timothy Paul may have been exercising his wisdom to make the situation easier for him to preach the gospel. Otherwise there was no reason for Paul to have Timothy circumcised. </p>

And I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the gospel which I proclaim among the nations, but privately to those of reputation, lest somehow I should be running or had run in vain. But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.” These verses refer to what is recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76714" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76715" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> there is no mention of Titus, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76716" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span> Paul tells us that he took Titus with him to Jerusalem. Furthermore, Paul says that Titus was not compelled to be circumcised. Since Titus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76717" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span> was not circumcised, why did Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76718" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span> circumcise Timothy when he was on his second ministry journey? Here we see that Paul acted in two ways. On the one hand, Titus was not circumcised; on the other hand, Paul had Timothy circumcised. </p>

Since Timothy was circumcised, did Christ profit him nothing? </p>
<p data-content-id="Rk893wdUx5BEGaMPK80I_l_Y9RUXWC8S9x4OY1mdzGmnzTwz2JfO8yuVuuay8b7Zz"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76720" data-verses="Galatians 5:4">Galatians 5:4</span> Paul goes on to say, “You have been <span class="pg" data-page-id="373" id="373">[373]</span> brought to naught from Christ, you who are justified by law; you have fallen from grace.” This is a serious word. To be brought to naught from Christ is to be reduced to nothing from Christ, deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated from Him, making Him void of effect. </p>
<p data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDv98dh1Mw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76721" data-verses="Galatians 6:14">Galatians 6:14</span> Paul says, “But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.” In this verse the “world” is not the world in general but the Jewish, religious world. As the following verse indicates, here Paul is saying that the religious world has been crucified to him, and he to the religious world. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76722" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">Galatians 6:15</span> he goes on to explain, “For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.” As we have pointed out elsewhere, circumcision is an ordinance of the law, whereas the new creation is of the divine life with the divine nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4FyHh8wlMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> Paul also speaks of circumcision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76723" data-verses="Galatians 5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>: “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith operating through love.” Here the word “avails” indicates force or practical power. Circumcision is merely an outward ordinance and has no power or life. </p>

They intended to speak the word in Asia, but the Holy Spirit forbade them. Forbidding is also a part of the Holy Spirit’s leading. </p>

If we look at a map, we shall see that such a forward direction would be <span class="pg" data-page-id="378" id="378">[378]</span> toward eastern Europe, in particular, toward Macedonia and Achaia. Paul, however, did not have the thought of going there. This made it necessary for the Lord to give him a vision during the night, and in this vision a Macedonian call came to Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76752" data-verses="Acts 16:9">v. 9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tBwNIhiC-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf"> The Holy Spirit’s forbidding Paul to go to the left, to Asia, and the Spirit of Jesus’ not allowing him to go to the right, Bithynia, indicates a straightforward direction for the apostle and his co-workers. Thus they went in a direct course to Macedonia through Mysia and Troas (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76753" data-verses="Acts 16:8">v. 8</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ayDvwYGbF8kWY5F_8GVvXQTv6UiHZVamrMqmbhtFN96IRxElNLGJfnroptl9R0_TX">TWO DIVINE TITLES NOT FOUND<br/>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IV2VNo-28Fq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> We need to pay careful attention to two divine titles in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76754" data-verses="Acts 16:6">verses 6</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76755" data-verses="Acts 16:7">7</span>: the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus. The interchangeable use of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit in the preceding verse reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament. The Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God, and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God, but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death as well. Such an all-inclusive Spirit was needed for the apostle’s preaching ministry, a ministry of suffering among human beings and for human beings in the human life. </p>
<p data-content-id="q56ADhFm7_LcIoAPG0xFRgUPM8WaUIO8_vrnKMCsdpFo2iQHQ7PItJoxf0tRnNi13"> We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76756" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span> Luke first speaks of the Holy Spirit and then of the Spirit of Jesus. In the Old Testament we read of the Spirit of God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76757" data-verses="Genesis 1:2">Genesis 1:2b</span>: “The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” There the Spirit of God brooded over the death waters. Elsewhere in the Old Testament the Spirit of God is called the Spirit of Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76758" data-verses="Judges 3:10">Judg. 3:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76759" data-verses="Ezekiel 11:5">Ezek. 11:5</span>). The title “the Holy Spirit” is not used in the Old Testament. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76760" data-verses="Psalms 51:11">Psalm 51:11</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76761" data-verses="Isaiah 63:10-11">Isaiah 63:10-11</span> the “Holy Spirit” should be translated “the Spirit of <span class="pg" data-page-id="379" id="379">[379]</span> holiness.” The main titles of God’s Spirit in the Old Testament, therefore, are the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah. God’s Spirit is never called the Spirit of Elijah or the Spirit of David. From this we see that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76762" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span> Luke uses two titles for the Spirit of God that are not found in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOYKz1RRk0YVQ9GDbrwAsYkC2xIcaMrEmSNYGfSmuuL0gRLldZ5UBQtK-b9YuTg7p"> The title “the Holy Spirit” was used for the first time at the time of the conception of the Lord Jesus. It was when the time came to prepare the way for Christ’s coming and to prepare a human body for Him to initiate the New Testament dispensation that the term the Holy Spirit came into use (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76763" data-verses="Luke 1:15">Luke 1:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76764" data-verses="Luke 1:35">35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76765" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matt. 1:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76766" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">20</span>). In order to understand the first usage of the title the Holy Spirit, we need to see that this title is involved with the Lord’s incarnation. Hence, according to the principle of first mention, the Holy Spirit is related to Christ’s incarnation and birth. </p>
<p data-content-id="8hEVLiYPHPDrLKUUGORp91MIdV-olxt5lp8YViQRgoFO6adHYqE9Xo2xECC72P9rr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76767" data-verses="Acts 16:7">Acts 16:7</span> Luke turns from the Holy Spirit to the Spirit of Jesus. As a man, Jesus was first living a human life and then was crucified and resurrected, and He ascended to the heavens and has been made Lord and Christ. The Spirit of Jesus involves more than the Holy Spirit does. The Holy Spirit involves only the incarnation and birth of the Lord Jesus, but the Spirit of Jesus involves His humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="01ti1r4uNODePuwq-F9e_wibcI0Asch_5CI1PAYjW-KfNYvtApOjUcBbYG5vhQyHY">A NEW MOVE IN GOD’S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAclb-PqKjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76768" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span> we see that the move of the apostles in their evangelistic work was strictly speaking not by the Spirit of God. Rather, it was by the Holy Spirit, who was involved with the Lord’s incarnation and birth, and by the Spirit of Jesus, who was involved with the Lord’s humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. These two divine titles indicate strongly that Paul’s move in his evangelical work was not something in the way of the old dispensation. If it had been a move in the old dispensational way, then the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah should have been mentioned. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76769" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span> there is no mention of the Spirit of God nor of the Spirit of Jehovah. Instead, we are told that <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> Paul and his co-workers were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia and were not allowed by the Spirit of Jesus to go into Bithynia. The fact that Luke speaks of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus indicates that the evangelical work of the apostles was a new move in God’s New Testament economy. As we have pointed out, it is not our burden in this Life-study of Acts to consider all the minor points. Our burden is to see God’s move on earth for His New Testament economy and all the crucial dispensational turning points related to this move. </p>
<p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsNk8LIq_GFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> God’s New Testament economy is carried out through the Lord’s incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. The Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus include these matters. This means that the Spirit who is now called the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus is the totality and ultimate consummation of Christ’s incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. When we have this Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus, we have Christ in His incarnation, in His humanity and human living, and in His death, resurrection, and ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKITnjz2HZh9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG"> Elsewhere we have pointed out that after His resurrection and in His resurrection Christ has become the pneumatic Christ. The pneumatic Christ is identical to the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76770" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76771" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). The Holy Spirit, who is also the Spirit of Jesus, is the totality of this pneumatic Christ. The pneumatic Christ is constituted of certain elements: incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. In the entire universe He is the only one who possesses these six qualifications. Only He is qualified with incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. Hence, the Spirit of Jesus is the realization of this qualified Jesus. The Spirit of Jesus is the totality of such an all-inclusive One. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76772" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span> Paul and his co-workers were moving under the direction of such a Spirit, the Spirit who is the totality of the all-inclusive Christ. </p>

Rather, it is the result of more than a half century of studying the holy Word and the writings of others, plus observing the experience of the saints and my own experience. My fellowship concerning these two titles of the divine Spirit, therefore, is based upon years of study, observation, and experience. </p>

After they had come down to Troas, “a vision was seen by Paul during the night: a certain man, a Macedonian, was standing and entreating him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76784" data-verses="Acts 16:9">v. 9</span>). This vision seen by Paul was neither a dream nor a trance. This is different from Peter’s experience in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76785" data-verses="Acts 10:9-16">10:9-16</span>, when “a trance came upon him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76786" data-verses="Acts 10:10">v. 10</span>). In the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76787" data-verses="Acts 16:9">16:9</span> a Macedonian man urged Paul to come over into Macedonia. Macedonia was a province of the Roman Empire in southeastern Europe between Thrace and Achaia on the Aegean Sea. </p>

The mind that is capable of understanding such a vision from God is a mind saturated and directed by the spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76789" data-verses="Ephesians 4:23">Eph. 4:23</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="1jNZ3Y6RNXScv8-BkjBPHxEFaFzfAIRX4Bba-Y8mPL_tBBhV44go-Yxey-xe-DJIo"> After concluding that God had called them to bring the good news to the Macedonians, Paul and his co-workers endeavored to go forth into Macedonia. This was a major step in the Lord’s move for the spreading of His kingdom to another continent, to Europe. It explains the intention of the Holy Spirit forbidding them, the Spirit of Jesus not allowing them, and also the coming of the vision in the night. To carry out this particular leading in the Lord’s strategic move required the endeavoring of the apostle and his co-workers. This they did immediately. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9B3GelIP98ERinHYusa7LW0V_Tl3VD5C0GrAN_47CuFPIXBZ0UnuKxTnHsaPni2Fg">THE PREACHING AND ITS FRUITS</h2><p data-content-id="jHPCvHM6AJL14sHMoNHv4qpZKdllursp8MnQXFHjxCUMf5qoYcCmTHDm7GFZatUid"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76791" data-verses="Acts 16:11-12">Acts 16:11 and 12a</span> say, “And putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the following day to Neapolis; and from there to Philippi, which is the leading city of that part of Macedonia, a colony.” Troas was a seaport at the northwest corner of Asia Minor opposite to Macedonia on the Aegean Sea. Samothrace was an island in the Aegean Sea between Troas and Philippi, and Neapolis was a seaport of Philippi. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76792" data-verses="Acts 16:12">Acts 16:12</span> says that Philippi was a colony. This means that it was a fortified outpost of the Roman Empire in a foreign country, where the citizens had equal rights with those at the capital, Rome. Hence, Philippi was a strategic point for the spread of the gospel at its beginning in Europe. </p>

This verse also speaks of a place of prayer. Man’s prayer to God affords Him an opportunity for His move among men on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="63PjdVBPG51GyPm3TV2qIfmT1y1Uj-ESJwos787hQjcxafhitczkEPKKkKzBqHe70"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76794" data-verses="Acts 16:13">16:13</span> Paul followed his principle of seeking out God’s chosen people.

We do not know whether Lydia was a Jewish lady or a God-seeking Greek, since many of the Greek women, especially of the upper class, were seeking God.

Lydia, after believing and being baptized, entered into fellowship with the apostle and his co-workers, the fellowship of the Body of Christ, as evidence of her salvation.

The fallen angels work with Satan in the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76806" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Eph. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76807" data-verses="Ephesians 6:11-12">6:11-12</span>), and the unclean spirits, the demons, move with him on earth. Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan. The possession of people by demons signifies Satan’s usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuGjIAnEo5IafG53qBVe0_SpiGKgO2xOWEc6_4BynTJX3LLZmIC9oRziJLF_biW7b"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76808" data-verses="Acts 16:16">Acts 16:16</span> the maiden had a spirit of Python and brought profit to her masters by divining. The name “Python” was used to denote a prophetic demon, and was also used of fortune tellers. Divination is the art or practice that seeks to foresee or foretell future events or discover hidden knowledge by the aid of supernatural powers. </p>

And she was doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly disturbed, and turning, he said to the spirit, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out from her! And it came out that very hour.” The woman with this evil spirit became a frustration to Paul’s preaching. Paul tolerated the situation for some time. But eventually he cast out the evil spirit. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76810" data-verses="Acts 16:19">verse 19</span> indicates, after the demon had been cast out from the woman, she could no longer bring profit to her masters. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76847" data-verses="Acts 17:1-9">verses 1 through 9</span> Paul comes to Thessalonica; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76848" data-verses="Acts 17:10-13">verses 10 through 13</span>, to Berea; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76849" data-verses="Acts 17:14-34">verses 14 through 34</span>, to Athens. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo4kypI-kl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk">TO THESSALONICA</h2><p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZkbucKbDnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76850" data-verses="Acts 16:11-40">16:11-40</span> we have an account of the raising up of the church in Philippi. This church was raised up through two rather unusual persons. The first was “a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple-dyed goods, from the city of Thyatira” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76851" data-verses="Acts 16:14">16:14</span>). The second was a jailer. According to our experience and observation, churches are often raised up through unusual persons such as these. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2aZAJ_v2Cwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> After staying in Philippi Paul and his co-workers traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and then “came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76852" data-verses="Acts 17:1">17:1</span>). Thessalonica was another leading city, sitting on a gulf in the middle of the shoreline of the province of Macedonia. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAcl7-PoKjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC">Reasoning from the Scriptures<br/>concerning Christ</h2><p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsNkcLIo_GFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> In Thessalonica there was a synagogue of the Jews, a place where the Jews sought the knowledge of God by studying the Holy Scriptures. According to his custom, Paul “went in to them, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them <span class="pg" data-page-id="394" id="394">[394]</span> from the Scriptures” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76853" data-verses="Acts 17:2">v. 2</span>). Concerning what did Paul reason with those in the synagogue from the Scriptures? Concerning theology and the law of Moses? Concerning types and prophecies? No, he did not reason from the Scriptures concerning any of these things. Rather, he reasoned concerning Christ, “opening and setting before them that the Christ must suffer and rise from among the dead, and saying, This is the Christ, Jesus, whom I announce to you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76854" data-verses="Acts 17:3">v. 3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKITnDz1H5h9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG"> In my Christian life I have seen people reason concerning many things other than Christ. For example, many have reasoned about immersion. Some have argued that believers should be immersed frontward; others argue that they should be immersed backward or straight downward. Each of the parties gave reasons for their opinions. Others have reasoned concerning whether a believer should be immersed once or three times—the first time in the name of the Father, the second in the name of the Son, and the third in the name of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1cvUrw7akEn3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp"> When Paul was in the synagogue in Thessalonica, he did not reason concerning the law. Rather, from the Scriptures he reasoned with those in the synagogue concerning Christ. He set before them that Christ must suffer and rise from among the dead. Then he said to them, “This is the Christ, Jesus, whom I announce to you.” </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQS7mcYxx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_">According to His Spiritual Constitution</h2><p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGUPjd2bozY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> Because Paul was constituted of the Spirit of Jesus, he was led, guided, and directed by this Spirit. He did not have the heart to reason concerning genealogies, prophecies, or types. He had just one burden, and this burden was according to his spiritual constitution. Paul’s constitution was fully of the Spirit of Jesus. Therefore, in Thessalonica Paul ministered nothing other than the all-inclusive Christ. Many rabbis studied the Old Testament without seeing anything of Christ. Paul, however, could see Christ revealed in the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-DjlteMcORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> We need to learn to study the Bible and use the Bible the way Paul did. We should also seek to minister divine things <span class="pg" data-page-id="395" id="395">[395]</span> according to Paul’s way. I have observed much reasoning, debate, and contention about certain biblical truths, but I have seen very few reasonings concerning the all-inclusive Christ. Let us learn to reason for the all-inclusive Christ based upon both the New Testament and the Old Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3HyMEsc83s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn">Ministering the All-inclusive Christ</h2><p data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjVlzEIu23Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76855" data-verses="Acts 17:3">17:3</span> Luke indicates that Paul simply announced Christ to those in the synagogue. Actually, Paul must have reasoned concerning Christ in a lengthy and detailed way. I believe that he reasoned about Christ being God and man. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76856" data-verses="Acts 17:3">verse 3</span>, Paul told them that it was necessary for Christ to suffer. Christ’s suffering implies His incarnation, and His incarnation implies His dual status, that is, His deity and His humanity. Furthermore, Christ’s suffering implies His death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76857" data-verses="Acts 17:3">17:3</span> Paul explicitly spoke of Christ’s resurrection, saying that “the Christ must suffer and rise from among the dead.” Therefore, Paul must have reasoned concerning the incarnated Christ in His deity, humanity, human living, suffering, death, and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="OxXT42mbN-_IwwC7yJgB057lOD0YMzE-XjPYijEZ2-L3hEiePh0clDIYHsHVPlhJm"> The fact that Paul reasoned in detail concerning Christ is indicated by the fact that on three Sabbaths he reasoned with those in the synagogue from the Scriptures. It is not likely that on these Sabbaths Paul reasoned only for an hour. It is much more likely that he spent several hours, even half a day, reasoning with them concerning Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKetU9-vDzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO"> Paul’s reasoning in the synagogue concerning Christ corresponds to his being led by the Holy Spirit and regulated by the Spirit of Jesus. Paul was this kind of person. Because he was under the leading of the Holy Spirit and the regulation of the Spirit of Jesus, Paul carried on a work of presenting, conveying, and ministering the all-inclusive Christ to others. Paul did not minister law, genealogies, prophecies, or types—he ministered the living and all-inclusive Christ. This is the deeper significance of this portion of the Word. When we come to these verses in Acts, we need to read and study them in this way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="396" id="396">[396]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWB_Jrv0Q5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ">Many Joining Themselves<br/>to Paul and Silas</h2><p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh88dyW-wR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76858" data-verses="Acts 17:4">Acts 17:4</span> continues, “And some of them were persuaded and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, and of the leading women not a few.” These worshipping Greeks may have been Greeks that were converted to the Jewish religion. The great multitude that joined themselves to Paul and Silas included a number of leading women. It is significant that in Acts the leading women among the Greeks often were among the first to believe in the gospel. This indicates that many of the Greek women were seeking God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="GKyQWo5hWTLmBf9JYjSBV4W1c46e937yRP_pDDoKx7RxQqXYuUV78sCkWbNBL0DfD">The Opposition of the Jews</h2><p data-content-id="clSZYpbJsMTyRlnc4CAjg8WDUxpJYeKfy4Dt-eqWvnGgiKA6P3AKy7krljshseoz8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76859" data-verses="Acts 17:5-7">Acts 17:5-7</span> describes the opposition of the Jews: “But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some evil men who were loafers in the marketplace, gathered a crowd and set the city in an uproar; and coming upon the house of Jason, they sought to bring them before the populace. But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city officials, shouting, These men who have upset the world have come here also, whom Jason has welcomed; and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.” Literally, the Greek word translated “world” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76860" data-verses="Acts 17:6">verse 6</span> means the inhabited earth. Probably the apostles did preach that Jesus is the King. The opposers used their word to accuse them and in a subtle way to involve Caesar. Opposers often have this ability, which may come from the training they have received from the Devil, the evil instigator. </p>
<p data-content-id="YJs94s2aJDs7VNvpWj2WpvnDyQTQT1-VL5FhVS1mIG-dzYnTnvCO7bnb1cG2qXU2E"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76861" data-verses="Acts 17:5-7">17:5-7</span> we can see how strong was the influence of Judaism. This influence was prevailing not only in Jerusalem but also in the Gentile world, even in eastern Europe. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76862" data-verses="Acts 17:8">verse 8</span>, “they troubled the crowd and the city officials when they heard these things.” Here we see their subtlety in joining with local politics and even utilizing it to persecute the apostles. This indicates that the Jewish religion has been usurped by God’s enemy, Satan, to oppose <span class="pg" data-page-id="397" id="397">[397]</span> God’s economy. In principle, the situation is the same today. Religion joins the worldly authorities to frustrate God’s genuine move on earth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1IRJs21r0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg">TO BEREA</h2><p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2UV_f60NqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76863" data-verses="Acts 17:10">Acts 17:10</span> says, “And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas during the night to Berea, who when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.” Why did the brothers immediately send Paul and Silas to Berea? They sent them immediately because the apostles were in danger of being killed. If they had delayed even a little, they might have been put to death. </p>
<p data-content-id="SX_7dMl2HfxSBERUsHgTcPLFHdrM23w5gIng7aE_LX2argmuVZZVL0WFlWju6AxQa"> Once again, upon arrival in Berea, Paul and Silas “went into the synagogue of the Jews.” As usual, their reason for doing so was to grasp the opportunity for preaching the gospel. Paul and Silas were bold, going into the Jewish stronghold. This was necessary in order for them to gain God’s called ones who were held in the fold of Judaism. </p>
<p data-content-id="g8IXFe6HuOguESGggpgOgskbyypS3PnQmdHqw5ICsa7V_yGT9Yi4eMOByQVLvj_dD"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76864" data-verses="Acts 17:11-12">Acts 17:11 and 12</span> say, “Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so. Therefore many of them believed, and there were not a few Greek women of high standing and men.” Vine says that the Greek word rendered “more noble” indicates that the Bereans were more noble minded. F. F. Bruce says that the word means to be liberal, free from prejudice. </p>

The same word is used in noun form in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76892" data-verses="Acts 25:19">25:19</span> for religion. The Athenians were very religious not in relation to the true God but with respect to the worshipping of idols. We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76893" data-verses="Acts 17:16">verse 16</span> Paul’s spirit “was provoked in him as he beheld that the city was full of idols.” </p>
<p data-content-id="yOYKz1RRk0YVQ9GDbrAAkLUC2xIcaMrEmSNYGfSmuuL0gRLldZ5UBQtK-b9YuTg7p"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76894" data-verses="Acts 17:23">verse 23</span> Paul continued, “For while I was passing through and carefully observing objects of your worship, I found also an altar on which was inscribed, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you worship as unknown, this I announce to you.” Here Paul seemed to be saying, “I announce to you the One you worship as the unknown God. He may be unknown to you, but He is known by me.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDv88di0sw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx">THE CREATOR AND THE PROVIDER</h2><p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4FzHh_xFMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76895" data-verses="Acts 17:24-25">verses 24 and 25</span> Paul says, “The God who made the <span class="pg" data-page-id="404" id="404">[404]</span> world and all things in it, this One, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands, neither is He served by human hands as though He needs anything, since He Himself gives to all life and breath and all things.” The apostle’s word in these verses was a very strong inoculation to both the atheistic Epicureans, who did not recognize the Creator and His providence over the world, and the pantheistic Stoics, who submitted themselves to the will of many gods concerning their fate (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76896" data-verses="Acts 17:18">v. 18</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76897" data-verses="Acts 17:24">verse 24</span> Paul speaks of the God who made the world and all things in it. This word was directed mainly against the Epicureans, who, as atheists, did not believe in God. They believed neither in the Creator nor in the divine provision. Therefore, continuing to speak against the Epicureans, Paul went on to say that God is the Lord of heaven and earth. This One was absolutely ignored by the Epicureans. Furthermore, Paul pointed out that God Himself gives to all life and breath and all things. These are the divine provisions. God provides all things so that man may live. The Epicureans did not believe in the Creator, the Lord of heaven and earth who provides all the necessities of life for human beings. </p>
<p data-content-id="LilxD0znUWS-9v837430VBPuzl4KnJ-MfefbTNnzPPig5LWJWb9boygxWo-Q9W1s_"> Paul’s preaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76898" data-verses="Acts 17:1">Acts 17</span> is very good. When he was reasoning with the Jews in the synagogues, he used the Scriptures. But when he was preaching to the philosophical Epicureans, he referred to the creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="mlcLhH-3w5KZuNDv7yNvCeSzmtunqHXxKV7NNVCdEbwgO3dnwE5vpipW8E4hgdOFK"> What Paul did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76899" data-verses="Acts 17:2">17:2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76900" data-verses="Acts 17:24">17:24</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76901" data-verses="Acts 17:25">25</span> is similar to what he did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76902" data-verses="Acts 13:1">chapters thirteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76903" data-verses="Acts 14:1">fourteen</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76904" data-verses="Acts 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> he used the Jewish Scriptures as the basis for preaching the resurrected Christ. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76905" data-verses="Acts 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> his preaching to the heathen was based on God’s creation. However, there is a difference in Paul’s use of the creation in his preaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76906" data-verses="Acts 14:1">chapters fourteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76907" data-verses="Acts 17:1">seventeen</span>; his utterance in these chapters is somewhat different. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76908" data-verses="Acts 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> he told the heathen that the “living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all the things in them...did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76909" data-verses="Acts 14:15">14:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76910" data-verses="Acts 14:17">17</span>). There his word was not very <span class="pg" data-page-id="405" id="405">[405]</span> philosophical. By contrast, Paul’s word to counter the false teachings of the Epicureans in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76911" data-verses="Acts 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> is quite philosophical. Here Paul declares that there is a Creator, the Lord of heaven and earth, and that He provides life, breath, and everything necessary for man’s living on earth. </p>

Here we see God’s sovereign authority. God is sovereign over the entire earth. Not only did He create all nations out of one, Adam, but He determined the times and places of the nations. The migrations to America in its times and boundaries is a strong proof of this word and also of the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76914" data-verses="Acts 17:27">verse 27</span>. Apparently Columbus opened the way from Europe to America; actually it was God who opened the way, for He determined the seasons for the discovery of the new land. Furthermore, it is He who draws the boundaries of all nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvAAaw5W8_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP"> Paul’s preaching here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76915" data-verses="Acts 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> is very philosophical. From the creation of the heavens and the earth and God’s provision for all of mankind, Paul goes on to speak of the existence of mankind. We need to learn of Paul in preaching the gospel. We may begin with creation, but we should not remain there. Rather, we should go on from creation to speak concerning man’s life. When we do this, we touch the very point of man’s need. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76916" data-verses="Acts 17:26">17:26</span> Paul in his preaching came to man’s life on earth. </p>

This involves the Trinity. The divine Spirit is triune. Do you think that this Spirit is only the Spirit and not the Father and the Son as well? The God who is not far from us is surely the omnipresent Spirit, and this Spirit is the Triune God. The Spirit is the entire God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. </p>

This does not mean that man has God’s life and lives, exists, and acts in God as do the believers in Christ, who are born of God, possess His divine life and nature, and live, exist, and act in God’s Person. Rather, here Paul is pointing out that all human beings, including the Epicureans and all other unbelievers, live, move, and exist in God. </p>

In the writings of these two poets “His” refers to Zeus as the supreme God. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2aZQJ08GCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> According to the poets to whom Paul refers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76920" data-verses="Acts 17:28">verse 28</span>, we are God’s offspring. Mankind is God’s offspring just as Adam was supposed to be the son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76921" data-verses="Luke 3:38">Luke 3:38</span>). To say that Adam was a son of God does not mean that he was born of God and possessed the life of God. Adam was created by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76922" data-verses="Genesis 5:1-2">Gen. 5:1-2</span>), and God was his origin. Based upon this, he was supposed to be the son of God, even as the heathen <span class="pg" data-page-id="407" id="407">[407]</span> poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God. They were only created by God, not regenerated of Him. This is absolutely and intrinsically different from the believers in Christ being the sons of God.

And having found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had directed all the Jews to depart from Rome), he went to them.” Claudius was a Caesar of the Roman Empire. What he did here was used by the Lord for His ministry to build up His church, just as what Caesar Augustus did was used by God for the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the birth place of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76970" data-verses="Luke 2:1-7">Luke 2:1-7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjVmTEIs23Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76971" data-verses="Acts 18:3">Verse 3</span> says, “And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them and they worked; for they were tentmakers by trade.” This indicates that while Paul was carrying out the ministry of the Lord, he still had a job. He refers to this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76972" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>, “We labor, working with our own hands.” Furthermore, in both <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76973" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="416" id="416">[416]</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76974" data-verses="2Thessalonians 3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span> Paul says that he labored day and night so as not to be burdensome to the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="OxXT42mbN-_IwwC7yKAB077lOD0YMzE-XjPYijEZ2-L3hEiePh0clDIYHsHVPlhJm"> Paul’s practice was different from that of many Christian workers today. Often when a person becomes a minister or a missionary, he will no longer do any other kind of work. But while Paul was ministering the word, he also worked with his hands in order to earn a living. This he did not only to support himself, but also to support his co-workers. Regarding this, he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76975" data-verses="Acts 20:34-35">Acts 20:34 and 35</span>, “You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my needs and to those who are with me. I have showed you all things, that toiling in this way we ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus which He Himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.” Once again Paul set up a good pattern. </p>
<p data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKeu099vjzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO"> According to a passage such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76976" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:3-15">1 Corinthians 9:3-15</span>, the churches and the saints were not faithful in taking care of Paul as a servant of the Lord. Because they did not support him adequately, he was forced to work. Some of the Corinthians even accused Paul of trying to make a gain for himself from them. But Paul indicated that he would rather die than take anything from the Corinthians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="76977" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:15">1 Cor. 9:15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWB8prs0w5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> Those who serve the Lord full-time should not regard their work for the Lord as their profession. If necessary, some may still need to work in order to make a living for themselves. Whether or not we do this depends on how much our burden occupies us. If your burden occupies you in full and the environment affords you a living, then you should certainly spend all your time on the Lord’s work. But if not, you should still work to support yourself, and not only yourself but also your co-workers, especially the younger ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh8_9yV_QR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> If Paul did not receive proper financial support, how could his younger co-workers have received it? Because of the need to support himself and others, Paul was forced to work at his trade of tentmaking. This is a very good pattern for us today. </p>
<p data-content-id="GKyQWo5hWTLmBf9JYgyBW521c46e937yRP_pDDoKx7RxQqXYuUV78sCkWbNBL0DfD"> Concerning financial support, the situation of Paul and his co-workers in the New Testament was different from the <span class="pg" data-page-id="417" id="417">[417]</span> priests and the Levites in the Old Testament. According to the Levitical regulations, the priests and Levites were to live on the offerings of God’s people. But in the New Testament this regulation is over. </p>
<p data-content-id="clSZYpbJsMTyRlnc4Bgjj82DUxpJYeKfy4Dt-eqWvnGgiKA6P3AKy7krljshseoz8"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76978" data-verses="Luke 8:1-3">Luke 8:1-3</span>, a group of sisters ministered to the Lord Jesus and the twelve out of their possessions. The twelve disciples followed the Lord full time, and they all needed financial support. Certain women who loved the Lord and who had the substance to support the Lord and His followers met their need. </p>
<p data-content-id="YJs94s2aJDs7VNvpWgWWqvHDyQTQT1-VL5FhVS1mIG-dzYnTnvCO7bnb1cG2qXU2E"> In the early years in the church in Shanghai, the financial support came mainly from the sisters. A number of sisters were nurses in a leading hospital, and these sisters supported the church and the co-workers in Shanghai. I have also observed this in other places. </p>
<p data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1ISps12L0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg"> In a very real sense, the sisters love the Lord much more than the brothers do. Among the twelve was a Judas, but there was no “Judas” among the sisters. Judas did not know how to love the Lord, but he certainly knew how to count money. Those who care for money in this way will never support others. The more they count their money, the more they love it and desire to keep it for themselves. </p>

Although Roman politics persecuted the Lord Jesus, the wife of a Roman official used her husband’s money to support Him. I have known cases of sisters who have used their husband’s money to support the Lord’s work. </p>
<p data-content-id="g8IXFe6HuOguESGggqAOgukbyypS3PnQmdHqw5ICsa7V_yGT9Yi4eMOByQVLvj_dD"> The point we are emphasizing regarding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="76981" data-verses="Acts 18:3">Acts 18:3</span> is that those who are burdened to serve the Lord full time should do so if the environment and the financial situation allow. But if the environment does not permit one to serve full time, he should not give up his burden. Rather, he should carry out <span class="pg" data-page-id="418" id="418">[418]</span> his burden and yet at the same time be diligent to work to meet his needs, as Paul did in Acts. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77040" data-verses="Acts 18:5">18:5</span>, “when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was wholly occupied in the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77041" data-verses="Acts 18:11">Acts 18:11</span> tells us that Paul settled in Corinth “a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.” In Corinth Paul first went to the synagogue to testify to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ. When they resisted and blasphemed, “he shook out his garments and said to them, Your blood be upon your head; I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77042" data-verses="Acts 18:6">v. 6</span>). Paul then remained in Corinth teaching the word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1IS5s8mr0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77043" data-verses="Acts 18:5">Acts 18:5</span> indicates that when Paul was in the synagogue, he came directly to the matter of testifying that Jesus is the Christ. However, in our preaching of the gospel to unbelievers, we may think that they will not listen to us if we speak to them concerning the Lord immediately and directly. According to our concept, we may need some kind of opener for our gospel preaching, some way to open the listeners and gain their attention. I do not say that we should never use an opener in preaching the gospel. But we must always remember what our job is. Our job is not to do anything other than to present Christ to sinners and especially to <span class="pg" data-page-id="426" id="426">[426]</span> minister Christ to them. Some may say that it is very difficult to present Christ in a direct way to unbelievers. I agree that this is difficult. Therefore we need to learn how to have the power and impact necessary for this. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2UWPfxndqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO">POWER THROUGH PRAYER,<br/>THE WORD, AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvAD6w5U8_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP"> If we would have power and impact in our gospel preaching, we need to pray. There is no need for us to pray until we speak in tongues in order to have the power. We may have genuine power through prayer without speaking in tongues. Furthermore, I have known a number of tongue-speakers who were not at all powerful in preaching the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBNTN1VkWnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> At this point, let me relate to you a conversation I had many years ago with a Christian friend in Chefoo, my hometown. This friend was the leader of a certain Pentecostal group. I had known this brother for years, and the meeting hall for this Pentecostal group was very close to the church meeting hall. One day this brother came to me with the intention of convincing me to take the Pentecostal way. Because we were friends, I encouraged him to speak openly and frankly. I said to him, “Brother, you have come to see me for the purpose of convincing me to practice the Pentecostal things.” When he told me that this was his intention, I indicated to him that I was happy to talk to him concerning this. </p>
<p data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBcqKD02wHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa"> I asked this brother why he was so enthusiastic about the Pentecostal things. He said that the reason for his enthusiasm was his belief that through speaking in tongues we may have power. Then I said, “Brother, let us pay attention to the facts. I am not in favor of the Pentecostal things, but you are strongly for them and have been practicing them for years. I would ask you to compare the number in your congregation with the number in ours. You claim to be powerful because you speak in tongues, but you still only have about fifty meeting with you. We do not practice tongue-speaking, but we have hundreds meeting with us, hundreds who have been brought to the Lord through our gospel preaching. Where, then, is your power? You speak in tongues, but you do not <span class="pg" data-page-id="427" id="427">[427]</span> have power. We do not speak in tongues, but we have genuine power. Do you know where this power comes from? This power comes from prayer.” </p>
<p data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGmDM6sI3UZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L"> I went on to testify to this brother regarding our practice of preaching the gospel at the time of the Chinese new year. Instead of celebrating the Chinese new year, the saints in the church in Chefoo made preparations to preach the gospel to their relatives, neighbors, and friends. The last night of the year, which was a time of feasting according to Chinese custom, was for us a time of fasting and prayer. Then the next day, the first day of the year, we came together with our relatives, friends, and neighbors for the preaching of the gospel. That gospel preaching was carried on with much prayer. As I was preaching in the meeting hall, many saints were in different rooms praying until the message was over. The power we experienced in our gospel preaching came from such prayer. I told my friend in Chefoo that we trust in prayer, not in tongue-speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyepKDvGoxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> In my talk with this brother, I went on to give him two further reasons for our power. I told him that our power is not only through prayer but also in the Word. We do not preach any strange or peculiar things. On the contrary, our preaching is according to the word in the Bible. This word is the truth, and the truth is prevailing. There is power in every word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo4nCpOtUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> We preach only the Word, not Chinese ethics or philosophy. Furthermore, instead of using many stories in our speaking, we mainly preach Christ according to the revelation in the Scriptures. Because God’s word is powerful, we have power in our gospel preaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZkYecDIDnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> I also told this brother that our power is in the Spirit and not in tongue-speaking. We believe that we have the Spirit within us and also upon us. Because we have the Spirit within us and upon us, we have power. Our power, therefore, is in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2aawJ38mCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> At this juncture I would like to give you a testimony of what happened one day as I was speaking in Chefoo. I had the sense at a certain point that I was in a certain kind of <span class="pg" data-page-id="428" id="428">[428]</span> atmosphere that had come upon me. Then I began to realize that my speaking was altogether out from the genuine power of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_Z_NyMEyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> Whether or not the power in gospel preaching can be sensed by us is not important. What is vital is that in our gospel preaching we have genuine power. </p>
<p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paXXKYr-94ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> Along with the elders of the church in Chefoo, I had a definite experience of the Lord’s power during a revival that was taking place in the church in 1942. Many of the saints requested the laying on of hands. We laid hands on them one by one and also prayed for each one. In approximately an hour we prayed for more than two hundred saints. The prayer that was uttered during that time was actually one long prayer that continually bubbled forth. What is significant was that the prayer for each saint exactly fit the situation of that saint. Suddenly the prayer ceased, and we did not lay hands on anyone else. All the attendants at that meeting realized that what had taken place was truly a move of the Spirit and that we could not repeat it. I give this as a further illustration of the fact that our trust for power is in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSXiOcBRc9bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057"> As we seek to have power and impact in our gospel preaching, we should not follow any strange or peculiar way. Let us take the way of prayer, the way of the Word, and the way of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG_ck57Mk8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> We believe that today the Lord is the processed Spirit who dwells in us and also upon us. It does not matter whether this Spirit is sensed by us. We believe that while we are serving Him and speaking for Him, especially as we are speaking Him forth, He is with us. We have the Lord’s presence within us as the anointing. Through prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, we can have true power and impact. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip-NTJWid8Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF"> I practiced tongue-speaking for a year and a half. The more I spoke in tongues, the less power I had. Eventually, I discontinued that practice and came back to the regular way of prayer. Although I did not have much time to kneel down and pray, all day long I had a praying spirit. From experience I can testify that prayer brings in power. <span class="pg" data-page-id="429" id="429">[429]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tBzdIiii-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf"> Furthermore, throughout the years my ministry has always been with the Word. During the years I have been preaching and teaching in this country, I have cared only for the Word. The Word is inexhaustible, and the Word is power. </p>

<p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2VUff51tqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77060" data-verses="Acts 18:25">18:25</span>, Apollos knew only the baptism of John. This indicates that Apollos did not have a complete revelation of God’s New Testament economy, although he <span class="pg" data-page-id="434" id="434">[434]</span> was instructed in the way of the Lord. Hence, there was a deficiency in the result of his ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77061" data-verses="Acts 19:2">19:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="SX_7dMl2HfxSBERUtGATfNrFHdrM23w5gIng7aE_LX2argmuVZZVL0WFlWju6AxQa"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77062" data-verses="Acts 18:26">Verse 26</span> continues, “And this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to themselves and expounded the way of God to him more accurately.” In Acts “the way” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77063" data-verses="Acts 9:2">9:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77064" data-verses="Acts 19:9">19:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77065" data-verses="Acts 19:23">23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77066" data-verses="Acts 22:4">22:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77067" data-verses="Acts 24:14">24:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77068" data-verses="Acts 24:22">22</span>) denotes the Lord’s full salvation in God’s New Testament economy. It is the way God dispenses Himself into the believers through Christ’s redemption and the Spirit’s anointing; it is the way the believers partake of God and enjoy God; it is the way the believers worship God in their spirit by enjoying Him and follow the persecuted Jesus by being one with Him; and it is the way the believers are brought into the church and built up into the Body of Christ to bear the testimony of Jesus. </p>

This grace is just God Himself in Christ as the portion to the believers in Christ. As we have pointed out elsewhere, this grace is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77071" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>) to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply so that we may live in resurrection.

Not only was he pious and godly like Gamaliel; he also knew the way of the Lord. However, although Apollos knew the Lord’s way, he did not know God’s economy in full. <span class="pg" data-page-id="435" id="435">[435]</span> This lack of knowledge is indicated by the fact that he knew only the baptism of John. Of course, John the Baptist testified to the Lord, and Apollos received the Lord and knew the way of the Lord to a certain extent. The Lord’s New Testament way had been in practice for many years, but Apollos did not know God’s economy further than the ministry of John the Baptist. Apollos was very knowledgeable in the Scriptures and was regarded as a great teacher, yet in his knowledge of the Lord’s move he had not gone further than the ministry of John the Baptist. </p>
<p data-content-id="tGyva9892obRbw9l-I_IUTfOIjFQhBT0AQQVTHyEChz0auSMkGYTRa1jagwpmuJyF"> There is a lesson for us to learn from the case of Apollos in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77073" data-verses="Acts 18:1">Acts 18</span>. We may think that we are in the way of the Lord, but we may not actually be up-to-date with the Lord’s move. We may not have the vision concerning His present move on earth. Apollos was good, scriptural, and powerful in expounding the Word, yet he was backward concerning the Lord’s move. This is the situation among many Christians today. They love the Lord and they know the Scriptures to some extent, but they are not up-to-date in the Lord’s move. During my Christian life I have met a number of saints like this. These saints did not realize that the Lord had gone on further in His move. Their vision fell short of the Lord’s move. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB_tSql1mKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> As we consider the case of Apollos, we all need to humble ourselves and empty our spirit. The Lord Jesus said, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77074" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">Matt. 5:3</span>). To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble but also to be emptied in our spirit, emptied in the depths of our being. Many of the Jewish leaders knew of God’s move in the Old Testament, but they did not see that God intended to have a new start for His New Testament economy. These religious leaders were full in their spirit. Therefore, the Lord Jesus pointed out that we all need to be poor in our spirit. We need to be poor in spirit so that we may see the Lord’s up-to-date move. </p>
<p data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqIyzb8BUdJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5"> If we read through the Bible carefully, we shall see that from the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77075" data-verses="Genesis 4:1">Genesis 4</span> onward the Lord has been moving step by step. He moved in a particular way at the time of <span class="pg" data-page-id="436" id="436">[436]</span> Enosh and Enoch; in another way at the time of Noah; and in still other ways at the time of Abraham, Moses, David, Elijah, and Zechariah.

And they said to him, No, we have not even heard if there is a Holy Spirit.” Here we see the deficiency in the result of Apollos’ ministry, which lacked a complete revelation of God’s New Testament economy. Although Apollos was very good, there was a deficiency in the result of his ministry, and this caused a problem. Therefore, when Paul came to Ephesus, it was necessary for him to fill up the deficiency in the ministry of Apollos. </p>

<p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4Eynh3j1Mg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> Paul’s purpose in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77125" data-verses="Acts 19:21">19:21</span> was to carry out his loving concern for the need of the poor saints in Jerusalem. At this time he was at Ephesus on his third ministry journey, busy with a heavy burden to carry out his ministry in Asia (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77126" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:8-9">1 Cor. 16:8-9</span>) and in Macedonia and Achaia (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77127" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:5-7">1 Cor. 16:5-7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77128" data-verses="Acts 20:1-3">Acts 20:1-3</span>). Nonetheless, he still had a burden to spare a part of his time for the needy saints in Jerusalem. When he came to Corinth and wrote his Epistle to the saints in Rome, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="442" id="442">[442]</span> expressed his purpose in this concern and begged them to pray for him concerning this purpose (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77129" data-verses="Romans 15:25-31">Rom. 15:25-31</span>). Although Paul was an apostle set apart by God for the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77130" data-verses="Acts 22:21">Acts 22:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77131" data-verses="Galatians 2:8">Gal. 2:8</span>), he was still concerned for the Lord’s interest among the Jews. His primary concern was for the Body of Christ universally, not merely for his part of the New Testament ministry among the Gentiles. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_Y9NyMGyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> Besides this, Paul’s purpose in going to Jerusalem at this juncture might also have been to fellowship with James and the other apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning the Judaic influence upon the church there. The decision made by the conference of the apostles and elders in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77132" data-verses="Acts 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> to resolve the problem concerning circumcision should not have been fully satisfactory to Paul according to his teachings in the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans. This should have troubled him because of his concern for God’s New Testament economy to build up the Body of Christ. After Paul arrived at Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77133" data-verses="Acts 21:17-18">21:17-18</span>), James’ word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77134" data-verses="Acts 21:20-22">21:20-22</span> and his proposal to him to participate in the four Jewish believers’ Nazarite vow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77135" data-verses="Acts 21:23-24">21:23-24</span>) seem to confirm this view. </p>

Because the Lord the Spirit dwelt in Paul’s spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77137" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77138" data-verses="Romans 8:10-11">Rom. 8:10-11</span>), he must have purposed according to the leading of the Lord the Spirit. Paul’s human spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77139" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zech. 12:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77140" data-verses="Job 32:8">Job 32:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77141" data-verses="Proverbs 20:27">Prov. 20:27</span>) was regenerated by the Spirit of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77142" data-verses="John 3:6">John 3:6</span>) and indwelt by the Lord the Spirit. Paul’s spirit witnessed with the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77143" data-verses="Romans 8:16">Rom. 8:16</span>), and in his spirit he worshipped God and served Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77144" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77145" data-verses="Romans 1:9">Rom. 1:9</span>). </p>

Paul did go to Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77146" data-verses="Acts 21:17">21:17</span>), and he did see Rome (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77147" data-verses="Acts 28:14">28:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77148" data-verses="Acts 28:16">16</span>). Paul’s desire to see Rome was fulfilled by the Lord bringing him to Rome through his appealing to Caesar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77149" data-verses="Acts 23:11">23:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77150" data-verses="Acts 25:11">25:11</span>). </p>

It was a difficult time because the Jews were opposing him and even seeking to kill him. But it was an excellent time in that the door had been opened for Paul to gain many for the Lord. Concerning this time, Paul says, “I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost; for a door is opened to me, great and operative, and many are opposing” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77152" data-verses="1Corinthians 16:8-9">1 Cor. 16:8-9</span>). These words to the church in Corinth were written in Ephesus, where Paul stayed for three years on the third journey of his ministry. Therefore, the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77153" data-verses="Acts 19:21">19:21</span> was crucial; it was both a time of opposition and of great opportunity to carry out a fruitful work for the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tAxdIhjC-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf"> The fact that Paul purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem indicates that he was absolutely for the Body of Christ. Because he was for the Body, he was very concerned about Jerusalem. From this we see that Paul certainly was a qualified vessel to bear the testimony of God’s New Testament economy. Paul bore this testimony in an up-to-date way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ayDvwYGbF8kWY5F_9HFvXRTv6UiHZVamrMqmbhtFN96IRxElNLGJfnroptl9R0_TX">PAUL’S BURDEN FOR JERUSALEM</h2><p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IV3Udo-38Fq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> At a time when Paul was in a very difficult situation and also had an excellent opportunity to carry out God’s New Testament economy, he purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem. Although he was very much occupied with his work in Ephesus, his spirit was burdened for Jerusalem. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77154" data-verses="Romans 15:25-31">Romans 15:25-31</span>, we shall see that Paul was burdened to bring financial help from the churches in Macedonia and Achaia to the poor saints in Judea. Paul also refers to this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77155" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:1">2 Corinthians 8</span>, where he indicates that the giving of material things is altogether a matter of grace. Therefore, Paul’s purpose in going to Jerusalem was apparently to minister to the needy saints. Actually, Paul had a deeper reason for purposing in spirit to go to Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="q56ADhFm7_LcIoAPH1hFRjUPM8WaUIO8_vrnKMCsdpFo2iQHQ7PItJoxf0tRnNi13"> I believe that from the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77156" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> Paul did not have peace concerning the situation in Jerusalem. If we study the book of Acts and all of Paul’s Epistles, we shall have a clear view of the Lord’s move on earth in His New Testament economy. The Lord’s move started from Jerusalem and eventually reached Antioch. The “flow” of the Lord’s move went <span class="pg" data-page-id="444" id="444">[444]</span> from Jerusalem to Antioch, and turned from Antioch to the Gentile world. However, the source, the “spring,” of this flow in Jerusalem had been “poisoned.” Since the source was poisoned, the poison would be carried by the flow wherever it went. This was the reason Paul could not be at peace concerning the situation in Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="yOYKz1RRk0YVQ9GDaqgAsbkC2xIcaMrEmSNYGfSmuuL0gRLldZ5UBQtK-b9YuTg7p"> It is likely that Paul had the burden to help Peter and James to improve or adjust the situation in the church at Jerusalem. The situation there was one of mixture—a mixture of God’s New Testament economy with the things of the Old Testament dispensation. As we have seen, this mixture is evident in James’ fellowship in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77157" data-verses="Acts 15:13-21">15:13-21</span>. As we shall see, the mixture of God’s New Testament economy with the old dispensation is very obvious in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77158" data-verses="Acts 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> of Acts. This mixture was very offensive to the Lord. Realizing that the problem still existed in Jerusalem, Paul was not at peace about the church there. </p>
<p data-content-id="8hEVLiYPHPDrLKUUHPBp-0sIdV-olxt5lp8YViQRgoFO6adHYqE9Xo2xECC72P9rr"> We have seen that at the end of his second journey of ministry Paul went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church there (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77159" data-verses="Acts 18:22">18:22</span>). He made this trip to Jerusalem because he always endeavored to maintain the oneness of the Body and to keep a pleasant feeling between him and the saints in Jerusalem. From this we see that whenever there was an opportunity Paul would go to Jerusalem to visit the church in order to keep a pleasant relationship between him and the church and also to seek to render some help to the situation there. Because Paul was concerned for Jerusalem, he purposed in spirit, in spite of the difficult and promising situation he was in, to go to Jerusalem. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="01ti1r4uNODePuwq_Ete8xCbcI0Asch_5CI1PAYjW-KfNYvtApOjUcBbYG5vhQyHY">A BROADENED HEART FOR THE LORD’S INTEREST</h2><p data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAdkL-Moqjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77160" data-verses="Acts 19:21">Acts 19:21</span> indicates that Paul had a broadened heart for the Lord’s interest. As he was encountering attack at Ephesus and carrying on his ministry, he still purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, and from there he was eager to go to Rome. Concerning this, he said, “I must also see Rome.” If you consult a map, you will see that Ephesus, in Asia Minor, was midway between Jerusalem to the east and Rome <span class="pg" data-page-id="445" id="445">[445]</span> to the west. While Paul was laboring and facing attack at Ephesus, he had the heart to care for the situation in Jerusalem and also to see Rome. What largeness of heart Paul had! </p>
<p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsMlsLLofGFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> Not many of us have such a large heart. Rather, often those who are laboring in a certain place will say, “I am very busy here. I do not have the heart to care for any other place. Furthermore, I am facing much opposition. How can I have the burden for other places?” </p>

The craftsmen were concerned that their business would come into disrepute (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77172" data-verses="Acts 19:27">v. 27</span>). As a result, there was a great disturbance. Those whom Demetrius had assembled became full of rage and “they kept crying out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians! And the city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus of Macedonia, Paul’s traveling companions” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77173" data-verses="Acts 19:28-29">vv. 28-29</span>). The Gaius mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77174" data-verses="Acts 19:29">verse 29</span> was not the Gaius of Derbe in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77175" data-verses="Acts 20:4">20:4</span>, nor the Gaius of Corinth in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77176" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77177" data-verses="Romans 16:23">Romans 16:23</span>, nor the Gaius addressed by John in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77178" data-verses="3John 1:1">3 John 1</span>. The name Gaius was very common at the time. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlp6L1IJzOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX">Causing Trouble through a Prevailing Ministry</h2><p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT54DaX1qVfvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77179" data-verses="Acts 19:23-41">Acts 19:23-41</span> we see an important principle. This principle is that if we stay in a locality for a longer time we should have a prevailing ministry, a ministry that is able to stir up others. In a sense, when Paul was in Ephesus he was a troublemaker. Before he arrived, the city was peaceful, worshipping the idol of Artemis. But Paul’s presence in Ephesus eventually caused a great disturbance. He did not attack Artemis by name. On the contrary, he carried on a prevailing ministry, and that ministry stirred up the entire city, affecting the society. This indicates that if we stay in a particular place, our ministry should be so prevailing that it stirs up the situation there in the right way. </p>
<p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDVIhtvW41r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77180" data-verses="Acts 19:23-41">19:23-41</span> we have another pattern—the pattern of causing trouble through a prevailing ministry. If we follow this pattern, we shall cause trouble through the prevailing <span class="pg" data-page-id="451" id="451">[451]</span> preaching of the gospel. Before we come to a certain place, the people may live peacefully and worship idols. But after we stay there for a period of time, the city may be in a turmoil because of our prevailing ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="1jNZ3Y6RNXScv8-BlixPHwEFaFzfAIRX4Bba-Y8mPL_tBBhV44go-Yxey-xe-DJIo"> Certain matters relating to the disturbance in Ephesus are almost laughable. We are told that “some cried out one thing and some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know for what cause they had come together” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77181" data-verses="Acts 19:32">v. 32</span>). Furthermore, “some of the crowd focused on Alexander, the Jews having pushed him forward; and Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the populace. But when they realized that he was a Jew, one voice arose from all for about two hours, crying out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77182" data-verses="Acts 19:33-34">vv. 33-34</span>). Probably Alexander was not a convert of Paul’s preaching. Neither was he the Alexander in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77183" data-verses="1Timothy 1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77184" data-verses="2Timothy 4:14">2 Timothy 4:14</span>. Concerning the disturbance, the townclerk said, “For indeed we are in danger of being charged with insurrection concerning today’s affairs, there being no cause for it; and with reference to it we shall not be able to give an account concerning this disorderly gathering” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77185" data-verses="Acts 19:40">v. 40</span>). From these verses we see how great was the turmoil caused by Paul’s prevailing ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="9B3GelIP98ERinHYvtq7LX0V_Tl3VD5C0GrAN_47CuFPIXBZ0UnuKxTnHsaPni2Fg"> When some read the account of the disturbance in Ephesus, they may say, “When I go to a place to work for the Lord, I do not want to see such turmoil.” Nevertheless, if your work is truly prevailing, eventually this prevailingness will touch the heart of the power of darkness. In Ephesus the heart of the power of darkness was the temple of the goddess Artemis. The more the Ephesians became believers in the Lord, the less influence this temple had. Apparently, the disturbance was caused by certain craftsmen. Actually, it was stirred up by the demons who were behind the scene. </p>
<p data-content-id="jHPCvHM6AJL14sHMpM3v4rpZKdllursp8MnQXFHjxCUMf5qoYcCmTHDm7GFZatUid"> Our ministry is to propagate the resurrected Christ as God’s kingdom. But today every city is the kingdom of the Devil. Hence, the prevailing ministry for the propagation of Christ is a fighting, a battle, for God’s kingdom. The whole earth is the kingdom of darkness. If we are very kind and <span class="pg" data-page-id="452" id="452">[452]</span> gentle in carrying out our work, seeking to please everyone, no opposition will be stirred up, no matter how long we stay in a certain place. If our ministry is truly prevailing, there is bound to be opposition. </p>
<p data-content-id="T-2PL0pYEh4xbDc25gPnQOxuN30o1T5sQX2Xs2X0xJS4o-7h7OkAAU9bwEGWRJ0lt"> However, we should not do anything in ourselves to stir up trouble, thinking that this is a proof that our ministry is powerful and prevailing. It is terrible to do such a thing, for that will be used by the power of darkness. Then instead of being part of the propagation of Christ for God’s kingdom, we shall in a practical way be a part of the kingdom of darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVcYoWrqPMnLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd"> We all need to realize that a battle is raging between God and Satan. Therefore, we need to be certain that whatever we do is absolutely on the side of the kingdom of God and that nothing is involved with the kingdom of darkness. </p>
<p data-content-id="63PjdVBPG51GyPm3SUGqLeGT1y1Uj-ESJwos787hQjcxafhitczkEPKKkKzBqHe70"> Because of the battle raging between God and Satan, we should be prepared for the enemy’s attack. If we carry on a prevailing ministry, eventually we shall be attacked. The demonic “arrows” will be aimed at us. However, instead of being dismayed by this, we, like Paul, should be encouraged. </p>
<p data-content-id="Rk893wdUx5BEGaMPL8kI_k_Y9RUXWC8S9x4OY1mdzGmnzTwz2JfO8yuVuuay8b7Zz"> Paul was strong in confronting attack. He did not flee from that demonic uproar in Ephesus. In fact, he even intended to go in to the populace, but the disciples would not allow him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77186" data-verses="Acts 19:30">v. 30</span>). “And some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent to him and entreated him not to venture into the theater himself” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77187" data-verses="Acts 19:31">v. 31</span>). These Asiarchs were principal persons of the province of Asia. Here we see that even Paul’s friends in the political circle were concerned for his safety. If Paul had ventured into the theater, the Jews who were opposing him may have seized the opportunity to kill him. </p>
<p data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDu9sdh0Mw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77188" data-verses="Acts 19:35-41">Acts 19:35-41</span> describes how the crowd was quieted. After the townclerk addressed the crowd, he dismissed the assembly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77189" data-verses="Acts 19:41">v. 41</span>). This was the sovereignty of the Lord to preserve His apostle from the demonic uproar. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4EyXh8xlMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ">The Lord’s Sovereign Preservation of Paul</h2><p data-content-id="LilxD0znUWS-9v8365n0WAvuzl4KnJ-MfefbTNnzPPig5LWJWb9boygxWo-Q9W1s_"> In his ministry Paul was constantly fighting against the <span class="pg" data-page-id="453" id="453">[453]</span> power of darkness. As we have pointed out, the power of darkness was behind the idol worship in Ephesus. Humanly speaking, there was no reason for the people in Ephesus to behave so foolishly, crying out without knowing what they were doing. Their behavior was provoked by demons. The demons in the idol worshippers instigated them to do something against God’s propagating ministry. It was of the Lord’s sovereignty that this disturbance took place at the end of Paul’s three-year stay in that city. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77190" data-verses="Acts 20:1">20:1</span> tells us, “after the uproar had ceased, Paul, having sent for the disciples and encouraged them, took leave of them and went off to go into Macedonia.” </p>

When they came to him, he said, “You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time, serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears and trials which came upon me by the plots of the Jews; how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77233" data-verses="Acts 20:18-20">vv. 18-20</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77234" data-verses="Acts 20:20">verse 20</span> Paul says that he did not shrink from declaring to the saints in Ephesus anything that was profitable, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77235" data-verses="Acts 20:27">verse 27</span> he says that he did not shrink from declaring to them all the counsel of God. These verses refer to Paul’s three years of teaching in Ephesus and indicate the extent of his teaching. <span class="pg" data-page-id="460" id="460">[460]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="q56ADhFm7_LcIoAPH1BFRhUPM8WaUIO8_vrnKMCsdpFo2iQHQ7PItJoxf0tRnNi13"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77236" data-verses="Acts 20:20">verse 20</span>, Paul taught the saints in Ephesus both publicly and from house to house. This indicates that at Paul’s time there were home meetings. Not only did Paul teach publicly in a larger meeting place; he also taught from house to house. This indicates that the churches had small meetings in the homes as well as large meetings in a public place. </p>

Testifying requires experiences of seeing, participating, and enjoying. It is different from mere teaching. Paul’s use of this word here indicates that he himself had experienced repentance unto God and faith in the Lord Jesus. Therefore, he could testify concerning what he had experienced. He did not merely preach and teach; he testified of what he had passed through in his experience of repentance and faith. </p>

Due to the Jews’ plot against him, he changed his route northward to Macedonia, and from there he returned to Jerusalem. Paul was aware of and suffering from the plots of the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77241" data-verses="Acts 20:19">v. 19</span>). This was possibly the cause of his being bound in spirit to go to Jerusalem. The spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77242" data-verses="Acts 20:22">verse 22</span> refers to Paul’s regenerated spirit, in which he served God. In his spirit, a spirit joined to the Lord the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77243" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>), Paul sensed beforehand that something would happen to him in Jerusalem, and the Holy Spirit testified this to him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77244" data-verses="Acts 20:23">v. 23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsMlMLIp_GFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> Paul knew that trouble was waiting for him. He realized this in his spirit. The Jews throughout the area around the Mediterranean Sea were plotting to seize him. Not only <span class="pg" data-page-id="461" id="461">[461]</span> those in Jerusalem but also those in Asia and in Macedonia and Achaia were determined to apprehend him. It may have been that they all were working together and had a joint plot. Eventually, in his last visit to Jerusalem, Paul was caught by some Jews who had come to Jerusalem from Asia Minor. </p>
<p data-content-id="BilurL5ZLQlrHWKISmTz1G5h9vFlZ1Q5wQMvMWFVtrzb8Mwh9qfCXa7xfx0tDifjG"> Aware of the plot of the Jews, Paul, in a very real sense, had nowhere to go. If he went to Asia Minor, the Jews were there. If he went to Macedonia and Achaia, the Jews were there. If he went back to Judea, the Jews were there all the more. How, then, could he not be bound? Where was he to go? We need to understand Paul’s situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1cuV7w7bkEn3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp"> It was not by doing something wrong that Paul stirred up the opposition of the Jews. Rather, their opposition was stirred up by his being faithful to God’s New Testament economy; it was provoked by his obedience to the heavenly vision. Simply because Paul was faithful to the vision he had received from the Lord concerning God’s New Testament economy, there was opposition to him wherever he went. </p>
<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQT62cYyx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> Neither James nor Peter faced the kind of opposition Paul did. James was compromising, and Peter was somewhat weak. Actually, since Peter’s ministry began before Paul’s, he should have stirred up the opposition of the Jews. However, that was not the case with Peter. No doubt, Peter suffered. But his suffering came from the outsiders, whereas Paul’s suffering came from insiders as well as outsiders. </p>
<p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGVOzd2YozY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> If we read carefully <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77245" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span>, we shall see that even James and Peter were both a cause of suffering to Paul. In writing the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul was frank. He told them that he had even rebuked Peter to his face. Peter would not have needed that rebuke if he had been faithful. If Peter had been faithful, he would have shared a great deal of Paul’s sufferings. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-Ci1tdN8ORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> In saying this about Peter I am not belittling him. It was very difficult to stand against the heavy Judaic atmosphere in Jerusalem. As we shall see, when Paul went to Jerusalem for the last time, even he was subdued by the atmosphere there. Although he had written the books of <span class="pg" data-page-id="462" id="462">[462]</span> Galatians and Romans, he still agreed to take part with those who had made a vow and agreed to go to the temple to be purified. </p>
<p data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3GzcEvdc3s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn"> The atmosphere in Jerusalem was so heavy and strong that no one could withstand it. Both Peter and James were defeated by it. Peter was defeated by not doing anything about the situation, and James was defeated by compromising with the situation. As we shall see, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77246" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> James said strongly to Paul that in Jerusalem there were many thousands among the Jews who believed and who were all zealous for the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77247" data-verses="Acts 21:20">21:20</span>). This indicates that those believers were strongly under the Judaic influence, mixing God’s New Testament economy with the Old Testament dispensation. If we consider this matter, we shall realize that Paul was in a very difficult situation. </p>

The Holy Spirit’s testifying was only a prophecy, a foretelling, not a charge. Hence, he should not have taken this as a command but as a warning. Although Paul did not know exactly what was awaiting in Jerusalem, he knew, through the warning of the Holy Spirit, that bonds and afflictions awaited him. </p>
<p data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKfsE9-uDzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77250" data-verses="Acts 20:24">verse 24</span> Paul continues, “But I consider my life of no account as if it were precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify the gospel of the grace of God.” Paul’s word here is related to the Lord’s New Testament move in propagating the resurrected Christ through the gospel. <span class="pg" data-page-id="463" id="463">[463]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWA-Zrv1Q5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77251" data-verses="Acts 20:24">20:24</span> the Greek word rendered “life” also means soul. Paul’s word in this verse implies that he sensed that he would be martyred. </p>

Whenever we purchase something, we acquire it, or obtain it. God acquired, obtained, the church by purchasing it. In order to purchase anything, we need to pay the price for that thing. What was the price God paid to purchase the church? According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77287" data-verses="Acts 20:28">20:28</span>, God obtained the church by paying the price of “His own blood.” </p>

It is quite bothering. Can God have blood? God is God; He is not a man or a creature. How, then, can God, the Creator, have blood? </p>
<p data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1cuULwzI0En3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp"> Some may try to explain this by saying that the blood in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77289" data-verses="Acts 20:28">20:28</span> is the blood of Jesus. But how can Jesus’ blood be God’s blood? The Lord Jesus is God, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77290" data-verses="Acts 20:28">20:28</span> does not speak of Jesus; this verse speaks of God.

<p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4Ez3h_wFMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> In this hymn Wesley goes on to say, “Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!” Here Wesley declares that God died for us. When I was translating this hymn into Chinese years ago, I was troubled by this. I was not sure whether to be so bold as to translate it literally to indicate that God died for us. Do you have the boldness to say that God died for you? Charles Wesley saw the vision concerning this and declared in his hymn that God died for us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LilxD0znUWS-9v8364H0VAPuzl4KnJ-MfefbTNnzPPig5LWJWb9boygxWo-Q9W1s_">THE GOD-MAN</h2><p data-content-id="mlcLhH-3w5KZuNDv6y9vCfSzmtunqHXxKV7NNVCdEbwgO3dnwE5vpipW8E4hgdOFK"> The God who died for us is not the God before incarnation. Prior to incarnation, God certainly did not have blood, and He could not have died for us. It was after the incarnation, in which God was mingled with humanity, that He died for us. Through incarnation, our God, the Creator, the eternal One, Jehovah, became mingled with man. As a result, He was no longer only God—He became a God-man. As the God-man, He surely had blood and was able to die for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuGjIAnEo5IafG53rBFe39ypiGKgO2xOWEc6_4BynTJX3LLZmIC9oRziJLF_biW7b"> When the God-man died on the cross, He died not only as man but also as God. The One who died on the cross was the One who had been conceived of God and born with God. Because He was a God-man, the very element of God was in Him. The divine element was mingled with His humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="AY-SUR-EoOuNw4w4fgaDJg70E3N7TuSXEOTbw_G2bv_OjbWVvXlpJAskEmK1oKtQB"> In the conception of the Lord Jesus, the God-man, the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77291" data-verses="Matthew 1:18-20">Matt. 1:18-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77292" data-verses="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</span>) was generated in Mary’s womb. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature and produced the God-man, One who is both the complete God and a perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively, without a third nature being produced. This is the most wonderful and excellent Person of Jesus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="469" id="469">[469]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97mYi_U7vK6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq"> The conception and birth of the Lord Jesus was God’s incarnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77293" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>), constituted of the divine essence added to the human essence, hence, producing the God-man of two natures—divinity and humanity. Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77294" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Tim. 3:16</span>) and might be the Savior (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77295" data-verses="Luke 2:11">Luke 2:11</span>) who died and shed His blood for us. </p>

As human beings, we need genuine human blood for our redemption. Because He was a man, the Lord Jesus could fulfill this requirement. As a man, He shed human blood to redeem fallen human beings. The Lord is also the Son of God, even God Himself. Therefore, with His blood there is the element of eternity, and this element ensures the eternal efficacy of His blood. Therefore, as a man He had genuine human blood, and as God He has the element that gives to His blood eternal efficacy. </p>
<p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBMQd1Wk2nHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77296" data-verses="1John 1:7">First John 1:7</span> says that “the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.” The name “Jesus” denotes the Lord’s humanity, which was needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title “His Son” denotes the Lord’s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, “the blood of Jesus His Son” indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man for redeeming God’s fallen creatures with the divine surety for its eternal efficacy, an efficacy which is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time. </p>
<p data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBdpaD33QHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa"> The blood the Lord shed on the cross was the blood of Jesus, the Son of God. It was not only the blood of Jesus; it was also the blood of the Son of God. For this reason, the redemption accomplished by the God-man, by the One mingled with God, is eternal. </p>
<p data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGnAc6vJXUZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L"> If the redemption accomplished on the cross was accomplished merely by a man, that redemption could not be eternally effective. Although it might be effective for the redemption of one person, it would not be effective for <span class="pg" data-page-id="470" id="470">[470]</span> the redemption of millions of believers. Since a man is limited, a particular man cannot die for millions of others. However, although man is limited, God is not limited. Likewise, although man is temporal, God is eternal. Therefore, in Christ’s redemption there is the eternal and unlimited element of God. This is the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77297" data-verses="Hebrews 9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span> this redemption is called an eternal redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyeoJTvFoRqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> We need to see that the blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross is eternal blood.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77298" data-verses="Acts 20:28">Acts 20:28</span> Paul had the boldness to speak of this blood as being God’s own blood. </p>

The Jewish concept of God is that God is God and that there is no human element in Him. But according to the Bible, the very God in the Old Testament has become the God revealed in the New Testament. In the Old Testament God was merely God, without any human element. But in the New Testament we see the God-man. Through incarnation the God in the Old Testament put on human nature and became the God-man. As such, He became God manifested in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77299" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Tim. 3:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2bZgJ0_GCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> God became the God-man by being conceived in the womb of a human virgin and then being born of that virgin. In this way the human element was added to His divine element. However, this does not mean that as the God-man the Savior has two persons. No, the Lord Jesus, the Savior, has one person with two natures—the divine nature and the human nature. Although this is very difficult to understand, it is nevertheless a fact revealed in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_Y8dyOGyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> Now we can see that our God is the God revealed in the New Testament and not merely the God as He is revealed in the Old Testament. The Jews, however, have God only as He is seen in the Old Testament. What is the difference between the Jewish God and our God? The difference is that the <span class="pg" data-page-id="471" id="471">[471]</span> Jewish God is merely God without a human element, whereas, according to the New Testament, our God is no longer merely God—He is a God-man. Our God has two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. This means that our God, the God-man, is both the complete God and a perfect man. However, He is not two persons; rather, the God-man is one person. </p>
<p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paWUaYp894ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> Although we have always believed and taught that the God-man, Jesus Christ, is one person with the divine nature and the human nature and that He is both the complete God and a perfect man, certain opposers have falsely accused us of teaching that Christ was neither fully God nor fully man. They accuse us of saying that the two natures, the divine nature and the human nature, are mingled in Christ to produce a third nature. This accusation is utterly false and baseless, and we repudiate it. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77314" data-verses="Acts 20:29">verse 29</span>, Paul did not care for his own life, but he was very much concerned for the future of the church, which was a treasure to him as well as to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="GKyQWo5hWTLmBf9JZjiBeqG1c46e937yRP_pDDoKx7RxQqXYuUV78sCkWbNBL0DfD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77315" data-verses="Acts 20:30">verse 30</span> Paul goes on to say, “And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.” The perverted ones among the believers in the church are always used by the Devil, who hates the church, to draw the sheep away to form another “flock.” </p>
<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQT7WcYwx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> During our many years in the church life, we have experienced both the wolves and the perverted ones. The wolves come from outside the church, and the perverted ones rise up from inside the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGVPTd2aozY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> When perverted ones rise up in the church, we may think that this indicates that we have not been careful in our work and that we have brought inside seed that has produced perverted ones. Many of us would think this way whenever we <span class="pg" data-page-id="476" id="476">[476]</span> see perverted ones rising up. However, we may not have anything to do with the rising up of such ones. Consider Paul’s work in Ephesus. The church in Ephesus was raised up, established, and carried on by Paul’s ministry over a period of three years. To be sure, Paul did his work very carefully. Nevertheless, even Paul anticipated that certain ones would rise up to speak perverted things in order to draw away saints after themselves to form another “flock.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-CjVteNcORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> One of the Lord’s parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77316" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> speaks of the sowing of tares among the wheat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77317" data-verses="Matthew 13:24-30">vv. 24-30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77318" data-verses="Matthew 13:36-43">36-43</span>). I have studied this parable for years, trying to understand where the tares come from. Some might say that seeds producing tares are blown in by the wind. Although I do not know where the tares come from, I know that wherever the “wheat” is, there the “tares” will be also. This indicates that where the real believers are, there false believers will also be. This is unavoidable. It was unavoidable in Paul’s work, and it will be unavoidable in our work today. </p>
<p data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3Gy8Esd83s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn"> After working in Ephesus for three years, Paul warned the elders of the church there that wolves would come in among them and that certain ones would rise up to speak perverted things. We have seen this take place both in the Far East and the West. We should not expect that there will be wheat without tares. It is possible that in any local church certain perverted ones may rise up. When some hear this, they may say, “Oh, please don’t predict such a thing. Among the brothers and sisters in our locality there will never be any perverted ones.” Nevertheless, we need to receive Paul’s word. Although he did not know who the perverted ones would be, he predicted their rising up. </p>
<p data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjUlDEIt23Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77319" data-verses="Acts 20:30">verse 30</span>, the purpose of the perverted ones is to draw away the disciples after themselves. Their intention is to draw away the saints to form another “flock.” We have observed this over the years. We have seen that the intention of the perverted ones is to set apart a group of believers to become their following. Therefore, we should take heed to Paul’s word concerning wolves <span class="pg" data-page-id="477" id="477">[477]</span> entering in from without and perverted ones rising up from within. </p>

And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.” Here Paul commits the believers to God and to the word of His grace. Grace is the Triune God received and enjoyed by the believers. I believe that during the three years Paul was in Ephesus, he daily spoke the word of God’s grace to the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWA_5rs1w5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> We can testify that, by the Lord’s mercy, the word of God’s grace can be found in the Life-study Messages. Recently a young brother charged the young people in the Lord’s recovery to become constituted of all the riches of the Life-studies. I agree with this brother’s word. If the young people are constituted in this way, in the recovery there will be a great dispensational transfer. I would encourage the young people to take the time over the next several years to become constituted of all the Life-study Messages. If the young people are saturated with these messages in the coming years, saturated with the word concerning God’s New Testament economy, many will be useful in serving the Lord full time. They will be able to go to other cities and countries and convey to others God’s New Testament economy. This will cause the situation among today’s Christians to be transformed. In this way the riches in the Life-studies will become known to the entire Christian community. However, the main thing is that among us many living vessels are raised up and constituted of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh98tyV8QR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> We should not think that only the young people need to be constituted of the Life-study Messages.

First, this word is able to build up the saints. To build up the saints requires the growth in the divine life, and the growth in the divine life needs the nourishment of the divine element and the edification and equipment with the divine knowledge. All these can be afforded only by the word of God’s abundant grace, which is the Triune God Himself who went through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and who has been given to the saints for their enjoyment. </p>

This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77322" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>), who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77323" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Col. 1:12</span>). The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77324" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Rom. 8:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77325" data-verses="Ephesians 1:14">Eph. 1:14</span>), which we are sharing and enjoying today in God’s New Testament jubilee as the foretaste and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77326" data-verses="1Peter 1:4">1 Pet. 1:4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2VVPf61NqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> Our eternal inheritance is related to the divine life which we received through regeneration and which we are experiencing and enjoying through our entire Christian life. “This inheritance is the full possession of that which was promised to Abraham and all believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77327" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Gen. 12:3</span>; see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77328" data-verses="Galatians 3:6">Gal. 3:6ff</span>), an inheritance, as much higher than that which fell to the children of Israel in the possession of Canaan, as the sonship of the regenerate, who have already received the promise of the Spirit through faith as a pledge of their inheritance, is higher than the sonship of Israel: compare <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77329" data-verses="Galatians 3:18-29">Gal. 3:18-29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77330" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:9">1 Cor. 6:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77331" data-verses="Ephesians 5:5">Eph. 5:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77332" data-verses="Hebrews 9:15">Heb. 9:15</span>” (Wiesinger, quoted by Alford). </p>
<p data-content-id="SX_7dMl2HfxSBERUtHQTcMLFHdrM23w5gIng7aE_LX2argmuVZZVL0WFlWju6AxQa"> An inheritance is a proper and legal possession. It is not gained by our energy, ability, or deeds. On the contrary, it is <span class="pg" data-page-id="479" id="479">[479]</span> granted to us by another in a way that is legitimate. We do not work for an inheritance; we receive it. </p>
<p data-content-id="g8IXFe6HuOguESGghpQOgvkbyypS3PnQmdHqw5ICsa7V_yGT9Yi4eMOByQVLvj_dD"> On the day we were regenerated, we were given the right to share an inheritance. This inheritance includes all the blessings related to eternal life. Daily we need to take possession of this inheritance and enjoy it. This inheritance is legal, proper, and legitimate, for Christ died to purchase it for us, paying the price of His precious blood. Daily we may participate in and enjoy the inheritance that is ours today and for eternity. </p>

<p data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZrRlHi7sxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45"> After Paul’s solemn and precious fellowship with the elders of the church in Ephesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77347" data-verses="Acts 20:13-35">20:13-35</span>), “he knelt down with them all and prayed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77348" data-verses="Acts 20:36">20:36</span>). Eventually, they escorted Paul to the ship. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77349" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21:1</span> says, “Now it came about that when we parted from them and set sail, we took a straight course and came to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.” The Greek word translated “parted” may also be rendered “tore ourselves.” </p>
<p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc4cWprIgwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> At Patara Paul and his company found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board, and set sail (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77350" data-verses="Acts 21:2">v. 2</span>). They sailed to Syria and came down to Tyre. “And having sought out the disciples, we remained there seven days; and they told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77351" data-verses="Acts 21:4">v. 4</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77352" data-verses="Acts 20:23">20:23</span> the Holy Spirit made known to Paul that bonds and afflictions awaited him in Jerusalem. The Holy Spirit’s testifying concerning this was only a prophecy, a foretelling, not a charge. Therefore, Paul should have taken it not as a command but as a warning. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77353" data-verses="Acts 21:4">21:4</span> the Spirit took a further step to tell him, through some members of the Body, not to go to Jerusalem. In practicing the Body life, Paul should have taken this word and obeyed it as a word from the Head. </p>

And on the next day we went out and came to Caesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we remained with him.” Wherever Paul went he visited the brothers and stayed with them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77355" data-verses="Acts 21:4-7">vv. 4-7</span>). He was actually practicing the Body life of the church, living according to what he taught concerning the Body of Christ. </p>

And he came to us and took Paul’s girdle; and having bound his own feet and hands, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, In this way shall the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.” Here the Holy Spirit told Paul again, not directly but through a member of the Body, what would befall him in Jerusalem. This was again a warning in the nature of a prophecy, not a charge. It was again the Head speaking through the Body, which Paul should have listened to in the practice of the Body life. </p>

Here the Body, through many members, expressed its feeling, entreating Paul not to go to Jerusalem. But due to his strong will in being ready even to sacrifice his life for the Lord, he would not be persuaded. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77358" data-verses="Acts 21:13">verse 13</span> says, “Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” Since Paul would not be persuaded, the members of the Body were forced to leave this matter to the will of the Lord. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77359" data-verses="Acts 21:14">Verse 14</span> says, “And when he would not be persuaded, we were silent, having said, The will of the Lord be done.” </p>

<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyeoJzvGrxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77366" data-verses="Acts 21:18">21:18</span> we see that Paul went in to James. James was the central figure relating to the problem in Jerusalem, for he was a leader among the apostles and elders in Jerusalem. When Paul and his co-workers went in to see James, all the elders were present. This indicates that James was the leading one among the elders. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo5kypOuUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> After Paul greeted the elders, “he related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77367" data-verses="Acts 21:19">v. 19</span>). Paul wisely did not teach them, but instead presented the things God had done through his ministry. When they heard this, they glorified God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77368" data-verses="Acts 21:20">v. 20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZlbucAJjnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> Although the elders in Jerusalem glorified God for what He had done among the Gentiles through Paul’s ministry, they nevertheless went on to say to him, “You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous for the law.” The Greek word rendered “thousands” also means myriads, ten thousands. These myriads of the Jews who believed were all zealous for the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2bZAJ09GCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> The word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77369" data-verses="Acts 21:20">21:20</span> about thousands of believing Jews being zealous for the law indicates how the Jewish believers <span class="pg" data-page-id="488" id="488">[488]</span> in Jerusalem still kept the law of Moses, still remained in the Old Testament dispensation, and still were strongly under the Judaic influence, mixing God’s New Testament economy with the out-of-date economy of the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_Y89yPGSB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> James addressed his Epistle to “the twelve tribes in the dispersion” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77370" data-verses="James 1:1">James 1:1</span>), indicating that it was written to Christian Jews. However, to call these believers in Christ “the twelve tribes,” as God’s chosen people in His Old Testament economy, may indicate the lack of a clear view concerning the distinction between Christians and Jews, between God’s New Testament economy and the Old Testament dispensation. It may also indicate that James did not realize that God in the New Testament had delivered and separated the Jewish believers in Christ from the Jewish nation, which was then considered by God as a “crooked generation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77371" data-verses="Acts 2:40">Acts 2:40</span>). In His New Testament economy God no longer regards the Jewish believers as Jews for Judaism but as Christians for the church. Therefore, the Jewish believers, as the church of God, should be as distinct and separate from the Jews as from the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77372" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:32">1 Cor. 10:32</span>). Nevertheless, James, as a pillar of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77373" data-verses="Galatians 2:9">Gal. 2:9</span>), in his Epistle to the Christian brothers, still called them “the twelve tribes.” This was contrary to God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paWU6Yo8d4ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> In his Epistle James also uses the word “synagogue” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77374" data-verses="James 2:2">James 2:2</span>). The use of this word by James may indicate that the Jewish believers considered their assembly and assembling place as one of the synagogues among the Jews. James’ use of this word in his Epistle may indicate that the Jewish Christians regarded themselves as still a part of the Jewish nation, as the chosen people of God according to the Old Testament, and that they lacked a clear vision concerning the distinction between God’s chosen people of the Old Testament and the believers in Christ of the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSWh-cBQc9bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77375" data-verses="James 2:8-11">James 2:8-11</span> indicates that the Jewish believers at James’ time were still practicing the keeping of the Old Testament law. These verses correspond to the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77376" data-verses="Acts 21:20">Acts 21:20</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="489" id="489">[489]</span> spoken to Paul by James and the elders in Jerusalem concerning the zeal of the thousands among the Jews who believed for the law. James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers still remained in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law. They even advised Paul to practice such a semi-Judaic mixture (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77377" data-verses="Acts 21:20-26">21:20-26</span>). They were not aware that the dispensation of law was altogether over and that the dispensation of grace should be fully honored, and that any disregard of the distinction between these two dispensations would be contrary to God’s economical plan for the building up of the church as the expression of Christ. </p>

On the other hand, they pointed out to Paul that in Jerusalem thousands of Jews believed and were zealous for the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77408" data-verses="Acts 21:20">v. 20</span>). Furthermore, these believing Jews had been instructed concerning Paul that he taught “apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77409" data-verses="Acts 21:21">v. 21</span>). James and the elders went on to make the following requirement of Paul: “Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77410" data-verses="Acts 21:23-24">vv. 23-24</span>). As we have seen, the vow mentioned here is the Nazarite vow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77411" data-verses="Numbers 6:2-5">Num. 6:2-5</span>). To be purified with the Nazarites was to become a Nazarite with them, joining them in their vow. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVcYpGrif8nLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77412" data-verses="Acts 21:24">verse 24</span>, Paul was told to be purified with the four men who had a vow on themselves and to pay their <span class="pg" data-page-id="496" id="496">[496]</span> expenses. The first thing a Nazarite had to do was to purify himself in the presence of God. According to the custom at the time, the rich would often pay the expenses of the offerings needed for a Nazarite to complete his purification. Sometimes the poor Nazarites could not afford to pay for all the offerings. Thus, they needed someone to help them with the expenses. Those who helped the Nazarites in this way joined themselves to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh98NyV-QR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77413" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>, for Paul to be purified with the Nazarites and to pay their expenses was for him to be joined to them so that the four would then become five. In the words of James and the elders in Jerusalem, if Paul were to be purified with the Nazarites and pay their expenses, all the believing Jews would know that Paul himself also walked orderly, keeping the law. But was Paul keeping the law? He certainly was not keeping the law. Nevertheless, James and the elders told Paul to join himself to the four Nazarites so that the Jewish believers would see that he kept the law. This was a serious, terrible, and mistaken requirement made by James and the elders. </p>
<p data-content-id="GKyQWo5hWTLmBf9JZjCBW421c46e937yRP_pDDoKx7RxQqXYuUV78sCkWbNBL0DfD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77414" data-verses="Acts 21:25">21:25</span> James and the elders said to Paul, “But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote, having decided that they should keep themselves from idol sacrifices and blood and anything strangled and fornication.” Their word here has the same old tone as that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77415" data-verses="Acts 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="clSZYpbJsMTyRlnc5CQjj92DUxpJYeKfy4Dt-eqWvnGgiKA6P3AKy7krljshseoz8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77416" data-verses="Acts 21:26">Acts 21:26</span> says, “Then Paul took the men on the following day, and having been purified with them entered into the temple, giving notice of the completion of the days of the purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.” The completion spoken of here is the completion of the Nazarite vow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77417" data-verses="Numbers 6:13">Num. 6:13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="YJs94s2aJDs7VNvpXjmWquHDyQTQT1-VL5FhVS1mIG-dzYnTnvCO7bnb1cG2qXU2E"> I would call your attention to the word “having been purified.” Here we see that Paul had already been purified with the four Nazarites. He then took them into the temple and waited with them for the offering to be offered for each one. This time of waiting is indicated by the word “until.” Having been purified along with the four, Paul waited in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="497" id="497">[497]</span> temple with them for the priest to come at the end of the completion on the seventh day to offer sacrifices for them all, including Paul. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1JRZs11L0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg">PAUL’S COMPROMISE AND RELEASE</h2><p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2VVvf50tqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> It is very difficult to believe that Paul would be purified, enter into the temple, and wait for the offerings to be offered by the priest. He did this after writing the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans, books that were written not long before he came to Jerusalem. Although it is difficult to believe that Paul carried out the word of James and the elders, it is a fact that he joined himself to the Nazarites and went with them into the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="SX_7dMl2HfxSBERUtHwTfMrFHdrM23w5gIng7aE_LX2argmuVZZVL0WFlWju6AxQa"> As we shall see in a later message, there was an uproar against Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77418" data-verses="Acts 21:27">21:27—23:15</span>), and he was seized by the Jews in Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77419" data-verses="Acts 21:27-30">21:27-30</span>). Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77420" data-verses="Acts 21:27-28">21:27 and 28</span> say, “Now when the seven days were about to be concluded, the Jews from Asia saw him in the temple and threw all the crowd into confusion; and they laid their hands on him, crying out, Men, Israelites, help! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and besides, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has profaned this holy place.” This uproar took place “when the seven days were about to be concluded,” that is, on the seventh day. Humanly speaking, Paul’s intention in going into the temple was to avoid trouble. Actually, his going into the temple with the four Nazarites caused a great deal of trouble for him. </p>
<p data-content-id="g8IXFe6HuOguESGghpwOjvEbyypS3PnQmdHqw5ICsa7V_yGT9Yi4eMOByQVLvj_dD"> Suppose Paul had decided not to go to the temple but simply to stay with the brothers in the house of Mnason, with whom Paul and his companions were to lodge in Jerusalem. Let us further suppose that Paul had said to the brothers, “I do not care for the temple, because God is finished with it. Brothers, did the Lord Jesus not tell us that God has forsaken the temple? I am practicing the Lord’s word concerning us. The priesthood and all the sacrifices are also over. Therefore, I cannot go back to the temple to have any share in the offerings and the priesthood. Brothers, <span class="pg" data-page-id="498" id="498">[498]</span> I would like to stay here to have fellowship with you.” Would not the situation have been very different if Paul had decided not to go to the temple and instead had spent his time having fellowship with the brothers? To be sure, the situation would have been very different. </p>
<p data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZrR1HlrMxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77421" data-verses="Acts 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> of Acts Paul was compromising. He was the writer of the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans, yet not long after these Epistles were written, he took the step described in this chapter. For Paul to take such a step was a great compromise on his part. </p>
<p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc4cGptYQwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77422" data-verses="Acts 21:26-27">21:26 and 27</span>, Paul was in the temple waiting for the completion of the days of the purification. He was to be in the temple until the priest came to offer the offerings for him and the four others. How could Paul bear to stay in the temple for that period of time? Do you think he was happy? Do you think he was joyfully praising the Lord? Paul could praise the Lord when he was in prison in Philippi (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77423" data-verses="Acts 16:23-25">16:23-25</span>). But do you think he could praise the Lord there in the temple in Jerusalem? Apparently, the temple was a much better place for Paul than a prison. However, that prison in Philippi actually became a holy place, even the heavens, for Paul, whereas the temple in Jerusalem was a prison for him. In a very real sense, Paul was imprisoned there in the temple, unable to be released. Paul had become “trapped” in that situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="NaxbvirwEM9IrWiL01kgL0QpTMeYfdNPKigSWcaRtEc-jMmKUrEXcfIwob1MBGo1q"> Although Paul was imprisoned in the temple, the Lord had a way to release him from this prison. The Lord used the Jews to accomplish this release. In particular, the Lord used the uproar caused by the Jews to take Paul out of the temple. On the one hand, Paul was then in greater difficulty. On the other hand, he was released not only from the temple but also from the God-condemned mixture of the New Testament grace with the Old Testament law in Jerusalem. In His sovereignty the Lord protected His faithful servant from that terrible mixture. </p>

God’s plan is to have a group of human beings who are regenerated with the divine life become His sons and the members of Christ so that the Triune God in Christ may have a Body through which to express Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97mYh_Ux9q6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq"> God’s plan is accomplished through Christ’s incarnation, human living, and all-inclusive death to terminate everything of the old creation so that He may germinate His chosen people in resurrection. In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77442" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>) so that He may propagate Himself as the processed Triune God to produce the Body. After His resurrection Christ ascended to the heavens, and there He was made the Lord and Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77443" data-verses="Acts 2:36">Acts 2:36</span>). In His resurrection the Lord had already breathed Himself as the Spirit into His chosen people essentially (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77444" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>). Then in His ascension He poured out Himself as the all-inclusive consummated Spirit upon them economically. Therefore, everything has been fulfilled and accomplished: incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, the life-giving and propagating resurrection, the breathing of the life-giving Spirit essentially, the ascension, and the pouring out of the consummated Spirit economically. <span class="pg" data-page-id="504" id="504">[504]</span> Because all this has been accomplished, the church has been produced. </p>
<p data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5mW3ZcuvsITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb"> Before Christ came to pass through the processes for accomplishing God’s plan, the points related to it were put into the Old Testament in the way of promises, prophecies, types, figures, and shadows. Then, in the fullness of time, the Triune God in the Son became a man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77445" data-verses="Galatians 4:4">Gal. 4:4</span>). In His humanity He passed through the processes of human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish everything for the fulfillment of God’s plan. Having become the all-inclusive Spirit, He now enters into God’s chosen people to apply to them all that the Triune God in the Son has accomplished. Through such an application, God’s people become living witnesses of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77446" data-verses="Acts 1:8">Acts 1:8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyeoKTvGpxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> As those who have the all-inclusive Spirit within us, what should we do? We should simply be living witnesses containing, bearing, and conveying the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ so that He may be propagated throughout the earth for the fulfillment of the divine economy. This is a brief summary of the entire revelation in the New Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo5nSpOsUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk">THE SITUATION OF MIXTURE IN JERUSALEM</h2><p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZlYOcDJDnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> Since Christ has come and passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, breathing the Spirit into God’s chosen people essentially and pouring the Spirit upon them economically, many of the promises, prophecies, types, figures, and shadows in the Old Testament related to this are now out-of-date. God’s people should not hold on to these out-of-date things. However, degraded Judaism as a religion continues to hold on to those things which have become out-of-date. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2bagJ39mCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> Between those in degraded Judaism and the Christian believers was the situation of mixture in Jerusalem. In Jerusalem was the first group of vessels chosen by God to contain Christ. This group included the apostles, among whom Peter was the leading one and James was the most <span class="pg" data-page-id="505" id="505">[505]</span> influential one. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77447" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>, with these apostles there were thousands of Jews who believed in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77448" data-verses="Acts 21:20">v. 20</span>). Although they had become believers in Christ, they were still strongly under the influence of their Judaic background. Because of this influence, it was impossible for them to abandon their background and to give up the atmosphere that prevailed in Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_Y_dyMHyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> The Jewish believers in Jerusalem became those who insisted on having both faith in Christ and also the out-of-date things of the Old Testament. They wanted to put these two matters together. I would say that, according to my study of the New Testament, James was the leader in this trend. It seems that he took the lead to say, “There is no need for us to fight. We may keep our faith in Christ and at the same time also keep the Old Testament laws, customs, and practices. We may still practice circumcision.” </p>
<p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paWXaYr994ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> In not wanting to fight or offend others, James may have had a very good intention. He may have had a good heart in wanting to blend the Old Testament dispensation with faith in Christ. We also need to realize that James had a broadened heart. This is indicated by the fact that he did not propose that the Gentile believers be circumcised. Consider the solution he proposed to the problems concerning circumcision during the course of the fellowship recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77449" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span>: “I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who turn to God. But that we write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and fornication and what is strangled and blood. For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, being read every Sabbath” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77450" data-verses="Acts 15:19-21">vv. 19-21</span>). James made it clear that it was not necessary for the Gentiles to be circumcised or to keep the law. He only required that they abstain from idol worship, fornication, things strangled, and blood. </p>
<p data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSWiecCQ89bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057"> James, however, continued to think that it would be better for the Jewish believers to practice the things of the Old Testament and to keep the law. James seemed to say, “The Gentiles do not need to keep the law or to be circumcised. But we Jews should practice circumcision and keep <span class="pg" data-page-id="506" id="506">[506]</span> the law. We need to practice the kind of life exactly like that practiced by our forefathers in the Old Testament. Of course, we now have faith in Christ. Therefore, let us keep both the Old Testament things and our faith in Christ.” This, I believe, was James’ concept. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG-c054NE8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj">A CLEAR VISION OF THE BODY</h2><p data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip_NDJVg98Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF"> If James’ concept had been widely accepted in Asia Minor and Europe, how could there have been one Body for Christ in a practical way? Would there be two kinds of churches—a Judaic church for the Jewish believers and a Gentile church for the Gentile believers? Such a thing is utterly impossible. </p>
<p data-content-id="z61RD3KafAYjfi8tAzNIhgC-sYC6r-1Y3A4B2LIPEwKemXPbABjI7hz5oz07qdStf"> Concerning the Body Paul had seen a clear vision. He spoke of the one Body in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77451" data-verses="Romans 12:5">Romans 12:5</span>, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77452" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span> he said, “In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77453" data-verses="Galatians 3:27-28">Galatians 3:27 and 28</span> Paul said, “For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” Although Paul had seen a clear vision, in his first six Epistles—Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians—this vision was not yet presented in a full way. No doubt Paul was waiting for a time to put into writing the vision he had seen. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ayDvwYGbF8kWY5F_9FVvUQzv6UiHZVamrMqmbhtFN96IRxElNLGJfnroptl9R0_TX">THE LORD’S SOVEREIGN RESCUE OF PAUL</h2><p data-content-id="b5ZbaQ6Os4GxN0IV3WNo92cFq2rFS48vWpcda_KJxCHDGLFCKCUa4Gfp6xNdoRiCS"> When Paul saw the situation of mixture in Jerusalem, he must have been heavily burdened by it. Perhaps when James made his presentation to him in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77454" data-verses="Acts 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> concerning the thousands of Jews who believed and who were zealous for the law and concerning Paul’s joining with those who had the Nazarite vow, he was hesitating what to do. Perhaps he said to himself, “Humanly speaking, I should simply do what James says. After I pass through this critical time, I may have another opportunity to adjust or clarify the <span class="pg" data-page-id="507" id="507">[507]</span> situation in Jerusalem.” This may have been Paul’s thought as he complied with James’ proposal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77455" data-verses="Acts 21:23-26">21:23-26</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="q56ADhFm7_LcIoAPH3xFSh0PM8WaUIO8_vrnKMCsdpFo2iQHQ7PItJoxf0tRnNi13"> The Lord, however, did not allow Paul to complete the days of the purification. Paul, a chosen vessel, was the unique one used by the Lord to carry out God’s New Testament economy. How could the Lord allow such a one to complete the days of purification, which involved the temple, the priesthood, and the offering of animal sacrifices with the shedding of blood? All these things were terminated by God’s New Testament economy. The Lord could not tolerate this. Hence, almost at the last minute, at the time when Paul’s vow was about to be completed, the Lord came in, and there was a great disturbance. That was the Lord’s exercise of His sovereignty concerning Paul to rescue him from that dilemma. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2bawJxv2Cwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51">THE DISAPPEARING<br/>OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_Y_NyFUSB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> Concerning the matter of a dispensational transfer, let us consider the case of Peter. On the mount of transfiguration Peter took the lead to propose to the Lord that he build three tabernacles, one for Moses, one for Elijah, and one for the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77492" data-verses="Matthew 17:4">Matt. 17:4</span>). “While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight; hear Him!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77493" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">v. 5</span>). When the disciples heard this, they fell on their face. When they lifted up their eyes, “they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77494" data-verses="Matthew 17:8">v. 8</span>). Moses and Elijah had disappeared, and only Jesus remained. Peter had proposed to keep Moses and Elijah, that is, the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving “no one except Jesus Himself alone.” No one <span class="pg" data-page-id="512" id="512">[512]</span> except Jesus Himself alone should remain in the New Testament. He is today’s Moses, imparting the law of life into His believers, and also today’s Elijah, speaking for God and speaking forth God within His believers. This is God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paWXKYjuN4ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77495" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-8">Matthew 17:1-8</span> we have a clear revelation of the fact that with the coming of Jesus both Moses and Elijah were over. Moses and Elijah represent the entire Old Testament, with Moses representing the law and Elijah representing the prophets. According to Jewish custom, the Old Testament was regarded as having two main parts—the Law and the Prophets. Even the Psalms were considered part of the Law. Therefore, the fact that Moses and Elijah were over indicates that the entire Old Testament, consisting of the Law and the Prophets, was over. </p>
<p data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZrSVHlpMxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45"> Peter had the experience of seeing the vision on the mount of transfiguration, and later, in his second Epistle, he referred to what happened on that mountain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77496" data-verses="2Peter 1:16-18">2 Pet. 1:16-18</span>). Why, then, did Peter say nothing about this vision when James was insisting on keeping the Old Testament economy along with the New Testament economy? I find this difficult to understand. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77497" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> did Peter not have any remembrance of the vision he had seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77498" data-verses="Matthew 17:1">Matthew 17</span> and about which he later wrote in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77499" data-verses="2Peter 1:1">2 Peter 1</span>? </p>
<p data-content-id="5wLxD0JTmzajhXUc4fmptaQwrqYY1T7923HeO_J4MrTAgZ8iZAOuyrYzAbxi5dF58"> Peter certainly was knowledgeable concerning the disappearing of the Old Testament economy. On the mount of transfiguration he must have been impressed with this. He heard the voice out of the cloud declare, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight; hear Him!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77500" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">Matt. 17:5</span>). He had also seen Moses and Elijah together with Jesus, and then he saw that Moses and Elijah had disappeared and that Jesus remained alone. Why, having heard this word and having seen this vision, was Peter silent in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77501" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>? Why did he not rise up and say, “Brother James, let me tell you what I heard and saw on the mount of transfiguration. Moses and Elijah, the Law and the Prophets, are over. We should no longer hold on to the Old Testament economy. To do that is contrary to God’s move in His New Testament economy.” However, <span class="pg" data-page-id="513" id="513">[513]</span> Peter kept silent and did not speak this way to James in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77502" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>. Likewise, there is no indication that John, who was with Peter on the mount of transfiguration, said anything to James concerning it at that juncture. Neither Peter nor John stood up to testify regarding the vision they had seen and the charge they had received on the mount of transfiguration. </p>

The disciples were charged to disciple the Gentiles by baptizing them into the Triune God. The Lord’s charge to the disciples in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77504" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> is very emphatic. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB_vCql2mKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77505" data-verses="Mark 16:15">Mark 16:15</span>, the Lord, after His resurrection and before His ascension, charged the eleven, saying, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation.” In this verse “creation” mainly denotes different peoples, although it includes more than this. As in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77506" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>, here the Lord commands the disciples to preach the gospel to all peoples, to all nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqIwjb8CUdJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5"> After His resurrection and before His ascension, the Lord Jesus spoke yet another word to the disciples to indicate that the gospel should be preached to all nations. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77507" data-verses="Luke 24:47">Luke 24:47</span> He told them that “repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.” If we consider these three charges at the end of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, we shall see how strong, definite, emphatic, and absolute they are. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlp471IIzOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX">THE SITUATION OF MIXTURE IN JERUSALEM</h2><p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT54BqX1rVfvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> Regarding the situation of mixture in Jerusalem, Peter and John were silent. There is no record that they did anything to diminish this mixture. Rather, according to Luke’s account in Acts, only Paul bore the burden of this matter. <span class="pg" data-page-id="514" id="514">[514]</span> It seems that Peter and John were not concerned about it. If they had been concerned, they should have spoken strongly to James and said, “James, before you were saved, we heard the word and saw the vision about the passing away of the Old Testament economy.” </p>
<p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDVKRtvV41r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> According to the record of the New Testament, the James in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77508" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> was a brother of the Lord Jesus in the flesh. Along with the other brothers of the Lord, James was saved right after His resurrection, if not a little before that time. Therefore, it is possible that James was present when one or more of the charges recorded at the end of Matthew, Mark, and Luke was given. He must have known that the Lord had commanded the disciples to preach the gospel to all the nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="1jNZ3Y6RNXScv8-BlgBPHzEFaFzfAIRX4Bba-Y8mPL_tBBhV44go-Yxey-xe-DJIo"> Why did the disciples, including James, seemingly disregard the Lord’s word about preaching the gospel to all the nations and pay so much attention to the Old Testament? Both the revelation given to the disciples and the Lord’s charge were clear, definite, emphatic, and absolute. All the disciples, therefore, should have been clear concerning God’s economy. But in the midst of the situation in Jerusalem, none of them cared for the Lord’s charge. Instead, they were in favor of a mixture of the Old Testament dispensation with God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="9B3GelIP98ERinHYvva7IWUV_Tl3VD5C0GrAN_47CuFPIXBZ0UnuKxTnHsaPni2Fg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77509" data-verses="Acts 21:19">Acts 21:19</span> says that Paul, after greeting James and all the elders “related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry.” When they heard this, they glorified God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77510" data-verses="Acts 21:20">v. 20</span>). Then James took the lead to say to Paul, “You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous for the law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77511" data-verses="Acts 21:20">v. 20</span>). It was a shame to James that he spoke such a word. If I had been Peter listening to this word, I would have had a deep sense of shame. </p>
<p data-content-id="jHPCvHM6AJL14sHMpOHv7qJZKdllursp8MnQXFHjxCUMf5qoYcCmTHDm7GFZatUid"> In the early chapters of Acts Peter was bold. He and John were strong when they faced the opposition of the Sanhedrin. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77512" data-verses="Acts 15:1">chapters fifteen through twenty-one</span> Peter seems to have lost his boldness. According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77513" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span>, Peter even practiced hypocrisy concerning this <span class="pg" data-page-id="515" id="515">[515]</span> mixture. How pitiful was the situation in Jerusalem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77514" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>! We all need to be impressed with the picture of this situation. However, we should not blame Peter, for, in principle, we are in the same kind of situation today. </p>

In this message we shall see that Paul was seized by the Jews in Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77576" data-verses="Acts 21:27-30">21:27-30</span>), that the Roman commander intervened (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77577" data-verses="Acts 21:31-39">21:31-39</span>), and that Paul was given the opportunity to defend himself before the rioting Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77578" data-verses="Acts 21:40">21:40—22:21</span>).

Because Paul’s ministry was to carry out God’s New Testament economy, it could not please the Jews who were <span class="pg" data-page-id="524" id="524">[524]</span> possessed and usurped by Satan, the enemy of God, with their deformed traditional religion, to oppose and ravage God’s New Testament move. Rather, it offended them and it stirred up their jealousy and hatred to the uttermost, so that they made a plot (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77598" data-verses="Acts 20:3">20:3</span>) to do away with him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77599" data-verses="Acts 21:31">21:31</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77600" data-verses="Acts 21:36">36</span>). </p>

Then the commander drew near and laid hold of him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and he inquired who he might be and what he had done.” This commander was a chiliarch in command of a thousand troops, or a cohort. A cohort was one of the ten divisions of an ancient Roman legion. In His sovereignty, the Lord used the intervention of this Roman commander to rescue Paul from the Jews, who were seeking to kill him. </p>

Christ was a lamb brought to the slaughter, and as a sheep dumb before its shearer for the accomplishment of His redemption, He did not open His mouth when judged by men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77606" data-verses="Isaiah 53:7">Isa. 53:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77607" data-verses="Matthew 26:62-63">Matt. 26:62-63</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77608" data-verses="Matthew 27:12">27:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77609" data-verses="Matthew 27:14">14</span>). But Paul, a faithful and bold apostle sent by the Lord, needed to make a defense and to exercise his wisdom to save his life from his persecutors so that he might fulfill the course of his ministry. Although he was willing and ready to sacrifice his life for the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77610" data-verses="Acts 20:24">20:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77611" data-verses="Acts 21:13">21:13</span>), he still endeavored to live longer that he might carry out the Lord’s ministry as much as possible. </p>

And I persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering to prisons both men and women.” As we have seen, “this way” denotes the way of the Lord’s full salvation in God’s New Testament economy. </p>

As we have pointed out, the “Me” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77616" data-verses="Acts 22:7">verse 7</span> was a corporate Me, including Jesus <span class="pg" data-page-id="526" id="526">[526]</span> the Lord and all His believers, all the members of His Body.

And He said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.” Even without knowing the Lord Jesus, Paul called Him Lord. Then the Lord indicated that Paul, by persecuting His followers, who were united to Him through their faith in Him, was actually persecuting Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQQ6GcbwR3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77618" data-verses="Acts 22:9">verse 9</span> Paul says, “And those who were with me beheld the light, but did not hear the voice of the One who was speaking to me.” To say that they did not hear the voice means that they did not hear in the sense of understanding, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77619" data-verses="Mark 4:33">Mark 4:33</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77620" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>. They heard the voice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77621" data-verses="Acts 9:7">Acts 9:7</span>), but they did not understand it, just as they beheld the light, but beheld no one. </p>

And the Lord said to me, Rise up and go into Damascus, and there it will be told you concerning all things which have been appointed for you to do.” Here we see that the Lord would not directly tell Paul right after his conversion what He wanted him to do, for the reason that He needed a member of His Body to initiate him into the identification with His Body. </p>

And in that very hour I looked up at him.” We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77625" data-verses="Acts 9:11-17">9:11-17</span> that the Lord sent Ananias, one member of His Body, to Paul so that he might <span class="pg" data-page-id="527" id="527">[527]</span> be initiated into the identification with His Body. This must have impressed him with the importance of the Body of Christ and helped him realize that a believer needs the members of the Body of Christ. </p>

And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.” “His” is significant here. It points particularly to the name of the One whom Paul hated and persecuted (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77627" data-verses="Acts 22:8">v. 8</span>). </p>

In this message we shall focus our attention on Ananias’ word to Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77649" data-verses="Acts 22:16">verse 16</span>: “And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjXkDEB-W3Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h"> In the case of Paul, like that of the Ethiopian eunuch, water baptism is emphasized. We need to pay attention both to water baptism and Spirit baptism. Water baptism signifies the believers’ identification with Christ’s death and resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77650" data-verses="Romans 6:3-5">Rom. 6:3-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77651" data-verses="Colossians 2:12">Col. 2:12</span>), and Spirit baptism signifies the reality of the believers’ union with Christ in life essentially and in power economically. Water baptism is the believers’ affirmation of the Spirit’s reality. Both are needed, and neither can replace the other. All believers in Christ should properly have both. </p>
<p data-content-id="OxXT42mbN-_IwwC7wIQB8pLlOD0YMzE-XjPYijEZ2-L3hEiePh0clDIYHsHVPlhJm"> According to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77652" data-verses="Mark 16:16">Mark 16:16</span>, in order to be saved, a person must believe and be baptized. To believe is to receive the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77653" data-verses="John 1:12">John 1:12</span>) not only for forgiveness of sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77654" data-verses="Acts 10:43">Acts 10:43</span>), but also for regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77655" data-verses="1Peter 1:21">1 Pet. 1:21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77656" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">23</span>), so that those who believe may become the children of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77657" data-verses="John 1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span>) and the members of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77658" data-verses="Ephesians 5:30">Eph. 5:30</span>) in an organic union with the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77659" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>). To be baptized is to affirm this by being buried to terminate the old creation through Christ’s death and by being raised up to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="532" id="532">[532]</span> a new creation of God through Christ’s resurrection. Such a baptism is much more advanced than the baptism of repentance by John (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77660" data-verses="Mark 1:4">Mark 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77661" data-verses="Acts 19:3-5">Acts 19:3-5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDWIRtvX41r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> To believe and to be baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving the full salvation of God. To be baptized without believing is merely an empty ritual; to believe without being baptized is to be saved only inwardly without an outward affirmation of the inward salvation. These two should go together. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1jNZ3Y6RNXScv8-BmiBPHxEFaFzfAIRX4Bba-Y8mPL_tBBhV44go-Yxey-xe-DJIo">TRANSFERRED OUT OF ADAM INTO CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="9B3GelIP98ERinHYsta7LW0V_Tl3VD5C0GrAN_47CuFPIXBZ0UnuKxTnHsaPni2Fg"> Baptism is actually a great transfer. For this reason, the New Testament ministry began with baptism. We have emphasized the fact that baptism involves first termination and then germination. Through termination and germination a real transfer takes place. It is not surprising, then, that the New Testament begins with baptism to indicate that the things of the Old Testament should be terminated in order to have a new beginning. However, among many Christians today, baptism is simply a ritual whereby people enter into another kind of religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="jHPCvHM6AJL14sHMqMHv4qpZKdllursp8MnQXFHjxCUMf5qoYcCmTHDm7GFZatUid"> When we were baptized, we were transferred out of Adam into Christ. Many Christians have never been taught this adequately. Others know that in baptism they were transferred out of Adam into Christ, but for them this is only a doctrinal matter. It is not something practical in their Christian life. In our living as Christians we should be out of Adam and in Christ. No longer should we live in the sphere of Adam; instead, our living should absolutely be in the sphere of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="T-2PL0pYEh4xbDc26g_nQNxuN30o1T5sQX2Xs2X0xJS4o-7h7OkAAU9bwEGWRJ0lt">CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVcbomrqMMnLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77662" data-verses="Acts 22:16">22:16</span> Ananias told Paul to be baptized and wash away his sins, calling on the name of the Lord. In this verse “calling on His name” modifies both “be baptized” and “wash.” Here Ananias seems to be saying, “Paul, rise up and be baptized. As you are being baptized, you must call on the name of the Lord. Calling on His name is the condition of your being baptized.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="533" id="533">[533]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="63PjdVBPG51GyPm3RU2qIfmT1y1Uj-ESJwos787hQjcxafhitczkEPKKkKzBqHe70"> It would be a good practice for us when baptizing new believers to charge them to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. This means that while they are being baptized, they are calling on the name of the Lord. Just as we breathe and eat at the same time, so a person may be baptized and call on the Lord at the same time. The transfer that takes place through baptism is strengthened by one’s calling on the Lord’s name. Therefore, let us charge those who are being baptized by us to call on the name of the Lord Jesus and thereby have a stronger transfer out of Adam into Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Rk893wdUx5BEGaMPI8UI8lfY9RUXWC8S9x4OY1mdzGmnzTwz2JfO8yuVuuay8b7Zz">A Condition for Baptism<br/>and for the Washing Away of Sins</h2><p data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDt9cdi2sw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77663" data-verses="Acts 22:16">22:16</span> Ananias told Paul to rise up, be baptized, and wash away his sins. We have seen that “calling on His name” modifies both “be baptized” and “wash.” Calling is a condition both of being baptized and of washing away sins. Calling on the Lord’s name was a means for Paul to wash away his sins. </p>
<p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4Hynh_zFMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> According to Ananias’ understanding, what were Paul’s sins that needed to be washed away? No doubt, the most serious sins, according to Ananias, were the sins of persecuting and arresting those who called on the name of Jesus. Paul’s going out to arrest those who called on the Lord’s name was his major sin. In this matter he was condemned not only by God but also by the believers, both in Jerusalem and elsewhere. All the believers condemned Paul as a persecutor. Paul regarded the calling on the name of the Lord as a sign of the believers. Therefore, wherever Paul went, he sought out those who called on the Lord’s name. </p>
<p data-content-id="LilxD0znUWS-9v8355X0WBvuzl4KnJ-MfefbTNnzPPig5LWJWb9boygxWo-Q9W1s_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77664" data-verses="Acts 22:16">22:16</span> Ananias seemed to be saying, “Paul, in the eyes of the believers your most serious sin was persecuting and arresting those who called on the Lord. Now that you have repented and have had a turn, you need to wash away your sins. In particular, you need to wash away the sin of persecuting the saints. In order to wash away your sins, you need to call on the name of the Lord. If you call, ‘O Lord Jesus,’ a number of times, the saints will forgive you. Your calling will be the condition for the washing away of your sins. Paul, you <span class="pg" data-page-id="534" id="534">[534]</span> cannot be a silent believer, a believer who does not audibly call on the Lord’s name. If you are silent, the believers will not recognize you as one of them, and they will not forgive you. Therefore, you must now practice the very thing that you condemned—calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. Once you took this as a sign of those to be persecuted and arrested by you. Now it should be a sign that you have believed in the Lord Jesus and have been saved. Paul, rise up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name. When you do this, you will be forgiven by all those who love the Lord Jesus.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mlcLhH-3w5KZuNDv5ztvBeyzmtunqHXxKV7NNVCdEbwgO3dnwE5vpipW8E4hgdOFK">The Initial Step of Paul’s Transfer</h2><p data-content-id="ZuGjIAnEo5IafG53oAVe0_SpiGKgO2xOWEc6_4BynTJX3LLZmIC9oRziJLF_biW7b"> Paul’s calling on the name of the Lord Jesus was the initial step of his transfer. He was transferred from condemning this calling to practicing it. Some may say that calling on the Lord’s name was a part of Paul’s conversion. Yes, but that was not only part of his conversion; it was also the beginning of his transfer from one realm into another. </p>
<p data-content-id="AY-SUR-EoOuNw4w4chKDKib0E3N7TuSXEOTbw_G2bv_OjbWVvXlpJAskEmK1oKtQB"> It is difficult to understand why the Jews opposed the matter of calling on the Lord’s name. To the Jews the important matters were keeping the law and practicing circumcision and following the customs. Nevertheless, before his transfer, Paul particularly opposed the calling on the Lord’s name. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97mbjvU7uK6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq"> The principle is the same today among those who oppose the practice of calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. Some condemn us for calling on the name of the Lord. Actually, they have no reason to oppose this practice. Nevertheless, some falsely say that it is mere shouting. But what is wrong with believers in the Lord calling on His name? This practice is strongly revealed in the Scriptures. It is better to call on the Lord’s name than to be silent, dead, and without any genuine contact with the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5lUnZX9fsITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb"> Some who oppose calling on the name of the Lord Jesus say, “Christianity has been on earth for nineteen hundred years, but we have never heard this teaching that believers should call on the Lord’s name.” To this we may reply, <span class="pg" data-page-id="535" id="535">[535]</span> “Perhaps you have never heard this kind of teaching, but certainly you have heard believers call on the Lord’s name. In fact, it is likely that in the years you have been a Christian you have had at least some experience of calling on the name of Jesus yourself.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvCB6w6Vc_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP"> There have been many cases of those who called on the Lord’s name without receiving any teaching concerning this practice. One particular person strongly opposed our calling on the Lord’s name. One day as he was riding his bicycle, he was hit by a car, and the bicycle was thrown into the air. While he was falling to the ground, he spontaneously called, “O Lord Jesus!” </p>

Paul was then given the opportunity to defend himself before the rioting Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77673" data-verses="Acts 21:40">21:40—22:21</span>). The Jews listened to him up to a point, but eventually began to make a disturbance. Paul was then bound by the Romans (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77674" data-verses="Acts 22:22-29">22:22-29</span>). In his wisdom, Paul utilized his Roman citizenship to save himself from suffering persecution (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77675" data-verses="Acts 22:25-29">vv. 25-29</span>). The Roman commander then gave Paul the opportunity to defend himself before the Sanhedrin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77676" data-verses="Acts 22:30">22:30—23:10</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77677" data-verses="Acts 22:30">Acts 22:30</span> says, “And on the next day, intending to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together; and having brought Paul down, he had him stand before them.” Let us now consider Paul’s defense given before the Sanhedrin. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="SX_7dMl2HfxSBERUuGgTWfrFHdrM23w5gIng7aE_LX2argmuVZZVL0WFlWju6AxQa">Conducting Himself in All Good Conscience</h2><p data-content-id="g8IXFe6HuOguESGgiogOr8UbyypS3PnQmdHqw5ICsa7V_yGT9Yi4eMOByQVLvj_dD"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77678" data-verses="Acts 23:1">Acts 23:1</span> says, “And Paul, looking intently at the Sanhedrin, said. Men, brothers, I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day.” Following man’s fall and his being sent out of the garden of Eden (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77679" data-verses="Genesis 3:23">Gen. 3:23</span>), God wanted man, in His dispensation, to be responsible to his own conscience. But man failed to live and walk according to <span class="pg" data-page-id="540" id="540">[540]</span> his conscience and fell further into wickedness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77680" data-verses="Genesis 6:5">Gen. 6:5</span>). After the judgment of the flood, God ordained man to be under human government (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77681" data-verses="Genesis 9:6">Gen. 9:6</span>). Man failed also in this. Then, before fulfilling His promise to Abraham concerning the blessing of the nations in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77682" data-verses="Genesis 12:3">Gen. 12:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77683" data-verses="Galatians 3:8">Gal. 3:8</span>), God put man under the test of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77684" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Rom. 3:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77685" data-verses="Romans 5:20">5:20</span>). Man failed utterly in this test. All these failures indicate that man has fallen from God to his conscience, from his conscience to human government, and from human government to lawlessness. Therefore, man has fallen to the uttermost. </p>
<p data-content-id="7vlrk2jmnN7Q5XaAek7-PoKjqp5N5XIkclfQ0bOt-e35bg1m3dulz70LAYh3QPmLC"> To conduct oneself “in all good conscience before God,” as Paul did, was a great return to God from man’s fall. Paul spoke this word to vindicate himself before those who accused him of being a lawless and even reckless person. He referred, in his defense, to his conscience again in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77686" data-verses="Acts 24:16">24:16</span>. This showed his high standard of morality in contrast to the hypocrisy of the Jewish religionists and the crookedness of the Roman (Gentile) politicians. </p>
<p data-content-id="_EkbDUiwZcLk8sdsPlcLIo_GFlTJSNeZs5C4yt_SuEY4MSFJxsuZ08LV5stPQq0L0"> In his defense before the Sanhedrin in the presence of representatives of the Roman government, Paul could say that there was nothing wrong in his personal conduct.

Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! And you sit, judging me according to the law, and contrary to the law you order me to be struck?” Here we see Paul’s straightforwardness and boldness in dealing with his persecutors. Those standing by said to him, “Do you revile the high priest of God?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77688" data-verses="Acts 23:4">v. 4</span>). Paul replied, “I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evilly of a ruler of your people” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77689" data-verses="Acts 23:5">v. 5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQQ6mcYxx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77690" data-verses="Acts 23:6">Acts 23:6</span> says, “And Paul, knowing that one part was <span class="pg" data-page-id="541" id="541">[541]</span> Sadducees, but the other Pharisees, cried out in the Sanhedrin, Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!” The Pharisees were the strictest religious sect of the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77691" data-verses="Acts 26:5">26:5</span>), formed about 200 B.C. They were proud of their superior sanctity of life, devotion to God, and knowledge of the Scriptures. Actually, they were degraded into pretentious conduct and hypocrisy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77692" data-verses="Matthew 23:2-33">Matt. 23:2-33</span>). The Sadducees were another sect among Judaism. They did not believe in the resurrection, nor in angels, nor in spirits. While the Pharisees were supposed to be orthodox, the Sadducees were ancient modernists. </p>
<p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGWOjd2bozY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> When Paul declared that he was a Pharisee and that he was being judged concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead, “a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the multitude was divided. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge both. And there was a great outcry; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ party rose up and fought it out, saying, We find nothing evil in this man; and if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel...” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77693" data-verses="Acts 23:7-9">vv. 7-9</span>). Paul wisely used this situation to his benefit, knowing that the Pharisees would take sides with him and then fight with the Sadducees. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q-Z1fr4pKUnjskM-BilteMcORMXDYly2Ybap68W30wzThTySRlaIBTPQrNKHrcZQ_"> When Paul realized that it was helpful to him to take his stand as a Roman citizen, he did so, and this frightened the Roman officials. Here he cried out that he was a Pharisee, knowing that this would cause a fight between the Pharisees and Sadducees. Once again Paul exercised his wisdom to avoid suffering persecution. As we have seen, Paul faced his opponents in a different way than Christ did. When Christ was judged by men for the accomplishment of redemption, He did not open His mouth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77694" data-verses="Isaiah 53:7">Isa. 53:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77695" data-verses="Matthew 26:62-63">Matt. 26:62-63</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77696" data-verses="Matthew 27:12">27:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77697" data-verses="Matthew 27:14">14</span>). But Paul, as a faithful and bold apostle sent by the Lord, exercised his wisdom to save his life from his persecutors so that he might fulfill the course of his ministry. For the sake of carrying out this ministry, he endeavored to live as long as possible. <span class="pg" data-page-id="542" id="542">[542]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKcsU9-vDzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO"> The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77701" data-verses="Acts 23:11">23:11</span> about Paul solemnly testifying concerning Him in Jerusalem indicates that the Lord admitted that the apostle had borne a solemn testimony concerning Him in Jerusalem. Testimony differs from mere teaching. To testify requires experiences of seeing, participation, and enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWD-Jrv0Q5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> What the ascended Christ wanted to use to carry out His heavenly ministry for the propagating of Himself so that the kingdom of God might be established for the building up of the churches for His fullness was not a group of preachers trained by man’s teaching to do a preaching work, but a body of His witnesses, martyrs, who bore a living testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ. Witnesses bear a living testimony of the resurrected and ascended Christ in life. They differ from preachers who merely preach doctrines in letters. In His incarnation, Christ carried out His ministry on earth, as recorded in the Gospels, by Himself to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom of God only in the Jewish land. In His ascension He carries out His ministry in the heavens, as recorded in Acts, through witnesses in His resurrection life and with His ascension power and authority to spread Himself as the development of the kingdom of God from Jerusalem unto <span class="pg" data-page-id="543" id="543">[543]</span> the remotest part of the earth, as the consummation of His ministry in the New Testament. All the apostles and disciples in Acts were such witnesses of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh-9dyW-wR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> As we shall see, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77702" data-verses="Acts 26:16">26:16</span> Paul testified that the Lord had appointed him a minister and a witness. A minister is for the ministry; a witness is for the testimony. Ministry is mainly related to work, to what the minister does; testimony is related to the person, to what the witness is. </p>

In this section of Acts Paul is accused by the Jews’ advocate (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77721" data-verses="Acts 24:1-9">vv. 1-9</span>), he defends himself before Felix (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77722" data-verses="Acts 24:10-21">vv. 10-21</span>), and he is kept in the custody of the unjust and corrupt Roman politician (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77723" data-verses="Acts 24:22-27">vv. 22-27</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT57DKXz4Ffvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj">ACCUSED BY THE JEWS’ ADVOCATE</h2><p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDWIxtmFY1r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77724" data-verses="Acts 24:1">Acts 24:1</span> says, “And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a certain orator, Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.” The orator Tertullus, was an advocate, a lawyer, who knew Roman legal procedure. </p>
<p data-content-id="1jNZ3Y6RNXScv8-BmihPPj0FaFzfAIRX4Bba-Y8mPL_tBBhV44go-Yxey-xe-DJIo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77725" data-verses="Acts 24:2-4">Verses 2 through 4</span> continue, “And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him saying, Since we have obtained much peace through you, and through your forethought reforms are being carried out for this nation, both in every way and everywhere we welcome it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. But that I may not detain you further, I entreat you to hear us briefly in your forbearance.” Tertullus’ word here displayed his baseness; he was altogether without any ethical standard. </p>
<p data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDt98di0sw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77726" data-verses="Acts 24:5">24:5</span> Tertullus said concerning Paul, “For we have found this man a pest and an agitator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.” Here we have a threefold accusation. First, Tertullus accused Paul of being <span class="pg" data-page-id="548" id="548">[548]</span> a pest. A pest is full of evil “germs.” Paul, however, was full of positive germs—the germs of the resurrected Christ for the propagation of Christ by imparting Him to others. We all should be such “pests.” </p>
<p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4HyHh_xFMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> Second, Tertullus gave to Paul the title of “agitator.” He accused Paul of being an agitator of insurrections among the Jews throughout the inhabited earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="LilxD0znUWS-9v835530VBPuzl4KnJ-MfefbTNnzPPig5LWJWb9boygxWo-Q9W1s_"> Third, Tertullus claimed that Paul was a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. The word “sect” here is somewhat equal to today’s word “cult.” Tertullus’ word indicates that the Jews regarded the believers in the Lord Jesus as Nazarenes. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77727" data-verses="Acts 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> of Acts the believers were first called Christians in Antioch. Christians are Christ-men, those who live Christ. Here the Jews’ attorney gives the believers another nickname—Nazarenes. The use of this nickname indicates that the believers were considered followers of the Nazarene, Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mlcLhH-3w5KZuNDv5zNvCeSzmtunqHXxKV7NNVCdEbwgO3dnwE5vpipW8E4hgdOFK">DEFENDING HIMSELF BEFORE FELIX</h2><p data-content-id="ZuGjIAnEo5IafG53oA1e3-ypiGKgO2xOWEc6_4BynTJX3LLZmIC9oRziJLF_biW7b"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77728" data-verses="Acts 24:10">24:10</span> Paul begins to make his defense before Felix: “And when the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul answered, Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense as to the things concerning myself.” We have seen that, in contrast to the way the Lord Jesus faced His opponents, it was necessary for Paul to make a defense and to exercise his wisdom in order to save his life from his persecutors so that he might fulfill the course of his ministry. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="AY-SUR-EoOuNw4w4chqDJj70E3N7TuSXEOTbw_G2bv_OjbWVvXlpJAskEmK1oKtQB">Serving God and<br/>Behaving according to the Scriptures</h2><p data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97mbjPU4uq6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77729" data-verses="Acts 24:11-14">verses 11 through 14</span> Paul goes on to say, “As you can realize, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem. And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with anyone nor stirring up a crowd, neither in the synagogues nor throughout the city. Neither are they able to prove to you the things concerning which they now accuse me. But I confess this to you, that according <span class="pg" data-page-id="549" id="549">[549]</span> to the way which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all that is written throughout the Law and in the Prophets.” Here we see that what the opposing Jews called a sect Paul called the way. As we have pointed out, the way, mentioned several times in Acts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77730" data-verses="Acts 9:2">9:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77731" data-verses="Acts 18:25-26">18:25-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77732" data-verses="Acts 19:9">19:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77733" data-verses="Acts 19:23">23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77734" data-verses="Acts 22:4">22:4</span>), denotes the Lord’s full salvation in God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5lUHZU9_sITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77735" data-verses="Acts 24:14">verse 14</span> Paul testified that according to the way the opposers called a sect he served the God of their fathers. Literally, the Greek word rendered “serve” means “serve as a priest.” Paul’s way of serving God was the way of the New Testament economy. Therefore, his way of serving was different from that of the other Jews. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvCBaw5W8_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77736" data-verses="Acts 24:14">verse 14</span> Paul also says that he believed all that is written throughout the Law and in the Prophets. Here Paul is saying that he acted according to the Old Testament, which was composed of the Law and the Prophets. Therefore, Paul vindicated himself as a person who behaved according to the Scriptures. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBPRt1VmWnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2">A Resurrection<br/>of the Righteous and the Unrighteous</h2><p data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBeoqD32QHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77737" data-verses="Acts 24:15">24:15</span> Paul speaks of the resurrection: “Having hope toward God, which these themselves also look for, that there is about to be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous.” The resurrection of the righteous will occur before the millennium at the Lord’s coming back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77738" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:23">1 Cor. 15:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77739" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:16">1 Thes. 4:16</span>). It will be the resurrection of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77740" data-verses="John 5:28-29">John 5:28-29a</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77741" data-verses="Daniel 12:2">Dan. 12:2</span>). The resurrection of life is the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium. The dead believers will be resurrected to enjoy eternal life at the coming back of the Lord Jesus. Hence, it is called the resurrection of life. It is also the resurrection of reward (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77742" data-verses="Luke 14:14">Luke 14:14</span>), when God will reward the saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77743" data-verses="Revelation 11:18">Rev. 11:18</span>) at the Lord’s return (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77744" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:5">1 Cor. 4:5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGkBs6vIXUZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L"> The resurrection of the righteous, which is the resurrection of life, also includes the first, or the best, resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77745" data-verses="Revelation 20:4-6">Rev. 20:4-6</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77746" data-verses="Revelation 20:5-6">Revelation 20:5 and 6</span> speak of the first, or the <span class="pg" data-page-id="550" id="550">[550]</span> best, resurrection. The first resurrection is the best one. It is not only the resurrection of life, but also the resurrection of reward, the ex-resurrection, that is, the extraordinary resurrection for which the apostle Paul sought (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77747" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">Phil. 3:11</span>), the resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers so that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77748" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">Rev. 20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77749" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>). Not only the resurrected overcomers, such as the man-child in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77750" data-verses="Revelation 12:5">Revelation 12:5</span> and the later martyrs in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77751" data-verses="Revelation 15:2">Revelation 15:2</span>, but also the raptured living ones, such as the firstfruit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77752" data-verses="Revelation 14:1-5">Revelation 14:1-5</span>, will have “part in the first resurrection” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77753" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">Rev. 20:6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyerIjvFpRqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77754" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">Philippians 3:11</span> Paul refers to the first, or best, resurrection as the out-resurrection: “If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.” This is the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints. All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from among the dead at the Lord’s coming back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77755" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:16">1 Thes. 4:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77756" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:52">1 Cor. 15:52</span>). But the overcoming saints will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection. This is called in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77757" data-verses="Hebrews 11:35">Hebrews 11:35</span> the “better resurrection.” </p>
<p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo6lipNs0l_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> To arrive at the out-resurrection means that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected. God first resurrected our deadened spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77758" data-verses="John 5:25">John 5:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77759" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5-6">Eph. 2:5-6</span>). Then from our spirit He proceeds to resurrect our soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77760" data-verses="Romans 8:6">Rom. 8:6</span>) and our mortal body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77761" data-verses="Romans 8:11">Rom. 8:11</span>), until our entire being—spirit, soul, and body—is fully resurrected out of our old being by and with His life. This is a process in life through which we must pass and a race for us to run until we arrive at the out-resurrection as the prize. Hence, the out-resurrection should be the goal and destination of our Christian life. We can reach this goal only by being conformed to the death of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77762" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>), by living a crucified life. In the death of Christ we are processed in resurrection from the old creation to the new. </p>
<p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZma-cAIjnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> We have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77763" data-verses="Acts 24:15">Acts 24:15</span> Paul says that there will be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous. The resurrection of the unrighteous will occur <span class="pg" data-page-id="551" id="551">[551]</span> after the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77764" data-verses="Revelation 20:5">Rev. 20:5</span>). It will be the resurrection of judgment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77765" data-verses="John 5:29">John 5:29</span>) and of shame and everlasting contempt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77766" data-verses="Daniel 12:2">Dan. 12:2b</span>). This resurrection of judgment will be the resurrection of the perished unbelievers after the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77767" data-verses="Revelation 20:5">Rev. 20:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77768" data-verses="Revelation 20:12">12</span>). All the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the thousand years to be judged at the great white throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77769" data-verses="Revelation 20:11-15">Rev. 20:11-15</span>). Hence, it is called the resurrection of judgment. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77770" data-verses="Revelation 20:12">Revelation 20:12</span> the word “standing” indicates the dead have been resurrected. This is the resurrection of judgment for eternal perdition upon the unrighteous after the millennium. This is the resurrection concerning which the apostle Paul warned unrighteous Felix in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77771" data-verses="Acts 24:25">Acts 24:25</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2YYQJ08GCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51"> All the unsaved will be in the resurrection of judgment. Because they will be condemned to eternal perdition, their resurrection will be of shame and everlasting contempt. Paul, in his wisdom, mentioned this resurrection as a warning to Felix. Paul’s word implies that Felix should prepare himself to face the coming resurrection of judgment. As we shall see, later on Paul spoke directly to Felix concerning the coming judgment. </p>

Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77806" data-verses="Acts 24:22-27">24:22-27</span> he was kept in the custody of the unjust and corrupt Roman politician. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77807" data-verses="Acts 24:27">Acts 24:27</span> says, “And when two years were completed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and wanting to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.” Luke does not disclose what Paul did during these two years. In this message we shall consider what Paul might have done during this period of time. </p>

Neither does Luke say anything about the time Paul spent in Arabia after his conversion. Concerning this, Paul says, “Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77808" data-verses="Galatians 1:17">Gal. 1:17</span>). It is difficult to trace where in Arabia Paul went and how long he stayed there after his conversion. However, it must have been a place apart from the Christians, and the time of his stay there must not have been short. His purpose in referring to this was to testify that he did not receive the gospel from man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77809" data-verses="Galatians 1:12">Gal. 1:12</span>). In Arabia Paul must have <span class="pg" data-page-id="556" id="556">[556]</span> received some revelation concerning the gospel directly from the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="mlcLhH-3w5KZuNDv5y9vKMCzmtunqHXxKV7NNVCdEbwgO3dnwE5vpipW8E4hgdOFK"> No doubt, the divine revelation Paul received from the Lord in Arabia came through his knowledge of the Old Testament. Paul was an excellent student of the Old Testament. This is indicated by the way he expounded the Old Testament in the books of Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews. As we read these books, we see that Paul had a thorough knowledge of the Old Testament. Furthermore, he had insight into the Scriptures. An example of this insight is Paul’s allegorizing Sarah, Abraham’s wife, and Hagar, Abraham’s concubine, as two covenants (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77810" data-verses="Galatians 4:22-26">Gal. 4:22-26</span>). Apart from Paul’s allegorizing of these women in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77811" data-verses="Galatians 4:1">Galatians 4</span>, we could read Genesis again and again without seeing that Sarah and Hagar signify two covenants. But Paul, who was very knowledgeable in the truth in the Old Testament, had the insight to see this. Through his knowledge of the Old Testament the divine light came to him. Therefore, as indicated by his writings, Paul could understand the types in the Old Testament concerning Christ’s Person and work. Paul’s knowledge of the Scriptures was one reason for his receiving so much divine revelation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lO2yGU2mlLPDpfqjXlTEIs23Qa88aFX0ursquXvuqisqK7enMxIMyRGVc2BfpIR-h">RECEIVING REVELATION DIRECTLY FROM THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="OxXT42mbN-_IwwC7wJAB077lOD0YMzE-XjPYijEZ2-L3hEiePh0clDIYHsHVPlhJm"> Although Paul received a great deal of revelation from the Lord through his knowledge of the Old Testament, certain aspects of the revelation he received from the Lord are not based on the Old Testament. We may take as an example what Paul says concerning the different kinds of law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77812" data-verses="Romans 7:1-2">Romans 7 and 8</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77813" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> he says, “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.” Here Paul speaks of two laws—the law of sin and death and the law of the Spirit of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77814" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>, in addition to the law of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77815" data-verses="Romans 7:22">v. 22</span>), Paul speaks of “the law of my mind” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77816" data-verses="Romans 7:23">v. 23</span>), which is the law of doing good. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77817" data-verses="Romans 7:23">Romans 7:23</span> he also mentions “the law of sin which is in my members.” Therefore, in these two chapters Paul speaks of four laws: the written law of God, the law of doing <span class="pg" data-page-id="557" id="557">[557]</span> good, the law of sin and death, and the law of the Spirit of life. In contrast to the law of God, the law of doing good, the law of sin and death, and the law of the Spirit of life are not written laws. Rather, they are fixed principles of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKct099vjzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO"> Every kind of life has its own law. The law of doing good is the law of the human life. The law of sin and death is the law of the sinful, Satanic life. The law of the Spirit of life is the law of the divine life. These three laws are based on the fixed principles of these kinds of life. The human life has its own law, the satanic life has a sinful law, and the divine life, which is the highest life, surely has a divine law. </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWD_prs0w5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> What was the source of the revelation Paul saw concerning these three laws? I have investigated this matter in the attempt to learn the source, but I have not been able to find it. Probably Paul received the revelation concerning these three laws directly from the Lord. Moreover, his knowledge of these laws was based on his experience. Paul experienced the law of the mind, the law of doing good. Paul also experienced the law of sin and death. Concerning this, he could say, “I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive in the law of sin which is in my members” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77818" data-verses="Romans 7:23">Rom. 7:23</span>). Earlier in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77819" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> Paul said, “For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to do the good is not. For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice. But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me. I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77820" data-verses="Romans 7:18-21">vv. 18-21</span>). Therefore, from his experience Paul learned that there is such a law as the law of sin and death. To be sure, from his Christian experience Paul discovered that there is a higher law within him—the law of the divine life. Paul certainly received the revelation concerning the law of doing good, the law of sin and death, and the law of the Spirit of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="3lRx9lZjc54Vntgh-89yV_QR1ix9I0RZJp2STcofgbf4veQLJW__07TlnAOFMDrwo"> Because Paul received so much revelation from the Lord, when he came forth to preach, he could minister to others the riches of these revelations. He was able to write such <span class="pg" data-page-id="558" id="558">[558]</span> letters as 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Romans, Galatians, and 1 and 2 Corinthians. As we read Paul’s writings, we see that each one of them is full of divine revelation. The point we are emphasizing here is that Paul must have received a great deal of revelation from the Lord during the time he was in Arabia. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GKyQWo5hWTLmBf9JajyBW521c46e937yRP_pDDoKx7RxQqXYuUV78sCkWbNBL0DfD">PAUL IN CAESAREA</h2><p data-content-id="clSZYpbJsMTyRlnc6Cgjj82DUxpJYeKfy4Dt-eqWvnGgiKA6P3AKy7krljshseoz8"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77821" data-verses="Acts 24:27">Acts 24:27</span>, the Lord set aside a two-year period in which Paul was kept in custody in Caesarea. In these years Paul must have thought about what had taken place in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77822" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77823" data-verses="Acts 21:1">21</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="YJs94s2aJDs7VNvpUjWWqvHDyQTQT1-VL5FhVS1mIG-dzYnTnvCO7bnb1cG2qXU2E"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77824" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> we see the weakness of Paul in facing the religious mixture in Jerusalem. Although Peter and John were with the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration, they were silent concerning God’s New Testament economy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77825" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>. As we have seen, James spoke on behalf of the believing Jews who were still zealous for the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77826" data-verses="Acts 21:20">21:20</span>). Did James not have any light concerning God’s New Testament economy? It seems that he was very dull in his understanding of this. Although Peter and John had been enlightened regarding God’s New Testament economy, they did not do anything about the situation of the mixture of the New Testament grace with the Old Testament law in Jerusalem. It seems that Paul was the only one burdened about that situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="EbSBtvkZQD_UG5P1KRps12L0kwMC3MnG9I0DLFenIxm9iwpfcmQpJikuo5D1Tjilg"> As we consider the scene portrayed in these chapters of Acts, we see that the central figure was actually the Lord Himself. He played the major role in these chapters as the One who was sovereign over everything. Eventually, the Lord delivered Paul from the difficult situation in Jerusalem, preserving his life from the plotting Jews, and placed him in custody under the Roman government in Caesarea. Although Paul was in custody, he was not actually in prison. Felix “directed the centurion to keep him in custody, and yet that he should have some liberty, and that no one should prevent his own people from attending to him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77827" data-verses="Acts 24:23">24:23</span>). As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77828" data-verses="Acts 24:26">24:26</span> indicates, Felix’s purpose in allowing Paul’s friends to visit him <span class="pg" data-page-id="559" id="559">[559]</span> was to gain money for himself. Although Felix’s purpose was to get money, the Lord had His own purpose in keeping Paul in custody in Caesarea. There in Caesarea Paul did not have anything to do, and he was safely kept from trouble. </p>

<p data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBepKDzkwHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa"> In the last four chapters of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77848" data-verses="Acts 25:1">Acts, chapters twenty-five through twenty-eight</span>, Paul defends himself twice. First, he defends himself before Festus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77849" data-verses="Acts 25:6-8">25:6-8</span>), and then before Agrippa (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77850" data-verses="Acts 26:1-29">26:1-29</span>). Following his defense before Agrippa, Paul makes his fourth journey (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77851" data-verses="Acts 27:1">27:1—28:31</span>). In these chapters we have a picture of people in three kinds of situations. We have a picture of the Jewish religionists, the Roman politicians, and those in the church. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGkAM6qanUZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L">THE JEWISH RELIGIONISTS</h2><p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyerJDvP7RqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> Let us first consider the portrait of the Jewish religionists. Judaism was formed according to God’s word. Therefore, the Jewish religion was according to the Scriptures. The Jewish religionists had the holy Bible, the holy land, the holy city, the holy temple, the holy priesthood, and all the other holy things. Nevertheless, what these religious people did as recorded in the book of Acts was absolutely not of God but of Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo6kCpG-kl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77852" data-verses="Acts 25:1-3">Acts 25:1-3</span> says, “Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. And the chief priests and leading men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they kept entreating him, asking for a favor against him, so that he might summon him to Jerusalem, setting an ambush to do away with him <span class="pg" data-page-id="566" id="566">[566]</span> on the way.” Here we see that the Jews wanted to set up an ambush in order to kill Paul. Furthermore, the Jewish religionists lied and exercised hypocrisy. With them there was nothing holy or righteous. With them there was nothing that could be counted as being for God. In this religion we cannot see anything spiritual or divine. On the contrary, what was practiced among the Jewish religionists in the case of Paul was not only fleshly and sinful but even devilish and hellish. The source of what they did was the Devil. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvCA6w5U8_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP">THE ROMAN POLITICIANS</h2><p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBPQN1VkWnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> In Acts we also have a portrait of the Roman politicians. In particular, we have an account concerning the commander, Felix, Festus, and Agrippa. The higher the Roman politicians were, the more corrupt they were. Felix was more corrupt than the commander, Festus was more corrupt than Felix, and Agrippa was more corrupt than Festus. According to the record in the holy Word, in the Roman political circle there was much corruption. As we have pointed out, along with the Hebrew religion and Greek culture, Roman politics was one of the three elements that composed western culture. But according to Acts, Roman politics was corrupt. </p>
<p data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBepKD02wHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77853" data-verses="Acts 24:24">Acts 24:24</span> speaks of Felix and Drusilla his wife. Drusilla was a daughter of King Herod Agrippa. Felix became enamored of her and persuaded her to forsake her husband and marry him. This shows the intemperance and corruption of Felix, a Roman politician. Felix’s corruption is also seen in his sending for Paul frequently in the hope that money would be given him by Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77854" data-verses="Acts 24:26">24:26</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGkAM6sI3UZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77855" data-verses="Acts 25:13">Acts 25:13</span> speaks of Agrippa and Bernice. Bernice was a sister of Drusilla, the wife of Felix. She was also a sister of Agrippa, with whom she lived incestuously. This may be the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77856" data-verses="Acts 25:13">25:13</span> Bernice is not identified as being Agrippa’s wife. Roman politics certainly was dark and corrupt, full of sexual immorality and the love of money. The record in Acts exposes the corruption of the Roman politicians. <span class="pg" data-page-id="567" id="567">[567]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyerJDvGoxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U">THE DISAPPOINTING SITUATION<br/>CONCERNING THE CHURCH IN JERUSALEM</h2><p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo6kCpOtUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77857" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:32">1 Corinthians 10:32</span> Paul speaks of the Jews, the Greeks, and the church of God. This indicates that in New Testament times people were of three classes: the Jews—God’s chosen people; the Greeks—unbelieving Gentiles; and the church—a composition of the believers in Christ. We have seen that, according to the picture portrayed in Acts, the Jewish religionists were hypocritical and even devilish and that the Roman politicians were dark and corrupt. What, then, was the situation concerning the church? When Paul was in custody for two years in Caesarea, he must have been disappointed with the church in Jerusalem. What he saw in the church there was weakness and compromise. </p>
<p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZmbecDIDnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> Paul, as a vessel chosen by God, was enlightened to the uttermost concerning the universe. In 2 Corinthians, an Epistle written not long before his last trip to Jerusalem, Paul testifies that he was caught away to the third heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77858" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">2 Cor. 12:2</span>) and was also caught away into paradise (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77859" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:4">v. 4</span>), the pleasant section in Hades. Having received an abundance of revelation, Paul was enlightened concerning the secrets of the universe. Of course, he received much revelation in particular concerning God’s New Testament economy. Now, in the last chapters of Acts, Paul was in a situation in which he was surrounded by the Jewish religionists, the Roman politicians, and his fellow workers in the church life. He must have found this situation very disappointing. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2YZwJ38mCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51">Weakness, Compromise,<br/>and the Lack of Revelation</h2><p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_b8NyMEyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> As one who had an abundance of the divine revelation stored up in his being, Paul faced the situation among the Jews, the Roman politicians, and the church people. Among the Jewish religionists he saw hypocrisy, and among the Roman politicians he saw corruption. Furthermore, in the church life he saw weakness, compromise, and the lack of light and revelation. It seems that no one in the church was bold enough to stand for the revelation they had received <span class="pg" data-page-id="568" id="568">[568]</span> and the vision they had seen. In the midst of that situation Peter should have stood boldly for the revelation he had received of the Lord, but he failed to do this. </p>
<p data-content-id="He5snHWxzQEsk1paVUKYr-94ucKoTWBxj2ZrJmQ3c-wEhaFlCDby4vnNPdRbz0vqK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77860" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapters two through five</span> of Acts Peter and John were very strong and bold. As a result of their boldness, they were brought before the Sanhedrin in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77861" data-verses="Acts 4:1">chapter four</span>, and they were placed by the Sanhedrin in public custody in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77862" data-verses="Acts 5:1">chapter five</span>. There was no sign of weakness or compromise in Peter and John in these early chapters. There is no hint that they were afraid of the Jewish religionists or compromised with them. However, as we read from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77863" data-verses="Acts 15:1">Acts 15</span> onward and also read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77864" data-verses="Galatians 2:1">Galatians 2</span>, we see that Peter eventually was exposed in his weakness and even in his hypocrisy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSVhOcBRc9bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057">The Destruction of Jerusalem</h2><p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG9fk57Mk8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> Because of the strong attitude and standing taken by Peter, John, and the other believers, the Jews persecuted the saints to such an extent that, with the exception of the apostles, they all left Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77865" data-verses="Acts 8:1">8:1</span>). But by the time Paul paid his last visit to Jerusalem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77866" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>, James could speak of “how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous for the law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77867" data-verses="Acts 21:20">v. 20</span>). All these thousands of believers had remained in Jerusalem. If Peter and John had had the strong attitude and standing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77868" data-verses="Acts 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> that they had in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77869" data-verses="Acts 2:1">chapters two through five</span>, most of these Jewish believers would have been scattered, and that scattering would have become their salvation as far as the religious mixture in Jerusalem was concerned. However, these thousands of believers, who were still zealous for the law, stayed in Jerusalem, and their remaining in Jerusalem put them in great danger. Not too long after Paul’s last visit to Jerusalem, perhaps not more than ten years later, Titus came with the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem and to slaughter those who continued to live there. It is possible that many Christians were put to death at that time. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip8OTJWid8Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF"> In the parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77870" data-verses="Matthew 21:33-46">Matthew 21:33-46</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77871" data-verses="Matthew 22:1-14">22:1-14</span> the Lord Jesus expressed God’s anger concerning the situation in Jerusalem. The Lord indicated that God, “the lord of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="569" id="569">[569]</span> vineyard,” would miserably destroy the evil vinedressers. This was fulfilled when Titus, the Roman prince, and his army destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77872" data-verses="Matthew 22:7">Matthew 22:7</span> the Lord prophesied that God would send “his troops,” the Roman troops under Titus, and destroy the city of Jerusalem. The destruction of Jerusalem may have included the church in Jerusalem. Because of James’ compromising attitude and Peter’s weakness, the church in Jerusalem may have been destroyed along with the city. However, the situation concerning the church would have been different if Peter and John had been as bold in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77873" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> as they were at the beginning. If they had continued to be strong and bold, the saints either would have been scattered, or would have been persecuted unto death by the Jewish religionists. </p>

And the chief priests and leading men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they kept entreating him, asking for a favor against him, so that he might summon him to Jerusalem, setting an ambush to do away with him on the way.” Here we see that the leaders of the Jews begged Festus to bring Paul back to Jerusalem from Caesarea. Two years earlier, the Roman commander had used four hundred seventy soldiers to take Paul from Jerusalem to Caesarea. Now these Jewish leaders entreated Festus to <span class="pg" data-page-id="576" id="576">[576]</span> bring Paul back so that they could set an ambush in order to kill him. </p>

Therefore, he says, let able men from among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him.” The Greek word rendered “wrong” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77895" data-verses="Acts 25:5">verse 5</span> may also be translated “out of place,” “amiss.” </p>
<p data-content-id="DaWtmluLWTtPJD_2WV_f51tqVGH87BwUIZquplZpIuh1yEm1ooDC8pkEYGKlIdTlO"> We have pointed out in foregoing messages that the record of Acts indicates that Roman politics was corrupt. Nevertheless, Roman law was very strong. Although the politicians in the Roman government were corrupt, they still cared for the law. Therefore, when Festus was asked to bring Paul back to Jerusalem, he considered that such an action was not according to Roman law, and he rejected the request of the Jewish leaders. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77896" data-verses="Acts 25:6-8">25:6-8</span> Paul defended himself before Festus. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77897" data-verses="Acts 25:6-7">Verses 6 and 7</span> say, “And having stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought. And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him, which they were not able to prove.” Here we see that the Jewish leaders fulfilled Festus’ request in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77898" data-verses="Acts 25:5">verse 5</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="eeXdqDWMpB7T6NTZoRlHloMxkkUaHC0XedTWfX-4qKWFuXPw-4_obV8SQ4s-6Yl45"> Actually, in defending himself before Festus Paul did not say very much. He simply denied doing anything against either Jewish law or Roman law: “While Paul said in his defense. Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I sinned in anything” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77899" data-verses="Acts 25:8">v. 8</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="577" id="577">[577]</span> </p>

Regarding this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77900" data-verses="Acts 25:9">25:9</span> says, “But Festus, wanting to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me concerning these things?” This proposal exposed the corruption of yet another Roman politician. Here again we see the crookedness of the Roman politicians. </p>
<p data-content-id="tGyva9892obRbw9l9JfIUTfOIjFQhBT0AQQVTHyEChz0auSMkGYTRa1jagwpmuJyF"> Paul was wise and saw through the subtlety of Festus’ proposal. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77901" data-verses="Acts 25:10">verse 10</span>, Paul said strongly, “I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.” Paul’s word concerning “Caesar’s judgment seat” indicated to Festus that he intended to appeal to Caesar. </p>

I appeal to Caesar.” The Greek words translated “hand me over” may also be rendered “grant as a favor,” both here and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77903" data-verses="Acts 25:16">verse 16</span>. The Caesar to whom Paul appealed was Caesar Nero. </p>
<p data-content-id="UpfNfc_pfseUifZqLzTb8BUdJa1ut6Hu062pZviVKMS_imsPEbWCwba2a0NSczEO5"> For his defense Paul wanted to appeal to Caesar. Without such an appeal, the apostle Paul might have been killed by the Jews through Festus’ unjust handling of him, and thus his life might not have been preserved for the finishing of the course of his ministry. Paul’s appeal to Caesar would fulfill his desire to see Rome for the furtherance of the Lord’s testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77904" data-verses="Acts 19:21">19:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77905" data-verses="Acts 23:11">23:11</span>). Without this appeal, he would have been killed by the plot of the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77906" data-verses="Acts 23:12-15">23:12-15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77907" data-verses="Acts 25:1-3">25:1-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77908" data-verses="Acts 25:9">9</span>), and he would not have been able to write his last eight Epistles. </p>
<p data-content-id="MSDt93GzmmHeRBKlq7L1LJTOSaMdksBagVTfN47mfBzkwBc0rrB0qwI4-OPmBoLGX"> Before his appeal to Rome, Paul had written only six Epistles: 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Galatians, Romans, and 1 and 2 Corinthians. It was during his first imprisonment in Rome that he wrote Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, <span class="pg" data-page-id="578" id="578">[578]</span> and Philemon. It was after his first imprisonment that he wrote 1 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews. Then during his second imprisonment he wrote 2 Timothy. Without these last eight Epistles, what a lack the divine revelation would have had and what a loss the church would have suffered! His appeal did render a great profit and benefit to the Lord’s interest. </p>
<p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT57CaX2q1fvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77909" data-verses="Acts 25:12">Acts 25:12</span> says, “Then when Festus had conferred with the council, he answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.” The council here was the council of the Roman province, composed of the councillors or assessors chosen by the governor of the province, with whom the governor usually consulted concerning an appeal like Paul’s. </p>
<p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDWJhtsXY1r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> Why was Paul so strong in daring to appeal to Caesar? Paul was strong in this matter because, as a Roman, he knew Roman law. He knew that when he appealed to Roman law, Festus did not have any choice except to honor this appeal. No doubt, the Roman politicians were corrupt, but the Roman government had strong laws which gave Paul a basis to appeal to Caesar. </p>
<p data-content-id="1jNZ3Y6RNXScv8-BmjxPExkFaFzfAIRX4Bba-Y8mPL_tBBhV44go-Yxey-xe-DJIo"> On two previous occasions Paul stood on the fact of his Roman citizenship. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77910" data-verses="Acts 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> Paul said to his captors, “They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now they are thrusting us out secretly? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out. And the deputies reported these words to the magistrates. And they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77911" data-verses="Acts 16:37-38">vv. 37-38</span>). Later, when Paul was about to be examined by scourging, he said to the centurion standing by, “Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned? And when the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it, saying, What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77912" data-verses="Acts 22:25-26">22:25-26</span>). Paul knew the value of Roman citizenship. He knew that Roman law protected those who were Roman citizens. The law did not give anyone the right to mistreat a Roman citizen. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77913" data-verses="Acts 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> Paul, according to Roman law, appealed to Caesar. <span class="pg" data-page-id="579" id="579">[579]</span> </p>

He was the son of Herod in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77916" data-verses="Acts 12:1">chapter twelve</span> and was a Jew by religion. </p>
<p data-content-id="T-2PL0pYEh4xbDc26hPnTNRuN30o1T5sQX2Xs2X0xJS4o-7h7OkAAU9bwEGWRJ0lt"> Bernice, who came with Agrippa, was the sister of Drusilla, wife of Felix (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77917" data-verses="Acts 24:24">24:24</span>). She was also a sister of Agrippa, with whom she lived incestuously. This again shows the corruption of the politicians in the circle of Roman politics. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVcbpWrpMsnLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd"> Agrippa’s status was quite complicated. He had either a Jewish father or a Jewish mother. His sister Drusilla is called a Jewess in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77918" data-verses="Acts 24:24">24:24</span>. Because Agrippa was a Jew in religion, Festus was careful in talking to him concerning Jewish matters. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77919" data-verses="Acts 25:19">25:19</span> Festus said to Agrippa regarding Paul and the Jews, “They had certain questions against him concerning their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.” Here we see that Festus was cautious in referring to Judaism. </p>

<p data-content-id="dEi3MiNty6nAAPAGWPzd-IYzY2uT4h3vFUsYswGo0shYwdHBEAEWJLouEntWgmm8-"> As we have pointed out, Paul wrote Ephesians, Colossians and Philippians during his first imprisonment in Rome. It should have been after this imprisonment that he wrote Hebrews. We should not think that these Epistles were written by accident. On the contrary, they were written after a long period of consideration and preparation. I believe that the two years of being held in custody in Caesarea were a time of preparation for Paul. The more he saw of the situation concerning Jewish religion, Roman politics, and the church and compared this situation with what he had received from the Lord, the more he was burdened to <span class="pg" data-page-id="584" id="584">[584]</span> put into writing the revelation he had seen. Paul did not have the opportunity to speak what was on his heart. No doubt, he intended to find a time in a quiet environment where he could write down the revelation concerning God’s New Testament economy. He must have been looking for a chance to put into writing everything he had seen of the Lord concerning the divine economy, and then to send these writings to the churches, where they would be preserved. </p>
<p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_b8tyMGyB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> We thank the Lord that He gave Paul the time and the place to write Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews and that we have these four Epistles today. In these four books we see a number of crucial points concerning the dispensational transfer that we have been emphasizing in these messages. This dispensational transfer is a great matter. </p>

No doubt, this abolishing of the ordinances includes the ones concerning circumcision, diet, and the Sabbath. </p>
<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG9fE54ME8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> Although Christ had abolished these ordinances, James in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77948" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> still promoted them. To be sure, the ordinances abolished by Christ on the cross include the Nazarite vow. Do you not believe that when Christ abolished the ordinances He included the ordinances related to vows? If we have the proper understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77949" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77950" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span>, we shall see that what James did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77951" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> was contrary to what Christ accomplished on the cross. Christ abolished the ordinances, but James held to them and promoted them. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ju0hNCrqvawLgJip8OzJVj98Ya6nzXeqyY1W7ph4gWcVsqLVblH84SlFePYa9TjHF"> We may say that the matter of abolishing ordinances is a negative aspect of the revelation in Ephesians. On the <span class="pg" data-page-id="585" id="585">[585]</span> positive side, we have Paul’s word concerning the unsearchable riches of Christ: “To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77952" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">3:8</span>).

Although Paul was “a Hebrew of Hebrews” and “as to the law, a Pharisee” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77954" data-verses="Philippians 3:5">v. 5</span>), he could testify, “What things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ. But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77955" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-8">vv. 7-8</span>). Paul realized that in the sight of God and in the New Testament economy all the things of Judaism were refuse. Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77956" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> indicates the kind of vision that was within him.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77958" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">verse 11</span> “all” refers to all the members who compose the new man.

According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77959" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">Colossians 3:10 and 11</span>, not the slightest ground remains for Judaism. <span class="pg" data-page-id="586" id="586">[586]</span> </p>

Christ is both God and man, and He is superior to Moses, Joshua, and Aaron. As our High Priest, Christ has replaced all the Old Testament offerings with Himself as the unique offering. Christ is the only offering God cares for, and all the Old Testament offerings were simply types of this unique offering. Now that Christ has come, all the other offerings should be terminated, and in fact they have been replaced and terminated. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77960" data-verses="Hebrews 10:14">Hebrews 10:14</span> says, “By one offering He has perfected forever those who are sanctified,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77961" data-verses="Hebrews 10:18">verse 18</span> goes on to say, “Now where forgiveness of these is, there is no longer an offering for sin.” Furthermore, the old covenant has been replaced by the new covenant.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77963" data-verses="Acts 21:20">21:20</span> James said to Paul, “You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous for the law.” Then James went on to ask Paul to pay the expenses of four men who had taken the vow of the Nazarite: “Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77964" data-verses="Acts 21:23-24">vv. 23-24</span>). What a contrast there is between James’ word and Paul’s revelation concerning God’s New Testament economy! This comparison should enable us to have a clear view of Paul’s situation in these chapters of Acts. </p>

A favorite verse of those who emphasize evangelism is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77965" data-verses="Ephesians 2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>. This verse tells us that by grace we are saved through faith. <span class="pg" data-page-id="587" id="587">[587]</span> Many messages are also given from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77966" data-verses="Ephesians 5:22-25">Ephesians 5:22-25</span> about wives submitting to their husbands and husbands loving their wives. Often during a wedding a pastor will quote these verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77967" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>. But have you ever heard a message telling you that on the cross Christ abolished all the ordinances, in particular, that He abolished the differences between the races? Although the ordinances and all racial differences were abolished by Christ on the cross, who preaches this word today? Actually, even in the twentieth century, racial differences are still promoted in order to maintain a separation of the races. From this we see that the book of Ephesians is misused by many believers. They select certain verses from this book without caring for God’s New Testament economy. Many have never seen that Ephesians is a book concerned with God’s New Testament economy. </p>

As we have pointed out a number of times, in facing his opponents it was necessary for Paul to make a defense in order to save his life from his persecutors. By making such a defense to save his life, he would be able to fulfill the course of his ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="YJs94s2aJDs7VNvpUgWWi8XDyQTQT1-VL5FhVS1mIG-dzYnTnvCO7bnb1cG2qXU2E"> Paul appealed to Agrippa as being an expert in all the customs and questions among the Jews. The Greek words rendered, “Especially since you are an expert,” may also be translated, “Since you are especially expert.” </p>
<p data-content-id="hcv5kEXxGN89QArB8vSql3mKhdKtSZ3FqDgrBb1Sj0rwQMk1Q3MICXwrawWOYfQar"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77983" data-verses="Acts 26:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> Paul continued, “Now, therefore, my manner of life from my youth, which from the beginning was among my nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews know, having previously known me from the first, if they were willing to <span class="pg" data-page-id="592" id="592">[592]</span> testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.” Here Paul vindicated himself by saying that, even before his conversion, he was a proper person and lived the strict life of a Pharisee. Of course, in the sight of God Paul was not proper. But humanly speaking, he did live a proper life, and there was no ground for anyone to condemn him. </p>

Why is it judged incredible by you if God raises the dead?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77985" data-verses="Acts 26:6">verse 6</span> the Greek word translated “for” literally means “upon,” “on the ground of.” In these verses Paul indicates that, in contrast to the Sadducees, he had always believed in the resurrection. The resurrection was taught in the Old Testament, especially in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77986" data-verses="Daniel 12:1">Daniel 12</span>. It is a matter that requires our careful consideration. </p>
<p data-content-id="V2r3spEVxwhfKbT57B6X1qVfvh9iM7AzKlfSEokEfCQ9nK_LLroajaRyF4x-FONQj"> In the Bible resurrection implies the coming judgment, and judgment implies eschatology. Resurrection, therefore, is related to one’s eternal future, whether he will be happy in eternity or suffer perdition. A person’s eternal future depends upon judgment, and judgment requires resurrection. From this we see that resurrection is an important matter in the Scriptures, for it concerns our eternal destiny. Even before his conversion, Paul, as a Pharisee, believed in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="imaEGKAW_UV-YZWDWKBtvW41r615cWWlVEl_7IFkSQ3uhA1prBTmfC68eCg26DvpJ"> The Lord Jesus spoke clearly concerning resurrection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77987" data-verses="John 5:28">John 5:28</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77988" data-verses="John 5:29">29</span>: “An hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, and shall come forth: those who have done the good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done the evil to the resurrection of judgment.” We have seen that the resurrection of life is the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="77989" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">Rev. 20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77990" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77991" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:23">1 Cor. 15:23</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77992" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:52">52</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77993" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:16">1 Thes. 4:16</span>). The dead believers will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="593" id="593">[593]</span> resurrected to enjoy eternal life at the coming back of the Lord Jesus.

And in all the synagogues, punishing them often, I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even as far as foreign cities.” Literally, the Greek word translated “foreign” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="77999" data-verses="Acts 26:11">verse 11</span> means “outside.” Paul not only opposed Jesus the Nazarene—he attacked Him. In his blindness, Paul considered the Lord Jesus nothing more than a poor Nazarene. He attacked the name of Jesus the Nazarene to such an extent that he put many of the saints in prison. Now before Agrippa he confessed his foolish deeds. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jHPCvHM6AJL14sHMqOXv4rpZKdllursp8MnQXFHjxCUMf5qoYcCmTHDm7GFZatUid">THE LORD’S APPEARING</h2><p data-content-id="T-2PL0pYEh4xbDc26ivnQOxuN30o1T5sQX2Xs2X0xJS4o-7h7OkAAU9bwEGWRJ0lt"> Paul then went on to tell Agrippa that while he was on the way to persecute those who called on the name of the Lord Jesus, he himself was gained by the Lord. “Engaged in which, I journeyed to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests. And at midday, on the way, I saw, O king, a light from heaven beyond the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me. And when we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice <span class="pg" data-page-id="594" id="594">[594]</span> saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads. And I said, Who are You, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78000" data-verses="Acts 26:12-15">vv. 12-15</span>). We have strongly emphasized the fact that this “Me” is corporate, comprising Jesus the Lord and all His believers. We have also seen that spontaneously Paul called Jesus Lord, even without knowing Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVcbq2rqPMnLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd">APPOINTED A MINISTER AND A WITNESS</h2><p data-content-id="63PjdVBPG51GyPm3RWmqLeGT1y1Uj-ESJwos787hQjcxafhitczkEPKKkKzBqHe70"> When the Lord Jesus appeared to Paul, He commissioned him, appointing him a minister and a witness. Concerning this, the Lord said to him, “Rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me, and the things in which I will appear to you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78001" data-verses="Acts 26:16">v. 16</span>). Here we see that the Lord appointed Paul both a minister and a witness. A minister is for the ministry; a witness is for the testimony. Ministry is mainly related to the work, to what the minister does. Testimony is related to the person, to what the witness is. </p>
<p data-content-id="Rk893wdUx5BEGaMPI-EI_k_Y9RUXWC8S9x4OY1mdzGmnzTwz2JfO8yuVuuay8b7Zz"> We need to be impressed with the fact that what the ascended Christ wants to use to carry out His heavenly ministry for the propagating of Himself so that the kingdom of God might be established for the building up of the churches for His expression is not a group of preachers trained by man’s teaching to do a preaching work. Rather, the Lord wants to use a body of His witnesses, who bear a living testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ. According to the book of Acts, Satan could instigate the Jewish religionists and utilize the Gentile politicians to bind the apostles and their evangelical ministry, but he could not bind Christ’s living witnesses and their living testimony. The more the Jewish religionists and the Gentile politicians bound the apostles and their evangelical ministry, the stronger and brighter these witnesses of Christ and their living testimony became. In His appearing to Paul on the way to Damascus, the Lord clearly told him that He <span class="pg" data-page-id="595" id="595">[595]</span> appointed him not only a minister but also a witness. We have seen that as a living witness of Christ, Paul had testified concerning Him in Jerusalem and would testify of Him in Rome (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78002" data-verses="Acts 23:11">23:11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDt_Mdh0Mw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78003" data-verses="Acts 1:8">1:8</span> the Lord said to the disciples, “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.” Witnesses are those who bear a living testimony of the resurrected and ascended Christ in life. They differ from preachers who merely preach doctrines in letters. As recorded in Acts, the ascended Christ carries out His ministry in the heavens through these witnesses in His resurrection life and with His ascension power and authority to spread Himself as the development of the kingdom of God unto the remotest part of the earth. </p>

<p data-content-id="x9eSFP4LibV4Cj1ctXbw7bkEn3JBQvVocBHdDWoeZy9rLfhlNS3ujQEYT2LaQYowp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78038" data-verses="Acts 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> of Acts James was promoting the old things of Judaism. When he was doing this, he was in darkness. James said to Paul, “You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous for the law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78039" data-verses="Acts 21:20">21:20</span>). This word was spoken in darkness, and it indicates that James himself was blind and in darkness. Because he was in darkness, he was also under the authority of Satan. It is not too severe to say this concerning James. </p>
<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQQ4WcYyx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> Paul certainly was not blind. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78040" data-verses="Acts 21:1">Acts 21</span> he was in danger of being pulled back into darkness. Actually, for the days he was in the temple with the others for the completion of the Nazarite vow, he was in darkness. </p>

Forgiveness of sins is the base of all the blessings of the New Testament jubilee. The genuine forgiveness of sins comes through the opening of the eyes and the transfer from Satan to God. Therefore, we need to have our eyes opened and to <span class="pg" data-page-id="602" id="602">[602]</span> have a transfer from the authority of Satan to God in order to receive the complete and perfect forgiveness of sins. </p>

<p data-content-id="OxXT42mbN-_IwwC7wKQB37blOD0YMzE-XjPYijEZ2-L3hEiePh0clDIYHsHVPlhJm"> As the result of having our eyes opened and of being transferred from the authority of Satan to God, we not only have the forgiveness of sins on the negative side, but also we receive an inheritance on the positive side. This divine inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people. This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78042" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>), who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78043" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Col. 1:12</span>). The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the seal, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78044" data-verses="Romans 8:23">Rom. 8:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78045" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13-14">Eph. 1:13-14</span>), which we are sharing and enjoying today in God’s New Testament jubilee as a foretaste, and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78046" data-verses="1Peter 1:4">1 Pet. 1:4</span>). In the type of the jubilee in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78047" data-verses="Leviticus 25:8-13">Leviticus 25:8-13</span>, the main blessings were the liberty proclaimed and the returning of every man unto his own inheritance. In the fulfillment of the jubilee here, liberation from the authority of darkness and receiving the divine inheritance are also the primary blessings. </p>
<p data-content-id="4zsJheE_d4HOSMvKcuk9-uDzIerxvJwuW-PYYJI1AbMNWS7vWloR6vW_S09YYF2XO"> Believers are generally taught that the inheritance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78048" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span> is a heavenly mansion. This is what I was told as a young Christian. But after more than fifty years of studying the Bible, I have learned that this inheritance is Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. This Christ is the portion of the saints. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78049" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Colossians 1:12</span> Paul says that the Father has qualified Us “for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.” This portion is the “lot,” the inheritance, of the saints. The inheritance is a lot, and this lot is a portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="oxneY2ZOaTXocAnWD85rv1Q5zpF1Rt2cT7wfL5k5xLJLYTO0yitSMNyiatqCR0rPJ"> In the Old Testament the twelve tribes of Israel each received an allotment, a portion, of the good land for an inheritance. The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ given to us as our inheritance. Therefore, Christ, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="603" id="603">[603]</span> embodiment of the processed Triune God, is our inheritance. This inheritance is the processed Triune God fully embodied in the all-inclusive Person of Christ, who through resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit. </p>

<p data-content-id="T-2PL0pYEh4xbDc27gvnXeRuN30o1T5sQX2Xs2X0xJS4o-7h7OkAAU9bwEGWRJ0lt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78087" data-verses="Acts 27:1">chapters twenty-seven and twenty-eight</span> of Acts Luke gives us a long narration of Paul’s voyage from Caesarea to Rome. We may wonder why Luke includes such a lengthy and detailed record. In certain matters he is very brief, but the record of this voyage is very detailed and vivid. After considering this matter, I believe that the reason for this detailed account is that Luke intends to present a picture that conveys some important points. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVcao2rsf8nLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd">SATAN’S ATTACK</h2><p data-content-id="63PjdVBPG51GyPm3QUmqBMmT1y1Uj-ESJwos787hQjcxafhitczkEPKKkKzBqHe70"> The first of the points conveyed in Luke’s lengthy narrative of Paul’s voyage is Satan’s attack on the apostle. Satan was constantly behind the scene attacking Paul. This is the reason that the voyage was difficult, with many hardships, and took such a long time. The weather in particular was very bad. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78088" data-verses="Acts 27:4">Acts 27:4</span> says, “And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.” Later, after boarding an Alexandrian ship, they “sailed slowly for a considerable number of days and came with difficulty off Cnidus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78089" data-verses="Acts 27:7">v. 7</span>). Then with difficulty they came to a certain place called Fair Havens. Eventually, after putting out to sea again, “there beat down from the island a hurricane wind called a northeaster” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78090" data-verses="Acts 27:14">v. 14</span>). Satan was behind these difficulties, attacking the apostle. <span class="pg" data-page-id="608" id="608">[608]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Rk893wdUx5BEGaMPJ8EI02PY9RUXWC8S9x4OY1mdzGmnzTwz2JfO8yuVuuay8b7Zz">THE LORD’S SOVEREIGN CARE</h2><p data-content-id="T-2PL0pYEh4xbDc27gvnQMxuN30o1T5sQX2Xs2X0xJS4o-7h7OkAAU9bwEGWRJ0lt"> In the picture portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78091" data-verses="Acts 27:1-2">Acts 27 and 28</span> we also see the Lord’s sovereign care. The Lord is over all things, including the wind and the storms. The Lord was sovereign over the centurion named Julius who brought Paul to Rome and over all the soldiers who were with him. In His sovereignty, the Lord caused this centurion to show kindness to Paul. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78092" data-verses="Acts 27:3">27:3</span> says, “And on the next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends to receive care.” Probably some soldiers accompanied Paul, and it is likely that Paul was still in chains. Nevertheless, the Lord sovereignly took care of Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="nEZu_9FtTtdHBAVcao2rqNMnLMymN4WF7FskplbSJNsz9N3hKP6eI_tEwDKnoBDWd"> In His sovereignty the Lord also sent an angel to Paul in the midst of a violent storm, when those on the ship had abandoned all hope of being saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78093" data-verses="Acts 27:20">vv. 20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78094" data-verses="Acts 27:23">23</span>). Paul testified that the angel had said to him, “Do not fear, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78095" data-verses="Acts 27:24">v. 24</span>). As we shall see, this word indicates that there on the boat Paul had a little kingdom composed of two hundred seventy-six citizens. </p>
<p data-content-id="63PjdVBPG51GyPm3QUmqIemT1y1Uj-ESJwos787hQjcxafhitczkEPKKkKzBqHe70"> Luke and Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, were with Paul on the ship. Luke functioned in two ways. First, as a medical doctor, he took care of Paul’s health. Second, he functioned as a newsman to record the details of the voyage. We thank the Lord for this record. The more we read it, the more we realize how significant it is. In Luke’s detailed account of the voyage we see that the Lord overruled Satan’s attacks. Everything that happened took place at the right time so that Paul’s life was preserved. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Rk893wdUx5BEGaMPJ8EI8kfY9RUXWC8S9x4OY1mdzGmnzTwz2JfO8yuVuuay8b7Zz">PAUL’S LIVING</h2><p data-content-id="smqLrlv10U_CexYDs9Mdi1sw3QtOFa1apMMowrnGIQG4VQ4PyQP8dylC48OiKsGZx"> The picture in these chapters of Acts also shows Paul’s life, behavior, and character. We see Paul’s ascendancy over the situation. We also see the wisdom and dignity of his human life. No doubt, Paul’s life was a life of living Christ and magnifying Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="wtd4wbWwgfqz0Ew4Gy3h_wFMg5WQfLClAmyC8gJ42X7kvooCzWPYUr9aObbI4bbYQ"> If we read this portion carefully, we shall see that here Paul was living the very life that he aspired to live in <span class="pg" data-page-id="609" id="609">[609]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78096" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span>. In that chapter Paul says that he pursued Christ in order to be found in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78097" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">vv. 9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78098" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">12</span>). When I read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78099" data-verses="Acts 27:1-2">Acts 27 and 28</span>, I find Paul in Christ. Throughout a rough and difficult voyage, Paul lived a life of ascendancy and dignity and full of wisdom. Although he was a prisoner, he behaved like a king. Furthermore, he had foresight and wisdom to handle matters. </p>
<p data-content-id="LilxD0znUWS-9v8345H0VAPuzl4KnJ-MfefbTNnzPPig5LWJWb9boygxWo-Q9W1s_"> No doubt, the Lord was with Paul. On the one hand, he was a prisoner, one among two hundred seventy-six passengers. On the other hand, he was the center, the focus, of the situation, whether on the ship or on the island where they wintered after the ship was destroyed. In every circumstance Paul lived a life of ascendancy. </p>

The Augustan cohort may have been an imperial cohort named by Caesar Augustus (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78102" data-verses="Luke 2:1">Luke 2:1</span>). A cohort was one of ten divisions of an ancient Roman legion and was composed of six hundred men. </p>

<p data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97maj_U7vK6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq"> In his account Luke says that at Myra “the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78105" data-verses="Acts 27:6">v. 6</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78106" data-verses="Acts 27:9-10">Verses 9 and 10</span> say, “And when considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, and also because the Fast had already passed, Paul advised them, saying, Men, I perceive that the voyage will be with damage and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.” The Fast in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78107" data-verses="Acts 27:9">verse 9</span> refers to the day of atonement (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78108" data-verses="Leviticus 16:29-31">Lev. 16:29-31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78109" data-verses="Leviticus 23:27-29">23:27-29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78110" data-verses="Numbers 29:7">Num. 29:7</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="610" id="610">[610]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5kU3ZX8fsITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78111" data-verses="Acts 27:10">verse 10</span> Paul voiced his feeling about the danger of the voyage. The sailors were experts in sailing the ship, and they knew all about the wind and the sea, but they did not have the insight that Paul had. Although Paul warned them of the damage and loss they would face, “the centurion was persuaded by the navigator and the ship’s owner rather than by what was being said by Paul” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78112" data-verses="Acts 27:11">v. 11</span>). The navigator and the ship’s owner convinced the centurion not to take Paul’s word. Therefore, according to their mistaken concept, they continued the voyage. Paul, of course, was neither a sailor nor a navigator. Rather, he was a preacher who at that time was a prisoner. However, he had more insight than the centurion, the soldiers, the sailors, the navigator, and the owner of the ship. Here we have a view of Paul’s character. </p>

But not long afterward there beat down from the island a hurricane wind called a northeaster.” Literally, the Greek word translated “the island” means “it” and refers to Crete. </p>
<p data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBfoaD33QHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78115" data-verses="Acts 27:15-17">Verses 15 through 17</span> continue: “And when the ship was caught by it and was not able to face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. And running under the shelter of a certain little island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get control of the small boat, which having hoisted up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on Syrtis, they lowered the gear and so were driven along.” “To get control of the small boat” was to secure on deck the small boat which, in calm weather, was attached by a rope to the vessel’s stern (Vincent). The helps mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78116" data-verses="Acts 27:17">verse 17</span> were things such as ropes and chains. To undergird the ship with these helps was to pass the cables around the body of the ship. Syrtis, on which they feared that they might run aground, was a shoal southwest of the island of Crete. For the sailors to lower the gear <span class="pg" data-page-id="611" id="611">[611]</span> means either that they lowered the sails or dropped the sea anchor. </p>
<p data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGlBc6vJXUZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78117" data-verses="Acts 27:18-19">verses 18 and 19</span>, they began to jettison the cargo and throw the ship’s gear, or furniture, overboard. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78118" data-verses="Acts 27:20">Verse 20</span> indicates that the storm was so severe that eventually they lost hope: “Now, when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing us, all hope that we might be saved was now abandoned.” As we shall now see, that time was a good opportunity for Paul to say something to those on the ship. </p>

However he shook off the snake into the fire and suffered no harm.” Literally, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="616" id="616">[616]</span> Greek word for “snake” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78151" data-verses="Acts 28:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> is “beast.” But medical writers used this term to denote poisonous snakes. At first, the natives thought that Paul was a murderer because he was bitten by a viper. However, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78152" data-verses="Acts 28:6">verse 6</span> indicates, they eventually changed their minds concerning him: “But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But while they were expecting for a long time and beheld nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.” The apostle was not a god in the superstition of the curious natives, but he expressed, in his living and ministry, the true God, who in Jesus Christ has gone through the processes of the incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection and who was then living in Paul and through him as the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="rPIIIuq6UNs1JitQR6WcYwx3vJNTL_yI5nDZkWpGmI5-6-mqgA0KYzzTp1Ed_K5T_"> In his teaching as recorded in his Epistles Paul emphasized the matter of walking in the Spirit. Throughout the voyage and now on the island of Malta Paul certainly was walking in the Spirit. He surely lived a life that was the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ. Paul’s living was actually the expression of the life-giving Spirit. In every situation of his daily living, Paul was the expression of the very Christ he preached. He preached the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ as the life-giving Spirit, and on the island of Malta he lived such a Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit. This is indicated by Paul’s word, written later, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78153" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">Philippians 1:20 and 21a</span>: “According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death; for to me to live is Christ....” Paul cared only to live Christ and to magnify Him. On the island of Malta Paul lived Christ and magnified Him as the life-giving Spirit. As we read Luke’s account of Paul’s living, we see that his living was the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and God-exalted Christ. </p>

And it came about that the father of Publius was lying down sick with fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to him, and having prayed and laid his hands on him, cured him.” Dysentery was a common disease, but it was difficult to cure. However, Paul, who had been living like a king ruling over his kingdom, now became a physician to heal the father of Publius. </p>

All the sick who were brought to Paul were healed. </p>
<p data-content-id="KfuYMApRYUQYaPK3Ez8Esd83s69vqSDFO4lXkvKxZfsxjq4GOqsHLrbTiGmthzdfn"> On the sea in the storm, the Lord had already made the apostle not only the owner of his fellow voyagers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78156" data-verses="Acts 27:24">27:24</span>), but also their life-guarantee and comforter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78157" data-verses="Acts 27:22-25">27:22-25</span>).

All during his long and unfortunate imprisonment-voyage, the Lord kept the apostle in His ascendancy and enabled him to live a life far beyond the realm of anxiety, but fully dignified with the highest standard of human virtues expressing the most excellent divine attributes, a life that resembled the one that He Himself had lived on earth years before. This was Jesus living again on the earth in His divinely enriched humanity! This was the wonderful, excellent, and mysterious God-man, who lived in the Gospels, continuing to live in Acts through one of His many members! This was a living witness of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and God-exalted Christ. Paul in his voyage lived and magnified Christ. No wonder the people honored him and his companions with many honors (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78160" data-verses="Acts 28:10">v. 10</span>), that is, with the best respect and highest regard! </p>

The Lord sovereignly provided food for two hundred and seventy-six people. Any king must provide food for his people. As a king, Paul received the supplies from the natives. However, he did not owe them anything for this, because he had healed so many of the sick among them. In a sense, the people paid Paul by putting on board the food supply needed for the voyage. </p>

Rather, in these chapters we have a record of a man living Christ to the uttermost. Paul was imprisoned, bound in chains, and surrounded by guards. The sea was very stormy, and the sailing was rough. Furthermore, Paul was away from his homeland and from most of his friends. Although he was in such a difficult situation, he lived like a reigning king. </p>
<p data-content-id="XwXg7mNRWi2ahrzSUg-cLD89bSV6mZ55lp54R9_I_VOt2qothKRfAL-aS1YkJZ057"> Paul’s living as presented in these two chapters of Acts reminds us of his word written while he was imprisoned in Rome: “I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death; for to me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78222" data-verses="Philippians 1:19-21">Phil. 1:19-21a</span>). This describes Paul’s living during the voyage from Caesarea to Rome. Regardless of the situation, Paul magnified Christ in his body. <span class="pg" data-page-id="624" id="624">[624]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="kF8Mj44-oCSCcZAG8eU5weU8mqVmPhOaHPz7pxhcooKm1tU5N2R9jqwVb4vIHm7hj"> As we ponder the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78223" data-verses="Acts 27:1-2">Acts 27 and 28</span>, we see that Paul was an outstanding witness of Christ. He was the kind of witness the Lord Jesus spoke about in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78224" data-verses="Acts 1:8">1:8</span>: “You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ZuGjIAnEo5IafG53pAle3_ypiGKgO2xOWEc6_4BynTJX3LLZmIC9oRziJLF_biW7b"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78225" data-verses="Acts 1:6">1:6</span> the Lord’s disciples had asked Him if He would at that time restore the kingdom to Israel. The Lord indicated that it was not for them to know times or seasons, which the Father had placed in His own authority. Instead, after they had received power through the coming of the Holy Spirit upon them, they would be His witnesses. Paul was such a witness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78226" data-verses="Acts 27:1-2">Acts 27 and 28</span>. In these chapters Paul was living among Gentiles. There were very few Jews on the ship, if any. Everything on that voyage was Gentile. The food, the environment, and the atmosphere were Gentile. Furthermore, there was nothing Jewish on the island of Malta. Paul was surrounded by Gentiles and the Gentile way of living. But in that situation Paul lived like a king in a palace. I very much appreciate the picture of Paul’s living in these chapters. </p>
<p data-content-id="AY-SUR-EoOuNw4w4dh6DJi70E3N7TuSXEOTbw_G2bv_OjbWVvXlpJAskEmK1oKtQB"> We all should live Christ in the way Paul did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78227" data-verses="Acts 27:1-2">Acts 27 and 28</span>. If we live Christ only in a situation that is according to our culture, character, constitution, and disposition, our living is not genuine. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78228" data-verses="Acts 27:1-2">Acts 27 and 28</span> Paul lived Christ in a situation that was altogether contrary to his culture and character. Many things were disappointing and discouraging, but Paul nevertheless lived a life of the highest standard. As we have pointed out, in Paul the wonderful, excellent, and mysterious God-man, who lived in the Gospels, continued to live through one of His many members. This was Jesus living again on earth in His divinely enriched humanity. Paul’s living, therefore, was a repetition of the living of Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fo_vb9jdhvAd_97majfU4vq6u-XR7EUc0LZi59xdacMQ7EEtthBGtWM4i8U7T6HPq"> After Paul arrived in Rome as described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78229" data-verses="Acts 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span>, he wrote the Epistles of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews. Paul was imprisoned in Rome twice. The first was about A.D. 62-64, due to the Jews’ accusation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78230" data-verses="Acts 28:17-20">28:17-20</span>). During that time he wrote the Epistles <span class="pg" data-page-id="625" id="625">[625]</span> of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. After his release from the first imprisonment, it is likely that he visited Ephesus and Macedonia, and then Crete and Miletus, from where he probably wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews. Paul’s second imprisonment, about A.D. 65, was due to Caesar Nero’s sudden persecution of the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="CtCdOOyOokdSBMj5kUXZU8_sITA85HX3892l3e3HxwaICoEQZwCUvaEO75qBXgICb"> Paul passed through many things in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78231" data-verses="Acts 15:1">chapters fifteen through twenty-eight</span> of Acts. Without his experience of the events recorded in these chapters, he could not have written Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews, or he could not have written these Epistles in such a thorough way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Pslvg7-IAa_NVQEvDBKw5V8_CoTGBeJ50VN9dBndwxFlnOXWnlp6CEsVJ-FCrWQZP">THE ABOLISHING OF THE ORDINANCES</h2><p data-content-id="-XrOC7pvJ9oERyVBOR91VlWnHm69dNNUFmS-SufKGWAw-IhXPUYCMOpKheTfivOm2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78232" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14-15">Ephesians 2:14 and 15</span> Paul says, “He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.” I believe that what Paul saw and experienced in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78233" data-verses="Acts 15:1-28">Acts 15 through 28</span> caused him to write such a strong word. As he was writing this, Paul may have been saying to himself, “All the ordinances of the law have been abolished. Circumcision, the Nazarite vow, and even the vow I had have been abolished.” </p>
<p data-content-id="pDuzZeFzBFiYglBBfo6D03wHaphkI6Q6T1ojEIRUyRDyAd1NE86olgRYDTICkgjGa"> Paul may have regretted his vow in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78234" data-verses="Acts 18:1">Acts 18</span> and also his circumcising Timothy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78235" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span>. If I had been with Paul when he wrote the Epistle to the Ephesians, I might have said, “Brother Paul, I would like to learn of you. Since Christ abolished all the ordinances, why at Lystra did you still circumcise Timothy?” It is possible that if Paul had been asked such a question, he might have said, “I did that quite a while ago, and I am sorry about it. Never again will I circumcise anyone.” </p>
<p data-content-id="vj1pkDwxiyE7TIMGlB86sJ3UZvDQxhX_sxm-VzaYLYXrpf8RTbCLlRrjLTMork54L"> By the time Paul wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78236" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span>, he was much more thorough than he was when he circumcised Timothy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78237" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span>. His experiences in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78238" data-verses="Acts 15:1">chapters fifteen through twenty-eight</span> of Acts caused him to be more thorough regarding <span class="pg" data-page-id="626" id="626">[626]</span> circumcision. I do not believe that apart from his experience in these chapters, Paul could have written such a chapter as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78239" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="WktMP_M9WAYvNsyeqIzvGrxqsxvqoST8gZDhwQ3Hw6DB6TruYNeq64BZZlIP9xZ0U"> It is profitable to compare Paul’s word about circumcision in Galatians to what he says concerning the abolishing of the ordinances in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78240" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span>. Probably Galatians was written before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78241" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78242" data-verses="Galatians 6:15">Galatians 6:15</span> Paul said, “For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.” Actually, this word still leaves some amount of ground for the practice of circumcision. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78243" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> Paul’s word is absolute, and not one bit of ground remains for the practice of circumcision. </p>
<p data-content-id="2yqVjrPN-KSgTZFo7lypOuUl_C9AuQWXt14nq3KVyCXQQOt7HGmwNfMbEhh9RRWbk"> Paul learned from all that happened in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78244" data-verses="Acts 15:1-28">Acts 15 through 28</span>. I believe that while he was in custody for two years in Caesarea, he reviewed all that had taken place. As he made such a review, Paul may have said to himself, “If there is an opportunity, I would like to write another letter and say something more thorough concerning circumcision than I said in Galatians. I shall not say simply that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything. Instead, I shall say that all the ordinances, especially the ordinances regarding circumcision, have been abolished. If I could rewrite the Epistle to the Galatians, I would tell the believers that circumcision has been abolished on the cross. I would tell them not to practice circumcision, for it is offensive to the Lord, an insult to Him. We should not continue to practice anything that the Lord has abolished on the cross.” </p>
<p data-content-id="u0QmbzCd12NDmknZnaucAJjnFZ1o5X0fMyfr244YiG2lYJ8iSQvXbvKxG_QooHr6i"> In studying the Bible, we may compare Ephesians and Galatians with respect to the ordinances concerning circumcision. If we make this comparison, we shall see that what Paul says in Galatians is not as strong or as thorough as what he says in Ephesians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78245" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> Paul does not leave any ground for circumcision. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fjr20ggG2qN0Qtc2ZYAJ09GCwr9VB6cFiYuovdwvg6u_AsEZlv3GJJI-Mr4n49c51">A WARNING REGARDING THE CONCISION</h2><p data-content-id="IxCJo9O5CHJvqB6_a99yPGSB1UayeMh-kFrYEMoLUY-Rqoq9NhICDaWt1YuyWmgig"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78246" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> Paul uses a very strong negative term for circumcision: concision. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="78247" data-verses="Philippians 3:2">Philippians 3:2</span> he says, “Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of <span class="pg" data-page-id="627" id="627">[627]</span> the concision.” The word “concision” here, meaning mutilation, is a term of contempt for circumcision. Since there is no conjunction used in this verse between these three clauses, they must refer to the same class of people. Dogs are unclean (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="78248" data-verses="Leviticus 11:4-8">Lev. 11:4-8</span>), the workers are evil, and the concision are those deserving contempt. The “dogs” refer to the Judaizers. In nature they are unclean dogs, in behavior they are evil workers, and in religion they are the concision, people of shame. Paul certainly is very strong in charging the Philippians to beware of the dogs, the evil workers, the concision. Here Paul is saying that the Judaizers, those who promote circumcision, are dogs. </p>
