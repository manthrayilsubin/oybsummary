<p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvdsYwF3-7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> In the Bible there are two books which are concerned with experience rather than with doctrine. These books are Song of Songs and Philippians. Apparently these books have no relation to each other. But if we get into the depths of these books, we shall find that they are sister books and that both are concerned with the experience of Christ. For this reason, it would be helpful to study the Song of Songs along with the book of Philippians. </p>
<p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O1Dx5n4KLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> We have pointed out that four New Testament books make up the heart of the divine revelation. These books are Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. Galatians, Ephesians, and Colossians all have a similar pattern of composition. In these books Paul first presents doctrines, then experience. After setting forth a certain doctrine, Paul encourages us to walk according to that doctrine. Ephesians, for example, is written in two main parts. The first part, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90096" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapters one through three</span>, sets forth the doctrine regarding the church, the Body of Christ. But the second section, composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90097" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapters four through six</span>, is concerned with our walk according to the doctrine unfolded in the first three chapters. Since Ephesians is composed in this way, it is a book of both doctrine and experience. In principle, the same is true of Galatians and Colossians. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyFnSC1L8z0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK"> The book of Philippians, however, is different in this regard. It is not Paul’s intention in writing this book to convey doctrine. This does not mean that there is no doctrinal element in this book. All the New Testament writings have a doctrinal ingredient. But strictly speaking, <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> Philippians is not concerned with doctrine; it is concerned with the experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NCbS_igqpcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90098" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">1:20</span> Paul says, “Christ shall be magnified in my body,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90099" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">1:21</span> he declares, “To me to live is Christ.” These two statements represent the basic concept of the whole book. In this book we are charged to magnify Christ and to live Him. To magnify Christ is not only to express Him; it is to express Christ by causing Him to be enlarged. We should magnify Christ by living Him in a practical way day by day. Our daily living should be a living that lives Christ. Certain ethical teachings encourage people to live by particular virtues. The book of Philippians, however, does not charge us to live according to ethics or virtues; it charges us to live according to Christ. Christ must be everything in our daily living. He must be even such virtues as humility and kindness. </p>
<p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV387A3htRIiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> Before Paul was saved, his life was centered around the law, and he lived the law. But after he was converted to Christ and was regenerated, he began to live Christ. Christ became not only Paul’s life, but also his living. Eventually, according to his experience, Paul could declare that to him to live was Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-V7223f52MYBu9DyQ9J3bCV24DW9Jm57fbHd_yZfKDZbKPYsFs3GvbJI_KQbDX4I8">I. THE BACKGROUND</h2><p data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPRbAxYJ_y3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy"> In this message we shall consider the background and subject of Philippians. Every book in the Bible has both a background and a subject. Since the book of Philippians is concerned with the experience of Christ, some may think that there is no need to consider the background. However, even this book on the experience of Christ was written with a certain kind of background. This background is the reason the book was written. In order to get into the depths of the significance of this book, we must know its background. </p>
<p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X8cXcHXKIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> The book of Philippians does not say explicitly what the background is. But as we consider Paul’s statements and exhortations in this book, we detect certain hints regarding the background. If we read the four chapters of this book <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> carefully, we shall find four elements related to the background. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCXMv91wp16P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v">A. The Judaizers Exercising Their Influence<br/>over the Believers in Christ</h2><p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExXlY-oYu6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> At the time the book of Philippians was written, the Judaizers were exercising their influence over the believers in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90100" data-verses="Philippians 3:2-4">3:2-4</span>). The Judaizers were very strong for the Jewish religion. They not only practiced their religion, but they promoted it and even fought for it. The most zealous of the Judaizers were the Pharisees, those who were most orthodox in the religion of their fathers. As a result of the Jewish dispersion, these Judaizers were spread over the Mediterranean region. Wherever Jews were found, there would always be some Judaizers. No other group of people could match the zeal with which the Judaizers promoted their religion. Even in Philippi, a city in Macedonia, they were exercising their influence over the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadPKx_JP6oQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90101" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">3:1</span> Paul says, “For the rest, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, and for you it is safe.” This word indicates that to rejoice in the Lord is a safeguard, a security. When we rejoice in Him, we are safe. Rejoicing protects us. </p>
<p data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78Re06vlm6XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5"> When Paul wrote the book of Philippians, certain believers in Philippi were not rejoicing in the Lord, for they were being troubled or distracted by those described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90102" data-verses="Philippians 3:2">verse 2</span>. In this verse Paul says, “Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision.” On the one hand, Paul tells us to rejoice; on the other hand, he tells us to beware of the dogs. As we shall see, the “dogs” here refer to the Judaizers. </p>
<p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2IwGqhS-QfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> Today there are also “dogs” of which we need to beware. In fact, in Paul’s time there was just one group of “dogs,” the Judaizers, but today there are many different kinds of “dogs.” Whenever these “dogs” exercise their influence, perhaps by spreading evil rumors about the Lord’s recovery, we may find it difficult to rejoice. Thus, we need Paul’s exhortation to rejoice and to beware of “dogs.” According to <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> the construction of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90103" data-verses="Philippians 3:2">3:2</span>, the dogs, the evil workers, and the concision all refer to the same people. The fact that the “dogs” are associated with the evil workers and the concision indicates that the “dogs” are religious people. The evil workers mentioned here were not thieves. They were those who advocated circumcision. But as they zealously promoted circumcision, they were like barking dogs. For this reason, Paul uses the terms <em>evil workers</em> and <em>the concision,</em> as expressions of extreme contempt. As religious “dogs,” the Judaizers were not only barking ones, but also biting ones. Wherever the gospel was preached and churches were established, the Judaizers came as barking, biting, religious “dogs” to trouble the saints. The barking and biting of the Judaizers was one aspect of the background against which the book of Philippians was written. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3jYkjZItf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> Today there are a number of different groups of barking religious “dogs.” Wherever we may go, we are troubled by the different religious parties. In principle, our situation is the same as that of the Philippians when Paul wrote to them. Like the believers at Philippi, we urgently need the experience of Christ. If the Philippians were in need of the experience of Christ because of their background, how much more do we need to experience Him because of the situation in which we find ourselves today! The Philippians had to deal with only one ism, but we must deal with many isms, with many groups of barking religious “dogs.” When we rise up to speak concerning the experience of Christ, these “dogs” come to bark and to bite. The writings of the opposers, in which many false accusations are made against us, may be regarded as the “barking” of religious “dogs.” </p>
<p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllxZXm1Us6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> Because of the influence the Judaizers were exerting over the saints, Paul was compelled to warn the saints at Philippi to beware of “dogs.” It was not easy for him to utter such a word, for these barking “dogs” were his countrymen. Paul was very patriotic, and he had a deep love for the Jewish nation. This made it difficult for him to refer to certain of his countrymen as “dogs.” But the situation forced him to use such a strong expression. Even though the <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> Judaizers were among Paul’s countrymen, his kinsmen according to the flesh, he could not refrain from calling them “dogs,” “evil workers,” “the concision.” The influence of these “dogs” was an important part of the background of the book of Philippians. Since, in principle, our situation is the same today, we must consider that Philippians was written for us also. In their situation, the Philippian believers needed the experience of Christ, and in our situation today we need all the more to experience Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGx4IpxVQkIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r"> In this message we shall consider certain features of the church in Philippi. Philippi was the chief city in the province of Macedonia of the old Roman Empire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90128" data-verses="Acts 16:12">Acts 16:12</span>). Through Paul’s first ministry journey to Europe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90129" data-verses="Acts 16:10-12">Acts 16:10-12</span>), a church was raised up in this city, the first church in Europe. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVwMOPmfHBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU">I. ESTABLISHED IN GOOD ORDER</h2><p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3QBZ5_AKQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90130" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">Philippians 1:1</span> Paul says, “Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.” This verse indicates that the church in Philippi was established in good order. Notice that Paul speaks of “the saints...with the overseers and deacons.” This is the only place in the New Testament where such an expression is found. It is significant that Paul speaks of the saints <em>with</em> the overseers and deacons. In every local church the unique group consists of the saints. The saints are the components of a local church. Among the saints there are leading ones, which the New Testament describes as elders or overseers. Overseers are the elders in a local church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90131" data-verses="Acts 20:17">Acts 20:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90132" data-verses="Acts 20:28">28</span>). “Elder” denotes the person, whereas “overseer” denotes the function. When an elder functions, he exercises oversight. Hence, he is an overseer. Here overseers are mentioned instead of elders to indicate that the elders were proper in their responsibility. </p>
<p data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7CJkN6ZOr0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt"> In the second century, Ignatius taught that the overseers, or bishops, are higher than the elders. He claimed that the elders are local and that the overseers, bishops, exercise authority in an area greater than a locality. Ignatius’ <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> concept, however, is altogether contrary to the Scriptures. The New Testament indicates clearly that the elders are the overseers and that the overseers are elders. Both titles refer to the same people. When an elder is carrying out his responsibility in the church, he is functioning as an overseer. The overseers, therefore, are not a group of people different from the elders. </p>
<p data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKJwJLHNGm4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90133" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">1:1</span> Paul also mentions the deacons. Deacons are the serving ones in a local church under the direction of the overseers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90134" data-verses="1Timothy 3:8">1 Tim. 3:8</span>). The English word <em>deacon</em> is an anglicized form of the Greek word <em>diakonos,</em> which means “a serving one.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s92GGcQOZINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90135" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>, which shows that a local church is composed of the saints with overseers to take the lead and deacons to serve, indicates that the church in Philippi was in good order. Paul did not say “to all the saints and the overseers and deacons”; he said “all the saints with the overseers and deacons.” The Greek preposition rendered <em>with</em> actually means “together with.” If Paul had used the conjunction <em>and</em> instead of the preposition <em>with,</em> this would indicate that in a local church there should be three groups of people—the saints, the overseers, and the deacons. But his use of <em>with</em> indicates that there are not three such groups in the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZFDLJUZNlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> The concept of today’s organized Christianity is to have various distinct classes of people within the church. It is against the Bible, however, to have different classes of believers in a local assembly. The New Testament reveals that in a local church there is a unique group, and this group is composed of all the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82jtym8UvQAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> Writing under the leading of the Holy Spirit, Paul wrote in a deliberate, cautious way, using the preposition <em>with</em> and not the conjunction <em>and.</em> Paul’s use of the preposition instead of the conjunction is very significant. It indicates that in any locality there should be just one church, which must include all the saints in that locality. We thank the Lord that in spite of all the divisions, we have been recovered to the original standing of the church: that of one church in a <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> locality including all the saints as the unique group of people. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT8EGQn-k-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK">II. FELLOWSHIPPING<br/>IN THE FURTHERANCE OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX7sK_fTrnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> The church in Philippi also had fellowship with Paul in the furtherance of the gospel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90136" data-verses="Philippians 1:5">1:5</span> Paul speaks of “your fellowship unto the gospel from the first day until now.” <em>Fellowship</em> here means “participation, communication.” The same Greek word is translated “contribution” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90137" data-verses="Romans 15:26">Romans 15:26</span> and “sharing” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90138" data-verses="Hebrews 13:16">Hebrews 13:16</span>. The saints in Philippi had fellowship unto the gospel, participating in the furtherance of the gospel through the apostle Paul’s ministry. This participation included their financial contributions to the apostle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90139" data-verses="Philippians 4:10">4:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90140" data-verses="Philippians 4:15-16">15-16</span>), which issued in the furtherance of the gospel. This kind of fellowship, which kept them from being individualistic and diversely minded, implies their oneness with the apostle Paul and with one another. This gave them the ground for their experience and enjoyment of Christ, which is the main point of this book. The Christ-experiencing-and-enjoying life is a life in the furtherance of the gospel, a gospel-preaching life, not individualistic but corporate. Hence, there is “the fellowship unto the gospel.” The more fellowship we have in the furtherance of the gospel, the more Christ we experience and enjoy. This kills our self, ambition, preference, and choice. </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO40bRLy456Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> As the Philippian believers were sharing in the furtherance of the gospel, in the furtherance of God’s move on earth according to His economy, they were partakers with Paul of grace. Those who partake of grace are those who share and enjoy the processed Triune God as grace. The apostle was such a one in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, and the saints at Philippi were joint-partakers with him in this grace. Grace is the Triune God processed to be our enjoyment. By having fellowship unto the gospel with Paul, the Philippians enjoyed this grace. According to the expression in Greek, they became partakers of Paul’s grace, of the very grace he enjoyed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSEzsImpR8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> The church in Philippi also prayed for Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90141" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span>), made his joy full and caused him to rejoice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90142" data-verses="Philippians 2:1-2">2:1-2</span>), and supplied his material need. There is no doubt that this church was very good. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfyn95PBGb9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI">III. HAVING DISSENSIONS AMONG THEMSELVES</h2><p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuOZuojxJpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> Although the church in Philippi was established in good order and had fellowship with Paul in the furtherance of the gospel, there was nevertheless dissension among them. By this we see that it is very difficult to avoid dissension. It can exist anywhere and at any time. The source of dissension is our opinions. Opinions come from the mind, the main part of the soul. In the book of Philippians Paul speaks often of the soul, the mind, and thinking. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90143" data-verses="Philippians 1:27">1:27</span> he uses the expression <em>with one soul,</em> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90144" data-verses="Philippians 2:2">2:2</span>, the expression <em>joined in soul.</em> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90145" data-verses="Philippians 2:20">2:20</span> he uses the term <em>like-souled.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceQzHSSPCcDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> We in the church life today need to be one in the soul. Christians frequently speak of being one in the Lord or one in the Spirit, but have you ever heard believers speak of being one in the soul? Until we are one in soul, there is no practicality to our oneness. Our oneness will be that of shaking hands over the fence. Christians talk about oneness, but they still hold to their dissenting opinions. Paul’s concept of oneness was different. In Philippians he makes it clear that we need to be one in soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexKMrNU7gzqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> In order to be one in soul, we need to be transformed and renewed in our mind. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90146" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span> speaks of being transformed by the renewing of the mind. It is quite possible that your mind is very old. This may even be true of young people. But if your mind has been renewed, it will be new and fresh, even though you may be an elderly person. I can testify that Christ has never bent my mind in any way, but He certainly has been renewing it. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwFv4obKkyG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> One reason for oldness in our mind is that we remember past offenses. Years ago a certain thing may have happened to you, but you are still not willing to forget it. This means that in this particular matter you do not show forgiveness, for genuine forgiveness implies forgetting the offense. <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> Because certain saints remember offenses from the past, their mind is old. If our mind is old, it will cause us problems and lead to dissension. Therefore, it is crucial for us all to have a renewed mind. </p>

<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZFHLIQ1NlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> In this message we shall consider Paul’s suffering for the gospel and his enjoyment of grace. It is easy to understand the matter of suffering for the gospel and of enjoying grace in a natural way. However, in approaching spiritual things, we need to go beyond the natural or traditional understanding. According to the book of Philippians, to suffer for the gospel and to enjoy grace are both deep matters. </p>
<p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82jt2m9gPQAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> To suffer for the gospel means that you are on earth solely for the interest of God’s economy. To suffer for the gospel is to care for the accomplishment of God’s economy. The gospel includes God’s economy, and suffering for the gospel requires that we participate in God’s economy. Thus, to suffer for the gospel actually means to share in the carrying out of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT8ECQmaA-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> Paul’s writings indicate that he suffered for the gospel. However, the gospel for which he suffered was not low or superficial. He suffered for the gospel in the sense that he was on earth for the carrying out of God’s economy. He did not simply preach that people should believe in Jesus as their Savior so that they might go to heaven. The preaching of such a limited gospel does not entail suffering. In preaching the gospel according to God’s economy, Paul renounced religion, law, culture, ordinances, customs, habits, and every kind of ism. The gospel Paul preached slaughtered everything that was apart from God’s economy. It slaughtered religion, politics, and culture. In a sense, Paul’s gospel slaughters even us. Because Paul preached such a gospel, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> was regarded as a troublemaker, a pestilent fellow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90167" data-verses="Acts 24:5">Acts 24:5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX7sO_dHTnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> Even though his preaching of the gospel slaughtered everything contrary to God’s economy, Paul referred to the gospel as the gospel of peace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90168" data-verses="Ephesians 2:17">Eph. 2:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90169" data-verses="Ephesians 6:15">6:15</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90170" data-verses="Ephesians 2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span> Paul points out that Christ, after His crucifixion and resurrection, came to the Gentiles preaching the gospel of peace. Peace is possible only when everything contrary to the gospel has been slaughtered. In order for there to be peace between us and God and with one another, religion, politics, culture, ordinances, and the law had to be terminated. Because Paul preached a gospel that involves the slaughter of so many things, his preaching was not pleasing to men. He could please neither the Jews nor the Gentiles. Paul could please only God Himself. His preaching was an offense to religion, politics, culture, and every kind of “ism.” </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO40bVLw8F6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> If we preach the gospel in the way Paul did, we also shall suffer. But if we preach the gospel in a sugar-coated way, we shall be universally welcomed. In such a case, we shall not be those who suffer for God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3jQkjZotf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> Do not understand suffering for the gospel according to the natural concept. To suffer for the gospel, as we have pointed out, is to stand for the interest of God’s economy. As long as we remain in the Lord’s recovery, caring for the accomplishment of God’s economy, our destiny is to suffer for the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllxRXm10s6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> The gospel we preach in the Lord’s recovery is opposed to today’s religion. In our Life-study of Revelation we pointed out that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90171" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span>, Judaism is satanic, Catholicism is demonic, and Protestantism is Christless. How could such a word be pleasing to those in religion? To utter this kind of word, however, is simply to agree with the terms used by the Lord Jesus in Revelation. He was the One to use the expression “the synagogue of Satan” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90172" data-verses="Revelation 2:9">Rev. 2:9</span>). Does not such an expression indicate that, in the eyes of the Lord, Judaism has become a satanic system? Furthermore, concerning Thyatira, which signifies Catholicism, the Lord speaks of “the deep things of Satan” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90173" data-verses="Revelation 2:24">Rev. 2:24</span>). This <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> expression refers to deep, satanic mysteries. Such things certainly are demonic. Concerning Laodicea, we see that Christ is standing outside the door of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90174" data-verses="Revelation 3:20">Rev. 3:20</span>). This is the reason we say that, in a very real sense, Protestantism is Christless, for Christ is outside the door. A similar sentiment was expressed by A. W. Tozer in an article entitled “The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches.” Even Tozer’s writing indicated that Protestantism is Christless. If we preach the gospel in this way, we should expect to be opposed. In preaching the gospel, our aim is neither to please people nor to offend them. It is simply to sound forth the truth of God. However, God’s truth will slaughter many things. Therefore, those who preach the gospel for the carrying out of God’s economy on earth will suffer for the sake of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jElHBVMTba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv"> Along with suffering for the gospel, there is always the enjoyment of grace. If you suffer for God’s economy, you will have this enjoyment. I can testify that in the midst of all the opposition we face, I truly enjoy the Lord’s grace. Suffering for God’s economy brings in the supply of grace. This enjoyment of grace is related to suffering on behalf of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURBVyLjfonHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> To enjoy grace is to have the genuine experience of Christ, for the grace we enjoy is Christ Himself. I do not believe that those who preach the gospel in a way that pleases men know anything of the enjoyment of grace. To be sure, those Judaistic believers who preached the gospel in rivalry with Paul did not have the enjoyment of Christ as grace. Their preaching could not bring in Christ as grace for their enjoyment. Elsewhere we have pointed out that grace is nothing less than the Triune God processed for our enjoyment. Some may question this understanding of grace, wondering whether it is true to say that grace is the Triune God processed for our enjoyment. Consider Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90175" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>: “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all” (Gk.). Here we see the Triune God for our enjoyment. Grace, therefore, is the experience of the indwelling Christ, who is the processed God as our enjoyment. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> more we suffer for God’s economy on earth, the more we enjoy such a Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LIf9yB0sqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> If I did not speak the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90176" data-verses="Revelation 2:1-2">Revelation 2 and 3</span> concerning Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism, I could no doubt gain many friends through my preaching of the gospel. However, I would lose the enjoyment of Christ, the unique Friend. In my attempt to please people, I would displease Him. I do not care to trade Christ’s favor for man’s. Like Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90177" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span>, I am willing to count everything loss on account of Christ. I am also willing to suffer the loss of all things on account of the enjoyment of grace. I have not been commissioned by the Lord to please men. When it comes to the matter of God’s economy, there is no room for compromise. Everything contrary to God’s economy must be slain by the truth of God. Like Paul, we have no choice in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFqLbPxvtd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> According to the book of Philippians, Paul suffered not simply because he preached the gospel, but in particular because he defended the gospel and confirmed it. We have seen that the gospel is related to God’s economy, to His move on earth for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. When Paul wrote to the Philippians, certain preachers were perverting this gospel of God’s economy and distorting it. Paul rose up to declare that in the gospel of God there was no place for Judaism or for Greek philosophy. He was set for the defense of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90178" data-verses="Philippians 1:16">1:16</span>). Furthermore, Paul confirmed the gospel by preaching two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. Although others were preaching Christ, they were not for the carrying out of these mysteries. The same is true among Christians today. There is a great deal of mission work and gospel preaching, but not many preachers care adequately for Christ as the mystery of God, much less for the church as the mystery of Christ. Many prefer to avoid talk concerning the church. Therefore, there is not much confirmation of the gospel today. The Lord has burdened us not only with the defense of the gospel, but also for the confirmation <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> of the gospel. This means that we care for the carrying out of the two mysteries. For this, we are opposed. </p>

<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwFvgoa-IyG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90199" data-verses="Philippians 1:7-11">1:7-11</span> Paul uses a number of important terms. He speaks of “the defense of the gospel,” “the confirmation of the gospel,” “full knowledge,” “all discernment,” “proving by testing,” and “the fruit of righteousness.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90200" data-verses="Philippians 1:8">verse 8</span> he even refers to the “inward parts of Christ Jesus.” The key to understanding these verses and all the terms and expressions they contain is the experience of Christ. The experience of Christ is the master key which opens the door to the book of Philippians. It is proper to say that the defense of the gospel, the confirmation of the gospel, knowledge, discernment, proving by testing, purity, and the fruit of righteousness are all Christ Himself. Yes, even the defense of the gospel is Christ. If we do not have Christ, there is no way for us to defend the gospel. We can defend it only by Christ, not by eloquence. It is possible to preach the gospel and even to mention Christ quite often without having the reality of Christ in our speaking. In such a preaching of the gospel, there is no ministry of Christ to others. The way to defend the gospel is to minister Christ. Christ is also the genuine confirmation of the gospel, for He is the centrality, the focal point, of the gospel. Apart from Him, there is no confirmation of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOxDIFkTOf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> True knowledge and discernment are also Christ Himself. If we experience Christ day by day, we shall be filled with knowledge and discernment. We shall discern matters not by our natural cleverness, but by the Christ who lives within us. Our experience of Christ will make us wise and tactful. The indwelling Christ is our perceptive power. Although I was a true seeker after the Lord when I was <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> young, I did not know that Christ could be my discernment, my tact, and my perception. But through the years I have come to see that He is the very ability by which I can see into the nature of things. The indwelling Christ is my perception. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrP6LLs7uSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> In reading the book of Philippians, we need to remember that the experience of Christ is the subject and main emphasis of this book. The controlling factor enabling us to understand Philippians is the experience of Christ. Every aspect of the book is governed by this subject. This is the reason we say that the experience of Christ is the master key which opens the book of Philippians to us. If we apply this key to every verse and phrase in the book, we shall see that Paul’s concern here is nothing other than the experience of Christ. For example, in suffering for the gospel we may enjoy grace. To enjoy grace is to experience Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90201" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> Paul speaks not of grace, but of the power of Christ’s resurrection. However, the power of resurrection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90202" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span> is the very grace in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90203" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapter one</span>. Furthermore, to enter into the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings is to suffer for the gospel. This indicates that even in suffering for the sake of the gospel, we need to experience Christ. Although Paul uses many different terms in this book, his subject is one—the experience of Christ. Therefore, if we wish to understand Philippians, we need to read it in light of the fact that its subject is the experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNznYYB2NP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> In this message we shall consider the different ways of preaching Christ. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90204" data-verses="Philippians 1:15-17">1:15-17</span>, some preach Christ out of envy and strife, announcing Him out of rivalry, whereas others preach Christ out of love, with a pure motive. In this matter, today’s situation is the same as that faced by Paul in the first century. When Paul wrote to the Philippians, there were different ways of preaching Christ. The same is true today. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWb8HgnNKV307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-">I.

Even at Paul’s time there were some who preached the gospel from envy of Paul’s influence and in strife with him. As the Greek word rendered <em>strife</em> indicates, they preached Christ because of faction and partisanship. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90208" data-verses="Philippians 1:17">1:17</span> Paul goes on to say that these “announce Christ out of rivalry, not purely, thinking to raise up affliction in my bonds.” The Greek word for <em>rivalry</em> denotes “self-seeking, selfish ambition, faction.” In Greek the word <em>affliction</em> means “pressure.” Those who announced Christ out of rivalry endeavored to make Paul’s bonds press him more heavily by depreciating him and his ministry while he was laid aside outwardly from his preaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceQzfSSPicDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> Paul’s affliction in bonds was not mainly due to his preaching of the gospel, but to his defense of the gospel. The Judaizers mixed the gospel with the law and circumcision, but Paul defended the gospel. This caused the riot which put him into bonds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90209" data-verses="Acts 21:27-36">Acts 21:27-36</span>). </p>

These were the ones who had fellowship, participation, in the preaching of the gospel with Paul and worked together with him for the defense of the gospel, preaching Christ out of love. </p>
<p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOxDIFln2f9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> It is commonly thought among Christians that as long as we all believe in Christ as the Savior, worship the same God, teach the Bible, and preach the gospel, everything is all right. Although all Christians believe in the same Lord Jesus, worship the same God, teach the same Bible, and preach the gospel, they may have different ways of preaching Christ. It is very clear from Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90211" data-verses="Philippians 1:15-17">1:15-17</span> that even in the first century there were different ways of preaching Christ. Both Paul and the Judaistic believers preached Christ, but in their preaching of Him they were very different. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrP6LLtfSSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> Because there are different ways of preaching Christ, we need knowledge and discernment. This was the reason Paul prayed for the Philippians that their “love may abound yet <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> more and more in full knowledge and all discernment” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90212" data-verses="Philippians 1:9">1:9</span>). We need discernment concerning the different preachings of Christ. Christians all over the world are preaching Christ. However, we should not think that simply because all are preaching the same Christ, everything is fine. We need to realize that there are different ways of preaching Christ and discern between them. Hence, we are burdened in this message to cover the matter of the different ways of preaching Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNznYYDi9P4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> Concerning the gospel, Paul uses in Philippians several significant terms: “fellowship unto the gospel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90213" data-verses="Philippians 1:5">1:5</span>), “the defense and confirmation of the gospel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90214" data-verses="Philippians 1:7">1:7</span>), “the advancement of the gospel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90215" data-verses="Philippians 1:12">1:12</span>), “the faith of the gospel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90216" data-verses="Philippians 1:27">1:27</span>). We all need to have a clear understanding of these aspects of the gospel and not take them for granted. Whenever we read these expressions in Philippians, there should be a deep response within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWb8HglJ-V307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> Christians often speak of preaching the gospel; however, seldom do we hear believers talk of having fellowship in the gospel or unto the gospel. Even we ourselves are not very familiar with this term or accustomed to using it. The term “fellowship unto the gospel” may seem like an utterance in a foreign language. This indicates that we are still under the influence of our religious background, not adequately familiar with Paul’s terminology concerning the gospel. Let us learn to use Paul’s language with respect to the gospel. Let us speak of the fellowship of the gospel, the defense of the gospel, the confirmation of the gospel, the advancement of the gospel, and the faith of the gospel. </p>

In this message we shall consider the first of these expressions, “the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.” </p>

THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY</h2><p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfpTQS-8_2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90225" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> Paul says, “I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.” The words <em>bountiful supply</em> are not simply a translation of the Greek, but an interpretation of the Greek term used. Literally, the Greek word refers to the supplying of all the needs of the chorus by someone known as the choragus, the leader or director of the chorus. The Greek word Paul uses thus implies a bountiful supply. The choragus supplied all the needs of everyone in the chorus, the needs for food, clothing, lodging, and musical instruments. The supply of the choragus truly was bountiful, even all-inclusive. Once a person had joined the chorus, there was no need for him to be concerned about the necessities of life; the choragus would supply whatever he needed. In using the expression “the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,” Paul likens the supply of the Spirit to that of the choragus. Therefore, to have a proper understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90226" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span>, we need the word <em>bountiful</em> with the word <em>supply.</em> This bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit was for Paul to live Christ and magnify Christ in his sufferings <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> for Him. The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is bountiful and all-inclusive. What we have today is not a partial supply, but a bountiful, all-inclusive supply. </p>

This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord’s incarnation, but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord’s resurrection, compounded with the Lord’s incarnation (humanity), human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. The holy anointing ointment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90228" data-verses="Exodus 30:23-25">Exodus 30:23-25</span>, a compound of olive oil with four kinds of spices, was a full type of this compound Spirit of God, who is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Here it is not the Spirit of Jesus as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90229" data-verses="Acts 16:7">Acts 16:7</span> (Gk.), nor the Spirit of Christ as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90230" data-verses="Romans 8:9">Romans 8:9</span>, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus is mainly for the Lord’s humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is mainly for the Lord’s resurrection. To experience the Lord’s humanity, as illustrated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90231" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-8">Philippians 2:5-8</span>, we need the Spirit of Jesus. To experience the power of the Lord’s resurrection, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90232" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">3:10</span>, we need the Spirit of Christ. In his suffering, Paul experienced both the Lord’s suffering in His humanity and the Lord’s resurrection. Hence, the Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God. Such a Spirit has, and even is, the bountiful supply for a person like Paul, who was experiencing and enjoying Christ in His human living and resurrection. Eventually, this compound Spirit of Jesus Christ becomes the seven Spirits of God, who are the seven lamps of fire before His throne to carry out His administration on earth for the accomplishment of His economy with the church, and who are the seven eyes of the Lamb for the transfusing of all that He is into the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90233" data-verses="Revelation 1:4">Rev. 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90234" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90235" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">5:6</span>). </p>

The Spirit of God was there from the beginning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90246" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Gen. 1:1-2</span>), but “the Spirit” as the Spirit of Jesus Christ was “not yet” at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90247" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>, because the Lord had not yet been glorified.

This term—“the Spirit”—is used often by Paul in his Epistles and by John in the book of Revelation.

However, the reality of this aspect of the Spirit is found in the Scriptures. The same is true of the Trinity. Although this term cannot be found in the Bible, it cannot be reasonably denied that the Bible reveals that God is triune. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90248" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> speaks of baptizing people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, a clear indication that God is triune. Another indication is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90249" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>, which <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> speaks of the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit (Gk.). Based upon the fact that, according to the Bible, God is triune, the term <em>Trinity</em> is used. In the same principle, based upon the facts in Scripture, we may properly speak of the Spirit as the compound Spirit. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90250" data-verses="Exodus 30:23-24">Exodus 30:23-24</span>, a hin of olive oil was compounded with four spices to produce the holy anointing oil, the holy ointment. In typology, oil signifies the Spirit of God, and the compound ointment, the oil blended with four spices, signifies the Holy Spirit. Through a compounding process, the oil became an ointment and was used to anoint the tabernacle and everything related to it. Even the priests were anointed with this holy ointment. Before <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90251" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>, this compound ointment was “not yet,” but after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90252" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span>, such an ointment was definitely in existence. In like manner, before Christ was crucified, resurrected, and glorified, the Spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was “not yet.” But through the process of Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God, typified by the oil, became the compound Spirit, typified by the ointment. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90260" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span> Paul said, “According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.” In Paul’s bodily sufferings, Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared great (shown to be without limitation), exalted, and extolled. His sufferings afforded him opportunity to express Christ in His unlimited greatness. Only Christ would he have magnified in him, not the law or circumcision. Philippians is concerned with the experience of Christ. To magnify Christ under any circumstances is to experience Him with the topmost enjoyment. </p>

MAGNIFYING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadPKt_IrGoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90261" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span> a number of expressions are related to Paul’s statement that Christ would be magnified in him: “with all boldness,” “as always,” “even now,” “in my body,” “whether through life or through death.” Paul does not simply say “with boldness,” but says “with all boldness.” Then he specifically points out that Christ would be magnified in his body. He said this because his body was in chains. At least during the night, if not all the time, Paul was chained to a guard. Nevertheless, even though his body was in chains, Christ would be magnified in his body. Moreover, Christ would be magnified whether through life or through death. This indicates that no matter what the circumstances were, Paul expected Christ to be magnified in him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78Reo6txW6XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5"> Now we must consider what it means to magnify Christ. The word <em>magnify</em> means to make something large to our sight. Perhaps you are wondering how Christ can be magnified since He is already universally great. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90262" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span>, the dimensions of Christ—the breadth, length, height, and depth—are immeasurable. They are the dimensions of the universe. Although Christ is vast, extensive, and immeasurable, in the eyes of the praetorium, the imperial guard of Caesar, Christ was virtually nonexistent. In their eyes, there was not such a person as Jesus Christ. However, Paul magnified Christ; he made Him great before the eyes of others, especially before the eyes of those who guarded him in prison. As a result, some eventually turned to Christ. Evidence of this is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90263" data-verses="Philippians 4:22">4:22</span>, where Paul speaks of the saints of Caesar’s household. Through Paul’s magnification of Christ, even some in Caesar’s household were saved. </p>
<p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2IwG2hQ6kfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> At the time of Paul’s imprisonment, the Jews were despised by the Romans. The Romans were the conquerors, and the Jews were the conquered ones. Among these conquered ones there was a man named Jesus. Although He is great and most wonderful, in the eyes of the Romans He was nothing. But as Paul was held captive in a Roman prison, he magnified Christ, making Him to appear great in the eyes of his captors. </p>
<p data-content-id="nHBw_AdnQIfkqKVM8Tgl0tVT-YUB7CZbTRLJRhNrPdZcnD6qmiGxxSQio_uvcr2U-"> In our daily living we also should magnify Christ, making Him great in the eyes of others. Where you work or go to school people may look down on Christ. They may ridicule Him and take His name in vain, in violation of the third commandment. Therefore, you need to let others see Christ not in a small way, but in the way of enlargement, of magnification. </p>
<p data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wEaf0prsWrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J"> We should also magnify Him at home. The parents of some of the young people may not believe in Christ, but rather may despise Him. Hence, these young people must bear the responsibility to enlarge Christ before their parents. Instead of simply preaching to their parents about Christ, they need to magnify Him. We need not simply the life within, but also the living without. Through the proper <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> living Christ will appear to be great in the eyes of others. Young people, let your parents see Christ’s greatness in you. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-jfN0rLEqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI"> We can magnify Christ even in situations where we have little or no liberty to speak about Him. Although teachers may not be able to preach the gospel to their students, they can magnify Christ in the classroom. They can cause Christ to appear great in the eyes of their students. I do not believe that when Paul was in prison, he was free to do much preaching of Christ. On the contrary, he was very limited and under strict control. However, even in such circumstances, Christ was magnified in his body. With all boldness Paul sought to magnify Him always. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRNBCflotMnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY"> Paul says that Christ would be magnified in him whether through life or through death. No matter what faced him—the opportunity to go on living or martyrdom—Paul expected to magnify Christ. In his living Paul magnified Christ. This is to magnify Him through life. As he was expecting to be martyred, he also magnified Him. This is to magnify Christ through death. Thus, whether through life or death, Christ was magnified in Paul’s imprisoned and chained body. Obviously this is not mere doctrine; it is the genuine experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvlXUg_8MXkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90264" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">verse 19</span> Paul mentions the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. If we allow the bountiful supply of the Spirit to work in us, our daily living will be changed. We shall be burdened to magnify Christ always and with all boldness. Through our magnifying of Christ, others will see His greatness and His unlimitedness. To magnify Christ in such a way surely is to live Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="LY3b3GAWOFJOmvN2cbErBRxwrAjFnQOHD62ke0j8mOyinQzXo2YxW2fi2ufAiHKu1"> At the time Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was an elderly person. No doubt, the guards expected him to be exhausted by his imprisonment. But far from being exhausted, Paul was full of joy and rejoicing in the Lord. I am confident that he was shining forth Christ and expressing Him. Such an expression was a declaration of the unlimited greatness of Christ and a declaration that Christ is inexhaustible. <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="mIS7O7a-NT_KDOKl-0XRFQVGIiRfbbtK_H0Cio96dDINunJF9QeGmdjRtCHl84RqP"> Our love is eventually exhausted, but Christ as love is inexhaustible. Likewise, our natural patience is limited, but Christ as our patience is without limit. We all have the capacity to be patient, but only to a certain extent. Then we become provoked and angry. For example, a brother may exercise patience with his wife. Eventually, however, this patience reaches its limit, and he becomes angry with her. Although our natural patience is so limited, Christ as patience is inexhaustible and immeasurable. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfpTcS_YL2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> Even though Paul must have been mistreated in prison, he could be happy and display to the guards the unlimited greatness of Christ. In particular, Paul displayed Christ’s inexhaustible patience. Christ certainly was magnified in Paul’s physical body. Day by day, Paul was happy in the Lord. His happiness did not diminish as time went by. In his happiness he could show forth the immeasurable Christ he experienced and enjoyed. By this way Paul expressed, exhibited, exalted, and extolled Christ. I do not believe that Paul was offended by the jailers or that he offended them. Rather, he was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure. The guards may have considered Paul to be strange or peculiar, viewing him as possessing something which they did not have. What they sensed in Paul was Christ magnified. While he was in prison, Paul expressed the greatness of Christ in an enlarged way. He magnified Christ with all boldness both through life and through death. By magnifying Christ in this way, Paul could overcome any situation. </p>

It indicates that what is to follow is an explanation of the preceding verse. Christ could be magnified in Paul’s body because Paul lived Christ. In order to magnify Christ, we must live Him. Although the matter of living Christ is of such tremendous importance, not many Christians have paid adequate attention to it.

Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90278" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span> opens with the words <em>according to my earnest expectation and hope.</em> This phrase modifies <em>salvation</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90279" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">verse 19</span>. With a full hope, Paul expected to enjoy salvation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90280" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">Verse 20</span> indicates that the salvation Paul expected to enjoy was that in nothing he would be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, Christ would be magnified in his body. </p>

Paul had good reason to worry and be sad. Since his circumstances were so difficult, he could have easily wept about his situation. However, if Paul had been weeping instead of rejoicing, he could not have said, “For me this shall turn out to salvation.” If he had wept, he would not have experienced salvation in that environment. Suppose you were a Jew held captive in a <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> Roman prison. Would you have rejoiced? I am sure we all would have felt sorrowful and homesick. But instead of weeping, Paul rejoiced in the Lord. For him, everything that happened turned out to salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nffCtx4C0ZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> According to the context of these verses, salvation means that Paul was not put to shame in anything. Not only did he not feel shameful, but nothing caused him to be put to shame. Christ was magnified in Paul’s body. This magnification of Christ, spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90281" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span>, is the very salvation mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90282" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">verse 19</span>. This means that the salvation which was according to Paul’s earnest expectation and hope was that he would not be put to shame, but would magnify Christ in his body. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90283" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span> we have a definition of the practical enjoyment of salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvdsAwG3-7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> To enjoy this kind of salvation is to live Christ. This is the reason Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90284" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">verse 21</span>, “For to me to live is Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMQxuJHlRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> Paul’s sufferings did not put him to shame. Instead, they afforded him an opportunity to magnify Christ. If we experience the salvation mentioned in these verses, then when we undergo suffering, we shall magnify Christ and not be put to shame. But if we are defeated by suffering, suppressed by it, and filled with worry, we shall be put to shame. But if we magnify Christ in sufferings, we shall experience this salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP-5EQ5VP3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> One day the wife of a certain brother died. Her death was a great loss to her husband and children. If in our contact with this brother we had seen nothing but sorrow and tears, we would have had a sense of shame. In such a case, the loss of his wife would have brought him into shame, and there would have been no manifestation of Christ and no magnification of Him. As a result, there would have been no experience of salvation. Rather, the brother’s experience in grieving over the loss of his wife would not have been different from the experience of an unbeliever. However, with this brother the situation was very different. He could rejoice, praise the Lord, and testify of the Lord’s grace. Truly in his situation the Lord was manifested and magnified, and the brother experienced salvation. In this experience of <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> salvation, the brother was saved in his suffering from the loss of his wife. Furthermore, this salvation enabled the brother to magnify Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8JluabVErEB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> The experience of this brother in magnifying Christ after the loss of his wife illustrates Paul’s experience in prison. Although he was a prisoner in a foreign country, his suffering did not put him to shame. According to Paul’s earnest expectation and hope, Christ was magnified in him, and Paul enjoyed the Lord’s salvation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGx4cpwR0kIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r">THE KEY TO PAUL’S EXPERIENCE</h2><p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVwMaPnr_BvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> The key to Paul’s experience of salvation was the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Everything that happened to Paul turned out to salvation through this bountiful supply. Between salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90285" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">verse 19</span> and the magnifying of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90286" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span>, we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Actually, in our experience, salvation, Christ, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit are one. But if we would enjoy Christ and experience Him as our salvation in every circumstance, we need the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Just as this Spirit dwelt in the apostle Paul during his imprisonment, He also dwells within us today. Through the supply of such a Spirit, Paul enjoyed salvation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3QVZ4b8KQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak">THE CONTRAST BETWEEN CHRIST AND GAIN</h2><p data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7CJwN4N-r0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90287" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">verse 21</span> Paul says, “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.” In this verse we have a contrast between Christ and gain. Some may think that the gain here refers to Christ. Although in a sense it may refer to Christ, it refers to Christ in a different way, not to the Christ we experience by living Him. In a practical way, the gain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90288" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">verse 21</span> is the presence of Christ. When Paul said, “To die is gain,” he meant that to die is to enjoy Christ’s presence in a better way. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90289" data-verses="Philippians 1:23">verse 23</span> Paul says that his desire is to depart and to be with Christ. To be with Christ is a matter of degree, not of place. While Paul was desiring to be with Christ in a higher degree, he was already with Him continually. Through his <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> physical death, he would be with Christ to a fuller extent than he enjoyed in this earthly life. </p>
<p data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKJwdLFJym4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO"> When Paul was in prison, he enjoyed Christ and experienced Him in two ways. One way was to enjoy the presence of Christ, and the other way was to live Christ. There is a vast difference between enjoying the presence of Christ and living Christ. For example, I may enjoy my wife’s presence, but I cannot live her. By this we see that we may enjoy a person’s presence without living that person. Paul not only enjoyed the Lord’s presence, but he also lived Him. He knew that when he died he would have no further opportunity to live Christ, but he would enter into a higher enjoyment of the presence of Christ. Therefore, to die would be gain. What Paul valued was not only the presence of Christ, but also the opportunity to live Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAUI9vdXNIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> Throughout the centuries, Christians have been encouraged to practice the presence of the Lord. However, there has been little encouragement, if any, to live Him. Many believers are familiar with the famous book <em>The Practice of the Presence of God</em> and have been encouraged by it to endeavor to live in God’s presence. However, the concept of practicing the presence of God is mainly an Old Testament concept, not a New Testament one. Yes, according to the New Testament, we may enjoy the Lord’s presence on the one hand. But, on the other hand, we should practice living Him. We have not only the Lord’s presence, but we also have His Person. Not only do we need to be in His presence; we also need to be one person with Him and live Him. To live Christ is a much deeper experience than simply to be in His presence. Living Him goes far beyond the enjoyment of His presence. </p>

If we would have a proper understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90303" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">Philippians 1</span> and the extraordinary expressions used in it, we need to see that the controlling concept, the governing factor, of the whole book is the experience of Christ. We should interpret Paul’s expressions not according to our natural understanding, but according to Christ. Virtually every point in this book is related to Christ and the experience of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMQNuIzNRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U">EXERCISING BOTH SPIRIT AND SOUL</h2><p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP-54Q4xj3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90304" data-verses="Philippians 1:27">1:27</span> Paul says, “Only conduct yourselves worthily of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent I may hear the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together in the faith of the gospel.” We need not only to stand firm in one spirit for the experience of Christ, but also to strive together with one soul in the faith of the gospel. To be with one soul for the gospel work is more difficult than to be in one spirit for the experience of Christ. This requires that, after being regenerated in our spirit, we be transformed in our soul, especially in our mind, which is the main part, the leading part, of our soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8JlumbXQLEB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90305" data-verses="Philippians 1:27">1:27</span> Paul charges the Philippians to stand firm in one spirit and to strive with one soul. Nowhere else in the Bible are the terms <em>spirit</em> and <em>soul</em> used together in this way. Concerning our standing, we need to be firm in one spirit; concerning striving together, we need to be with one soul. We <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> need to exercise both our spirit and our soul. We exercise our spirit to stand firm, and we exercise our soul to strive together in the faith of the gospel. To strive here is to struggle, to work by fighting. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGx4gpyVQkIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r">STANDING BY STRIVING</h2><p data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUkhnWqZH3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3"> It is important to see that we stand in one spirit and strive with one soul. We need to differentiate between the prepositions in and with. In one spirit we stand; with one soul we strive. We stand before God, but we strive before man. Before God we must stand as a testimony, and before man we must strive together with one soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="F0dlBCvTMMHz8TZjDG814kTWLwtQrG2Fp97z5APngXAwWFiOr0CkhKKWbXwwhx9XD"> Actually, according to the grammatical construction of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90306" data-verses="Philippians 1:27">verse 27</span>, standing firm in one spirit and striving together with one soul are not two separate things. Paul does not charge the Philippians to stand firm in one spirit and then to strive together with one soul. Rather, he charges them to “stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together.” Paul’s way of writing indicates that in order to stand firm, we need to strive. Striving is in fact part of standing. We stand firm in one spirit by striving together with one soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAN6o0k4ZK4wbCUGR_Vjs0Ec696PyQIm6bi8inm71-o9jsQfmolIoHnVNoOiMyBxz"> What is the difference between “in one spirit” and “with one soul”? Why does Paul not say “with one spirit” and “in one soul”? And why does Paul say “stand firm...striving together” instead of “stand firm and strive together”? Let me use a simple illustration. Suppose a father says to his son, “Eat quickly, using your fork properly.” This is different from saying, “Eat quickly and use your fork properly.” In the first command, using the fork properly is the way to eat quickly. In the second, eating quickly and using the fork properly are two distinct matters. Because of the background, Paul did not tell the Philippians to stand firm and strive, but to stand firm, striving together with one soul. Because the Judaizers were so active, it was necessary for the believers to stand firm and not be distracted, shaken, or moved. Such a firm standing was especially necessary during Paul’s absence. Paul, the one who could establish the believers, was away from them, but the Judaistic teachers, <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> those who were preaching contrary to God’s economy, were at hand. This was the reason that toward the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90307" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapter one</span> Paul charged the believers to stand firm. However, if they were to stand firm, they would have to strive together with one soul. Apart from striving, they would not be able to stand. Therefore, in this case striving is not a thing separate from standing. Rather, striving is the standing in actuality. </p>
<p data-content-id="PlrvbBpD2zxx_8-X698IQTc85TnaKgOnF52HYJhkJHFcO4Qc_4xEevBqOsx5k1dpA"> If we today only stand but do not strive, eventually we shall be shaken by the opposition or moved by it. It is not adequate simply to encourage others to stand firm. I repeat, in order to stand firm, we must strive and fight. Striving is the way to stand. Actually, to strive is to stand. Another way of putting it is to say that in order to have a defense, we need to be on the offensive. If we do not know how to go on the offensive, we shall not have an adequate defense. If we would defend ourselves, we must take the offensive against Satan. The point here is that defense requires offense. This is the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90308" data-verses="Philippians 1:27">1:27</span> Paul does not make standing firm a separate matter from striving together. Instead, he indicates that these two matters are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="-V7223f52MYBu9DyQ9J3bCV24DWZJm5rfbHd_yZfKDZbKPYsFs3GvbJI_KQbDX4I8"> In some places the churches are standing firm. However, they are not doing much striving. If these churches do not begin to strive and fight, eventually they will be shaken or moved. All the churches need to be aggressive. By striving in this way, they will be able to maintain their stand. But if the churches do not strive, sooner or later they will be shaken and moved. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPRbkxYJvy3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy">NOT DRAWN OUT OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X8czcHXaIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> If we would stand firm, we must be in one spirit. If we would strive together, we need to be with one soul. In our experience we realize that there is a great difference between being in one spirit and being with one soul. Whenever the church is attacked and opposed, we need to stand firm. Where do we stand firm? We stand firm in spirit. If we do not stay in our spirit, we shall be divided. First opinions will enter in, then there will be dissension, and eventually division will come about. Even if three brothers are together <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> and do not remain in the spirit, they will eventually be divided. The different opinions, thoughts, and concepts will lead to dissension, and this dissension will undermine the oneness and cause division. Therefore, we can stand firm only if we are in spirit. In no other organ of our being can we stand firm. </p>
<p data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCXML91w516P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v"> If we consider our experience, we shall realize that if we are drawn out of the spirit when we are opposed or attacked, doubts and questions will rise up within us. Suppose the Philippian believers did not remain in the spirit when they were opposed by the Judaizers. They might have had doubts or questions about Paul. They might have wondered if Paul had told them all the truth, or they might have thought that the Judaistic preachers had something more that they needed. Such doubts and questions do not have their source in the spirit. When we return to our spirit, stay there, and close our being to negative questions and doubts, there are no problems. </p>
<p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExXl8-oYe6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> Throughout the years we have been attacked. The enemy attacks constantly and refuses to let us go. During times of attack or opposition, we may be pulled out of the spirit. If we realize that this is our situation, we must immediately return to our spirit and close the door to Satan’s attack. To remain in the spirit in this way is to stand firm in the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadPKV_JPKoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> During the years I was with Brother Nee in China, I saw how many attacks came upon him. In those days he was the umbrella, and I was one under the umbrella. Because he was the umbrella, the rain beat down on him, not on me. Sometimes, when the attacks first came, doubts would creep into my being. This would happen especially early in the morning or late at night. Occasionally the thought would come that perhaps we are wrong in certain matters. Whenever I detected such an inroad of the enemy, I would return to the spirit and exercise my spirit to pray. Then I could stand firm in one spirit. During times of attack and opposition, it is crucial that we remain in spirit. Only our spirit can keep us together at such times. We need to stand firm not with one spirit, but in one spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="69" id="69">[69]</span> </p>

Paul could rejoice over the Philippians, but something about them kept him from rejoicing in a full way. Paul could say, “Philippians, I have joy concerning you, but my joy is not full. There is something among you which hinders me from rejoicing in a full way. I beg you to make my joy full.” </p>
<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZFvLLQ1NlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90328" data-verses="Philippians 2:1-4">Philippians 2:1-4</span> was obviously written by an experienced person, full of maturity. The tone of Paul’s words is tender and soft. Because of the way Paul wrote these verses, most readers of Philippians do not understand them adequately. This is especially true of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90329" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">verse 1</span>. What is Paul talking about in this verse? Why does he inquire if there is any encouragement in Christ, any consolation of love, any fellowship of spirit, or any tenderheartedness and compassions? Paul was saying that if the Philippians had such things for him, they would make his joy full. If they had any encouragement, consolation, fellowship, tenderheartedness and compassions, they would be eager to cause the apostle Paul to rejoice in full. </p>
<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAUIFvdXtIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> These words could not have been uttered by a young man. A young person would have spoken in a strong, direct way, saying, “Philippians, do you love me? If you love me, you must encourage me.” The tone would have been harsh instead of soft. Paul’s tone and expression testify of his maturity. He appealed to them and begged them to respond to his fellowship. He had given them such positive fellowship in the preceding chapter. Now he wanted them to return this fellowship. Such a return of fellowship would be the believers’ support to the apostle. Their encouragement, consolation, and tenderheartedness would support Paul in his imprisonment. </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY3pTqSRIHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> Although Paul was a prisoner, his concern was not for his imprisonment. Instead, he was concerned about the attitude of the believers and for the kind of spirit they had toward him. Nothing hurt the apostle as much as a negative attitude <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> of the believers toward him. In other words, Paul was not troubled by his imprisonment, but he was troubled by the situation among the believers in Philippi. He was very concerned about their spiritual condition. Therefore, Paul appealed to the Philippians to make him happy to the uttermost. Paul needed their encouragement, consolation, and fellowship to be a support to him. If the Philippians would render him such support, they would make his joy full. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG7koQaLyxa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj">THINKING THE ONE THING</h2><p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgwMKRJs96q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> The way the Philippians could make Paul’s joy full was to think the same thing, even the one thing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90330" data-verses="Philippians 2:2">2:2</span>). According to the context of the entire book, the one thing must refer to the subjective knowledge of Christ and experience of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90331" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">1:20-21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90332" data-verses="Philippians 2:5">2:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90333" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-9">3:7-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90334" data-verses="Philippians 4:13">4:13</span>). Christ, and Christ alone, should be the centrality and universality of our entire being. Our thinking should be focused on the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and the experience of Christ. Anything else causes us to think differently and thus creates dissensions among us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s92GqcQOJINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> What troubled Paul in his imprisonment was the dissension among the Philippians. The saints in Philippi were good, and the church in that city had been well established. However, there was dissension among them. Although they were one in spirit, they were not striving together with one soul. Although they all loved the Lord, they were not thinking the same thing. This caused Paul’s heart to be heavy. Out of heaviness of heart, he appealed to the Philippians to make his joy full by being joined in soul and by thinking the same thing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZFvLJUJNlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt">HAVING THE SAME LOVE</h2><p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82jtem8U_QAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> Thinking the same thing is related to having the same love. Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90335" data-verses="Philippians 2:2">verse 2</span> about “having the same love” indicates that, because of their dissenting thinking, the Philippian believers had different levels of love. They did not have the same love toward all the saints for the keeping of oneness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="76" id="76">[76]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT8EqQn-0-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> It is possible that we in the church life today may not have the same love for all the saints. Instead, our love may be on different levels. We may love a certain brother much more than we love another brother. Because we may love a particular brother only to a small degree, we may not be inclined to render much service to him. But because we love another brother to a very high degree, we may serve him too much and even spoil him by our love. It is possible in the church life to have different levels of love for different saints. If this is our situation, our love is not the love with one soul. We have one kind of soul when we love one brother, but a different kind of soul when we love another brother. As a result, instead of practical oneness, there will be dissension. </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX7sm_fTbnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90336" data-verses="Philippians 2:2">2:2</span> Paul also speaks of being joined in soul. This indicates that the dissension among the Philippians was due to their not being joined in soul, not thinking the one thing in their mind, the leading part of the soul. Their problem was not with their spirit, but with their soul, especially with their mind. They had Christ in their spirit through regeneration, but they did not have Christ fully in their soul through transformation. Only by having Christ saturate and occupy their entire soul could they be made one in soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO40b9Ly4J6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> The Philippians had been joined in spirit, but they had not been fully joined in soul. To have different levels of love is a sign that we have not been joined in soul. If we have been joined in soul, we shall have the same love for all the saints. </p>

Rivalry and vainglory may lie hidden among us. Even when we testify in the church meetings, there may be <span class="pg" data-page-id="77" id="77">[77]</span> rivalry. Perhaps when you share, not many saints say amen. But when someone else shares, the saints are very responsive, and there are many amens. Disappointed by the situation, you may decide never to share again in the meetings. Thus, in giving testimonies there may be rivalry. Even when we share our experiences of Christ, a feeling of rivalry may be hidden within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuOZCojBhpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> Some brothers have advised the saints to say amen to the weaker ones in order to encourage them, but not to say amen as much to the strong ones. This kind of encouragement simply feeds the flesh and strengthens the soul. </p>

This appeal is not confined to the first four verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90346" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span>, but includes all of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90347" data-verses="Philippians 2:1-16">2:1-16</span>. It concludes with Paul’s word about holding forth the word of life so that in the day of Christ he could boast that he had not run in vain nor labored in vain. </p>

Suppose the Philippian believers had a very positive attitude toward Paul, respected him, and loved him to the uttermost, but did not take his charge concerning the experience of Christ. The apostle still would not have been happy, even though the saints had such an excellent attitude toward him personally. The only thing that could make the apostle’s joy full was for the saints to take his word to experience Christ adequately and normally. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexKcjNWfIzqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90348" data-verses="Philippians 2:2">2:2</span> Paul tells the saints to think the same thing and the one thing. To think the same thing is to have our minds occupied with Christ and saturated with Him. Our mind should be occupied by Christ not merely in an objective, doctrinal way, but in a subjective, experiential way, in the way of allowing Christ to spread from our spirit into our mind and to take full possession of our mind, even to saturate our mind with His. If our mind is saturated with the mind of Christ, our mind will be wholly set on the spirit. Then we shall be those who have been occupied, permeated, and saturated by Christ and with Christ. If this had been the condition of the believers in Philippi, Paul would have <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> been extremely happy. His joy concerning them would have been full. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwF_woZ-IyG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> I repeat, Paul would not have been happy simply if the Philippians had a positive attitude toward him. He wanted them to allow Christ to possess them, and he was eager for them to grow in life. If the believers did not allow Christ to saturate them with Himself, Paul would have been troubled no matter how proper their attitude was toward him. Paul’s desire was that all the saints would be occupied with Christ and thereby think the same thing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExX1c-oY-6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q">SATURATED WITH CHRIST TO THINK THE SAME THING</h2><p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadPa1_JPqoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> It is not possible for us to think the same thing unless Christ saturates our mind and occupies our thinking. Then we shall spontaneously think the same thing, even the one thing. Apart from being saturated with Christ in this way, no two people, not even a husband and wife, will be able to think the same thing. Nevertheless, it was Paul’s appeal and expectation that the whole church in Philippi would think the same thing. He begged the Philippians that, if they had encouragement, consolation, love, tenderheartedness, and compassion toward him, they make his joy full by thinking the same thing. But how can a large group of people think one thing? Once again we point out that this is possible only when the believers are occupied by Christ and allow Him to saturate their whole being. Then, and only then, shall we be able to think the same thing. </p>
<p data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78ROw6vl26XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5"> Christ is unique, central, and universal. When in an experiential way, not just in a doctrinal way, Christ becomes our centrality and universality, we shall automatically think the same thing. </p>

These matters will always test to what extent we have actually <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> been occupied by Christ, taken over by Christ, and saturated with Christ. If Christ truly possesses us inwardly, our love for all the saints will be on the same level. Furthermore, we shall be joined in soul, and our mind will be occupied with knowing Christ, experiencing Christ, pursuing Christ, and gaining Christ. As a result, we shall not do anything in the way of rivalry or vainglory, but instead we shall count others more excellent than ourselves and regard their virtues and qualities. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllhdXm1ks6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> In this message we shall consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90349" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-8">2:5-8</span>. These verses are very familiar, and messages have been given on them again and again. Even when I was a child, I heard, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90350" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-8">Philippians 2:5-8</span>, how Christ emptied Himself and humbled Himself, coming down from heaven to earth. Most of the messages given on these verses deal with them in an ordinary way. This makes it rather difficult for us to get into these verses in a thorough way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jE1LBVMDba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv">CHRIST AS THE PATTERN WITHIN US</h2><p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURBF-Ljf4nHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90351" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-8">2:5-8</span> Paul presents Christ as our pattern. This pattern is not only objective, but also subjective. However, when I was young, I was taught only about the objective aspect of Christ as our pattern. I was told that in His life on earth Christ set up a pattern and that we should follow in His footsteps. Having established the pattern for us, Christ is now in heaven praying that we shall follow Him faithfully. I believe that many of us have heard such a teaching regarding Christ as the pattern. </p>
<p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LIPxyB0cqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> Now we must go on to ask where is this Christ who is our pattern. Is He in heaven, or is He in us? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90352" data-verses="Philippians 2:9">Verse 9</span> indicates clearly that God has highly exalted Christ. Thus, there can be no doubt that as our pattern Christ is in heaven. He has been exalted to the highest peak in the universe, where God is. This is related to the objective aspect of the pattern. However, if Christ were only in the third heaven objectively, how could we take Him as our pattern today? How could we, who are on earth, follow One who has been exalted and who is <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> now in heaven? It would be impossible. In order for us to take Christ as our pattern, this pattern must be subjective. </p>

If we could work out our salvation, would that not make salvation a matter of our own works? Suppose I fall into a pit and someone rescues me. That is salvation. But if I succeed in delivering myself, that is not salvation, but my own working. Since salvation is not of works, but of grace, what does Paul mean by telling us to work out our salvation? If we had been the first to utter such a word, we would be charged with heresy. </p>
<p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cIA6vaB9hRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> The key to understanding Paul’s word is to know the meaning of salvation in this verse. Salvation here is not salvation from the lake of fire. Rather, it refers to what Paul has already said about salvation earlier in this Epistle. The words <em>so then</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90354" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">verse 12</span> indicate that what Paul says in this verse is a consequence of what has gone before. Working out our salvation is the result of taking Christ as our pattern, as seen in the preceding verses. As our pattern, Christ is our salvation. However, this salvation needs to be worked out by us. </p>
<p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nffSxx6mUZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> In order for this to be accomplished in our experience, the pattern must be subjective to us as well as objective. If it were only objective, it could not be the salvation worked out by us. The salvation here is not the salvation we receive; it is the salvation we work out. The salvation we receive is the salvation from God’s condemnation and from the lake of fire. There is no need for us to work out that kind of salvation. The salvation here in Philippians is salvation of another kind, or of a different degree. It is higher than that mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90355" data-verses="Acts 16:31">Acts 16:31</span>, where the jailer is told that if he believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, he and his household will <span class="pg" data-page-id="85" id="85">[85]</span> be saved. The salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90356" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">2:12</span> is actually a living Person. This Person is the very Christ whom we live, experience, and enjoy. A pattern which is only objective could not be our salvation in this way. The fact that salvation is a living Person and that this Person is our pattern indicates that the pattern is subjective as well as objective. </p>

The exaltation of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90386" data-verses="Philippians 2:9">2:9</span> is actually the manifestation of resurrection power. Resurrection power always follows the living of a crucified life. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90387" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">3:10</span>, Paul aspired to know the power of Christ’s resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. In the foregoing message we pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90388" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-8">2:5-8</span> we have Christ as our pattern and that this pattern is the crucified life within us.

The experience of Christ as the pattern of a crucified life and the experience of the resurrection power which exalts Him is endless. Day by day, we need to live a crucified life. This is to live Christ as our pattern. Instead of having a life of rivalry and vainglory, we should live a life of self-emptying and self-humbling. This is to live a crucified life.

<p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvlHIg9o0Xkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> There is an urgent need among us in the Lord’s recovery today to experience Christ as our pattern. We desperately need to experience Him as our crucified life. Such a life stands altogether in contrast to a life of rivalry and vainglory. In the church life we either take the crucified life as our pattern or automatically live a life of rivalry and vainglory. There is no third way. If we do not take the crucified life as our pattern, we shall automatically live in the way of rivalry for vainglory. The issue here is extremely serious. We need to be honest with ourselves and consider the kind of life we have been living in the church. If you review the time you have been in the church life, you will see that whenever you did not take the crucified life as your pattern, you were living a life of rivalry for vainglory. </p>
<p data-content-id="LY3b3GAWOFJOmvN2cbErBRxwrAzZnSK7D62ke0j8mOyinQzXo2YxW2fi2ufAiHKu1"> Nothing was more troubling to the apostle Paul than to learn that the saints in Philippi were living in the way of vainglory. He was very concerned that they live a crucified life. As we have seen, this life is Christ Himself as the One who emptied Himself and humbled Himself. Taking this crucified life as our pattern opens the gate of resurrection and brings us into the power of resurrection. The exaltation which is of God will never come by way of rivalry or vainglory. The more we seek vainglory, the more shameful our situation will be. To pursue vainglory is not a glory at all; it is a shame. Likewise, when we are in rivalry with others, the result is never exaltation. Inevitably the result is that we are brought low. The highest life on earth is the crucified life. Whenever we live a crucified life, God will bring us into the power of resurrection, and in this power we shall be exalted. </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX78G_fT7nzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> During the years I have been in the church life, I have known many cases of those who were in rivalry for vainglory. Without exception, all those who engaged in such <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> rivalry went downhill. It is utterly foolish to have rivalry in the church life. We should fear this more than we fear a serpent. Whenever you are in rivalry with others, you are without question living in the self. We must condemn this rivalry and repudiate it. </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO40LdLy4p6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> Furthermore, none of us in the church life should hold to any personal standing. Of course, we must stand firm for the Lord’s testimony. However, we should not claim any standing, title, or position for ourselves. Making such claims will never bring us into the power of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSEjgImpB8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> In the church life I have seen not only those who were in rivalry for vainglory, but also a good number of saints who took the crucified life as their pattern. Eventually, these saints entered into the power of resurrection where they experienced God’s exaltation. </p>
<p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfynt1PBGL9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> I earnestly hope that none of the saints in the church life today will seek glory for themselves. Instead of seeking glory, we should seek Christ and Him alone. Then we shall experience the crucified life. </p>
<p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuOJiojx5pnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> I believe that in the church in Philippi, two sisters, Euodias and Syntyche, were in rivalry for position or vainglory. Otherwise, there would have been no need for Paul to beg them to “think the same thing in the Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90394" data-verses="Philippians 4:2">4:2</span>). If there had not been the problem of rivalry in the church there, there would have been no need for Paul to say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90395" data-verses="Philippians 2:3">2:3</span>, “Doing nothing by way of rivalry nor by way of vainglory.” Because among the saints in Philippi there was rivalry for vainglory, it was necessary for Paul to present Christ as the pattern of a crucified life. Paul presents this pattern in Philippians, not in other books, because in Philippi rivalry for vainglory was a definite problem. As long as certain of the saints there were seeking glory for themselves, there was rivalry. Therefore, Paul showed them that Christ, the Son of God, had a very high position. He possessed the very form of God and had the right to be equal with God. Nevertheless, He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men. Then, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> Himself and became obedient even unto the death of the cross. Those Philippian saints who were seeking position and title for themselves surely needed to live according to Christ as the pattern of a crucified life. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceQjLSSPycDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> We must admit that the rivalry for vainglory found among the saints in Philippi can also be found in many local churches today. No doubt, among the Christians outside the Lord’s recovery there is much rivalry for vainglory. But what about us in the churches? To some extent at least, such rivalry still exists among us. Thus, we need Paul’s word concerning Christ as our pattern. We need to be enlightened and take this crucified life as our pattern so that we may experience the power of resurrection. When we live the crucified life, we shall be ushered into resurrection power, and this power will exalt us. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexKcnNUL4zqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> We should be warned, however, not to take this word about the crucified life, the power of resurrection, and God’s exaltation as a ground for seeking glory. We should not even seek true glory as something apart from Christ. Do not seek any glory that is other than Christ Himself. We need to say, “Lord, I want only You. I am not seeking any exaltation or glory.” If we take the crucified life as our pattern, we shall experience the power of resurrection. This resurrection power is Christ Himself. Christ is not only the crucified life, but He is also the power of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwF_0ob68yG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> Often the saints complain of weaknesses. We are weak whenever we do not take the crucified life as our pattern. If you are weak in your family life, daily life, or church life, it is an indication that you are not taking the crucified life and therefore are not in the power of resurrection. I repeat, the gate through which we enter into the power of resurrection is the crucified life. Paul’s expectation concerning the saints in Philippi was that they would live this crucified life and then experience the power of resurrection. </p>

In the name of Jesus every knee will bow, and every tongue openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. This implies calling on the name of the Lord. When we call on the Lord’s name, we have the reality of bowing our knees to Him. Paul’s word about bowing our knees in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90424" data-verses="Philippians 2:10">verse 10</span> and confessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90425" data-verses="Philippians 2:11">verse 11</span> implies that as we bow our knees to the Lord, we call on His name. We confess the Lord’s name openly by calling on Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="-V7223f52MYBu9DyQ9J3bCV24DGxJnNTfbHd_yZfKDZbKPYsFs3GvbJI_KQbDX4I8"> We have pointed out again and again that Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ. Calling on the name of the Lord Jesus is a way to experience Him and enjoy Him. Many of us can testify that before we began to call on the Lord’s name, we did not have much experience of Him or enjoyment of Him. But when we call on the Lord, we spontaneously exercise our spirit and thereby touch the Lord who dwells in our spirit. As the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, the Lord is the fresh spiritual air for our enjoyment and experience. We would encourage all those who have recently come into the church life to practice calling on the name of the Lord. Many of us can testify how much we enjoy Him by calling on His name. Just as it is very helpful <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> to breathe deeply of fresh air for the cleansing of our system, so we need to breathe deeply of the spiritual air by calling on the name of the Lord. By calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are stirred in spirit and even set on fire. Let us all learn to call, “O Lord Jesus,” from the depths of our being. In this way we shall worship the Lord and openly confess Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPRLMxZtTy3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy"> In this message we shall consider the matter of working out our salvation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90426" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">2:12</span> Paul says, “So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only as in my presence, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” To work out our own salvation is to carry it out, to bring it to the ultimate conclusion. We have received God’s salvation, which has as its climax our being exalted by God in glory as the Lord Jesus was (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90427" data-verses="Philippians 2:9">v. 9</span>). We need to carry out this salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion, by our constant and absolute obedience with fear and trembling. We have received this salvation by faith. Now we must carry it out by obedience. This includes the genuine oneness in our soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90428" data-verses="Philippians 2:2">v. 2</span>). To receive salvation by faith is once for all; to carry it out is lifelong. </p>
<p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X8MbcFDqIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90429" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">verse 12</span> Paul charges us to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Fear is the inward motive; trembling is the outward attitude. </p>
<p data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCXcj930N16P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90430" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">verse 13</span> Paul goes on to say, “For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.” The word <em>for</em> at the beginning of this verse gives the reason we need to obey always. It is because God operates in us. In God’s economy we have the Lord Jesus as our pattern (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90431" data-verses="Philippians 2:6-11">vv. 6-11</span>), as the standard of our salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90432" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">v. 12</span>), and we also have God operating in us both the willing and the working to carry out our salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion. It is not that we by ourselves carry it out, but that God operates in us to do it. The only thing we need to do is to obey the inner operating of God. The willing Paul speaks of here is inward, whereas the working is outward. </p>
<p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LIP5yB08qAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90433" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">verses 12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90434" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90435" data-verses="Philippians 2:15">15</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90436" data-verses="Philippians 2:16">16</span> we have four wonderful matters: salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90437" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">v. 12</span>), God operating in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90438" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">v. 13</span>), lights or <span class="pg" data-page-id="101" id="101">[101]</span> luminaries (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90439" data-verses="Philippians 2:15">v. 15</span>), and the word of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90440" data-verses="Philippians 2:16">v. 16</span>). The salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90441" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">verse 12</span> is actually the very God who operates in us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90442" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">verse 13</span>. The One who operates in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure is Himself our salvation. As believers, we are children of God, children of the One who is operating in us. Because we are children of God, we most assuredly have the divine life and divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90443" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>). How could a child not have the life and nature of his father? It is simply not possible for someone to be born of a particular person and not have the life and nature of that person. In the same principle, it is not possible for us to be genuine children of God, born of Him, and not have His life and nature. We have been truly born of God and not merely adopted by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFqbfPxv9d_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> When we say that as children of God we have the life and nature of our Father, some accuse us of teaching what they call “evolution into God.” We definitely do not claim that man is evolving into the Godhead. However, we definitely teach according to the Word of God that, as true believers in Christ, we have experienced a divine birth. God has actually been born into us, and thereby we have His life and nature. We all may boast not in our first birth, but in the second, the divine birth which made us children of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG9M7ElH9eYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb"> Because we are children of God with the life and nature of God, we shine as lights in the world. The Greek word rendered <em>lights</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90444" data-verses="Philippians 2:15">2:15</span> means “luminaries which reflect the light of the sun.” Every child of God is a stone reflecting the light which comes from Christ, God’s unique Son. In this universe there is only one source of light, and this source is God. As those luminaries, we also hold forth the word of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cIAyvax1hRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> These four important matters are very subjective and experiential. We have received a salvation which is God Himself. Now there is operating in us this very God, the One who is real in our experience as our subjective salvation. He is not dormant, passive, or idle. His operating in us is His energizing in us. How wonderful that we have been born of this energizing God! Hence, we have His energizing life and <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> nature. We are the energetic children of the energizing God! Spontaneously we reflect the light which comes from God as the universal source. In the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, we shine as lights, as luminaries, in the world. Therefore, we can hold forth the word of life to those around us. This is to take Christ as our pattern and to work out our salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nffS5x6WMZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> If the believers in Philippi worked out their salvation in this way, they would make Paul very happy. If all the saints in all the churches would work out their salvation according to the items in these verses, all those who serve the churches, the apostles and elders, would be happy. To work out our salvation is to have the genuine experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvd8UwEzC7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn">I. HAVING RECEIVED SALVATION<br/>OF THE HIGHEST STANDARD</h2><p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O1T95mM6LRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90445" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span> Paul says that we have been saved by grace. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90446" data-verses="Ephesians 2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span> he declares, “By grace you have been saved through faith.” It is absolutely true that we are saved only by grace through faith. Without grace, it is not possible for us to be saved. Many Christians today rightly emphasize the fact that salvation is by grace alone. However, although they may stress salvation by grace, they fail to point out the extent of God’s salvation. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90447" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span>, God’s salvation brings us into the heavens. This indicates that we have received a salvation with the highest possible standard. We have been saved by grace to be in the heavenlies with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90448" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Eph. 2:6</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllhRXnxYs6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> In this message we shall consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90470" data-verses="Philippians 2:14-16">2:14-16</span>. These verses continue Paul’s word about working out our salvation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90471" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">verse 12</span> Paul charges us to work out our salvation, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90472" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">verse 13</span> he tells us that God is operating in us. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90473" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">verse 14</span> Paul issues a warning: “Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.” Murmurings are out of our emotion, mostly on the part of the sisters; reasonings are out of our mind, mostly on the part of the brothers. Both frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent, from experiencing Christ to the uttermost. </p>
<p data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jE1HBU4zba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv"> The context indicates that if we murmur or reason, we do not obey. Obedience to God slays all murmurings and reasonings. In order to work out our salvation, we must obey the very God who operates in us. He Himself is our salvation, and our obedience to Him is the working out of our salvation. The sisters need to realize that when they murmur, they disobey the God who works within them. Likewise, the brothers need to see that whenever they reason, they are rebellious against the One who operates in them. Only by obedience can murmurings and reasonings be put to death. </p>
<p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURBFyLi7MnHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90474" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">2:14</span> about murmurings and reasonings is a further indication that his purpose in writing the book of Philippians was not related to doctrine, but very much related to experience. Murmurings and reasonings are important factors that frustrate our Christian life. From experience Paul knew that if we would work out our salvation, we need to do all things without murmurings and reasonings. Often in important matters we may not murmur <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> or reason. But in small matters we are prone to murmurings and reasonings. Any kind of murmuring or reasoning is disobedience to the inner working of the Triune God. How we need the Lord to save us from our murmurings and reasonings! </p>
<p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LIP9yDgUqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90475" data-verses="Philippians 2:15">verse 15</span> Paul continues, “That you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.” The Greek word rendered <em>that</em> means “in order that.” We should do all things without murmurings and reasonings in order that we may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish. The Greek word translated <em>guileless</em> also means “simple, artless, innocent; hence, harmless” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90476" data-verses="Matthew 10:16">Matt. 10:16</span>). It comes from a root which means “unmixed.” The word <em>blameless</em> describes our outward behavior, and the word <em>guileless,</em> our inward character. To be artless means not to play politics. No one who is political can rightly be called guileless. If we are artless, we are also guileless and harmless. </p>
<p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFqbbPzrRd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90477" data-verses="Philippians 2:15">verse 15</span> Paul refers to “children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation.” As children of God, we have God’s life and nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90478" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>). Being children of God with the divine life and nature, we are luminaries which reflect the light of the sun (Christ). As such, we are without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation. “Without blemish” is the total quality of being blameless and guileless. The Greek word translated <em>perverted</em> means “warped or twisted.” There can be no doubt that today’s generation is twisted and warped. In this kind of generation we should shine as lights in the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOxTUFlnmf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90479" data-verses="Philippians 2:16">verse 16</span> Paul goes on to say, “Holding forth the word of life, for my boasting in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain nor labored in vain.” The Greek word for <em>holding forth</em> also means “applying, presenting, offering.” As God’s children, we need to present the word of life to others. If the Philippian believers did this, Paul would be able to boast in the day of Christ that he had not labored in vain. The day of Christ is the day of the Lord’s second coming, also called <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> “the day of the Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90480" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:2">1 Thes. 5:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90481" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:2">2 Thes. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90482" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:8">1 Cor. 1:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90483" data-verses="2Corinthians 1:14">2 Cor. 1:14</span>) and “that day” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90484" data-verses="2Timothy 1:18">2 Tim. 1:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90485" data-verses="2Timothy 4:8">4:8</span>).

<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrPqXLtfCSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> Just as the Philippians could boast in Paul in Christ, so Paul wanted to be able to boast, rejoice, and glory in them in the day of Christ. He hoped to be able to boast that, as far as they were concerned, he had not run in vain or labored in vain. However, at the time Paul wrote this Epistle, he was concerned that his running and labor might be in vain. Whether or not his labor was actually in vain would be determined by the deeds of the believers in Philippi. Suppose the believers there did all things without murmurings or reasonings and thus became blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a warped and twisted generation. Suppose, moreover, that the saints in Philippi were shining forth as luminaries in the world and presented the word of life to those around them. If such were their situation, Paul would be able to rejoice and even boast at the time of the Lord’s coming back. </p>

TO LIVE OUT CHRIST, TO EXPRESS CHRIST,<br/>TO WORK OUT OUR SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWbsbglJuV307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> The title of this message is “Holding Forth Christ.” To hold forth Christ is to live out Christ, to express Christ, and to work out our salvation. As we have indicated, to work out our salvation is to obey the Triune God who is operating within us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. Here we have five important, interrelated matters: working out our salvation, obeying God, living Christ, expressing Christ, and holding forth Christ. Christians commonly speak of obeying God. However, in most cases their understanding of obedience is very superficial. The other four expressions—living Christ, expressing Christ, holding forth Christ, and working out our salvation—are unusual and even extraordinary. It would be helpful if we would make such expressions part of our conversation in <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> fellowship. As we speak to one another, we need to encourage one another to live out Christ and express Christ. We need to remind one another to hold forth Christ and to work out our salvation. Using these expressions will help us in ministering Christ to others, especially to young ones who have just received the Lord. We should not merely talk about the gospel and salvation in a common, ordinary way. We need to use expressions based on Paul’s word to the Philippians to stir in others the desire to experience the Lord in their spirit. It is very important that we bring these extraordinary spiritual expressions into our daily conversation, prayer, fellowship, and testimonies in the church meetings. This will serve to enrich our utterance. May we all be exercised to speak of living out Christ, expressing Christ, holding forth Christ as the word of life, and working out our own salvation. </p>

DOING ALL THINGS<br/>WITHOUT MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS</h2><p data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wEKL0pr8WrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J"> We have pointed out that murmurings issue from the emotion, whereas reasonings proceed from the mind. Furthermore, murmurings are more of a problem among the sisters, and reasonings more among the brothers. Again and again we need to be reminded of Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90488" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">2:14</span>. When the sisters are washing dishes in the sisters’ house, they should remember not to murmur. As the brothers are taking care of matters in the service groups and the church life, they should remember to do all things without reasonings. They should not reason, but simply serve the Lord in the church. </p>

What a great thing it is not to have murmurings and reasonings! However, I have never met a sister who did not murmur or a brother who did not reason. The problem of murmurings and reasonings comes out in particular in married life. For example, a wife <span class="pg" data-page-id="111" id="111">[111]</span> may murmur if her husband does not show appreciation of the love and care she has for him. Some brothers have learned that one way to eliminate a wife’s murmuring is to use two simple expressions: “I’m sorry” and “thank you.” Using these simple expressions can make your married life much happier. If a brother never tells his wife that he is sorry or if he never says thank you, there is apt to be murmuring. If we are successful in eliminating murmurings and reasonings, we shall be blameless and guileless. </p>

Since everything Paul covers in the book of Philippians is related to the experience of Christ, this must also be true of the drink offering referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90509" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">2:17</span>. If our experience of Christ has not come to the point where we have been constituted as a drink offering, we have not yet experienced Christ to the uttermost. When we experience Christ to an exceedingly high degree, we shall become a drink offering. </p>

The basic offerings were types of various aspects of Christ. The drink offering was a type of Christ as enjoyed by the offerer, an offering that fills him with Christ as the heavenly wine and even causes him to become wine to God. The apostle Paul became such a drink offering by so enjoying Christ that he could be poured out by the shedding of his blood upon the believers’ faith as a sacrifice to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHUJBN4YfkJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> The burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering were the basic offerings, but the drink offering was not. The five basic offerings covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90513" data-verses="Leviticus 1:1">chapters one through seven</span> of Leviticus <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> are types of various aspects of what Christ is to God on our behalf. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90514" data-verses="Numbers 15:1-10">Numbers 15:1-10</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90515" data-verses="Numbers 28:7-10">28:7-10</span>, we shall see that the drink offering was something additional. If one of the basic offerings was offered without the drink offering, this was an indication that there was something lacking with the presentation of the basic offering. The one who offered the basic offering must have been rather poor. Actually, the drink offering signifies that the offerer himself becomes the drink offering. However, this does not mean that the offerer can be such a drink offering according to his own natural constitution. Rather, he must enjoy Christ to such an extent that Christ fills him, saturates him, and permeates him. Christ is the heavenly wine for our enjoyment. When we enjoy Him by taking Him into us, we shall become filled with Him and thoroughly saturated with Him. In this way we shall become the wine to be poured out as a drink offering upon the offerings we present to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld3Nkenxe_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5"> With the typology in the Old Testament as a basis, Paul came to regard himself as a drink offering poured out upon the sacrifice and priestly service of the believers’ faith. For years Paul had been drinking of Christ and enjoying Him so that he came to the point that he was filled with Christ and saturated with Him. Eventually, Christ as the heavenly wine caused Paul to become a constitution of wine in his very being. This was the reason Paul could consider himself wine poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice he offered to God as a priest. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NCLG_g0CpcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl">FAITH CONSTITUTED<br/>OF THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV38rU3jp9IiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90516" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">2:17</span> Paul speaks of “the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith.” The sacrifice of the believers’ faith means that the faith of the Philippian believers was considered by Paul a sacrifice offered to God by him as a priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90517" data-verses="Romans 15:16">Rom. 15:16</span>), and his offering ministry was considered a priestly service. The issue, the result, of Paul’s ministry was the faith of the believers. Faith in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90518" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">2:17</span> is all-inclusive. It refers to much more than the act of believing. Faith here includes all that <span class="pg" data-page-id="117" id="117">[117]</span> the believers have received and enjoyed. Ultimately it includes what the believers themselves are. This faith was the result of Paul’s ministry. Paul’s ministry resulted in the all-inclusive faith of the believers, the faith which Paul offered to God as a sacrifice. </p>
<p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHUJBN6M_kJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> To be sure, the sacrifice of the believers’ faith was full of Christ. It included Christ as the basic offerings. When we experience Christ in these different aspects and enjoy Him as these basic offerings, this experience and enjoyment become our faith. Experientially, the enjoyment of Christ as the basic offerings eventually becomes our faith. Hence, this faith is constituted of the Christ we experience and enjoy. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld3Nkel16_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5"> We must not make the mistake of understanding the faith spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90519" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">2:17</span> in a shallow, superficial way. Faith is a constitution of our experience of Christ. As such, it could be viewed by Paul as a sacrifice to be offered to God. The faith which can be offered to God as a sacrifice is a constitution of our enjoyment of Christ. The amount of faith constituted in us is in proportion to our enjoyment of Christ. The more we enjoy Him, the more we have the faith which is constituted of the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMA9uJH1RwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> During the years I have been ministering in this country, the saints have been enjoying the Christ ministered to them. They have experienced Christ and enjoyed Him in many different aspects. As a result, within the saints there is a constitution, and this constitution is called faith. There is no better word to signify the enjoyment and experience of Christ in its various aspects than the word <em>faith.</em> This was the word used by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90520" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">2:17</span>, and we cannot improve on it. Paul uses the word <em>faith</em> to denote the totality of our enjoyment of Christ and experience of Him. Therefore, faith is the total expression of our experience and enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP-pIQ5Vf3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> As we have pointed out, Paul regarded this faith, constituted of the believers’ experience and enjoyment of Christ, as a sacrifice which he could offer to God as a priest. Although I by no means presume to compare myself with Paul, many times in prayer I have had the sense that the enjoyment and experience of Christ found among the <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> believers is an offering which I can present to God. There is among the saints in the Lord’s recovery a kind of faith which is the constitution and totality of their experience and enjoyment of Christ. This faith can be found in every local church in the Lord’s recovery. The saints have a faith which is a constitution of their experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ over the years. This is a sign that the ministry has not been in vain. The ministry has resulted in a constitution which comes out from the saints’ enjoyment of Christ and experience of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90521" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">2:17</span> Paul refers to this constitution as faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8Jl-WbVE7EB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> Based upon the principle in the Old Testament that the drink offering required a basic offering, Paul regarded the faith constituted of the believers’ experience of Christ as the basic offering upon which he could pour out himself as a drink offering. God in heaven must have been very happy with this situation. How pleased He must have been to see the faith as the basic offering and also to see the drink offering! On the side of the believers, there was faith; on the side of the apostle, there was the drink offering. What a marvelous scene! No wonder Paul could say that he rejoiced with them all! Paul rejoiced to have his blood shed as a drink offering upon the sacrifice of the believers’ faith. He not only rejoiced, but he rejoiced together with all the saints. To rejoice together with others is to share joy with them. The apostle shared his joy with the Philippians in his martyrdom over their faith. This implies a congratulation to them. I believe that the Triune God was also rejoicing with Paul at such a happy, joyful scene. </p>
<p data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGxoQpwRkkIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r"> Both the believers’ faith as the basic offering and the drink offering are something which has been constituted over a period of time. Faith does not grow and develop suddenly, for it is a constitution of the believers’ enjoyment of Christ and spiritual experience. Likewise, a drink offering can only be produced out of our experience with the Lord. In order to become a drink offering, we need to be filled with the Lord and saturated with Him. Only in this way can we have the spiritual constitution which makes us a drink <span class="pg" data-page-id="119" id="119">[119]</span> offering. What a tremendous matter that sinners such as we can be constituted into heavenly wine for God’s satisfaction! </p>

Immediately after referring to himself as a drink offering poured out upon the sacrifice and priestly service of the believers’ faith, Paul speaks of sending Timothy and Epaphroditus, two intimate co-workers, to the saints in Philippi. We may wonder why Paul turned to such a matter, which seems to have no relationship to the experience of Christ. However, if we get into the depths of this portion of the book of Philippians, we shall see that it is definitely related to the experience of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7CZ4N55Or0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AND CARING FOR THE SAINTS</h2><p data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKJgVLEtGm4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90529" data-verses="Philippians 2:20-21">2:20 and 21</span> Paul says, “For I have no one like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you; for all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus.” In these verses we find a strong hint that even Paul’s concern for the believers was the concern for the things of Christ and for the genuine experience of Christ. Besides Timothy, Paul did not have another who was like-souled with him. Paul’s soul was concerned with the things of Christ. What are the things of Christ? The things of Christ are the churches with all the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAUY1vfDFIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> Here we see the important point that if our seeking after Christ does not result in a concern for the church, our seeking is at least somewhat abnormal or biased. Many Christians today are seeking spirituality, but they have no concern for the churches with the saints. Such a spiritual seeking is not normal. Where today can you find believers who are truly seeking after Christ with a concern for the <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> churches and the saints? We must check our seeking after Christ in relation to the concern for the churches with the saints. Many desire to be “spiritual,” “holy,” or “victorious.” Those who pursue spirituality without a concern for the churches are misled in their seeking. The normal seeking after Christ includes a concern for the churches and the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY35jqQVkHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> In this Epistle, Paul does not cover the experience of Christ in a doctrinal way. Rather, little by little, he unveils the genuine experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ by dealing with practical matters and actual situations. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90530" data-verses="Philippians 2:19-30">2:19-30</span> he indicates that the experience of Christ must include a concern for the churches and the saints. We may have the concept that the experience of Christ is one thing, but the concern for the church is another. Not many of us may realize that to experience Christ and to enjoy Christ is actually to care for the church, and to care for the church is to experience Christ and enjoy Him. Our natural tendency is to separate these things. We may think that because we are enjoying Christ, we do not have time to care for the church. Or, on the other side, we may think that because we are so busy in caring for the church, we have no time to enjoy Christ. It is important for us to see in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90531" data-verses="Philippians 2:19-30">2:19-30</span> that these two things must be one. If we truly experience Christ and enjoy Him, this should result in a concern for the church and the saints. There is a principle in the Word that if our seeking after Christ and our experience of Christ do not result in a concern for the churches and the saints, our seeking and our experience are abnormal. The experience of Christ must be for His Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvlHYg_8cXkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> I believe that, deep within, as Paul was testifying that he was willing to be poured out as a drink offering upon the believers’ faith, he was concerned for them. In these verses Paul seems to be saying, “My desire is to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith. Because I am in prison, I have no way to come to you. If I were at liberty to do so, I would visit you immediately. Since I am not able to come, I shall send Timothy, one whose <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> experience of Christ makes him full of concern for the churches and the saints.” I wish to emphasize again and again the crucial point that the genuine experience of Christ will always cause us to care for the churches and the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="LY3b3GAWOFJOmvN2cbErBRxwrAzJnQOXD62ke0j8mOyinQzXo2YxW2fi2ufAiHKu1"> I have often said that if we have good fellowship with the Lord in the morning, we shall be eager to meet with the church in the evening. This is another indication that the real experience of Christ always turns us to the church and results in a care for the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="mIS7O7a-NT_KDOKl-0XRFQVGIiBTbbta_H0Cio96dDINunJF9QeGmdjRtCHl84RqP"> Caring for the church because we have the genuine experience of Christ is very different from the so-called pastoring work common among Christians today. That kind of work may be a distraction from the true experience of Christ. However, the concern for the church which issues from the experience of Christ is not a distraction from the enjoyment of Christ. Because that kind of pastoring work often becomes a preoccupation which keeps people from the enjoyment of Christ, many of today’s pastors have no time to enjoy the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfpDQS_Yb2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> Paul’s concern for the churches and the saints came out of his experience of Christ. The real concern for the church will always proceed from the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUkxTWqZX3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3"> No doubt, both Timothy and Epaphroditus were younger than Paul. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90532" data-verses="Philippians 2:22">verse 22</span> Paul says of Timothy, “But you know his approvedness, that as a child with a father he has served with me in the gospel.” The Greek word rendered <em>approvedness</em> means “approved worth, proof of having been tested.” We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90533" data-verses="Philippians 2:20">verse 20</span> Paul speaks of Timothy as one who was like-souled. Timothy’s being like-souled with the apostle Paul was the secret of his experience of Christ. </p>

We must strive together with one soul in the faith of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90534" data-verses="Philippians 1:27">1:27</span>); we must be joined in soul, thinking the one thing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90535" data-verses="Philippians 2:2">2:2</span>); and we must be like-souled, genuinely caring for the things of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90536" data-verses="Philippians 2:20-21">2:20-21</span>). In the gospel work, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> the fellowship among the believers, and in the Lord’s interests, our soul is always a problem. Hence, it must be transformed, especially in its leading part, the mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90537" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Rom. 12:2</span>), that we may be of one soul, joined in soul, and like-souled in the Body life. </p>
<p data-content-id="PlrvbBpD2zxx_8-X698IQTc85T3uKgO3F52HYJhkJHFcO4Qc_4xEevBqOsx5k1dpA"> In the book of Philippians the experience of Christ is the key point, and the secret of the experience of Christ is to be one in soul or joined in soul. According to this book, we cannot go on in the experience of Christ unless we are joined in soul. If we are one only in spirit but are not joined in soul, we cannot go on in the experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="-V7223f52MYBu9DyQ9J3bCV24DGtJm5bfbHd_yZfKDZbKPYsFs3GvbJI_KQbDX4I8"> There is a great difference between being in the soul and being one in soul or joined in soul. The secret of experiencing Christ is to be one in soul, not to be in the soul. The dissenting ones who are altogether in the soul find it impossible to be one in soul. Those who exercise their mind, emotion, and will are not one in soul. If we would experience Christ, we need to be one with others in the soul; that is, we need to become like-souled with others. When we exercise our mind, emotion, and will, we may be very individualistic. But if we exercise our spirit to be one in soul, our mind will be sobered, our emotion will be regulated, and our will will be adjusted. Then it will be possible for us to be one in soul with other saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPRLQxYJfy3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy"> The extraordinary expression <em>like-souled</em> is used in the Bible only in this one place. The King James Version renders the Greek word as <em>like-minded.</em> The mind is the leading part of the soul. According to the context, to be like-souled primarily means to be like-minded. The book of Philippians deals much with the believers’ mind. At the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90538" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span>, Paul tells us to think the same thing and even the one thing. This indicates clearly and strongly that to be like-souled is to be like-minded. </p>
<p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X8MHcHnCIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> Some translations have made a serious mistake in their rendering of the Greek word for <em>like-souled.</em> The New American Standard Version says “kindred spirit.” This is terrible! In fact, it is actually a change of the holy Word. Such a rendering ignores the crucial difference between spirit and <span class="pg" data-page-id="127" id="127">[127]</span> soul. This same version even goes so far as to use the expression “united in spirit” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90539" data-verses="Philippians 2:2">2:2</span> instead of “joined in soul.” </p>

<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT8UWQm6A-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> In this message I would like to give a further word on the matters of being like-souled and of risking our soul. Concerning Timothy, Paul says, “I have no one like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90551" data-verses="Philippians 2:20">2:20</span>). Regarding Epaphroditus, he says, “Because for the work of Christ he drew near even unto death, risking his life, that he might fill up your lack of service toward me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90552" data-verses="Philippians 2:30">v. 30</span>). Without spiritual experience, we cannot have an adequate understanding of Paul’s thought in these verses. Mere reading without experience is not sufficient. Through our experience in the church life and through observation, we have come to understand at least to some extent what Paul means when he speaks of being like-souled and of risking the soul. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX78a_enTnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v">THE SOURCE OF DIVISIONS</h2><p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO40LBLzcF6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> As we all know, there are a great many divisions among Christians today, divisions that number in the thousands. In virtually every case, these divisions have been caused by Christians who have a heart for the Lord and who truly love Him. In fact, the more the believers love the Lord Jesus, the more divisions there are apt to be. The reason for this is that, out of their love for the Lord, Christians desire to do something for Him. Time and time again, the outcome has been division. </p>
<p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSEj8Ik9h8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> In order to accomplish something for Christ, we must use our soul. To simply have fellowship with the Lord it is sufficient to exercise our spirit, but to do something for Him we need to exercise our soul with its faculties. This was the reason God created the soul with the faculties of mind, <span class="pg" data-page-id="132" id="132">[132]</span> emotion, and will. Whenever we seek to accomplish something for the Lord, we must use these faculties. However, the serious problem is that when Christians endeavor to do something for the Lord Jesus out of their love for Him, they are not like-souled. Instead, they are very different in the soul. These differences in the soul are the primary cause of division. </p>
<p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfyntpPDCv9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> It is commonly thought that divisions among Christians have their source in doctrinal differences, and apparently this is so. But actually the true source is found not in disagreement over doctrine, but in the differences in the souls of believers. Because so many Christians are not like-souled, not truly one in soul, those who love the Lord Jesus have caused most of the divisions we see today. The source of divisions, therefore, is man’s soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVwcePnrvBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> The saints in the Lord’s recovery have a genuine love for the Lord Jesus. As far as loving the Lord and enjoying fellowship with Him are concerned, there are no problems. But when we attempt to carry out something for the Lord according to what we have seen in our fellowship with Him in the spirit, we may have problems because we are different in soul from the other saints. In other words, in what we desire to do, we are not like-souled. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3ARZ4bsKQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak">TWO RESULTS</h2><p data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7CZ0N4Nur0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt"> This difference in soul may have two different kinds of results. First, some may even go so far as to leave the church life and cause yet another division. Second, some may keep the proper standing on the ground of oneness and stay in the recovery, but they may become negative, dissenting, or cold. One who remains in the recovery while holding such an attitude may say to himself, “The brothers certainly are strong in their concepts about certain things. I simply am not able to get my idea across to them. Since they are not willing to take my proposal, it is best that I am silent from now on. Instead of being aggressive, I’ll withdraw and become passive. I’ll attend the church meetings, but I’ll let someone else care for the various matters in the church life.” Those who <span class="pg" data-page-id="133" id="133">[133]</span> adopt such an attitude may have a good intention. They may be reluctant to argue or cause trouble. For example, an elder in a local church may consider within himself, “My concept is different from that of the other elders. According to my opinion, my way is better than theirs. But, they won’t accept my proposal. Instead of arguing, it is better that I not say anything. Let the brothers do things their way and let them bear the responsibility of taking the church on.” I have seen many cases of this in the church life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKJgZLFJim4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO">EXPERIENCING CHRIST IN THE BODY</h2><p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAUY5vdX9IlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> It is very important to realize that if we hold such an attitude because of differences in the soul, this will cause our experience of Christ to be limited. We shall not be able to experience Him to the full extent. Rather, our experience of Christ will be limited to what we experience in our fellowship with Him in the spirit. We shall be hindered from going further to experience Christ in the Body. Because of the differences of our emotion, understanding, or decision regarding certain matters, we are different in soul. Such differences keep us from the full experience of Christ, the experience of Him in the Body. If we do not experience Christ in the Body, we do not experience Him in full. Only by experiencing Christ in the Body do we experience Him to the fullest extent. </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY35vqSRYHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> In order to experience Christ in the Body, our experience needs to be corporate. Furthermore, to have a corporate experience of Christ we need to be like-souled with others. It is vitally important that we learn to be like-souled. An elder must learn to be like-souled with other elders, and all the members of a local church need to learn to be like-souled with the other saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG70UQaLixa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> Throughout the years we have seen a number of saints who have been held back from full participation in the church life because they were not like-souled. For example, some have not been willing to give themselves to the church service in a positive, aggressive way. They could excuse their lack of involvement by saying they do not want to cause <span class="pg" data-page-id="134" id="134">[134]</span> trouble, but want to keep the situation calm. However, the true reason for their holding back is that they are not like-souled and are not willing to risk their souls in the church life. We know some brothers who have truly behaved like gentlemen in their involvement with the church. They have been honest and good and have not caused turmoil. Nevertheless, because of their difference of opinion, because of not being like-souled, they eventually forsook the Lord’s recovery. When these brothers gave up the church life, they did not criticize us. They simply went their own way. The underlying reason for leaving the church life was holding on to the differences in their souls. As we have pointed out, the divisions among Christians originate mainly from such differences in soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgwc2RJst6q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> Other saints who are not like-souled have chosen to remain in the recovery. But toward the church life in general and toward the church service in particular, they have a negative attitude. Instead of offending others or causing trouble, they withdraw and become cold. On the one hand, they do not leave the Lord’s recovery; on the other hand, they do not go on with the church in a strong, positive, aggressive way. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s92WWcQO5INjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> When Paul wrote to the Philippians, he had a number of co-workers. Nevertheless, Paul said that, apart from Timothy, he had no one like-souled who would genuinely care for what concerned the believers in Philippi. Paul’s situation with respect to the co-workers was quite difficult. On the one hand, there were a number of co-workers. But, when Paul was thinking of sending a brother to learn of the situation among the Philippian saints, he knew that he had only one, Timothy, who was like-souled with him. For this reason, Timothy was the only co-worker Paul could send to Philippi to care for the things concerning the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZVTLJU5NlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> Any co-worker who could not be sent by Paul with such a concern for the Body of Christ could not experience Christ to the same degree Paul did. Because Timothy was like-souled with Paul, he was in a position to experience Christ to the uttermost in the Body, just as Paul was experiencing Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="135" id="135">[135]</span> But those who were different in soul from Paul could not experience Christ to this high degree. Their experience of Christ was restricted by the differences in soul. </p>

<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrPqHLsbuSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> The book of Philippians was not written in logical order according to doctrine. For this reason, it is rather difficult to divide the book into sections. We may even wonder why Paul, after speaking of the mutual fellowship between him and the believers in Philippi in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90555" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span>, goes on to speak of other matters, which he refers to as “the rest” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90556" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">3:1</span>). I believe that the reason for this change of subject lies in the fact that Paul was deeply troubled by the activity of the Judaizers. He knew that the Judaizers were disturbing the churches, damaging the church life, and trying to turn the saints away from the faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNz3UYCWNP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> The Epistle to the Philippians was written when Paul received material supply from the believers in Philippi. Through Epaphroditus they had sent this supply to care for Paul’s need during his imprisonment. After receiving their gift, Paul wrote them this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWbsLgktKV307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> As we have pointed out, in the first two chapters we see the believers’ concern for Paul and Paul’s concern for the saints. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90557" data-verses="Philippians 1:7">1:7</span>, Paul realized that the believers in Philippi had him in their heart and that they were partakers of his grace. Paul went on to say that he longed after them all “in the inward parts of Christ Jesus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90558" data-verses="Philippians 1:8">1:8</span>). Thus, there was a mutual care between the apostle and the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="nHBw_AdnQIfkqKVM8Tgl0tVT-YEF7ANzTRLJRhNrPdZcnD6qmiGxxSQio_uvcr2U-"> Toward the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90559" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span>, Paul speaks of sending Timothy and Epaphroditus to Philippi. Remarks about the <span class="pg" data-page-id="140" id="140">[140]</span> sending of co-workers to visit the saints are usually found at the very end of Paul’s Epistles. This may indicate that Paul was planning to close this Epistle at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90560" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span>. Paul, however, was obviously burdened to write more. After he spoke of Timothy and Epaphroditus, his burden still was not discharged. Deep in his heart he was troubled by the Judaizers. I believe that this is the reason for the change of subject at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90561" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wEKb0rvAWrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J">I. REJOICING IN THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="-V7223f52MYBu9DyQ9J3bCV24DGlJm57fbHd_yZfKDZbKPYsFs3GvbJI_KQbDX4I8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90562" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">3:1</span> Paul says, “For the rest, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, and for you it is safe.” The Greek word rendered <em>irksome</em> also means “wearisome, tedious, troublesome.” Paul did not find it irksome or wearisome to write the same thing to the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPRLYxYJ_y3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy"> Paul here charges the saints to rejoice in the Lord. To rejoice in the Lord is a safeguard, a security. For Paul to write the saints about rejoicing in the Lord was safe for them. Paul’s use of the word <em>safe</em> points to the connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90563" data-verses="Philippians 3:1-2">3:1 and 2</span>. There must have been a situation in Philippi which required a safeguard, some kind of protection. The situation Paul had in mind was the trouble caused by the Judaizers. Therefore, after telling the believers to rejoice in the Lord, he charges them to beware of the dogs, the evil workers, the concision (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90564" data-verses="Philippians 3:2">v. 2</span>). The Greek word for <em>beware</em> means “to keep a watchful eye ever upon.” On the one hand, the apostle advises the Philippians to rejoice in the Lord; on the other hand, he warns them to beware of, to keep a watchful eye ever upon, the Judaizers. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X8MPcHXKIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_">II. THE THREE NEGATIVE ASPECTS<br/>OF THE RELIGIOUS JUDAIZERS</h2><p data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCXc391wp16P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v"> In using the word <em>dogs</em> Paul was very strong. If we were to use such an expression today, we would surely be condemned. Paul, however, was not the first to be so bold in his utterance. Both John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus referred to the Pharisees as the offspring of vipers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90565" data-verses="Matthew 3:7">Matt. 3:7</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="141" id="141">[141]</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90566" data-verses="Matthew 12:34">12:34</span>). Like John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus, Paul was honest and frank in speaking the facts. The Pharisees truly were the offspring of vipers, and the Judaizers really were “dogs.” </p>
<p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExX1A-oYu6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90567" data-verses="Philippians 3:2">3:2</span> Paul says, “Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision.” Since there is no conjunction used between these clauses, they must refer to the same class of people. Dogs are unclean (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90568" data-verses="Leviticus 11:4-8">Lev. 11:4-8</span>), the workers are evil, and the concision are those deserving contempt. (Concision, meaning mutilation, is a term of contempt, used in place of circumcision.) The “dogs” refer to the Judaizers. In nature they are unclean dogs, in behavior they are evil workers, and in religion they are the concision, people of shame. In such a book concerning the experience and enjoyment of Christ, the apostle warns the Gentile believers to be wary of such unclean, evil, and contemptible people. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadPap_JP6oQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> In speaking of the dogs, the evil workers, the concision, Paul exposed the shame of the Judaizers. In nature, they were dogs; in behavior, they were evil; and in religion, they were contemptible. Although they gloried in their religion, Paul regarded it as an object of shame and contempt. He wanted the believers to beware of the dogs, the evil workers, the concision. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78ROs6vlm6XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5">III.

They are absolutely different from the Judaizers. They serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they have no confidence in the flesh, but have their confidence in the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3zAkjZItf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90570" data-verses="Philippians 3:2-3">verses 2 and 3</span> there is a threefold contrast: believers who serve by the Spirit of God in contrast to the dogs; believers who boast in Christ in contrast to evil workers; and <span class="pg" data-page-id="142" id="142">[142]</span> believers who have no confidence in the flesh in contrast to the concision. The Judaizers lived by their fallen nature, whereas the believers in Christ serve by the Spirit of God. Thus, the Spirit of God is in contrast to the nature of the “dogs.” The Judaizers did evil things and even boasted in them, whereas the true believers boast in Christ. They glory and rejoice in Him. As used here, the word <em>boast</em> implies not only boasting, but also rejoicing and glorying. Our boasting, glorying, and rejoicing are not in our outward deeds, not in our behavior or conduct, but in Christ alone. The Judaizers had confidence in the flesh, whereas the true believers in Christ have no confidence in the flesh. </p>

The fact that the Judaizers had confidence in their circumcision was a sign that their confidence was in their flesh. They trusted in their natural qualities and qualifications, not in the Spirit. Their confidence was in what they were by nature. They trusted in the fact that they were Jews. By contrast Paul says strongly that we who believe in Christ do not have any confidence in the flesh. Our confidence is wholly in the Lord. </p>

This day distinguished him from the Ishmaelites and proselytes, who were circumcised later. Paul was a typical Jew, not a proselyte. This gave him ground to boast when he was a Judaizer. </p>

But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them to be refuse that I may gain Christ.” When we come to these verses, we come to the heart of this book. Here we are initiated into the experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUkxnWrtv3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90591" data-verses="Philippians 3:7">verse 7</span> Paul speaks of “what things were gains to me.” These are the things mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90592" data-verses="Philippians 3:5-6">verses 5 and 6</span>. The things that were gains to him Paul counted loss on account of Christ. All the different gains were counted as one loss by Paul because they all issued in one thing, that is, the loss of Christ, as indicated by “on account of Christ.” All the things which were once gains to Paul hindered him and held him back from participating in Christ and enjoying Him. Hence, on account of Christ, all the gains were a loss to him. </p>
<p data-content-id="F0dlBCvTMMHz8TZjDG814kTWLw9QrHSpp97z5APngXAwWFiOr0CkhKKWbXwwhx9XD"> Whereas in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90593" data-verses="Philippians 3:7">verse 7</span> Paul refers specifically to religious things, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90594" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span> he goes on to say, “I count also all things to be loss.” Paul counted as loss on account of Christ not only the things of his former religion, but all other things as well. In this message I have a particular burden to point out what these things include. </p>

In a sense, this understanding is partly right. However, to interpret Paul’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="148" id="148">[148]</span> word in this way is not very practical. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90596" data-verses="Philippians 3:5-6">verses 5 and 6</span>, Paul’s concept is not mainly related to material things. It is true, of course, that worldly, material things occupy people and keep them from experiencing Christ. However, Paul realized that the things which truly frustrate people from experiencing Christ are mainly the things of religion, philosophy, and culture. For the most part, the thoughtful, philosophical people are not occupied by material things. Those who are not thoughtful or philosophical are the ones usually distracted by material things. Those who are more philosophical care for religion, culture, and philosophy. When you go out to preach the gospel, you will discover that religion, philosophy, and culture are the most powerful strongholds of resistance to the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s92WucQOZINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> Before Paul was converted, he was not one who loved material things. On the contrary, he was a person fully given to Jewish religion, philosophy, and culture. His whole being was for Judaism and everything included in it. Apparently Jews care for their religion. Actually they care much more for their culture and philosophy than for religion. The same is true, of course, for people of every race, culture, and nationality. Moslems, for example, are fully occupied with their own type of thought, logic, philosophy, and culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZVrLJUZNlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> Let us review the items covered by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90597" data-verses="Philippians 3:5-6">verses 5 and 6</span>. He says that he was circumcised the eighth day, that he was of the race of Israel, that he was of the tribe of Benjamin, that he was a Hebrew of Hebrews, that concerning the law he was a Pharisee, that concerning zeal he persecuted the church, and that concerning righteousness which is in the law, he was blameless. These items are related to religion, philosophy, and culture. This is a strong indication that as Paul was writing these verses he was conscious not of material things, but rather of religious, philosophical, and cultural things. At the time the book of Philippians was written, most of the people in the Roman Empire were for religion, philosophy, or politics. In fact, the three main elements of Western culture, then as well as now, were Jewish religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics. <span class="pg" data-page-id="149" id="149">[149]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82j9am8UvQAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8">HOOKED BY SATAN</h2><p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT8UuQn-k-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> For thousands of years, Satan, the enemy of God, has been using religion, philosophy, and culture to possess people and to keep them from experiencing Christ. Man was made for Christ. God created man in the image of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90598" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>), and the image of God is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90599" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Col. 1:15</span>). Man was made in the image of God for Christ. But Satan uses religion, philosophy, and culture to hook people and to keep them from Christ. Although the more simple people may be hooked by material things, the more thoughtful ones are hooked by religion, philosophy, and culture. Actually it is the people who are occupied by these things who control the earth. The thoughtful, philosophical, and cultured ones are the most powerful ones. However, Satan has used religion, philosophy, and culture both to occupy these people and also to nail them on his wall. </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX78i_fTrnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> Before Paul believed in Christ, he also was one hooked and nailed by Satan. He had been hooked by Jewish religion, philosophy, and culture. How strong he was for Judaism! Perhaps there has not been another person more absolute for Jewish religion, philosophy, and culture. To people like Saul of Tarsus, wealth or material things mean nothing compared with their religion, philosophy, and culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO40L5Ly456Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> If we get into Paul’s spirit and thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90600" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span>, we shall realize that as he was writing he was thinking of religion, philosophy, and culture when he spoke of “all things.” The “all things” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90601" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span> must certainly include the three categories of religious things, philosophical things, and cultural things. If we would drop our religion, philosophy, and culture, we would truly abandon everything. By dropping these categories of things, we would automatically drop the worldly, material things, which are actually dominated by religion, philosophy, and culture. Although it is easy to overcome the influence of material things, it is very difficult to overcome religion, philosophy, and culture. Those who love the Lord may easily abandon material things for His sake. But it is not easy for them to lay aside their particular thought and logic. You may love the Lord and seek Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> for years without dropping one bit of your personal philosophy or logic. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSEjEImpR8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ">NATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND DOMESTIC LOGIC</h2><p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfyntRPBGb9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> Every nationality and culture has its particular type of logic and philosophy. The British, for example, are noted for their diplomacy, which embodies their logic and philosophy. The Chinese and Japanese are steeped in their own national logic and philosophy. Every nationality is strong in its particular kind of cultural peculiarity. As a result of all the different kinds of logic and philosophy, Christ does not have a way with any group of people on earth today. He does not have a way either with those in the Orient or with those in the West. At the time of the Reformation, Christ tried to find a way with the Germans, but He was not successful. Later, He tried to find a way with the British, also without success. We repeat, there is not one group of people on earth with whom Christ has been able to fully have His way. People of every nationality have been taken over by Satan and hooked by him through religion, philosophy, and culture. It has been difficult for the Lord to find any group of people available to Him for His move on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuOJGojxJpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> It is important for us all to realize that we still hold on to our national philosophy and domestic logic. Those from one part of the country hold to their logic, and those from another region cling to their philosophy. Holding to our domestic logic and national philosophy deprives us of Christ. In a sense, this drives Christ away from us in our experience. In a subtle, secret, and hidden way, the religious, philosophical, and cultural things occupy the believers, even the best of Christians, and keep them from the experience of Christ. Wherever you may go in the world today, you will find that Christ simply does not have a way with any nationality or group of people. In every part of the world, the national philosophy and the domestic logic are so strong that there is little ground in the believers for Christ. Years ago, I was invited to stay in a certain place as an honored guest. As I observed the way the people there behaved themselves, I was <span class="pg" data-page-id="151" id="151">[151]</span> deeply impressed that because they were so strong in their religion, philosophy, and culture, Christ had no way to get through in them. </p>

Paul had much experience both with Christ and with the law. Through his experience, he gained a full knowledge both of Christ and of the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3z4khNAtf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> The law and Christ are two major factors in the composition of the Bible. In a sense, the Old Testament is composed mainly with the law as a basic factor. It may be regarded as a book of the law. The New Testament, on the contrary, is composed with Christ as the basic and governing factor. Hence, the Old Testament is based on the law, and the New Testament is based on Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllh5XkxYs6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> Paul was very knowledgeable concerning both the law and Christ. Through his years in Judaism, he gained a detailed knowledge of the law. His knowledge was not that of an outsider, but of a very zealous insider. But by the time Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he had been transferred out from under the law into Christ. Furthermore, he had both the knowledge and the experience of the wonderful, all-inclusive, and extensive Person of Christ. Paul lived in this Person and could therefore speak of himself as a man in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90611" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">2 Cor. 12:2</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="156" id="156">[156]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3z4kjZotf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> The phrase <em>as to</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90612" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">3:8</span>, which may also be rendered “according to,” is used three times in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90613" data-verses="Philippians 3:5-6">verses 5 and 6</span>, referring to the law, zeal, and righteousness. The phrase <em>on account of,</em> which may also be rendered “because of,” is also used three times, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90614" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-8">verses 7 and 8</span>, referring to Christ, the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, and Christ again. Christ stands in contrast to the law, the zeal for it, and the righteousness in it. The excellency of the knowledge of Christ and Christ Himself are in contrast to all other things, including the law. On account of Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, Paul gave up the law, his zeal for it, the righteousness in it, and all other things. This indicates that Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Him are far superior to the law and all other things. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllh5Xm10s6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90615" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span>, Paul not only counted all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and suffered the loss of all things, but he actually counted them to be refuse. The Greek word for <em>refuse</em> denotes “dregs, rubbish, filth, what is thrown to the dogs; hence, dog food, dung.” There is no comparison between such things and Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jE1vBVMTba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv"> It is important to realize that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90616" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">3:8</span> Paul does not speak of the excellency of Christ, but of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Many readers of Philippians take the word <em>excellency</em> to refer not to the knowledge of Christ, but to Christ Himself. However, Paul specifically and definitely speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Paul’s knowledge of Christ was excellent. On account of the excellency of this knowledge, he was willing to suffer the loss of all things. </p>
<p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURBFaLjfonHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90617" data-verses="Philippians 3:7">verse 7</span> Paul says “on account of Christ,” but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90618" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span> he goes further and says “on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.” The addition of the words <em>my Lord</em> indicates that as Paul was writing, he was filled with intimate, tender feelings concerning Christ. Tender feelings concerning the preciousness of the Lord Jesus rose up within him, causing him to speak of “Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="157" id="157">[157]</span> Jesus my Lord.” Paul placed great value on the excellency of the knowledge of his dear Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LIPVyB0sqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH">DERIVED FROM THE EXCELLENCY<br/>OF THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFqbzPxvtd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His Person. The Jews consider the law of God given through Moses the most excellent thing in history. Hence, they are zealous for the law. Paul participated in that zeal. But when Christ was revealed to him by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90619" data-verses="Galatians 1:15-16">Gal. 1:15-16</span>), he saw that the excellency, the super-eminence, the supreme preciousness, the surpassing worth, of Christ far exceeded the excellency of the law. His knowledge of Christ issued in the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. On account of this, not only did he count the law and the religion founded on the law to be loss, but he counted all things loss. </p>
<p data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG9MXElHteYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb"> Here Paul speaks not directly of the excellency of Christ, but of the excellency of knowing Christ. The knowledge in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90620" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">3:8</span> is not the knowledge that belongs to Christ, the knowledge that Christ Himself has; it is our subjective knowing of Christ. To you, which is more excellent—the Person of Christ or your knowing Christ? According to doctrine or opinion, you may say that the Person of Christ is more excellent than the knowledge of Christ. However, Paul, speaking from his experience, could say that it is the knowledge of Christ which is more excellent. </p>
<p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cIAevaxlhRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> We have pointed out that the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His Person. There can be no doubt that in Himself Christ is excellent. But if we do not have the knowledge of Christ, how shall we know His excellency? If we lack the knowledge of Christ’s excellency, His excellency will not mean anything to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nffSVx6W8ZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> Before Paul’s experience on the road to Damascus, he did not have any knowledge of Christ. He treasured the law and regarded it as most excellent. Paul’s zeal for the law was a sign of his appreciation of the law. His zeal came out of his appreciation. Paul certainly was proud of his excellent <span class="pg" data-page-id="158" id="158">[158]</span> knowledge of the law. Even though Christ is infinitely more excellent than the law, Paul did not have the knowledge of Christ. But at the time of his conversion, this excellent One was revealed to him. With this revelation of Christ, Paul began to have the knowledge of Christ. After he began to acquire the knowledge of Christ, Paul came to realize that the knowledge of the law received through Gamaliel was far inferior to the knowledge of Christ. Conscious of this comparison as he was writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90621" data-verses="Philippians 3:5-8">3:5-8</span>, Paul could speak of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and of suffering the loss of all things for the excellency of this knowledge. </p>
<p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvd84wEzy7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> To be sure, the excellency is in the very Person of Christ. But for our experience, our realization of this excellency depends on our knowledge. If we lack knowledge, there is simply no way for us to realize that this Person is so excellent. Only when we come to know His excellency do we have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. How precious is this excellency of the knowledge of Christ! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O1TR5m8iLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA">THE ALL-INCLUSIVENESS OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyF3yC0fQz0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK"> In the four books that make up the heart of the divine revelation—Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians—Paul opens the veil to show us who Christ is and what Christ is. Christ is all-inclusive and all-extensive, the reality of every positive thing in the universe. He is the reality of God, man, eternity, light, and life. We simply do not have adequate words to declare who and what Christ is. </p>
<p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NCLy_gEKpcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> What was the extent of your knowledge of Christ before the books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians were opened to you in the Lord’s recovery? Perhaps you knew only that Christ is the Son of God sent by the Father in His mercy to die on the cross for the salvation of sinners. You knew that He was born of a virgin, that He died on the cross, that He was raised from among the dead, and that He was exalted to the heavens. You believed in Him as your dear Redeemer and precious Savior, and in this way you were saved. Then you realized that you need Him to <span class="pg" data-page-id="159" id="159">[159]</span> help you live in such a way as to glorify the Father. It is good to know Christ in this way, but this knowledge of Him is far too limited. </p>
<p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV38rg3jZ1IiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> Forty-eight years ago, I also had such a limited knowledge of Christ. But beginning in 1932 the Lord through the recovery has gradually been opening the veil that I may have a fuller knowledge of Him. Little by little, the veil has been taken away. I believe that many saints in the Lord’s recovery can give the same testimony. </p>

Rather, the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90631" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span> must be read in connection with the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90632" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">verse 9</span>. “I have suffered the loss of all things,” Paul declares, “and count them to be refuse that I may gain Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith.” According to these verses, Paul suffered the loss of all things and counted them to be refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him. Furthermore, Paul’s desire was to be found in Christ in the condition of having the righteousness which is of God based on faith, not of having his own righteousness. </p>

In the past Paul was fully in the Jewish religion under the law and was always found by others in the law. But at his conversion he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ, and he became “a man in Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90634" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">2 Cor. 12:2</span>). Now he expected to be found in Christ by all those who observed him—the Jews, the angels, and the demons. This indicates that he aspired to have his whole being immersed in Christ and saturated with Christ so that all who observed him could discover him in Christ. We also should aspire to be found by others in Christ. To be found in Christ actually means to be observed, seen, or discovered by others in Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O1j15kYKLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> Before Paul was converted to Christ, he lived in the law and under the law. Whenever someone met Paul, that person found Paul in the law and enveloped by the law. Saul of Tarsus was a person altogether encased by the law, fully boxed in by it. He was living by the law, with the law, and under the law. But one day he was transferred out from under the law into Christ. Henceforth, whenever others saw him or observed him, they could tell that he had become a person in Christ. Paul was not in culture, philosophy, or religion. He was a person who lived in Christ, and his aspiration and expectation were that he would be found by others in Christ. Paul suffered the loss of all things and counted them refuse in order to gain Christ on the one hand and to be found in Him on the other. </p>

He says that he did not want to have his own righteousness, but he wanted the righteousness which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith. “Not having my own righteousness...but...the righteousness which is of God” is the condition in which Paul desired to be found in Christ. He wanted to live not in his own righteousness, but in the righteousness of God, and to be found in such a transcendent condition, expressing God by living Christ, not by keeping the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceQTPSSPicDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> Before Paul was saved, he had no idea that Christ could be his righteousness. The righteousness of the law is the righteousness which comes from man’s own effort to keep the law, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90636" data-verses="Philippians 3:6">verse 6</span>. Formerly, Paul lived in that righteousness which was according to the law. Others could invariably find him enveloped by the righteousness of the law. But now Paul’s desire was to be observed as a person living in Christ and having Christ as his righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexKsjNULozqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> The righteousness in which Paul wanted to be found was the righteousness “which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith.” The <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> expression “the faith of Christ” implies our believing in Christ. Such faith issues from our knowing and appreciating Christ. It is Christ Himself infused into us through our appreciation of Him, who becomes our faith in Him. Hence, it is also the faith of Christ that brings us into an organic union with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwFPwob6syG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> The righteousness which is of God based on faith is that righteousness which is God Himself lived out of us to be our righteousness through our faith in Christ. Such righteousness is the expression of God, who lives in us. It is based on faith because it is on the basis, or condition, of faith. Faith is the basis, the condition, for us to receive and possess the righteousness out from God, the highest righteousness, which is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90637" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>). </p>

If I were to visit you in your home, where would I find you? Would I find you in your good behavior or in Christ? Where we are when others observe us indicates the realm in which we live. If we live in our culture, we shall be found by others in culture. If we live in our good behavior, we shall be discovered by others in our behavior. In whatever realm we live, that is where we shall be seen, observed, and discovered by others. When Paul was still living by the law, he was found in the law. But one day he began to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. He saw the vision that Christ must be his everything: love, kindness, humility, wisdom, patience, intention, attitude, and even his words, utterances, and expressions. On account of this excellency of the knowledge of Christ, he was willing to count all things to be loss. Furthermore, he suffered the loss of all things and counted them refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNzHIYDi9P4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> We need to have a vision of the preciousness of Christ. Then we need to gain the very Christ we have seen. For example, suppose a person visits a jewelry store and sees <span class="pg" data-page-id="166" id="166">[166]</span> many valuable items on display. To see these items is one thing, but to gain them is another. To know Christ is not merely to have the knowledge concerning Him, but to gain His very Person. Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90638" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>) and the reality of the shadows of all positive things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90639" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">Col. 2:16-17</span>). To gain Him is to experience, enjoy, and take possession of all His unsearchable riches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90640" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Eph. 3:8</span>). As we gain Christ, we should also live in Him and become those who are in Him in experience. Then when others see us or observe us, they will find us in Christ. We shall not be found in our own virtues—we shall be found in Christ and in Him alone. Oh, that we may gain Him and be found in Him! May we be willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them refuse in order to be found in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWbcXglJ-V307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> If we gain Christ and live in Him, He as our righteousness will become our expression before both God and man. Then we shall not simply be found in Christ in a general way, but we shall be found in the very righteousness which is Christ Himself lived out of us. Only when we are found in Christ will the Lord be satisfied. Likewise, those who serve the Lord will be pleased and satisfied only when the believers are found in Christ. </p>

The reason for this is that we are all still under the influence of six thousand years of tradition. When Paul wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90641" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span>, deep within him was the realization that the traditional forms of human living occupy everyone. Whether a person is sinful or not sinful, moral or immoral, that person is occupied by something other than Christ, by some element of the thousands of years of human history. We may call this the six-thousand-year human tradition. </p>

In Greek <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90655" data-verses="Philippians 3:8-11">verses 8 through 11</span> are one long sentence. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90656" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Verse 10</span> begins with the infinitive <em>to know.</em> This infinitive phrase is related to the phrase <em>gain Christ and be found.</em> This indicates that to know Christ is a result of being found in Him. All the words between <em>be found in Him</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90657" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">verse 9</span> and <em>to know Him</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90658" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">verse 10</span> describe in what condition Paul aspired to be found in Christ. He was willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them to be refuse that he might gain Christ and be found in Him to know Him. According to Paul’s concept, if we would know Christ, we must first be found in Him. Moreover, to be found in Him requires that we count all things loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and then suffer the loss of all things and count them to be refuse. Only when we have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, a vision of the supreme preciousness and surpassing worth of Christ, shall we be willing to let go of everything else and count those things as refuse. Then we shall gain Christ and be found in Him. We shall be those who live in Christ and who are found by others in Christ. Being found in Him, we shall surely know Him. </p>

To have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90659" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span> is by revelation. But to know Him in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90660" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">verse 10</span> is by experience—to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. Paul first received the revelation of Christ and then sought for the experience of Christ—to know and enjoy Him in an experiential way. </p>
<p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVwsCPl_HBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> After we receive the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we shall be willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him. As a result, we shall know Christ experientially. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90661" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">verse 9</span> comes out of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90662" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90663" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">verse 10</span> comes out of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90664" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">verse 9</span>. If we do not have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90665" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">v. 8</span>), we shall not be found in Christ, for it is having the excellency of the knowledge of Christ which makes us willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them as refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him. Then, once we have gained Christ and are found in Him, we shall know Him; that is, we shall enjoy Him and experience Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3wNZ6fAKQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> To gain Christ is one thing, and to experience Him is another. We may illustrate this difference by the difference between buying groceries and eating food which has been purchased and prepared. Gaining Christ may be compared to buying groceries, and the experience of Christ may be compared to the eating of the food we have first purchased and cooked. However, before we buy any groceries, we must first have the excellency of the knowledge of groceries. Before we purchase anything, we are first attracted by the excellency of the knowledge of that thing. Thus, first we have the excellency of the knowledge of the groceries, then we gain them by buying them, and finally we enjoy the food by eating it. In like manner, Paul first received the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, then he paid the price to gain Christ and be found in Him, and finally he experienced Christ and enjoyed Him. Paul realized that to gain Christ and be found in Him always results in knowing Him, in enjoying and experiencing Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> </p>

Rather, the excellency of the knowledge of Christ always exceeds our experience of Christ. There has never been a case where a believer’s experience of Christ surpassed his knowledge of Christ. If we do not have a higher knowledge of Christ, we cannot have a higher experience of Christ. This is why it is very important that we not be limited by our past knowledge of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O1jx5mMqLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> You may know that Christ is joy, peace, and rest. Before you were saved, you did not have the peace. But now that you have received the Lord, you have peace and joy. By no means do I belittle these aspects of the knowledge of Christ. I certainly enjoy the Lord Jesus as my peace, rest, and joy. Nevertheless, we should not be content with such a limited knowledge of Christ, but should advance in our knowledge of Him. Oh, how we need the excellency of knowing Christ! </p>
<p data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyFHSC0vYz0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK"> The excellency of the knowledge of Christ will attract us to Christ and motivate us to lay aside everything other than Him. If we see the surpassing worth of Christ, we shall be willing to count as loss not only worldly, material things, but even our culture, religion, and philosophy. I repeat, it is the excellency of the knowledge of Christ which causes us to drop everything else so that we may gain Christ and be found in Him. </p>

We may talk a great deal about Christ, but in our daily living we may not actually be in Christ. Instead, we may be in our culture, national philosophy, or domestic logic. When we are in the church meetings or with the saints, we may have a lot to say about Christ. But in our daily life we may live in our national philosophy, domestic logic, or family concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHU5VN6MvkJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> During the years we have been in the Lord’s recovery, we have come to know that the Lord is the all-inclusive Spirit and that we are one spirit with Him. The Lord is now the <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> Spirit dwelling in our spirit. Although we know this as a doctrine, in our daily life much of the time we do not live one spirit with the Lord. Instead, we often live in our culture. We may pray, “Lord, we thank You that You are the life-giving Spirit and that we are one spirit with You.” Nevertheless, day by day we do not live Christ moment by moment. We do not practice being one spirit with Him all the time. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld39wel1q_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5"> Recently the Lord has pointed out to me my shortage in living Christ. Most of the confession I make to Him is related to this lack. Day by day, I spend too little time living one spirit with the Lord. Too much of the time I live in something other than Christ, in many good things that are not Christ Himself. Because this is our situation, all of us need the Lord to have mercy on us. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMwpuJHFRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> Both we and the Lord have come to a point of crisis. A critical situation definitely exists among many of us today. Yes, we have seen the vision that Christ is our life, that He is the life-giving Spirit, and that we are one spirit with Him, and we talk a great deal about Christ. However, in our practical life day by day, we do not live Christ every moment. We are not found by others in Christ continually. We may be very familiar with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90666" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-10">3:7-10</span>. But how much have we gained Christ, how much are we found in Christ, and how much do we experientially know Christ? Because of our urgent need to experience Christ, it is not my burden in these messages to present Bible teachings. It is to minister Christ to the saints that they may grow in the divine life, which is Christ Himself, and may advance in the experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ. </p>

But it is not easy to see that things that are not material, such as religion, philosophy, and culture, may also be substitutes for Christ. Throughout the years, I have met a good number of spiritual people from different nationalities who were genuine seekers of the Lord. However, although they were progressing spiritually to a certain extent, hardly any lived outside their national culture. For example, among all the true seekers of Christ in China, very few lived outside their Chinese ethical philosophy. This philosophy had been wrought into them. For this reason, not even the best Christians were free from its influence. This is not to say that these ethical teachings are wrong. They were used to preserve people for centuries. The point is that such ethical teachings are something other than Christ Himself. It is not God’s desire that we live according to certain ethical teachings. Ethics is not part of the new creation. It is not something of Christ, of the Spirit, or of resurrection life. Anything that is of Christ must be in resurrection, in the new creation, and of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZlDLIw1NlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> Brother Nee was one who could discern between ethics and Christ. I have never met a person who knew more clearly than he the difference between Christ and ethics. One time <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> he had a thorough fellowship with me concerning the difference between Christ and the ethics developed according to the teaching of Confucius. However, many seeking Christians among the Chinese cannot discern this difference. The problem is not simply that they do not live outside their Chinese ethical philosophy. A more serious problem is that they do not know the difference between Chinese philosophical ethics and Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82jNym-APQAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> Regarding this, I am concerned about many of the saints in the Lord’s recovery. Although they have been under this ministry for years, they still have not acquired the proper discernment between philosophical ethics and Christ. Furthermore, even those who have some measure of discernment may still unconsciously and subconsciously live more in the realm of ethics than in Christ. Our ethics may be very good, but such an ethical living is not a living in resurrection. It has nothing to do with Christ, the Spirit, or the new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT8kGQl6A-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> I can testify that by the Lord’s mercy I can discern between Christ and ethics. Christ is altogether apart from Chinese ethics. Christ has nothing to do with ethics, and ethics has nothing to do with Christ. But although I have this discernment, I do not have the assurance that in my daily living I am altogether outside the realm of ethics and wholly in Christ. It is very possible that at least to some extent I am still under the influence of ethical teachings. Only when I have been fully brought into resurrection and raptured will I have the assurance that I am altogether in Christ. At present, I can testify only that I have the discernment, not that I live apart from the sphere of ethics and fully in Christ. No doubt, ethical teachings are very good, but these teachings are not Christ. A first step toward living apart from ethics and in Christ Himself is to develop the discernment between ethics and Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="nHBw_AdnQIfkqKVM8Tgl0tVT-Y0R7CZbTRLJRhNrPdZcnD6qmiGxxSQio_uvcr2U-"> What is true of Chinese Christians concerning ethics is also true of Christians of different nationalities concerning their cultures. Years ago I was invited to stay as an honored guest in a place in England known for the spirituality of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> Christians there. While I was there, I noticed that the saints in that place lived very much according to British diplomacy. This was especially true of the elders. The elders were obedient to the leading elder. When they were with him, they were kind and polite. But on occasion they spoke negative things concerning him. Although this place was the source of many books about spiritual things, the believers there actually did not express much genuine spirituality. Instead, they lived according to their type of diplomacy. There can be no doubt that they loved the Lord. But in their daily life they practiced diplomacy instead of living in Christ. Just as the Chinese philosophical ethics has been wrought into the very fiber of the Chinese people, so British diplomacy had been wrought into the being of those saints in England. </p>
<p data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wE6P0prsWrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J"> I use these illustrations to point out the fact that no matter how earnestly the believers may seek the Lord, they are still under the influence of their national characteristics. In their daily living, they are influenced more by their culture than by Christ. When Paul said that he counted all things loss, he meant not only material things, but also things such as religion, philosophy, and culture. We may be willing to count material things as loss for Christ, but we may not count as loss our culture or our national characteristics. But religion, culture, and national characteristics were among the things Paul counted to be trash, refuse, in order to gain Christ and be found in Him. These things may be very good, but they are not in resurrection and they are not in the new creation. Moreover, they are not of Christ or of the Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-j_d0rLEqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI">THE NEED FOR THE EXCELLENCY<br/>OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRNhSflotMnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY"> Even though we may love the Lord very much and daily take time to pray ourselves into the Spirit, in our actual living we may live in things other than Christ. The Chinese saints may live in their ethics, and the British saints may live in their diplomacy. We live this way automatically and <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> spontaneously. How we need a vision of the excellency of Christ. If we have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we shall see that He far surpasses the best national characteristics. We shall know that Christ is far superior to every element of our culture. Only the excellency of the knowledge of Christ will rid us of the influence of all the things that are not Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvl3Eg_8MXkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> It is rather easy for us to apply Christ as our peace, joy, and rest. But when we consider higher aspects of Christ, we find them rather difficult to apply. For example, Christ is the mystery of God’s economy. Although we may know Him as the mystery of God’s economy, it is not easy for us to apply Him in this aspect in our daily walk. The gap between such an aspect of Christ and our daily living is extremely great. We also find it difficult to experience Christ as the body, the reality, of all the positive things. There is an urgent need for us to pray concerning this. </p>
<p data-content-id="LY3b3GAWOFJOmvN2cbErBRxwrADVnQOHD62ke0j8mOyinQzXo2YxW2fi2ufAiHKu1"> Although the light is shining brightly among us, there seems to be too little effect in our daily living. In the meetings, under the shining of the light, we may be impressed with the excellency of Christ, but when we go home after the meeting, we are very much the same. We desperately need to pray that we may see the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. If we have such a knowledge in a real and practical way, all the elements of our human living which are not Christ Himself will be put to death. The excellency of the knowledge of Christ annuls the influence of our national characteristics and domestic philosophy. From my experience I can testify that the excellency of the knowledge of Christ kills all the good things that replace Christ in our daily living. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mIS7O7a-NT_KDOKl-0XRFQVGIixPbbtK_H0Cio96dDINunJF9QeGmdjRtCHl84RqP">THE POWER OF CHRIST’S RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfpzMS_YL2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90689" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">3:10</span> Paul speaks of the power of Christ’s resurrection. The power of Christ’s resurrection is His resurrection life that raised Him from among the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90690" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19-20">Eph. 1:19-20</span>). Christ’s divine life includes the element of resurrection. Even before He was resurrected, He could say to Martha, “I <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> am the resurrection and the life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90691" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>). The reality of Christ’s resurrection life is the Spirit. Resurrection is abstract and mysterious; no one can define it. But we can know the Spirit as the reality of resurrection. The Spirit of Christ is the reality of the resurrection of Christ. Thus, where the Spirit of Christ is, there is resurrection. Because this Spirit is now within us, the power of Christ’s resurrection is within us also. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90709" data-verses="Philippians 3:12-14">verses 12 through 14</span> Paul applies to himself the things presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90710" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-11">verses 7 through 11</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90711" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span> he says, “Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.” The Greek word rendered <em>perfected</em> also means “completed or matured in life.” Paul’s meaning here is that he was still growing, for he did not regard himself as one who had reached maturity. If Paul needed to say that he had not already obtained or was not already perfected, even though he had so much growth in life and so much experience of Christ, how much more should we have such an attitude about ourselves! </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwFP8oaeIyG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90712" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span> Paul says, “I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.” The Greek word translated “lay hold of” may also be rendered “gain, grasp, or get possession of.” It may even be rendered “seize.” For simplicity, in this message we shall use the word <em>gain.</em> Paul aspired to gain that for which he had been gained by Christ Jesus. At the time of his conversion Paul was gained by Christ. Christ had gained Paul with the intention that Paul would gain Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOxjUFnzOf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> Not many Christians speak of their conversion in the way Paul spoke of his. Have you ever heard anyone say that at the time he was converted Christ gained him so that he might gain Christ? We need to realize that Christ has gained us that we might gain Him. Then we need to use Paul’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="192" id="192">[192]</span> expression to uplift our conversation about conversion. Christ gained us not merely for the sake of forgiveness, redemption, salvation, or heaven. I repeat, He gained us for the definite purpose that we might gain Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrPaXLvbuSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> Do you realize that you have been gained by Christ? At the time of your conversion, Christ laid hold of you, seized you, grasped you. When you were converted to Christ, He took full possession of you. Now it is impossible for you to escape His grasp. The Lord holds the whole earth in His hands. How do you expect to be able to run away from Him? The Lord is very patient; He is not easily offended or angered. Sometimes Christians misrepresent the Lord Jesus and give others the impression that He will immediately become angry if they do something wrong. However, the Lord may bear with you quite a long time without becoming angry with you. He is not troubled by your attempts to escape from Him. He knows that once He has gained you, you cannot get away. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMwhuJHlRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> When we first called on the name of the Lord Jesus for our salvation, we were “hooked” by the Lord. It is a very important matter to call on the Lord, for when we call on Him, we are gained by Him. Once the Lord has gained us, there is no escaping from Him. Some have testified that they tried to get away from the Lord for many years, but eventually had to return to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP-ZUQ5VP3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> The Lord has taken possession of us so that we might take possession of Him. This was His purpose in grasping us. Christ wants us to gain Him. The Lord’s aim in His salvation is to seize us that we might take full possession of Him. Not even when Paul was writing to the Philippians did he regard himself as having gained Christ in a full way. Rather, he was still pursuing Christ in order to gain Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8JlOKbVErEB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90713" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> Paul uses three Greek words that are rendered <em>gained, obtained,</em> and <em>laid hold of.</em> The meaning of these words is very close, for to obtain is to gain, and to gain is to lay hold of. The strongest of these expressions is <em>lay hold of.</em> Christ has laid hold of us that we might lay hold of Him. He has gained us that we might gain Him. Thus, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="193" id="193">[193]</span> Christian life is a life of gaining Christ. How much have you gained of Christ? This is a crucial question. We grow in life by gaining Christ. The degree to which we have gained Christ is the degree to which we have grown with Christ. We all need to gain Christ in order to grow in life. Spiritual growth is measured by how much we have gained of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGxYMpwR0kIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r"> I hope that the saints will use <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90714" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">3:12</span> to improve their vocabulary concerning conversion and salvation. According to this verse, conversion means that Christ gains a person so that this person may gain Him. Gaining Christ is a lifelong matter. Day by day our goal should be to gain Him. Even during his imprisonment, Paul was pursuing Christ in order to gain Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVwsKPnr_BvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> Paul’s use of the little word <em>if</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90715" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span> indicates that he was not certain about his growth in life. It is right to be sure of our salvation, but not to be certain of our growth in life. If we have the assurance that we have grown in life to an advanced degree, we probably have not grown to that extent. We should join Paul in saying, “<em>If</em> also I may lay hold....” </p>
<p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3wFZ4b8KQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90716" data-verses="Philippians 3:13-14">verses 13 and 14</span> Paul goes on to say, “Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing—forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” Even though Paul had experienced and gained Christ tremendously, he did not consider that he had experienced Him in full or gained Him to the uttermost. For this reason he was still advancing toward the goal—the gaining of Christ to the fullest extent. </p>
<p data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7CpgN4N-r0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90717" data-verses="Philippians 3:13">verse 13</span> Paul speaks of forgetting the things behind. In order to gain Christ to the fullest extent, Paul not only forsook his experience in Judaism but also refused to dwell on his past experiences of Christ and be limited by them. To dwell on our past experiences, no matter how real they may have been, frustrates our further pursuing after Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKJQNLFJym4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90718" data-verses="Philippians 3:13">verse 13</span> Paul tells us that he was stretching forward to the things which are before. He knew that Christ is <span class="pg" data-page-id="194" id="194">[194]</span> unsearchably rich, that there is a vast territory of His riches to be possessed. He was stretching forward to gain these riches and to advance further into this territory. </p>
<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAUotvdXNIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> Paul was pursuing toward the goal for the prize. Christ is both the goal and the prize. The goal is the fullest enjoyment and gain of Christ, and the prize is the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race. In order to reach the goal for the prize, Paul was exercised to forget the things which are behind and to stretch forward to the things which are before. This is the way to gain Christ by pursuing Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY3J7qSRoHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> Even though Paul was a matured saint and a very experienced apostle, he tells us that he had not already obtained and had not yet been perfected. He did not regard himself as one who had obtained the full enjoyment of Christ or the full maturity in life. He, of course, had obtained the common salvation by the common faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90719" data-verses="1Timothy 1:14-16">1 Tim. 1:14-16</span>), but he was still pursuing Christ in order to gain Him. Furthermore, Paul was also seeking Christ in order to have the extra portion of resurrection. In order to have this portion of resurrection, called the out-resurrection, we must pursue, run the race, and finish our course triumphantly. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG7EAQa76xa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> Like Paul, we have been regenerated, but we are not yet perfected, or matured, in life.

Maturity is a matter of stages. We may be mature, but not mature in full. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90735" data-verses="Philippians 3:15">verse 15</span> Paul uses the expression “full grown” in a relative sense, meaning relatively mature, neither childish nor absolutely mature.

<p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvl3cg-I0Xkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> Those who are full grown still need a mind to pursue Christ. At the time Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was full grown. However, he was still growing. This confirms that even the matter of full growth, or maturity, may be relative. Today none of us can say that we have reached the goal. Although we may not be childish and may actually be somewhat full grown, we still have not reached the goal. </p>

It charges them to strive together for the gospel with one soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90737" data-verses="Philippians 1:27">1:27</span>), to think the same thing, to be joined in soul, even to think the one thing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90738" data-verses="Philippians 2:2">2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90739" data-verses="Philippians 4:2">4:2</span>), to let the mind which was in Christ be in them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90740" data-verses="Philippians 2:5">2:5</span>), and to have this mind, a mind focused on the pursuing and gaining of Christ to the uttermost. When our mind is thus occupied, we have the same <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> mind, thinking the same thing, even thinking the one thing—the fullest gain of Christ—joined in soul, like-souled (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90741" data-verses="Philippians 2:20">2:20</span>), and with one soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfpzUS9c_2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90742" data-verses="Philippians 3:15">verse 15</span> implies that if we do not have this mind, we may be childish. Not having this mind is a sign that we are not full grown. As we consider the situation among Christians today, we see a great deal of childishness. Not many believers have this mind, the mind to seek after the fullest enjoyment and gain of Christ. Imagine how marvelous the situation would be if all seeking Christians had a mind focused on pursuing Christ for the full enjoyment and gaining of Him. If the seeking Christians were like this, the situation on earth would be excellent and wonderful. However, the situation among Christians today is confused and complicated. This is due to the fact that seeking Christians do not have this mind. Instead of seeking God’s unique goal, they pursue other goals. These different goals cause trouble. We in the Lord’s recovery should have one goal, and this goal should be to pursue Christ that we may have the fullest enjoyment of Him and may gain Him in full. </p>

We should not be otherwise minded. God wants always to adjust our mind to His center by revealing to us the need of such a mind, a mind focused on the pursuing of Christ. </p>

What he said was that God would reveal this to them. </p>

If we do not have a fixed goal, the unique goal, the goal set up by God in eternity, and hold to it, we shall eventually be distracted. The only thing that can keep us on God’s way is His unique goal—Christ for our highest enjoyment and ultimate gain. If we take this goal as our ultimate goal, we shall be preserved. </p>

The words <em>whereunto we have attained</em> modify <em>walk.</em> </p>

By this word the apostle charges us to walk and order our lives by the same rule, in the same line, in the same path, in the same footsteps, whereunto we have attained, at the state to which we have attained. Whatever state we have attained to in our spiritual life, we all must walk by the same rule, in the same path, as the apostle did; that is, to pursue Christ toward the goal that we may gain Him to the fullest extent as the prize of God’s calling from above. </p>
<p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExXFM-oYe6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> The Greek word <em>stoicheo</em> is a verbal form of the noun which means “element.” We do not have an English equivalent for this word. In English we can use <em>element</em> as a noun, <span class="pg" data-page-id="202" id="202">[202]</span> but not as a verb. One version adopts the rendering “observe the elements.” This conveys much of the original meaning; however, I do not care to use the word <em>observe</em> here. Perhaps the Greek should be rendered “walk according to the elementary principles,” since the meaning is that the elementary principles become our walk. Among the ancient Greeks, there were, as there are today, societies or organizations which followed certain basic principles. There are also basic principles, basic elements, involved in being a Christian. These elements should become a Christian’s walk. This was Paul’s concept in using this particular word for <em>walk</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90758" data-verses="Philippians 3:16">3:16</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadPql_JPKoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> We have pointed out that this word is derived from a word which means to range in regular line or march in military rank. Paul uses this term in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90759" data-verses="Romans 4:12">Romans 4:12</span>, where he speaks of “those who walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham.” To walk in the steps of Abraham’s faith is to conform to his faith, to conform ourselves to certain virtue or piety. This Greek word is very rich in meaning. </p>

Pursuing Christ, therefore, should be the major principle according to which we walk. Paul has already indicated this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90761" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span> by saying that he pursues in order to lay hold of that for which he has also been laid hold of by Christ Jesus. According to this verse, the principle of our conversion and salvation is that we have been gained by Christ in order to gain Him. This principle must become a basic and governing element in our Christian walk. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3DMkjpgtf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> Unfortunately, many of today’s Christians do not follow this governing principle. Instead of pursuing God’s unique goal, they seek other things. For example, those in the Pentecostal movement or charismatic movement may seek power or spiritual gifts. They may pursue speaking in tongues, healing, or manifestations of other gifts. Those who have such pursuits are not following the basic principle of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="203" id="203">[203]</span> Christian life. This principle is to pursue Christ that we may gain Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPR7QxZNTy3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy"> In order to have an adequate understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90778" data-verses="Philippians 3:17-21">3:17-21</span>, we need to know Paul’s basic thought in these verses. This requires experience and insight. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X88HcGjqIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_">PAUL’S BASIC THOUGHT</h2><p data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCXs_90UN16P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90779" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapters one and two</span> Paul’s intention was to have communication, fellowship, between him and the believers in Philippi that he might share his experience of Christ so that the believers might be encouraged to have a full participation in his enjoyment of Christ. At the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90780" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span>, Paul changes his emphasis. Although it is rather difficult to trace Paul’s thought in this chapter, my burden in this message is to consider Paul’s basic concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90781" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExXFI-qMW6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> If we read this chapter carefully, we shall see that Paul refers to two groups of people who were exerting a strong influence in the Mediterranean area. The first group was the Judaizers, the Jewish religionists, who were zealous for their traditional religion. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90782" data-verses="Philippians 3:2">verse 2</span> Paul speaks of them as dogs, evil workers, the concision. The second group consisted of those who held to the Epicurean philosophy, which promoted indulgence in the pleasure of eating and drinking and self-gratification in other things, all of which are contrary to the cross of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90783" data-verses="Philippians 3:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>). From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90784" data-verses="Philippians 3:2">verse 2</span> we see that Judaizers were causing damage to the Philippian believers. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90785" data-verses="Philippians 3:18">verse 18</span> we see that those who practiced according to the Epicureans were also causing damage to them. The former was of Jewish origin; the latter, of a heathen source. <span class="pg" data-page-id="208" id="208">[208]</span> Paul’s underlying thought in this chapter is related to these two groups. As we shall see, in speaking of the Judaizers, Paul deals with the soul, especially with the mind, but in speaking of the Epicureans, he deals with the body. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadPqh_LLGoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> The Judaizers did not promote the enjoyment of material things. Rather, they zealously promoted their particular religious philosophy. Both religion and philosophy involve the mind. For the most part, religious people and philosophical people are not occupied with material things. They do not care to indulge themselves in such things as eating and drinking. On the contrary, they may even restrict themselves in these matters. As we have pointed out, the things to which Paul refers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90786" data-verses="Philippians 3:3-7">verses 3 through 7</span> are not material things, but things related to religion, philosophy, and culture, things which have much to do with our mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAUo1vdXtIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> The believers in Philippi had been saved and regenerated in spirit, but there was still the need for them to care for their soul and body in a proper way. As Paul was writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90787" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span>, deep within him was the intention to give certain instructions to the Philippian believers concerning how to deal with the soul and the body. Therefore, he first spoke of the Judaizers in order to edify the Philippians in dealing with the soul. Then he referred to the Epicureans in order to instruct the believers in dealing with the body. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY3JjqSRIHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu">TRANSFORMATION AND THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</h2><p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG7EYQaLyxa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> If we would deal with the soul, we need to count as refuse all religious matters, philosophical things, and cultural elements. The main ingredients of religion, philosophy, and culture are things which appeal to thoughtful people. This indicates that religion, philosophy, and culture are intimately related to the soul and to the psychological world. </p>
<p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgws6RJs96q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> In the past we have spoken very much about transformation. We even have a hymn on the subject of transformation (<em>Hymns,</em> #750). However, it is still possible that many do not realize that transformation involves the renewing of the mind. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90788" data-verses="Romans 12:2">Romans 12:2</span>, the renewing of the mind is a basic aspect of transformation. The transformation of our <span class="pg" data-page-id="209" id="209">[209]</span> soul depends to a great extent on the renewing of our mind. If our mind is not renewed, our soul will remain unchanged. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s92macQOJINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> To say that our mind is renewed means that a change has taken place in our way of thinking. The thoughts of many believers are still occupied with religious, philosophical, and cultural things, the very things mentioned by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90789" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-8">3:7 and 8</span>. These matters are related to the psychological world, to the world of the soul. Many are also taken over by a natural way of thinking. Such saints may be good, but they are the same in soul today as they were many years ago. A primary reason for our lack of transformation is that a huge rock, the rock of national characteristics, is occupying our soul, taking the place that belongs to Christ. In the case of every one of us, national characteristics occupy our soul. Our soul has been taken over by this rock. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZlfLJUJNlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt">THE NEED FOR SURGERY ON OUR SOUL</h2><p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82jNum8U_QAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> We may also liken national characteristics that occupy our soul to a tumor which grows in a person’s stomach until there is room for little else. In our psychological stomach a tumor has grown and has taken over nearly all the room which should be reserved for Christ. For this reason, our inner being cannot contain much spiritual food and it cannot function normally. Believers from every country, and even from different regions in a particular country, have a tumor characteristic of them. This tumor grows especially in our natural mind. It has grown to such a degree that it has become part of our very constitution. </p>
<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT8kaQn-0-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> From years of experience I can testify that, without exception, all believers have such a tumor in their psychological stomach. The only difference among us regarding this tumor is its size. Only the most skillful Surgeon—the Lord Jesus Himself—is able to remove the tumor hidden within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX7MW_fTbnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90790" data-verses="Philippians 3:1-16">3:1-16</span> Paul deals with this tumor; he operates on our soul, especially on our thinking. When he was Saul of Tarsus, Paul had a large tumor in his soul. This tumor influenced Paul’s thoughts about the Jewish religion, law, circumcision, and tradition. But one day the Lord Jesus, the greatest <span class="pg" data-page-id="210" id="210">[210]</span> Surgeon, operated on Paul, and a huge tumor was removed from his mind. However, with most of us, this surgery has not yet taken place. The tumor is still in our soul. </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO407NLy4J6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> For a number of years I was bothered within by a question for which I was not able to find an answer. Why do Christians who truly love the Lord and seek Him earnestly go on year after year without growing in life? Even though they read the Bible faithfully, they do not see anything. Now I have at least part of the answer. The lack of growth in life and shortage of revelation in reading the Word are caused by a tumor in their psychological stomach. Realizing the seriousness of this, I am burdened to emphasize again and again that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90791" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-8">3:7 and 8</span> Paul refers not to material things, but to religious, philosophical, and cultural things, in particular to thoughts, concepts, and ideas that occupy our soul. Because such things have grown within us like a tumor, we are in desperate need of surgery. We need a thorough dealing with the soul, especially with the mind. </p>

In order to have such a mind, we must be operated on by the Lord and have our psychological tumor removed. Oh, may the Lord show us how we need such a mind! </p>

These five verses deal with physical enjoyment, especially as practiced by the Epicureans. As genuine seekers of Christ, we need surgery to eliminate our religious and philosophical thoughts, and we also need a proper dealing with the physical body. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90795" data-verses="Philippians 3:19">verse 19</span> Paul speaks of those “whose God is the belly,” but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90796" data-verses="Philippians 3:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> he says that we are awaiting the Lord Jesus Christ, “Who will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory.” In these verses Paul deals with the physical body and its enjoyment. We should <span class="pg" data-page-id="211" id="211">[211]</span> not think that Paul deals only with the soul and leaves the body free to indulge itself in its lusts. In dealing with the soul, Paul does not touch physical things. But in dealing with the body, he does touch these things. </p>

<p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURB1mLibMnHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> In reading the Bible we should not take anything for granted. We should not take one sentence, or even a phrase or word, for granted, assuming that we understand it. If we take things for granted when reading the Bible, we shall deceive ourselves. In my reading of the Word I always exercise not to take anything for granted. In particular, I pay attention to those things which are rather puzzling. Before we go on to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90821" data-verses="Philippians 4:1-4">4:1-4</span>, I would like to point out some of the puzzling elements in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90822" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-16">3:7-16</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LI_pyAAUqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH">SOME PUZZLES IN PHILIPPIANS 3</h2><p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFqrPPwLRd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90823" data-verses="Philippians 3:7">verse 7</span> Paul says, “But what things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ.” What does Paul mean by gains and by loss? Furthermore, why does he speak of gains in the plural and loss in the singular? </p>
<p data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG98rEnTdeYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90824" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span> Paul continues, “But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them to be refuse that I may gain Christ.” Paul’s use of the word <em>excellency</em> is puzzling. What does he mean by this word? And what is “the excellency of the knowledge of Christ”? In reading this verse, many think of excellent knowledge rather than of the excellency of the knowledge. There is a great difference, however, between excellent knowledge and the excellency of the knowledge. In this verse Paul also speaks of suffering loss and counting certain things to be refuse. Why does he use the word <em>refuse</em>? Why does he not say, “I counted them to <span class="pg" data-page-id="218" id="218">[218]</span> be nothing”? Furthermore, what is the difference between <em>loss</em> and <em>refuse</em>? </p>
<p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cIwivY1RhRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90825" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">verse 9</span> Paul says, “And be found in Him.” What does it mean to be found in Christ? Why does Paul not say “known in Christ” or “seen in Christ”? Why did he use the word <em>found</em>? </p>
<p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExXFE-oY-6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90826" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Verse 10</span> says, “To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.” We have pointed out that to know Christ means to experience Him and enjoy Him. Why does Paul not use the words <em>enjoy</em> and <em>experience</em> here? We also need to pay more attention to the expression “the power of His resurrection.” I do not believe that we yet have an adequate definition of this. We should also inquire about “the fellowship of His sufferings.” To what does this refer? Some may say that the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings denotes our participation in these sufferings. But what does Paul intend by the word <em>fellowship</em> here? Furthermore, why does he use the word <em>conformed</em>? We need to study carefully Paul’s word about being conformed to Christ’s death and solve the puzzle raised by this expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadPqt_JPqoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90827" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">verse 11</span> Paul continues, “If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.” Paul’s use of the term <em>out-resurrection</em> is puzzling. Even the words <em>by any means</em> require careful consideration. </p>
<p data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78R-o6vl26XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90828" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span> Paul says, “Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.” Why does Paul use the word <em>obtained</em> here instead of <em>gained</em>? Also what does he mean by laying hold of that for which he had been laid hold of by Christ Jesus? All these matters are puzzling. </p>
<p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2Iwm2hS-AfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90829" data-verses="Philippians 3:13-14">verses 13 and 14</span> Paul goes on to say, “Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing—forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” What does Paul mean by the word <em>reckon</em> here? Also we need <span class="pg" data-page-id="219" id="219">[219]</span> to ask how it is possible to forget the things behind. It seems we can forget things only when we do not want to forget them. But when we try to forget something, we remember it all the more. How then are we to understand Paul’s word about forgetting? Can we forget our national characteristics, when they are with us wherever we go? Paul’s expression “stretching forward” is also unique and worthy of close examination. What does it mean to stretch forward to the things which are before? We also need to ponder the goal and the prize in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90830" data-verses="Philippians 3:14">verse 14</span>, not assuming that we have a full understanding of these two items. We also need to consider Paul’s word concerning the high calling. Why does he not speak of the calling from above or the calling from the heavens? Why does Paul say that the high calling of God is in Christ Jesus? Why does he not say that it is in Jesus Christ? In other words, why does he put the title Christ before the name Jesus? Surely the order is significant and meaningful. Moreover, why does Paul speak not of the high calling <em>by</em> God, but of the high calling <em>of</em> God? Some may say that this is simply a matter of idiom. But this does not resolve the puzzle. In Greek Paul could have said it either way. There must be a reason he said of God here and not by God. If we ask questions such as these, we shall learn not to take things for granted in reading the Bible. As we read the Word, we need to realize how little we actually understand it. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3DEkjZ4tf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90831" data-verses="Philippians 3:15">Verse 15</span> continues, “Let us therefore, as many as are full grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you.” Why does Paul use the term <em>full grown</em>? This expression signifies life, for anything that grows must be living. Although we may have some understanding of the expression “full grown,” it is still rather puzzling. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllRFXm1ks6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90832" data-verses="Philippians 3:15">verse 15</span> what does Paul mean by <em>this mind</em> and by <em>otherwise minded</em>? These simple words convey important concepts. </p>
<p data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jEFTBVMDba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv"> Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90833" data-verses="Philippians 3:16">verse 16</span> Paul says, “Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.” What is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="220" id="220">[220]</span> meaning of <em>only this</em> and of <em>whereunto we have attained</em>? In this verse almost every phrase is a puzzle. </p>
<p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURB1mLjf4nHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> The Bible is God’s word; it is the divine breath, the breathing out of God Himself. Thus we should not read it the way we read a newspaper or magazine. Instead, we should not take anything for granted, but, by asking questions, earnestly seek out the meaning and significance of the words, phrases, and sentences of the Bible. If we pay attention to all the puzzling elements in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90834" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-16">3:7-16</span>, we shall receive more spiritual riches. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LI_pyB0cqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH">TWO DEALINGS</h2><p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFqrPPxvdd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> In the first two chapters of Philippians we see the fellowship, the spiritual traffic, between the apostle and the believers. As we have pointed out, the third chapter is concerned with two kinds of dealing—the dealing with the soul and with the body. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90835" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span>, to deal with our soul in a proper way is to count as loss, even as refuse, all religious, philosophical, and cultural things. We may not realize that such things have been wrought into our soul. Our soul is not only filled with these elements, but even constituted of them. These things may be useful for society, but they are damaging to the Christian life. They are rocks occupying room in our being that belongs to Christ. Although you have received Christ, you may confine Him to your spirit and not allow Him to spread out into your soul. In your soul there may be no room for Christ. Your soul may have been filled with the things of religion, philosophy, and culture, in particular with your national characteristics. Both in the Orient and the West, I have seen that every saint has been constituted of these things in the soul. But Paul was rescued by counting these things to be refuse. No longer would he treasure anything of religion, philosophy, or culture. In order to gain Christ, he was absolute in counting other things to be refuse. </p>
<p data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG98rEl31eYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb"> As we have indicated, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90836" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> Paul deals with the body as well as the soul. He points out that the believers should not have excessive enjoyment in physical things. <span class="pg" data-page-id="221" id="221">[221]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cIwivaB9hRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2><p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nffipx6mUZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> After writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90837" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span>, Paul’s burden was discharged. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90838" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> serves as a conclusion. In this conclusion, Paul does not present any additional main points. The contents of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90839" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> are related to what Paul has already written and are a confirmation of these points. Furthermore, the points in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90840" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> function as a charge to the believers. </p>

<p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHU5NN74fkJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> In reading the book of Philippians it is important to find out what are the basic factors which motivated Paul in his writing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90853" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span> the motivating factors are the need for the dealing with the soul and with the body. We have seen that Paul referred to two groups of people, the Judaizers and the Epicureans, in giving instructions to the saints concerning how to deal with the soul and with the body. As we come now to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90854" data-verses="Philippians 4:5-9">4:5-9</span>, we find eight excellent characteristics. We need to ask why at this point in his writing Paul mentions these characteristics. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld39oekRe_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90855" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">Chapter four</span> is a word of conclusion. As he was composing this concluding word, Paul was still motivated by those factors which caused him to write the first three chapters. He was still considering such matters as thinking the same thing by pursuing Christ and rejoicing in the Lord in order to enjoy the riches of Christ. In the first three chapters of Philippians Paul refers to the inner reality of the experience of Christ. But prior to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90856" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span>, he does not give any illustrations of the outer expression of this reality. If we enjoy Christ and experience Him, we shall have a certain inner reality. Such an inward reality invariably issues in an outward expression. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90857" data-verses="Philippians 4:5-9">4:5-9</span> we find a full expression of this inward reality, a full expression of a life that lives Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMwxuLTNRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90858" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">1:21</span> Paul declares, “To me to live is Christ.” This statement is a testimony of Paul’s inner reality. But what is the real expression of a life that lives Christ? This expression is <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> found in the virtues listed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90859" data-verses="Philippians 4:5-9">4:5-9</span>. In the same principle, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90860" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span> Paul sets forth Christ as our pattern. Suppose we take the crucified and exalted Christ as our pattern. What will be the expression of a life which lives according to this pattern? The expression is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90861" data-verses="Philippians 4:5-9">4:5-9</span>. The same is true with respect to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90862" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span> concerning counting all things loss, even refuse, in order to gain Christ. What kind of expression will there be in a person’s life if that one condemns philosophy, rejects culture, and renounces religion, counting them as refuse in order to gain Christ? What kind of life will such a person live, and what will be the practical expression of this life? Once again we would point out that the expression is seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90863" data-verses="Philippians 4:5-9">4:5-9</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP-ZEQ7Rj3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> Although Philippians is a short book, the factors which motivated the writing of this book are rich and profound. In these messages we have been exercised to dig into the depths of Philippians and bring these factors to light. This is also our purpose in considering <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90864" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span>. What was the factor which motivated Paul to write this concluding chapter in the way he did? Why immediately after speaking of rejoicing in the Lord does he go on to speak of forbearance and anxiety? Why does he continue with naming certain virtues, and why do these virtues not include such things as holiness, victory, and patience? The basic factor within Paul motivating him to write this concluding word was the need to show the expression of a life that lives Christ, that takes Christ as the pattern, that counts all religious, philosophical, and cultural things as refuse, and that enjoys Christ as everything. With this as his motivation, Paul composed <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90865" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> as a concluding word to this Epistle. </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX7Me_fT7nzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> The title of this message is “Excellent Characteristics of the Christian Life.” But it could be entitled “The Expression of a Life Which Lives Christ.” The latter title is deeper and more profound than the former. This portion of Philippians presents the expression of a life that lives Christ—a life that takes Christ as the pattern and counts all things refuse in order to gain more of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="227" id="227">[227]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO407FLy4p6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz">I. FORBEARANCE</h2><p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSET4ImpB8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> The first aspect of the expression of a life that lives Christ is forbearance. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90866" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">Philippians 4:5</span> says, “Let your forbearance be known to all men.” Later we shall see that a second aspect is the absence of anxiety. In a life that lives Christ there will be forbearance, but no anxiety, no worry. Paul considers forbearance and the lack of anxiety as the first two aspects of the expression of a life that lives Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfyndtPBGL9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> A life that lives Christ is calm, tranquil, peaceful, and quiet. A life of turmoil, on the contrary, is a life that lives Satan. Forbearance is the most important element of a tranquil life. Forbearance is reasonableness and consideration in dealing with others. To have forbearance is to deal with others without strictness of legal right. If we would live a calm life, we must have forbearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuO56ojx5pnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> Forbearance includes patience and moderation, but goes beyond them. If you have forbearance, you will not argue with others, fight with them, or debate with them. You may have a great deal to say, but you will have patience and moderation in dealing with others and will not say anything in response to provocation or irritation. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceQTTSSPycDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> Suppose a group of sisters live together. The most precious sister will be the one who is the most forbearing. When difficulties arise, she will be calm and quiet. Even if others offend her, she will not retaliate. Sisters who lack forbearance, however, may easily react when they are offended. In their living there is no calm, no tranquillity, no moderation. A proper Christian life is a life of calm. To live such a life means that we do not argue with people or fight with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexKs_NUL4zqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> Forbearance is versus rivalry and vainglory, two negative things mentioned by Paul. Forbearance is also opposed to murmurings and reasonings. Some saints are given to the pursuit of rivalry and vainglory, whereas others are given to murmurings and reasonings. Whenever we have rivalry, vainglory, murmurings, and reasonings, there is no calm, no tranquillity, no forbearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwFPsob68yG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> From my experience I have learned that the first aspect of a life which lives Christ is tranquillity. If we live Christ, <span class="pg" data-page-id="228" id="228">[228]</span> we shall not argue with others. We shall know what is the right time to speak even a calm word. Even a calm statement made at the wrong time can contribute to an argument. If you reply as soon as someone offends you, your word will not be one of forbearance. If someone is angry with you, it is best not to say anything. Exercise forbearance and wait for the right time to utter a calm word. It is especially important for married brothers and sisters to practice this. If your husband or wife is argumentative, be careful about the way you speak. It may be wise not even to call on the Lord aloud. Such a calling may stir up trouble. Instead of speaking outwardly, calm yourself, call on the Lord inwardly, and wait until the situation is tranquil before you say anything. </p>
<p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOxjEFlnGf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> It is easy to teach this, but it is quite difficult to practice it. To live in this way requires grace. When a brother’s wife is angry with him, it is very easy for him to be stirred up. He may bristle with anger, and his emotions may boil over. At such a time it is extremely difficult to calm down and be tranquil. For this, we need the Lord’s grace. It takes much grace to be forbearing in this kind of situation. But if we exercise to be calm by the Lord’s grace, the atmosphere will eventually become tranquil. Then there will come a proper time to speak a calm word. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrPaHLtfiSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> I have wondered why after covering such profound matters in the first three chapters, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90867" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span>, “Let your forbearance be known to all men.” Compared with what Paul has already covered, forbearance seems to be a secondary matter. However, in a very practical way, forbearance is a test of whether or not we live Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNzHUYDSlP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90868" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> Paul also says, “The Lord is near.” Many readers of Philippians take this as a reference to the Lord’s coming. I do not say that this does not refer at all to the coming of the Lord; however, I believe that it does not mainly refer to His coming. On the contrary, it refers primarily to the Lord’s presence with us. The Lord is near; He is with us. When we live Him, taking Him as our pattern and counting all things loss in order to gain Him, we sense that He is present with <span class="pg" data-page-id="229" id="229">[229]</span> us. He is near both in space and in time. In space, He is close to us, ready to help; in time, He is at hand, coming soon. Since the Lord is near, what need is there for us to be troubled and stirred up? </p>

<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAUoBvcjFIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> In the foregoing message we began to consider certain excellent characteristics of the Christian life, pointing out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90886" data-verses="Philippians 4:5-9">4:5-9</span> we have the expression of a life that lives Christ. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90887" data-verses="Philippians 4:5-6">verses 5 and 6</span> we saw that such a life exhibits forbearance, but has no anxiety. In this message, a continuation of the preceding one, we shall go on to see six governing aspects of a life that lives Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY3JXqT1kHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu">III. THE REST</h2><p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG7EsQYfSxa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> Paul gives us these governing aspects in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90888" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">verse 8</span>: “For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.” </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgwsORLoZ6q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM">A. Whatever Is True</h2><p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LI_RyB08qAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> The first governing aspect of a life that lives Christ is “whatever is true.” The word <em>true</em> here means truthful ethically, not merely true in matter of fact. In the expression of a life that lives Christ there can be no falsehood, no lying. Everything we do or say must be truthful. No one who lives Christ should practice falsehood of any kind. A life that is the expression of Christ is a truthful one. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFqr3Pxv9d_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn">B. Whatever Is Honorable</h2><p data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG98TElH9eYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb"> The second aspect is “whatever is honorable.” The Greek <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> word rendered <em>honorable</em> means venerable, worthy of reverence, noble, grave (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90889" data-verses="1Timothy 3:8">1 Tim. 3:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90890" data-verses="1Timothy 3:11">11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90891" data-verses="Titus 2:2">Titus 2:2</span>), implying the idea of dignity, which inspires and invites reverence. A life that lives Christ will be honorable, noble, grave, solid, weighty, and dignified. </p>
<p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cIwavax1hRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> We should not think that only older people should be weighty. All the young people, even the teen-agers, should also have dignity. Even a young brother in junior high school should have dignity, for he has God within him. He is a vessel containing God as his worth, weight, and dignity. </p>
<p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nffiRx6WMZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> To have dignity is not to act important; it is to live God. A jewelry box containing a diamond ring has dignity not because of the box itself, but because of the diamond. It is the diamond in the box which gives dignity to the box. In like manner, we are a vessel containing Christ. If we live Him, we shall have true dignity. When others see us bearing such a dignity, they will have a deep respect for us. The dignity implied in the Greek word for <em>honorable</em> always inspires a profound respect. This dignity is the second governing aspect of the expression of a life that lives Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvdM8wEzC7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn">C. Whatever Is Righteous</h2><p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O1jV5mM6LRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90892" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">verse 8</span> Paul also speaks of “whatever is righteous.” This refers to what is right (not just) before God and man. Doing what is right is another governing aspect related to the living of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyFH2C0vIz0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK">D. Whatever Is Pure</h2><p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NC72_g0ipcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> The word <em>pure</em> in the expression “whatever is pure” means single in intention and action, without any mixture. To be pure in this way is to have no pretense. Purity is also a governing aspect of the life that lives Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV38bk3jpdIiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG">E. Whatever Is Lovely</h2><p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHU5xN683kJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> Yet another governing aspect of such a life is “whatever is lovely.” The word <em>lovely</em> means “lovable, agreeable, endearing.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="235" id="235">[235]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld39UelFy_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5">F. Whatever Is Well-Spoken Of</h2><p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMwNuJ3tRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> Next Paul goes on to mention “whatever is well-spoken of.” This means whatever is of good repute, renowned, attractive, winning, and gracious. The Greek word means “sounding well.” </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP-Z4Q5lH3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90893" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">verse 8</span> Paul does not mention kindness, patience, or holiness. Instead, he mentions six items which are governing aspects of a life that lives Christ. If we live Christ, we shall surely have a life that is an expression of all these aspects. In our living there will be no falsehood, looseness, or lightness. Instead, our living will be honorable, pure, right, lovely, and well-spoken of. Of the many, many Christian virtues, Paul selected these six as governing aspects. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8JlOmbV0zEB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> Here I wish to point out that all human virtues were created by God. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90894" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>, we were made in God’s image. Our human virtues are a vessel made to contain the divine virtues, just as a glove is made in the image of a hand to contain the hand. The Bible reveals that the image of God is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90895" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Col. 1:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90896" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4">2 Cor. 4:4</span>). Therefore, to say that man was made in the image of God means that he was made according to the form of Christ. Man was created according to Christ so that he could contain Christ and express Him. A glove is designed in the pattern of a hand so that it can contain the hand. Likewise, man was designed by God to bear the pattern of Christ. When Christ comes into a person, that person becomes a vessel containing Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGxYgpwhskIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90897" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span> indicates that we are vessels to contain the glory of God. The glory of God denotes the expression of God, and this expression is Christ. Human virtues such as truthfulness, dignity, purity, and loveliness are all aspects of man as a vessel to contain Christ as the reality. </p>
<p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVwsmPnb3BvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> On the basis of Paul’s word, “To me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90898" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">1:21</span>), we can rightly say that the virtues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90899" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">4:8</span> are aspects of the expression of a life that lives Christ. Since Paul himself lived Christ, he certainly would not charge the saints to live something else instead of Christ. Therefore, the virtues he mentions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90900" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">4:8</span> must be the expression of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> reality lived by Paul and by other saints. This reality is Christ Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3wpZ4r0KQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90901" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span> we see Christ as the pattern, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90902" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span>, the pursuing of Christ with a view to gaining Him. In order to gain Christ, Paul counted all other things as refuse. How then could he exalt human virtues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90903" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span>? This is another indication that the virtues in this chapter are not something apart from Christ Himself. Rather, these virtues must be the very expression of the Christ lived by the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7CpMN49Gr0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt"> If we consider carefully the virtues listed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90904" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">4:8</span>, we shall have to confess that there is no way for us to live such a life in ourselves. The ethical teachings of Confucius are very high, but they are inferior to Paul’s instructions here in Philippians. I studied Confucius’ writing entitled <em>The Highest Learning,</em> but it cannot compare to the virtues mentioned by Paul. In ourselves it surely is impossible to have such a life with such an expression. Therefore, we must go on to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90905" data-verses="Philippians 4:13">4:13</span>, where Paul says, “I can do all things in Him who empowers me.” All the virtues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90906" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">4:8</span> are the expression of the very Christ in whom Paul could do everything. Based on the whole context of the book of Philippians, we can say that the six virtues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90907" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">4:8</span> are the expression of the living of Christ. These are not mere human virtues, not even the virtues developed according to the teachings of Confucius. These virtues are the expression of the very Christ whom we live. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKJQhLF5Km4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO">G. If Any Virtue and Any Praise</h2><p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAUoBvd3tIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> Toward the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90908" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">4:8</span> Paul changes his expression and says, “If there is any virtue and if any praise.” The Greek word for <em>virtue</em> here means excellence, that is, ethical energy exhibited in vigorous action. Praise refers to things worthy of praise, as the companion of virtue. The first six items are categorized as “whatever is”; the last two are categorized as “if any.” This indicates that the last two are a summing up of the six foregoing items, in all of which are some virtue or excellence and something worthy of praise. <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY3JXqSxIHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> Virtue and praise are not two additional aspects, but values of the six aspects already mentioned. Virtue is a general term rather than a specific aspect. There is virtue in truthfulness, dignity, purity, loveliness, rightness, and being well spoken of. The principle is the same with praise: there is something worthy of praise in all these six aspects of the Christian life. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG7EsQaryxa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> How excellent is the expression of the life that lives Christ! The six aspects in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90909" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">verse 8</span> certainly are excellent characteristics of the Christian life. It is excellent to be truthful, honorable, right, pure, lovely, and of good report. In each of these excellent aspects there is some virtue and something worthy of praise. We should “take account of these things”; that is, we should think on them, ponder them, consider them. </p>

<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO4079Lz8F6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> In this message we shall consider Paul’s secret of sufficiency in Christ. Paul had learned the secret of sufficiency, of satisfaction, of contentment. This secret is actually Christ Himself. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90930" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapter one</span>, Christ is the life for us to live; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90931" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span>, Christ is the pattern for us to follow; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90932" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span>, Christ is the goal and the prize for us to pursue. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90933" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span>, Christ is the secret and also the power for us to enjoy. In doing many things we must first know the secret and also have the power, the strength, the energy, to accomplish those things. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSETAIndh8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ">LEARNING THE SECRET</h2><p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfyndVPAiv9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> In teaching people to do things, even insignificant things, we mainly teach them the secret. This is true, for example, in teaching someone the art of barbecuing meat. If a person does not learn the secret of barbecuing, he may ruin the meat. One side may be overdone, and the other side raw. Likewise, we may not know the secret of sufficiency in Christ found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90934" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">Philippians 4</span>. We may talk a great deal about the book of Philippians, but not know the secret of experiencing Christ. To change the figure of speech, because we do not have the key, we cannot open the door to the experience of Christ. I say again, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90935" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> we have the secret and the power. On the one hand, Paul says, “I have learned the secret” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90936" data-verses="Philippians 4:12">v. 12</span>); on the other hand, he testifies, “I can do all things in Him who empowers me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90937" data-verses="Philippians 4:13">v. 13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuO5CohlBpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90938" data-verses="Philippians 4:11">verse 11</span> Paul says, “Not that I speak according to want, for I have learned in whatever circumstances I am to <span class="pg" data-page-id="244" id="244">[244]</span> be content.” To what word should the phrase <em>to be content</em> be joined? This phrase should not be connected with <em>I am,</em> for the words <em>I am</em> are related to the expression <em>in whatever circumstances.</em> Rather, <em>to be content</em> should be connected to <em>I have learned.</em> Paul had learned to be content in all circumstances. He could say, “I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.” </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceQTrSQLOcDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90939" data-verses="Philippians 4:12">verse 12</span> Paul continues, “I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want.” The words <em>I have learned the secret</em> are an interpretation of the Greek word which means “I have been initiated.” The metaphor is that of a person being initiated into a secret society with instruction in its rudimentary principles. Paul had not only learned a secret; he had been initiated and had learned certain basic principles. </p>
<p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOxj8Flnmf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> Among the Greeks there were a number of secret societies. Anyone who was to become a member of such a society had to learn the rudimentary principles of that society. Others had to initiate him into the society by instructing him in its principles. By using this metaphor, Paul was saying that a church, which is rather mysterious, has certain basic principles. After Paul was converted to Christ, he was in a sense initiated into the church life. This means that he was instructed in the secret of how to enjoy Christ, how to take Christ as life, how to live Christ, how to magnify Christ, how to gain Christ, and also how to have the church life. These are the rudimentary principles of the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrPa_LtfCSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> Although the church, the Body of Christ, is somewhat mysterious, the church definitely is not a secret society. On the contrary, the church is a bright city set on a hill. Furthermore, the church is open to all who are willing to come. But because the church has a mysterious aspect, there is the need of a spiritual initiation in order to learn the principles of the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNzHsYDitP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> The basic principles of the church life are altogether different from the basic principles of the world. We may know <span class="pg" data-page-id="245" id="245">[245]</span> all the rudimentary principles of the world and yet not know anything of the church life. Thus, when we are saved and come into the church, the Body of Christ, we need to be initiated by learning certain basic principles. The secret of the Body is to take Christ as our life, to live Christ, to pursue Christ, to gain Christ, to magnify Christ, and to express Christ. These are the basic principles of the church, the Body of Christ. As one who had been initiated into the Body, Paul had learned the secret. </p>
<p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWbczglJuV307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> Many Christians today have not been initiated into the church life in such a way. Although they have been converted to Christ, baptized, and have joined a denomination, they have not been initiated into the Body of Christ. They have not learned how to take Christ as life, how to live Christ, how to take Christ as their pattern, and how to count all religious, cultural, and philosophical things as refuse in order to gain Christ. In contrast to Paul, they have not learned the secret of experiencing Christ. Paul had been initiated both into the proper Christian life and into the proper church life. </p>

As a prisoner in Rome, he was far away from many of the believers and from many churches which had been raised up through his ministry. No doubt, during his imprisonment, he suffered both psychologically and physically. He was in need of a material supply. It certainly was not easy for him to be in prison under such circumstances. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-j_x0rLUqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI"> According to the record in the New Testament, when Paul was journeying in Europe for the ministry, the church in Philippi was unique in taking care of Paul’s material needs. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90941" data-verses="Philippians 4:15">4:15</span> he says, “And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the account of giving and receiving but you only.” Paul’s use of the word <em>account</em> here indicates that the Philippian <span class="pg" data-page-id="246" id="246">[246]</span> believers’ supply of material things to the apostle opened an account with him. As we shall see more fully in the next message, the believers in Philippi had opened an account with Paul in a way similar to opening an account in a bank today. More than once, the Philippian saints had made deposits into this account. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90942" data-verses="Philippians 4:16">verse 16</span> Paul reminds them, “For even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90943" data-verses="Philippians 4:17">verse 17</span> Paul again refers to the account the believers had opened with him: “Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which increases to your account.” </p>
<p data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRNh-flo9MnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY"> We have pointed out that the Philippian believers had opened a heavenly account with Paul and were known for the way they had supplied his material needs. However, when Paul was in prison, he had certain physical needs. Because Paul was still human, he expected the Philippians to continue remembering him. But for a period of time, the Philippians did not do this. This is implied by Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90944" data-verses="Philippians 4:10">verse 10</span>: “But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you caused your thinking for me to blossom anew; wherein you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.” Notice the words <em>at length</em> and <em>blossom anew.</em> For some time, the Philippians’ thinking of Paul had been dormant; it might even have withered. Their thinking for him certainly was not blossoming. But when Paul wrote this verse, winter had passed, and spring had come. He could now say that their thinking for him had begun to blossom anew. Paul was very kind in saying, “You did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.” In Paul’s words, however, there is the implication that before this blossoming anew of their thinking for him, Paul had hoped to receive from them some material supply. He had hoped to be supplied by the church which was unique in having opened a heavenly account with him. But for a period of time, no deposits came in. The “blossoms” had withered during the winter. But now that spring had arrived, there was a new blossoming. </p>

In their giving, many Christians do not have fellowship. By fellowship we do not simply mean communication or mutual participation. Fellowship also involves the ministering of life. When we have fellowship with one another, we minister life to one another. When many Christians give something as a gift, they do not have the deep sense that in this transaction there is the ministry of life. But if we pray-read the verses listed above, we shall touch the ministry of life, both from the side of the apostle and also from the side of the believers who sent a gift to him. No doubt, the saints in Philippi not only sent the material supply to Paul, but also ministered life to him. Thus, between the two parties, the apostle and the believers, there was the fellowship of life and the mutual ministry of life. It is important that we learn to give in such a fellowship of life and ministry of life. </p>

THE APOSTLE REJOICING IN THE LORD<br/>FOR THE BELIEVERS’ RENEWED CONCERN</h2><p data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wEqH0oPAWrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90965" data-verses="Philippians 4:10">4:10</span> Paul says, “But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you caused your thinking for me to blossom anew.” It might have been circumstances which kept the Philippian believers from continuing to send the material supply to Paul. When they sent a gift with Epaphroditus, Paul considered this the blossoming again of their thinking for him. According to Paul’s feeling, the sending of a gift <span class="pg" data-page-id="256" id="256">[256]</span> with Epaphroditus was the blossoming again of their concern for him. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-jvV0pfkqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI"> The words <em>blossom anew</em> are a beautiful expression, rich in their implication. How can something blossom without life? Paul’s use of the word <em>blossom</em> implies that the believers’ thought of him was a matter of life, something that expressed life. Furthermore, “blossom anew” implies that the believers’ concern for Paul had been dormant for a time, having passed through a winter season. For a plant to blossom anew requires that it undergo a period of withering or dormancy during the winter season. This winter season, during which the saints lacked the opportunity to care for Paul, was a time of suffering for him. But this suffering afforded him the opportunity to experience Christ in a richer way. </p>

THE BELIEVERS’ THINKING FOR THE APOSTLE</h2><p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NCrW_g0CpcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90966" data-verses="Philippians 4:10">4:10</span> Paul also says to the Philippians, “You did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.” These words show Paul’s experience and maturity. There were times that he rebuked the saints. For example, in writing to the Corinthians he rebuked them and asked if they wanted him to come with a rod (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90967" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:21">1 Cor. 4:21</span>). In writing to the Philippians, however, he speaks in a very positive way, telling them that at length they caused their thinking for him to blossom anew, that they indeed did take thought, but lacked opportunity. </p>
<p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV38LE3jp9IiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> As we have indicated, the words <em>blossom anew,</em> a literal translation of the Greek, imply that the giving of material things is a matter of life and of the ministry of life. If this were not so, Paul would not have used such an expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHUpRN6M_kJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> We must pay careful attention to the word <em>blossom.</em> This word implies that our giving of material things to any church, to any servant of the Lord, and to any of the saints must be something living that is able to blossom. This fellowship involves more than participation; it involves the circulation of the current of life. According to the Bible, fellowship always comes from life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90968" data-verses="1John 1:2-3">First John 1:2 and 3</span> reveal <span class="pg" data-page-id="257" id="257">[257]</span> that fellowship issues from life. The source of fellowship is life. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90969" data-verses="Philippians 4:10">Philippians 4:10</span> Paul uses the word <em>blossom,</em> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90970" data-verses="Philippians 4:14">verse 14</span>, the word <em>fellowship:</em> “Nevertheless you did well to have fellowship with me in my affliction.” It seems as if Paul is saying, “You ministered life to me and helped to sustain me in my imprisonment. When I was suffering, you helped me by ministering life to me. Surely you will receive a supply of life in return.” </p>
<p data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld3t0el16_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5"> The fellowship in life can be illustrated by the circulation of blood in the human body. On the one hand, as the blood circulates, it flows out; on the other hand, it returns. In like manner, our fellowship in life always has a going out with a return. Any outflow without a corresponding inflow is not true fellowship. Fellowship always involves circulation. The life goes out, and the life also returns. The life goes with a supply to the other party, and then it comes back with a supply from this party. Whenever we give material things under the leading of the Lord, we should experience such a fellowship in life. There should be the blossoming and the mutual supply of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMgtuJH1RwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> The fellowship the believers in Philippi had with Paul was for the furtherance of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90971" data-verses="Philippians 1:5">1:5</span>). Their sending of the supply of material things was for the furtherance of the gospel. As we have pointed out, the gospel here equals God’s move on earth for His economy. The gospel includes not only the good news of salvation, redemption, forgiveness, justification, and eternal life. Especially in a book like Philippians, the gospel signifies the move of God in His economy. Therefore, fellowship, even in the sending of a material supply, is for the furtherance of God’s move in His economy. </p>

THE APOSTLE’S REMEMBRANCE<br/>OF THE BELIEVERS’ SUPPLY IN THE PAST</h2><p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8JleGbVE7EB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90972" data-verses="Philippians 4:15-16">4:15 and 16</span> Paul refers to those times in the past when the believers in Philippi supplied him materially. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90973" data-verses="Philippians 4:17">verse 17</span> Paul goes on to say, “Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which increases to your account.” Why does Paul refer to their giving in the past? Surely this was not <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> written by accident, for Paul would not write anything without a purpose. Whatever he wrote was with a purpose and according to a burden. The secret to understanding Paul’s purpose in these verses is in the word <em>account</em> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="90974" data-verses="Philippians 4:15">vv. 15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90975" data-verses="Philippians 4:17">17</span>). The Philippian believers’ supply of material things to the apostle opened an account with him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90976" data-verses="Philippians 4:17">verse 17</span> Paul refers to the account opened in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90977" data-verses="Philippians 4:15">verse 15</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGxIApwRkkIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r"> In the Bible we have a revelation of the heavenly banking system. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90978" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">Matthew 6</span> the Lord Jesus speaks of making a deposit in our spiritual bank account. According to His word, we need to make deposits into our account in the heavens. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90979" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">Matthew 6</span>, of course, the word <em>account</em> is not used. In this matter also, the revelation in the Bible is progressive. Hence, in the Epistle to the Philippians Paul deliberately uses the word <em>account</em> in referring to the heavenly banking system. </p>
<p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVw8GPnrPBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90980" data-verses="Philippians 4:15">4:15</span> Paul says, “And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the account of giving and receiving but you only.” This verse indicates that the church in Philippi was unique in opening an account with Paul. With this account there is the side of giving, and the other side of receiving. Here we have a double entry account, an account of both giving and receiving. To be sure, in the account opened with Paul, the Philippian believers gave a great deal. The church in Philippi had opened an account to care for the needs of the apostle. This account, reflected in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90981" data-verses="Philippians 4:15">verse 15</span>, was kept in the heavenly bank. They sent gifts to Paul, and in return they received God’s repayment. </p>
<p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3gJZ4bMKQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> Paul speaks of this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="90982" data-verses="Philippians 4:19">verse 19</span>: “And my God shall fill every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” In the apostle’s experience, he had the conviction and assurance that God was his God through his being one with Him. Since he considered the Philippians’ material gift to him a sacrifice to God, he assuredly believed that God, who was one with him and who was his God, would richly repay the Philippians. On behalf of God, the believers sent something to God’s servant. For this, God would be sure to pay <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> them back. He would not owe the believers anything. The heavenly account would enter both a credit and a debit for the Philippian believers. </p>

<p data-content-id="-V7223f52MYBu9DyQ9J3bCV24Dm9JktTfbHd_yZfKDZbKPYsFs3GvbJI_KQbDX4I8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91003" data-verses="Philippians 4:20">verse 20</span> Paul exclaims, “Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91004" data-verses="Philippians 4:21">verse 21</span> he goes on to say, “Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.” Paul’s words of greeting here are related to what he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91005" data-verses="Philippians 4:20">verse 20</span> about glory to our God and Father. This indicates that he greeted the saints with the very weight of glory spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91006" data-verses="Philippians 4:20">verse 20</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPRrAxaNTy3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy"> When we send greetings to others, or ask others to greet certain ones on our behalf, we may greet them with our best regards or with our love. However, Paul did not greet the saints in Philippi in a superficial way, merely with his best regards or with his love. I believe that what was within him as he wrote this word of greeting was God’s rich supply and glory. Paul had just written, “And my God shall fill every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91007" data-verses="Philippians 4:19">v. 19</span>). No doubt this was the substance of his greetings to the saints. He wanted every saint to be greeted in Christ in this way. </p>

This means that they greeted the believers not with their best regards, but with the assurance of God’s repayment and with His glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="mIS7O7a-NT_KDOKl-0XRFQVGIihDbbta_H0Cio96dDINunJF9QeGmdjRtCHl84RqP"> We may even say that Paul and those with him greeted the saints in Christ Jesus with the entire contents of the whole book of Philippians. This means that Paul and the others greeted them with all the words in this book. The very fact that Paul simply said to greet every saint in Christ, not specifying in what way the saints should be greeted, implies that he greeted them with all the points covered in this Epistle. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91009" data-verses="Philippians 4:21">verse 21</span> Paul was actually saying, “Greet every saint in Christ according to all the things I have written in this Epistle.” Any saint who would not receive all these points could not have a share in Paul’s greeting. Those who would participate in his greeting must first enjoy all the points covered in this Epistle. These points were Paul’s best regards sent to them. Paul’s best regards to the saints were that they would live Christ, magnify Christ, take Christ as their pattern, hold forth Christ, count all things loss in order to gain Christ and be found in Him, pursue Christ, lay hold of Christ, and do all things in Christ. Seen in the context of the whole book, Paul greeted every saint with all the profound aspects of the experience of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfpjAS_Yb2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> A further indication that this was Paul’s concept in sending greetings to the saints is that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91010" data-verses="Philippians 4:21">verse 21</span> he uses the expression <em>in Christ Jesus.</em> This phrase implies the contents of the whole book, for, as we have pointed out again and again, this book deals with the experience of Christ and in Christ. Paul wanted the saints to be greeted in the very Christ whom we live, magnify, take as our pattern, hold forth as the word of life, and pursue. In reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91011" data-verses="Philippians 4:21">verse 21</span> we should be impressed not only with the words <em>every saint,</em> but especially with the expression <em>every saint in Christ Jesus.</em> Paul and those with him greeted the saints in <span class="pg" data-page-id="269" id="269">[269]</span> Christ Jesus with the whole contents of the book of Philippians. </p>

Some of these were converted through contact with Paul and became believers in Christ in Rome. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAN6o0k4ZK4wbCUGR_Vjs0Ec69KryQI26bi8inm71-o9jsQfmolIoHnVNoOiMyBxz"> The expression “those of Caesar’s household” is both puzzling and encouraging. It is puzzling because we are not altogether sure to whom it refers; it is encouraging because it shows the furtherance of the gospel. The gospel had spread even into the household of Caesar Nero. God’s move in His economy had gained even some of Caesar’s household. Many commentators do not have the boldness to say that certain relatives of Nero were actually saved. Rather, for the most part, they claim that “Caesar’s household” refers to Nero’s royal guard, for, according to the custom of the time, the royal guard was counted as part of Caesar’s household. We need to be clear that this is simply an interpretation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91013" data-verses="Philippians 4:22">verse 22</span> Paul does not say “the royal guard”; he says “Caesar’s household.” Based upon his use of the word <em>household,</em> we believe that certain members of Nero’s family actually were saved. What a tremendous victory! This indicates how worthwhile it is to have fellowship which results in the furtherance of the gospel, in the spread of God’s move on earth for His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="PlrvbBpD2zxx_8-X698IQTc85TX-KgO3F52HYJhkJHFcO4Qc_4xEevBqOsx5k1dpA"> It is significant that in writing to the Philippians Paul deliberately refers to “those of Caesar’s household.” I believe that Paul had fellowship with these ones, perhaps even telling them that he was writing a letter to the believers in Philippi. Then those brothers and sisters must have asked Paul to send their greetings to the saints in Philippi. This was the reason Paul could say, “All the saints greet you, and <em>especially</em> those of Caesar’s household.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="270" id="270">[270]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X8sXcHnCIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> In his word of blessing Paul says, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.” Grace is God in Christ as our supply and enjoyment conveyed to us and realized through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91014" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span>). To experience Christ as Paul did we need this grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCX8v91Ah16P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v"> Throughout the years, we have given a number of definitions of grace. Now we see that, in brief, grace is God Himself in Christ as our life supply and enjoyment. This supply and enjoyment is conveyed to us by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and it is realized by us through this Spirit. When Paul says, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit,” he means that the supply and enjoyment of the Triune God by and through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ should be with us. When we have such a supply, we enjoy and experience the Triune God all day long. </p>

With Our Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadP6x_J_ioQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91015" data-verses="Philippians 4:23">verse 23</span>, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit. The spirit here is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of Christ. It is in this spirit of ours that we enjoy Christ and experience Him as Paul did. </p>
<p data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78Ru06vVu6XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5"> Many Christians today have missed the mark of the regenerated spirit. They speak much about the Holy Spirit, but not of the human spirit. Because of this neglect of the regenerated human spirit, there is very little experience of Christ or enjoyment of the all-inclusive grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2Iw2qhSOYfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91016" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span> Paul says, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all” (lit.). Love is the source, grace is the course, and fellowship is the flow. Here we have Christ the Son, God the Father, and the Spirit—the enjoyment of the Triune God. Furthermore, in this verse we have the dispensing of the Triune God into us as love, grace, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="271" id="271">[271]</span> fellowship. However, these three are actually one; they are all related to the enjoyment of the Triune God. By means of love as the source, grace as the course, and fellowship as the flow, the Triune God dispenses Himself into our being to become our enjoyment. This is the grace which is with our spirit. How wonderful that the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit now indwells our spirit! This marvelous enjoyment is with our spirit. </p>

<p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2Iw2mhT6kfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> In this message we shall consider four very important terms used by Paul in Philippians: grace, salvation, the Spirit, and Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91019" data-verses="Philippians 1:7">1:7</span> Paul tells the Philippians, “Both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all partakers of my grace” (lit.). Notice that here Paul speaks of “my grace.” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91020" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">verse 19</span> he goes on to say, “For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.” In this verse Paul speaks of salvation and of the Spirit. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91021" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> he says, “Even now Christ shall be magnified in my body...For to me to live is Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3TUkitAtf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> In these verses grace, salvation, the Spirit, and Christ are not defined in a doctrinal way. Rather, they are related to experience. When Paul says “my grace,” he is referring to grace in his experience. Likewise, when he tells us that for him this will turn out to salvation, he is not speaking of a mere objective salvation, a doctrinal salvation, but of a very experiential salvation. Furthermore, when he mentions the Spirit, he is surely speaking of the Spirit in his experience. Certainly his word about magnifying Christ and living Him is very subjective and experiential. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91022" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> we do not have an objective Christ, but the subjective Christ in Paul’s living. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllBVXnRYs6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW">DIFFERENT KINDS OF SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jEVDBXYzba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv"> Unfortunately, many Christians have the habit of taking things for granted in their reading of the Bible. Familiar with such terms as grace, salvation, the Spirit, and Christ, <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> they may assume that they understand them. However, if they are asked to explain these things, they may have difficulty. For example, what does Paul mean by “my grace”? Furthermore, what does Paul mean by “my salvation” (KJV)? When Paul wrote this Epistle, he had been saved for many years and had even become an apostle. Why then does he indicate that he still needs salvation? Since we are already saved, why do we still need to be saved? What did Paul mean by saying that all that was happening to him, persecution, imprisonment, and even the dissenting preaching out of rivalry, would turn out for him to salvation? What kind of salvation is he talking about? </p>
<p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURBl2LhbMnHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> It would not at all be accurate to try to answer this question by asserting that salvation is not complete. Rather, we need to point out that, according to the Bible, there is more than one kind of salvation. God’s salvation rescues us from His condemnation. As sinners, we were condemned by the righteous God according to His righteous law. Thus, we were in need of salvation. Praise the Lord that we have been saved from God’s condemnation by the redemption of Christ! Furthermore, as sinners, we were under the usurping hand of Satan and under the power of death, destined for hell. Therefore, we needed a salvation that could save us from hell. However, in addition to being saved from God’s condemnation and from hell, we also need other kinds of salvation. For example, we need to be saved from our temper. Young and old alike need to be delivered from a bad temper. Furthermore, husbands and wives need to experience salvation in their married life. The wives need a certain kind of salvation, and the husbands need another kind of salvation, for both face different situations and problems. By these examples we can see that there is more than one kind of salvation presented in the Bible. When Paul wrote to the Philippians, he needed a certain kind of salvation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVw8OPnrvBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU">TWO ASPECTS OF THE SALVATION NEEDED BY PAUL</h2><p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3gBZ4bsKQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> The kind of salvation we need depends on our situation. If we are under God’s judgment, we need a salvation that <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> rescues us from this. If we are under Satan’s hand, we need a salvation appropriate to that situation. Likewise, if we are troubled by our temper or face difficulties in our married life, we need still further kinds of salvation. Because Paul was a prisoner, he needed a salvation that applied to his situation in prison. Paul, a Jew, was not a prisoner in an ordinary jail; he was a prisoner of Caesar’s royal guard, the praetorium. Paul’s case was extraordinary. He had not committed any crime. His imprisonment was due to the fact that he preached Christ. Because he preached Christ, Paul was arrested and eventually imprisoned. At least part of the time each day, he was chained to a guard. No doubt, Paul suffered there in prison. He must have been despised and treated with contempt. To be sure, he needed a specific kind of salvation. By this I do not mean that what he needed was release from prison. No, he needed to experience salvation there in prison. </p>
<p data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7C5kN4Nur0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt"> He says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91023" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span>, “According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.” Here we see that Paul’s expectation was that he would not be put to shame. Suppose Paul wept over his situation. Would not that have been a shame? His weeping would have indicated that he was defeated, that he had lost his faith, confidence, and trust in the Lord. Or suppose that Paul became angry with the jailer and argued with him. This also would have been a shame. However, if Paul could rejoice no matter how he was treated, that would be a glory. In order to maintain such a victorious standing as an apostle of Christ, Paul needed a particular kind of salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKJAJLFJim4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91024" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span> we see two aspects of the salvation needed by Paul. The first aspect was that Paul would not be put to shame in anything; the second, that Christ would be magnified in Paul’s body. Paul expected that his situation would turn out to his salvation so that in nothing he would be put to shame, but that Christ would be magnified in his body. Here Paul seems to be saying, “I need salvation so that I <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> shall not be put to shame by suffering or persecution. Instead, Christ my Lord will be magnified in my body.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAU4pvdX9IlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4">PAUL’S GRACE AND OURS</h2><p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY3Z_qSRYHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> Let us now consider the meaning of the words <em>my grace.</em> If we consider this expression in the context of the entire book of Philippians, we shall see that the grace which was Paul’s grace was nothing less than the Triune God whom Paul enjoyed and experienced and of whom Paul was a partaker. Thus, Paul’s grace was not God in an objective way; it was God subjectively and experientially, the Triune God processed to be his portion. Paul truly enjoyed and experienced the processed Triune God. He was rich in his experience of the Father, Son, and Spirit. This processed Triune God was Paul’s grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG7UEQaLixa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> We are familiar with the hymn “Amazing Grace.” Although this is a good hymn, it does not speak of the Triune God as our portion for our enjoyment. When this hymn was written, the experiential knowledge of God among the Lord’s people had not come to this point. Even as recent as fifty years ago, Christians did not have the understanding of grace as the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us. But standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us, we have come to know that grace is far more than merely unmerited favor. Grace is the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—processed for our experience and enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgw8mRJst6q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> Today our Triune God is no longer the unprocessed God, or the “raw” God. Rather, He has been processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Those with a background in systematic theology may be troubled by the expressions “processed God” and “raw God.” They may argue that in the Bible we cannot find such terms. Although these terms are not used, the facts are there. In like manner, we cannot find the terms “Trinity” and “Triune God” in the Bible. However, there is no doubt that the Bible reveals the fact that God is triune. Likewise, we cannot deny that the incarnation was a process. Furthermore, the crucifixion, which led to resurrection, and the resurrection, which led to <span class="pg" data-page-id="277" id="277">[277]</span> ascension, were also steps in God’s process. God has passed through a process not only to redeem us, but also to make it possible for us to enjoy Him as grace. Today the One we enjoy as our grace is the Triune God who has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. As such a One, He is ready for us to take and enjoy. </p>

In this message we shall go on to consider the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ for magnifying Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O1z55n4KLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> As we have pointed out, many Christians have the habit, perhaps unconsciously, of taking things for granted in reading the Bible. Because they are familiar with the words they read, they take them for granted and assume that they understand them. Not many have developed the habit of inquiring concerning the meaning of different words, terms, and phrases. For example, when we come across the expression <em>my grace,</em> we should inquire of the Lord concerning its meaning. In like manner, in reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91034" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> we should ask why Paul speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and not of the Holy Spirit nor of the Spirit of God. Why does Paul here speak of the bountiful supply of <em>the</em> Spirit? His use of the definite article here is emphatic. Christians often speak of the Holy Spirit or of the Spirit of God, but rarely of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. We should not take <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91035" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> for granted, but ask why Paul uses a particular term for the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyFXaC1L8z0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK"> Furthermore, in reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91036" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span> we should ask why Paul uses the word <em>magnify.</em> Why does he not say here, “Christ shall be expressed”? Why does he say magnified instead of manifested? We all need to build up the habit of asking such questions when we read the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NCra_igqpcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> If we develop this habit, in our reading of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91037" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">1:21</span> we shall ask why Paul says “to live is Christ.” Why does he not say to <span class="pg" data-page-id="284" id="284">[284]</span> behave is Christ, or to walk is Christ? Why does he use the word <em>live</em>? Instead of taking things for granted, we need to ask questions such as these. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV38LI3htRIiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG">A DAILY SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="-V7223f52MYBu9DyQ9J3bCV24Dm1Jm57fbHd_yZfKDZbKPYsFs3GvbJI_KQbDX4I8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91038" data-verses="Philippians 1:18-21">Philippians 1:18-21</span> is one long sentence. In this sentence the crucial points are in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91039" data-verses="Philippians 1:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span>, where Paul says that in nothing he would be put to shame, but that Christ would be magnified in his body. Paul knew that his situation would turn out to be for him a particular kind of salvation, a daily, personal, and instant salvation. Like Paul, we have received eternal salvation. But in addition to this salvation, we still need a daily salvation, a salvation we can experience moment by moment. For example, perhaps a minute ago a brother was very kind to his wife. But now he is just the opposite in the way he deals with her; we may even say that his behavior is devilish. From our experience we know that one moment we may be living the life of a true saint, and the next moment our behavior is like that of a devil. The reason for this is that we lose for a time this personal, daily salvation. However, we may quickly turn to the Lord and continue to experience His salvation moment by moment. </p>
<p data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPRrIxYJ_y3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy"> The salvation of which Paul speaks in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91040" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> is not eternal salvation; it is not salvation from God’s judgment or from hell. On the contrary, it is a daily, continual salvation, a salvation that can be applied at every instant. Experiencing such a salvation, Paul expected that no matter what the circumstances, environment, or suffering may be, he would not be put to shame. Instead, Christ would be magnified in him. </p>
<p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X8sfcHXKIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> Suppose in the meeting a brother prays in a very released way about living Christ and magnifying Him. However, if this brother, in the presence of guests invited for dinner, expresses unhappiness or anger toward his wife, he will be put to shame. Others will not see on his face the magnification of Christ. But suppose no matter what the situation is at home, the brother’s face is glowing with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="285" id="285">[285]</span> Lord. That would be glorious, a true instance of Christ being magnified in the brother. </p>
<p data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCX8n91wp16P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v"> Whenever we fail to live Christ and magnify Him, we are put to shame. Paul’s expectation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91041" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">Philippians 1</span> was that his circumstances would turn out for his salvation so that in nothing he would be put to shame, but that Christ would be magnified in him. This was Paul’s salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExXVQ-oYu6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> Paul, a typical Jew, was imprisoned by the Roman imperialists. At least part of the time each day, he was chained to a guard. Furthermore, due to imprisonment, he was kept from his work for the Lord. No doubt, in that kind of environment it would be very difficult for anyone to have a shining face. It would be very easy to show sadness or discouragement through his facial expression. If Paul had shown such signs of sadness, he would have been put to shame. But he expected that he would not be put to shame in anything. Instead, the more he was mistreated, the more his face would shine with the Lord. Far from being put to shame, Paul would magnify Christ in his body. This was the salvation he expected to experience in prison. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadP65_JP6oQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> A few times I have felt ashamed as a dinner guest in a brother’s home. Even at the table, the brother lost his temper toward his wife. When that happened, I felt ashamed. The brother was lacking in God’s instant salvation. Instead of salvation, there was shame. </p>
<p data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78Ru86vlm6XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5"> In such a case there is definitely a shortage of Christ. However, the shortage is actually the lack of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. If we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we shall experience instant and constant salvation. Then we shall not be put to shame in anything, but we shall magnify Christ in all things. </p>
<p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2Iw2ihS-QfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> To be put to shame is to be defeated. If Paul’s face expressed discouragement or sadness, that would have been a sign that he was defeated by the guards, persecution, mockery, and suffering. If that had been his condition, Paul would have been put to shame. But once again I wish to point out that Paul declared that his situation would turn <span class="pg" data-page-id="286" id="286">[286]</span> out for him to salvation. In nothing he would be put to shame, but Christ would be magnified in him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3TQkjZItf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_">THE SUPPLY OF THE BODY</h2><p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllBRXm1Us6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> In this message we come to the crucial point of how we can have this kind of salvation. Notice what Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91042" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">verse 19</span>: “For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.” Do not take this verse for granted. Rather, consider what is the significance of the expression <em>your petition.</em> Many readers may think that this refers only to the prayers of the saints who had a loving concern for Paul. It is correct to say that here Paul is referring to the prayers of the saints on his behalf. Paul’s word, however, implies much more than this. To understand the full significance of this phrase, we need to consider it in the light of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91043" data-verses="Philippians 1:7">verse 7</span>, where Paul tells the saints that in the defense and confirmation of the gospel they are partakers of his grace. If we join <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91044" data-verses="Philippians 1:7">verses 7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91045" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">19</span> we shall see that the phrase <em>your petition</em> indicates the supply of the Body. Apparently Paul was in prison; actually he was in the Body. Imprisonment did not isolate him from the Body or cut him off from the supply of the Body. Paul had the clear sense within that he was in the Body and that the members of the Body were supplying him, supporting him, and standing with him. </p>
<p data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jEVHBV8bba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv"> It is worthy of note that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91046" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> Paul speaks first of the saints’ petition, then of the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Why does he not mention the bountiful supply of the Spirit first? The reason Paul speaks of the supply of the Body before the bountiful supply of the Spirit is that the Spirit is upon the Body. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91047" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span> illustrates this: the ointment poured upon Aaron’s head flowed down to the body. This portrays the fact that the ointment, the bountiful supply of the compound Spirit, is upon the Body. Paul realized that he was not the whole Body, but just a member of the Body. As a member, he needed the Body’s supply. If the Body would be exercised to supply him, the bountiful supply of the Spirit would come to him through the Body. <span class="pg" data-page-id="287" id="287">[287]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGxIQpxVQkIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r"> During my early years as a Christian, no one told me what was the goal of being a Christian. Of course I was taught that we were saved in order to go to heaven. The impression I received was that the purpose of being a Christian was simply to go to heaven. Heaven supposedly is the destiny ordained by God for all who believe in Christ. However, I eventually came to see that the goal of being a Christian is to live Christ. Furthermore, the destiny God has ordained for us in His economy also is that we might live Christ. Christ is our way, our goal, our destiny, and our destination. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVw8WPmfHBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU">LIVE CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3gZZ5_AKQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> I do not believe that even as recently as 1970 Christians were familiar with the term “live Christ.” This expression was not known even among us in the Lord’s recovery. We had heard of living for Christ, living out Christ, and living by Christ, but not of living Christ. This is a new term. To live by Christ and for Christ and to live Christ out are all somewhat different from simply living Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7C58N6ZOr0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt"> We can be helped to know what it means to live Christ by reading the Gospel of John. This Gospel reveals that Christ, the Word, is God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91068" data-verses="John 1:1">1:1</span>). One day, the Word became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91069" data-verses="John 1:14">1:14</span>); that is, God was incarnated. Referring to the Word made flesh, John the Baptist declared, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91070" data-verses="John 1:29">1:29</span>). The third chapter of the Gospel of John speaks of regeneration. Here <span class="pg" data-page-id="296" id="296">[296]</span> we see that we must be born of God through the Spirit in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKJARLHNGm4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91071" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> the Lord Jesus said, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91072" data-verses="John 14:9">v. 9</span>). The Lord also went on to say, “I am in the Father and the Father is in Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91073" data-verses="John 14:11">v. 11</span>). The Lord Jesus was one with the Father. To see Him was to see the Father. In this chapter the Lord Jesus also spoke of the Spirit of reality, telling the disciples that the Spirit of reality abode with them and would be in them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91074" data-verses="John 14:17">v. 17</span>). The Lord Jesus indicated that when the Spirit of reality came, He Himself would come also. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91075" data-verses="John 14:19">Verse 19</span> says, “Because I live, you shall live also.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91076" data-verses="John 14:20">Verse 20</span> continues, “In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” Here we have our living together with Christ. We are in Christ, and Christ is in us. This means that we and He live together. He lives, and we live also. We live in Him, by Him, and with Him, and we even live Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s922ecQOZINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91077" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> the Lord gives the very impressive illustration of the vine and the branches. He says, “I am the vine, you are the branches” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91078" data-verses="John 15:5">v. 5</span>). The branches are the very living of the vine. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZ1bLJUZNlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt">RECEIVING THE HOLY BREATH</h2><p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82jdqm8UvQAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> After the Lord Jesus entered into resurrection, He came to His disciples. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91079" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>, “He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.” The Greek word for “Spirit,” <em>pneuma,</em> also means “breath.” This indicates that the Lord Jesus was telling the disciples to receive the holy breath. The Gospel of John begins with the Word and goes on to speak of the Lamb and the vine. Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91080" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span> we see that the very One who is the Word, God, the Lamb, and the vine is also the breath for us to receive. On the one hand, He breathed out; on the other hand, the disciples breathed in. </p>
<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT80eQn-k-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91081" data-verses="John 20:22">20:22</span> the Lord Jesus told the disciples to receive the holy breath, the Holy Spirit. We should not analyze the breath, but receive it by breathing it into us. Unfortunately, many of today’s Christians know only to reason and <span class="pg" data-page-id="297" id="297">[297]</span> consider; they do not have any experience of breathing the holy breath. A. B. Simpson was one who knew the experience of breathing in of Christ. The opening lines of one of his hymns read: “O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me, Teach me how to breathe Thee in” (<em>Hymns,</em> #255). </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX7cS_fTrnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> In the Gospel of John we have a record of the divine process. The Word, who was God, became flesh. Eventually, having passed through crucifixion and resurrection, He became the holy breath for us to breathe in. </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO40rJLy456Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> If we see the steps of this process, we shall have a proper and thorough understanding of the Gospel of John. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91082" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91083" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>, the Word, who was in the beginning with God and who is God, became flesh. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91084" data-verses="John 1:29">verse 29</span> we see that this Word become flesh is the Lamb of God. On the one hand, He is the Lamb for accomplishing redemption; on the other hand, He is the tree for imparting life. Therefore, we may speak of Him as the Lamb-tree. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91085" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>, the branches of the vine are the living of the vine. Ultimately, the Lamb-tree becomes the holy breath. Hallelujah! In our experience we have Christ as the Word, the Lamb, the tree, and the breath. The Word is for expression, the Lamb is for redemption, the tree is for the impartation of life, and the breath is for our living. </p>
<p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSED0ImpR8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> We cannot live without breathing. Instead of saying that a certain person has died, the Chinese say that he has stopped breathing. No doubt, to stop breathing is to die. However, to keep on breathing is to live. No matter how many schools we may graduate from, we can never graduate from breathing. No one can say that because he has become so knowledgeable or mature, it is no longer necessary for him to breathe. Rather, the older a person becomes, the more concerned he may be about his breathing. How marvelous that for our spiritual life we have the holy breath for our living! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfynNhPBGb9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI">A LIFE OF COINHERENCE</h2><p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuOp2ojxJpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> The Gospel of John reveals that, as those who believe in Christ, we need to live Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91086" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span> says, “As the living <span class="pg" data-page-id="298" id="298">[298]</span> Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me.” Just as the Lord Jesus lived because of the Father, we should live because of Him. As we have pointed out, the Lord Jesus, referring to the day of His resurrection, said, “In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91087" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span>). He also said that because He lives, we shall live also (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91088" data-verses="John 14:19">v. 19</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91089" data-verses="John 14:19-20">John 14:19 and 20</span>, we live in Christ in the way of coinherence. He lives in the Father, we live in Him, and He lives in us. We not only coexist with Christ—we coinhere with Him. This means that He lives in us and we live in Him. How wonderful is this life of coinherence! </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceQDfSSPCcDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> We have a life of coinherence with Christ because He is not only the Word, the Lamb, and the tree, but also the breath, the Spirit. If He were only the Word, the Lamb, and the tree, we could not live in Him, and He could not live in us. Praise Him that today He is not merely the Word, the Lamb, and the tree, but also the <em>pneuma,</em> the breath, the Spirit! </p>

What does it mean to pray unceasingly? Although we may eat several meals a day and although we may drink many times during the day, no one can eat and drink without ceasing. But we certainly breathe unceasingly. Paul’s command to pray without ceasing implies that unceasing prayer is like breathing. But how can our prayer become our spiritual breathing? How can we turn prayer into breathing? The way to do this is to call on the name of the Lord. We need to call on the Lord Jesus continually. This is the way to breathe, to pray without ceasing. Because we are not accustomed to this, we need to practice calling on the Lord’s name all the time. To live is to breathe. Spiritually speaking, to breathe is to call on the Lord’s name and to pray. By calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, we breathe the Spirit. </p>

<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllZ1fLIQ1NlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91112" data-verses="Philippians 1:19-21">1:19-21a</span> we have salvation, the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the magnifying of Christ, and the living of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91113" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">2:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91114" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">13a</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91115" data-verses="Philippians 2:16">16a</span> we have the matters of working out our own salvation, of God operating in us, and of holding forth the word of life. In these two portions of Philippians we have two lines: the first line is salvation, the Spirit, and Christ; the second line is salvation, God, and the word. This comparison is quite revealing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82jdum9gPQAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8">EXPERIENCING SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT80aQmaA-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91116" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> Paul says that his situation, environment, and surroundings will turn out to him for salvation. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91117" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">2:12</span> he charges us to work out our own salvation. According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91118" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span>, the difficult situations we face can turn out to our salvation. Whether or not our circumstances turn out for us to salvation depends on whether or not we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. If we do not enjoy this bountiful supply, our circumstances will turn out to be for shame. Every situation we face will turn out either for salvation or shame. Suppose, for example, a brother’s wife gives him a difficult time. For the brother this situation can be either a salvation or a shame. It all depends on whether or not he enjoys the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. If he enjoys the supply of the Spirit, he will experience an instant salvation, and Christ will be magnified in him. If he does not enjoy the supply, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="304" id="304">[304]</span> becomes angry with his wife, he will be put to shame. I repeat, if the brother’s situation with his wife turns out to be for his salvation, Christ will be magnified. In a very real sense, the salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91119" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> is Christ magnified. </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX7cW_dHTnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91120" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">2:12</span> Paul again speaks of salvation. This time, however, he does not speak of his salvation, but charges the saints to work out their own salvation. Concerning himself, Paul says that his circumstances will turn out for salvation. But concerning the saints, he tells them that they must work out their own salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO40rNLw8F6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> For the problems we face day by day, especially in our family life and in the church life, we need God’s salvation. We need different kinds of salvation for different kinds of problems. A brother needs one kind of salvation in his dealings with all the different saints. But he needs another kind of salvation in his relationship with his wife. According to God’s ordination, it is not good for a man to be alone. Every brother should have a wife. However, in married life problems are unavoidable. For all these problems we need God’s salvation. God ordained marriage so that we might have the opportunity to enjoy Him. If we enjoy the Lord, we shall experience His salvation in our married life. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX3TIkjZotf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> God’s salvation as revealed in the Bible is of many categories. Day by day and even moment by moment we may experience different aspects of God’s salvation. Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and even moment by moment we need to experience salvation. I simply cannot live without God’s salvation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAllBJXm10s6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW">SAVED FROM MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS</h2><p data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jEVfBVMTba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv"> When Paul tells us to work out our own salvation, he is not speaking of salvation from hell nor salvation from God’s condemnation. We are not able to work out that kind of salvation. Notice that Paul tells the saints to “work out <em>your own</em> salvation.” A husband should not pay attention to the salvation needed by his wife. Instead, he should concentrate on working out his salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURBlqLjfonHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> Paul’s word about working out our own salvation should <span class="pg" data-page-id="305" id="305">[305]</span> be considered in relation to his charge concerning murmurings and reasonings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91121" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">verse 14</span>. In this verse he says, “Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.” As we have pointed out previously, murmurings are related to the emotions, and reasonings, to the mind. Furthermore, sisters in particular have a problem with murmurings, whereas brothers are troubled by reasonings. I have never heard of a wife who did not murmur. A sister needs to work out her own salvation with respect to her murmurings. She needs salvation from murmuring. Likewise, the brothers need to work out their own salvation with respect to reasonings. If our married life and church life are filled with murmurings and reasonings, this is proof that we are lacking God’s salvation. Our family life and our church life should be full of salvation and without any murmurings and reasonings. How marvelous it would be if in the church in our locality there were no murmurings or reasonings, but an abundance of salvation! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LIvlyB0sqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH">GOD’S OPERATION AND OUR COOPERATION</h2><p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFq7DPxvtd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> On the one hand, we work out our own salvation; on the other hand, God operates in us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91122" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">verse 13</span> Paul exclaims, “For it is God who operates in you.” God operates in us, and we cooperate with Him. This means that we work out our salvation according to God’s operation. At the very time a sister is murmuring or a brother is reasoning, God operates to enable them to work out their salvation from murmurings and reasonings. When we turn to the Lord and say, “O Lord Jesus, I love You,” we are saved from murmurings and reasonings. </p>
<p data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG9snElHteYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb"> The Greek word rendered “operates” can also be translated “energizes.” God is energizing us from within. Because it is not easy for us to experience God’s salvation in many situations, He energizes us. For example, a brother may be very strong in his reasonings. If this brother is to work out his own salvation from reasonings, he needs God to energize him. </p>
<p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cIguvaxlhRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> In creating the heavens and the earth God simply had to speak. But to rescue us from murmurings and reasonings, it <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> is necessary for Him to energize us. This indicates that it is more difficult for Him to save us from murmurings and reasonings than it was for Him to create the earth. When God wanted to create something, He simply spoke, and that thing came into being. However, if He tells us not to murmur or reason, we may not pay attention. Thus, there is a wrestling inwardly between us and God. Have you not wrestled with God many times? This wrestling is a proof that it is difficult for God to rescue us. In order to rescue us without damaging us, He energizes within us. The Christian life is a wrestling life, a life of wrestling with the God who operates in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nffylx6W8ZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> The very God who operates in us is the supplying Spirit. Again and again we have pointed out that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91123" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> Paul says that his circumstances will turn out to his salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit. If God does not operate in us, it will not be possible for us to experience the supply from the Spirit. God operates in us in order to bring to us the bountiful supply of the Spirit. This is not mere doctrine; it is a fact of spiritual experience. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvdcIwEzy7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn">CHRIST MAGNIFIED</h2><p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O1zh5m8iLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> Through the bountiful supply of the Spirit, Christ is magnified in us. What Paul speaks of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91124" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">1:20</span> is the magnification of Christ, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91125" data-verses="Philippians 2:16">2:16</span> he speaks of holding forth the word of life. Holding forth the word of life is equal to magnifying Christ. Christ Himself is the word of life. We hold forth the word of life, and this word is Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyFXCC0fQz0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK">THE SPIRIT, GOD, CHRIST, AND THE WORD</h2><p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NCrC_gEKpcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> I am very fond of these two portions of Philippians. On the one hand, we see from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91126" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapter one</span> that it is possible for our environment to turn out to our salvation. On the other hand, we see from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91127" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span> that we need to work out our salvation by cooperating with God’s energizing. However, according to our fallen disposition, our tendency is to go contrary to God’s desire. We need God to operate in us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="307" id="307">[307]</span> Then if we cooperate with Him, we shall work out our instant salvation and hold forth the word of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV38LQ3jZ1IiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> We need to be impressed with the fact that the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91128" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> equals God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91129" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">2:13</span>, and that Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91130" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">1:20 and 21</span> equals the word of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91131" data-verses="Philippians 2:16">2:16</span>.

<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwFfooa-IyG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> The basic thought of the Bible is that the Triune God desires to work Himself into man so that man may take Him as life and live Him. In order to fulfill this desire, the Triune God has passed through a wonderful process. Both the incarnation and the crucifixion were steps in this process. Through His death on the cross, Christ dealt with sin, sins, and Satan. He also released the divine life. Christ’s all-inclusive death was followed by His resurrection. By incarnation, Christ became a man; through crucifixion He dealt with all negative things; and in resurrection He imparted Himself into all those who believe in Him so that they might become one with Him in life and in nature. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOxzAFkTOf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP">MAN CREATED IN GOD’S IMAGE</h2><p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrPKDLs7uSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> By creation man is God’s creature. As a creature of God, man does not have the divine life or the divine nature. However, man was created in God’s image and after His likeness. God created us in this way because His intention is to come into man and be one with man. For this reason, God created man in such a way that man could receive Him and become one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNzXQYB2NP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> The relationship between God and the man created in God’s image may be illustrated by a glove designed to contain a hand. The glove is made in the image of the hand for the purpose of containing the hand. When a hand enters into a glove, the hand and the glove become one. In a similar way, man is a vessel created in the image of God for the purpose <span class="pg" data-page-id="314" id="314">[314]</span> of containing God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91151" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span> indicates that we are vessels created to contain God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWbMPgnNKV307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-">ONE WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuOp-ojxppnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> On man’s side, man was created as a vessel to contain God. On God’s side, a certain process was necessary. After passing through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God was ready to come into man. After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus charged His followers to disciple the nations and baptize the believers into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91152" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>). To baptize believers into the name of the Triune God is to immerse them into the very Person of the Triune God. The name denotes the person; and the person is the reality of the name. In his Epistles Paul speaks of being baptized into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91153" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Rom. 6:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91154" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>). To baptize believers into Christ is the same as baptizing them into the Person of the Triune God. Those who believe in Christ and are baptized into Him become one with the Triune God in life and in nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceQDXSSPicDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> We praise the Lord that, as believers, we have the divine life and partake of the divine nature. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91155" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">Second Peter 1:4</span> indicates clearly that we are partakers of the divine nature. Because we partake of the divine nature, it can rightly be said that we are divine. However, this definitely does not mean that we are evolving into God or that we shall ever become God as an object of worship. The Bible does not teach that believers will ever be deified. But, according to the Word of God, we who believe in Christ have truly been born of God. Thus, we are genuine sons born of Him, not adopted sons. Because we are sons of God, we have the life and nature of God. By having the divine life and nature, we are one with God. But we repeat that this certainly does not mean that we shall ever become God Himself as an object of worship. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexK87NULozqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> According to the Bible we teach that we are one with God because, through regeneration, we have the life and nature of God. Just as a child has the life and nature of his father, <span class="pg" data-page-id="315" id="315">[315]</span> so we, as sons of God, have the life and nature of God. But some Christians are humble in a religious way, and, although they confess that they have been born of God, they dare not say that they have God’s nature. They will say only that they are sinners who have received God’s mercy. They are reluctant to confess that they have God’s nature and are one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwFfoob6syG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> Regeneration does not make us part of the Godhead. To say that believers become part of the Godhead as objects of worship is to blaspheme God. We cannot share the Godhead. But we can partake of the divine nature. To share in the Godhead is one thing; to partake of the divine nature is another. What a great blessing it is to be one with God in His life and nature! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOxzAFln2f9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP">PREOCCUPIED BY OUR CONCEPTS</h2><p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrPKDLtfSSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> Although this matter is so crucial in the Bible, many Christians today do not pay attention to it because they are preoccupied by ethical, cultural, religious, and philosophical concepts. When they come to the Bible, they are impressed with admonitions such as the command for children to honor their parents, for husbands to love their wives, and for wives to submit to their husbands. Some Christian husbands appreciate the Bible because it teaches a wife to submit to her husband. Likewise, Christian wives may appreciate the Bible because it requires a husband to love his wife. Those who are occupied with ethics and religion will pay attention to those matters in the Bible which they regard as ethical or religious. However, they do not see the basic revelation in the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNzXQYDi9P4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> Suppose that a Chinese hears the preaching of the gospel and believes in Christ. In his reading of the Bible, he may pay special attention to those portions of the Word which seem to be concerned with ethics. He may have very little understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91156" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>, a verse which says that God created man in His own image, but he may devour the book of Proverbs, appreciating all its ethical teachings. Likewise, he may appreciate Paul’s words concerning the behavior of <span class="pg" data-page-id="316" id="316">[316]</span> husbands and wives, for these sound much like the teachings of Confucius. He may praise the Lord’s salvation because it helps him to be ethical and moral. We may say that in his daily life he is a “Confucius Christian,” a believer who regards the teachings of the Bible as if they were the same as the ethical teachings of Confucius. </p>
<p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWbMPglJ-V307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> A believer with a different cultural background may appreciate the Bible because it teaches us not to make a display of ourselves. He may pay attention to those matters in the Word which seem to be in line with his national characteristics and cultural background. Thus, living Christ is replaced by ethics and culture. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nHBw_AdnQIfkqKVM8Tgl0tVT-YkB7CZ7TRLJRhNrPdZcnD6qmiGxxSQio_uvcr2U-">NOURISHMENT AND REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wEqf0prMWrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J"> When we come to the Bible, we should forget about ethics, culture, and different kinds of national characteristics. With an unveiled face and an inner being that is not preoccupied with anything, we should pray-read the Word. In doing this, we shall receive not only revelation, but also nourishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-jvN0r7MqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91157" data-verses="1Timothy 4:6">1 Timothy 4:6</span> Paul speaks of nourishment: “Being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have closely followed.” Nourishment is related to life. All the words in the Bible are words of life, words that are nourishing and healthy. Paul even uses the expression “healthy teaching” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91158" data-verses="1Timothy 1:10">1 Tim. 1:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91159" data-verses="Titus 1:9">Titus 1:9</span>), referring to teaching that nourishes us and makes us healthy. It is important that we all receive nourishment from the Word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRNxCflYlMnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY"> If we would be nourished by the Word, we must be free from all preoccupying concepts. We need to lay aside the veils of culture, domestic logic, and national philosophy. We need to read the Word of God without wearing any kind of colored glasses, that is, without any preoccupying concepts. Then we shall receive both nourishment and revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvlnUg_MUXkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> Often after people are saved, they make up their minds to improve themselves. They may say, “I used to be godless and evil. I mistreated my parents, my brothers and sisters, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="317" id="317">[317]</span> my children. From now on I will pray that almighty God will help me to be kind to everyone. I make up my mind never to lose my temper again. Instead, I shall be loving.” I believe that virtually every Christian has made a decision like this. However, for believers to make such decisions is not the right way. From experience I have learned that there is no need for us to make up our minds to be good, or to pray that God will help us to improve. What we need is to come to the living Word and receive nourishment. </p>

Our concept is that after we are saved we should make up our minds to improve our behavior. Probably every genuine Christian has made such a decision. According to our concept, we need to improve ourselves. Conscious of our weakness, we beg God to help us. However, God does not answer this kind of prayer. The more we pray that He will help us to improve, the less He will do. On the contrary, our behavior may even worsen. The reason for this is that the concept of receiving help from God to improve our behavior is contrary to God’s economy. God’s economy is to dispense Himself into us and to work Himself into us that we may take Him as our life and life supply in order to live Him. This is not to have an improved human character; it is to live God. According to His economy, God’s intention is to impart His element, His substance, and the ingredients of His nature into our being that we may live Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfpjYS-8_2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> Christians have fallen into the trap of trying to improve their character. We thank the Lord that in His recovery we are being rescued from this trap. Many years ago it was my habit to pray that the Lord would help me to improve my behavior. I wanted to be a very refined human being. Especially, I wanted to have more love for my wife. Realizing my inability, I asked the Lord to help me. Now instead of <span class="pg" data-page-id="324" id="324">[324]</span> praying in this way, I enjoy God’s economy. I see that His intention is to dispense, or transfuse, Himself into me that I may live Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUkRbWoNv3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3">NOT OUTWARD CORRECTION<br/>BUT INWARD TRANSFUSION</h2><p data-content-id="F0dlBCvTMMHz8TZjDG814kTWLwdsrEypp97z5APngXAwWFiOr0CkhKKWbXwwhx9XD"> We may use other terms to describe God’s desire to dispense Himself into us. God wants to water us, feed us, refresh us, and nourish us. These terms indicate that God wants to be our life, life supply, food, drink, and air. He is our food to nourish us; our drink to quench our thirst; our air to refresh us; and our life supply to enrich us. As the divine Being, He infuses us with His elements, causing us to be the same as He in life and nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nffytx6WcZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> In His economy God does not improve us outwardly. Instead, He transmits all that He is into us. The difference between outward correction and inward transfusion can be illustrated by the difference between applying makeup and having a healthy complexion because of eating properly. Man’s way is to apply makeup. God’s way is to transform us metabolically; it is to nourish, refresh, water, enrich, and strengthen us. This is God’s economy. God is rich in His nourishing, watering, feeding, refreshing, and shining. Oh, His shining brings in His riches! The air, water, and food also supply His riches to us. In the Bible God likens Himself to food, water, air, and sunshine. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91171" data-verses="Psalms 84:11">Psalm 84:11</span> says that the Lord is our sun. God does not merely teach us; He nourishes us, waters us, and infuses all His riches into our inner being. This is God’s way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvdcAwEzS7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn">CONSTITUTED OF WHAT WE EAT</h2><p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O1zp5mMqLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> God’s purpose in transmitting His riches into us is that we may live Him. Dietitians tell us that we are what we eat. If we eat a great deal of a certain kind of food, we shall be constituted of that food. When I was young, I noticed that everyone who lived in the home of my grandparents smelled like fish. My mother explained to me that the people in that area eat fish three times a day. Because they ate so much <span class="pg" data-page-id="325" id="325">[325]</span> fish, they became constituted of fish. This illustrates the fact that we are what we eat. If we eat Christ, we shall be constituted of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyFXKC0vYz0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK"> God’s economy is that we eat Christ and become constituted of Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91172" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> the Lord Jesus says that He is the bread of life, the bread which came down from heaven, and that those who eat Him will live because of Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91173" data-verses="John 6:35">vv. 35</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91174" data-verses="John 6:41">41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91175" data-verses="John 6:57">57</span>). Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91176" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span> He sounds the call: “If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91177" data-verses="John 7:37">v. 37</span>). This the Lord Jesus said concerning the Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91178" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> the call is sounded once again to come and drink. The Lord calls us to drink of the Spirit, of the processed Triune God. Having passed through the steps of a divine process, the Triune God is now a universal, all-inclusive drink, prepared and available. </p>
<p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NCrK_g0SpcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> Every meeting of the church should be a feast. The Lord calls us to partake of Him as our food and drink. Whether or not a particular meeting is of the Lord can be determined by whether or not there is a “dining table” in that meeting. If you go to a Catholic cathedral, you will find superstition instead of feasting. The church meetings, by contrast, are a feast. In every meeting there is a dining table set for us, and we have the opportunity to eat and drink of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV38LY3jptIiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> By now it should be clear that what we need is not outward improvement or correction. Our need is to take in the Triune God by eating and drinking of Him. According to God’s ordination, the way to partake of Him is to eat Him and drink Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHUpNN6MvkJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ">THE WORD OF CHRIST DWELLING IN US RICHLY</h2><p data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld3toel1q_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5"> Now we come to the crucial matter of where to find the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive drink. It is true to say that He is in heaven. It is also true that He is in us. But although the Triune God indwells us as the all-inclusive Spirit, He may not dwell in us richly. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91179" data-verses="Colossians 3:16">Colossians 3:16</span> Paul says, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts <span class="pg" data-page-id="326" id="326">[326]</span> to God.” What does it mean to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly? Years ago I thought that this meant that we should memorize Bible verses and be able to recite them. According to my concept at the time, to let the word of Christ dwell in me richly was to memorize more and more verses. However, this is not the meaning of Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91180" data-verses="Colossians 3:16">Colossians 3:16</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMgxuJHFRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> For the word of Christ to dwell in us richly means that it inhabits us, indwells us, in a rich way. This can be illustrated by eating. After we eat a meal, the food inhabits us in a rich way. The food contains many rich, nourishing elements. When we take this nourishing food into us and assimilate it, it indwells us richly. In like manner, for the word of Christ to dwell in us richly means that it inhabits us in the way of nourishment and enrichment. This is not a matter of memorizing verses, but a matter of having the Word containing the unsearchable riches of Christ dwell in us in such a way that it nourishes us and enriches us. </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP-JEQ5Vv3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> I have met some people who had memorized the whole book of Ephesians and even one who had memorized the Gospel of Matthew. But to memorize entire books of the New Testament does not mean that the word of Christ is dwelling in us richly. For example, we may take food into us, but our stomach may not digest it properly. Indigestion indicates that the food does not enter into us richly. The food may be rich in nourishment, but its entering into us is not rich if we suffer from indigestion after eating it. In such a case we do not have the ability to absorb the riches of the food. But if we have a proper metabolism and digest the food we eat, the elements of the food will enter into us richly. We need the word of Christ to dwell in us in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8JleabV0jEB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> It is possible for the same verse of the Bible to enter into us either in a rich way or in a poor way. At one time you may not be able to digest and assimilate a particular verse. But at another time the Word may be rich in its entering into you and dwell in you richly. We all need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. <span class="pg" data-page-id="327" id="327">[327]</span> </p>

From the book of Colossians we have seen that Christ is not only all-inclusive, but also extensive. He is both the mystery of God and the mystery of God’s economy. Christ is God, man, and the reality of every positive thing in the universe. This, of course, is not pantheism. It is to testify according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91190" data-verses="Colossians 2:16-17">Colossians 2:16 and 17</span> that Christ is the body, the reality, of all positive things. </p>

As our holiday, Christ is our rest, joy, and enjoyment. With Christ every day is a holiday. Without Him, every day is miserable. Even during difficult times, we may experience <span class="pg" data-page-id="332" id="332">[332]</span> a true holiday if we have Christ as our joy, enjoyment, and rest. </p>

He is God incarnate, and He lived on earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years. Then He died on the cross, shedding His blood to cleanse us from our sins. Now He is our Savior in resurrection. Although we emphatically believe that Christ is our Redeemer and Savior and have experienced Him as such, we have come to realize that Christ is also our life. On the one hand, as life He has been supplied once for all; on the other hand, He is supplied to us continually as life. Life requires a continual supply. If we have life but lack the means to maintain it, we shall die. Breathing, for example, is a necessary matter of life. As such, it must go on continually. Although we may graduate from school, we cannot graduate from breathing and remain alive. Graduation from the matters of life can only mean death. We praise the Lord that Christ is our Redeemer, Savior, and also our life and life supply! </p>

We have the right to declare, “Hallelujah, we are sons of the almighty God!” </p>
<p data-content-id="mIS7O7a-NT_KDOKl-0XRFQVGIihnbbtK_H0Cio96dDINunJF9QeGmdjRtCHl84RqP"> As sons of God, we should live Christ, not ethics, morality, or behavior. Ethics may be very good and a high standard of morality is no doubt excellent, but there is no comparison between these things and Christ. The standard of the Christian life is Christ Himself; it is not ethics, morality, or high character. In the book of Philippians Paul wants to impress us with the matter of living Christ. Paul could say, “To me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91193" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">1:21</span>). It was his expectation that whether by life or by death, Christ would be magnified in him. What a standard! The standard of the Christian life far exceeds that of ethics, morality, or any kind of philosophy. To repeat, the standard of the Christian life is Christ, and we must live Him and magnify Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfpjkS_YL2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> Christ was Paul’s goal, and his desire was to be found in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91194" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">Phil. 3:9</span>). It should also be our desire to be found by others in Christ. Wherever we may be, we should be found in Christ. What a shame to be found in our natural life or in our culture! But how good it is if others could testify of finding us in Christ! Our goal is Christ, and our standard also is Christ. Wherever we are, the people we meet should be impressed with Christ. Then, because we live Christ, we shall be found by others in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUkRnWqZn3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3"> If we live a certain thing, we shall no doubt be found in that thing. For example, if we live our culture, others will find us in culture. Likewise, if we live Christ all the time, we shall always be found in Christ.

Instead of living in a <span class="pg" data-page-id="334" id="334">[334]</span> natural way as a young person, middle-aged person, or elderly person, we should live Christ. Oh, it is a great matter to live Christ and to be found in Him! </p>
<p data-content-id="F0dlBCvTMMHz8TZjDG814kTWLwdQrG2lp97z5APngXAwWFiOr0CkhKKWbXwwhx9XD"> Living Christ is abstract and mysterious. To live Christ is to live in a mysterious way. On the one hand, this kind of living is real and substantial; on the other hand, it is indefinable. When others find us in Christ, it will be difficult for them to describe us. We shall seem to be quite mysterious. Although as human beings we are not very different from others, there is something mysterious and even special about us. Christ is mysterious, and those who live Him also are mysterious. Because Christ is abstract and mysterious, it is not easy to explain how to live Him. </p>

To baptize the believers into the Triune God is to place them into an organic union with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="PlrvbBpD2zxx_8-X698IQTc85TXaKg-vF52HYJhkJHFcO4Qc_4xEevBqOsx5k1dpA"> Before we were saved, the Triune God was altogether objective to us. But through redemption, salvation, justification, and regeneration, He has become subjective. Now we are in Him, and He is in us. The Triune God is in us to be not only our Redeemer and Savior, but also our life and life supply. God’s desire is not that we do certain things for Him, but that we be one spirit with Him and live Him. To live the Triune God is to live Christ. It is to magnify Christ, to glorify Him, and to express Him. It is to magnify Christ in the eyes of the people with whom we are in contact. The focal point of the Bible is related to living Christ. </p>

In our experience, Christ should be very subjective to us. For instance, the Lord Jesus says, “Abide in Me and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91220" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span>). This expression is simple, but the meaning is profound. How can we abide in another person and have that person abide in us? With human beings it is impossible for people to abide in one another. But it is possible for the human life to abide in the divine life, and the divine life to abide in the human life. This means that God can abide in us, and we can abide in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvdc4wG3-7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> Some may wonder how we, little human beings, can abide in God, and how the great, almighty God can abide in us. Recently, some tried to tell us that because God is unlimited in His greatness and man is so small, it is impossible for <span class="pg" data-page-id="344" id="344">[344]</span> Him to abide in us. They asked how such a small container could hold such a vast content. Their word indicates that they do not believe what was spoken by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91221" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>. They charge us with heresy and claim that, on the one hand, we reduce God to our scale and that, on the other hand, we teach evolution into God and believe that human beings can actually become God Himself. When we asked them the meaning of the Lord’s word, “Abide in Me and I in you,” they answered that this refers merely to intimate relationship or fellowship. Their reply shows that, according to the natural human mentality, it is impossible to believe that we can actually abide in Christ and have Him abide in us. Nevertheless, we must believe the Lord’s word, “Abide in Me and I in you,” and say “amen” to it. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGMgJuJHlRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91222" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> Paul says, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” To say that Christ lives in us is even stronger than to say that He abides in us. When I visit another locality, I may abide in a brother’s home. However, I cannot say that I live there. I only abide there temporarily with certain limitations. But when I return to my home, I can live there. To live in a certain place is to have full liberty. Do you abide in your home or do you live there? Of course you would answer that you live at home. But you would not say that you live in a motel. To say that Christ lives in us means that He has the full liberty to speak, act, and behave. He is able to do in us whatever He desires, for He has redeemed us and made us His dwelling place. </p>

First Christ abides in us, then He lives in us, and then He settles down in us, making His home in our whole inner being. On the one hand, Christ may live in our spirit. But on the other hand, we may not give Him much room to live in our mind, will, or <span class="pg" data-page-id="345" id="345">[345]</span> emotion. From experience we know that sometimes we restrict Christ to our spirit. When He tries to spread from our spirit into our emotion, we may not allow Him to do so. For example, in the morning a brother may pray to the Lord, enjoy Him, and declare, “Hallelujah, the Lord Jesus is living in my spirit!” But, later that day he is tempted to do a certain thing. Even though the Lord who lives in his spirit does not agree, the brother, living according to his emotion, insists on doing that thing. He reasons with the Lord, trying to persuade Him to stay in his spirit and give him the freedom to live according to his emotion. He even promises that the next day he will give the Lord the freedom to spread into his emotion. But when the next day comes, he does not keep his promise. Thus, the Lord is not given the liberty to settle down in this brother’s emotion. </p>
<p data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGxIkpwR0kIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r"> Because we do not easily give the Lord the opportunity to make His home in our hearts, it was necessary for Paul to pray that the Father would strengthen us in our inner man through the Spirit that Christ may make His home in our hearts. According to the Bible, the heart is composed of the mind, will, emotion, and conscience. The heart surrounds the spirit and is larger than the spirit. When we received the Lord Jesus, He came into our spirit, and now He lives here. At first, we might not even have given the Lord the freedom to live in our spirit. We simply allowed Him to abide there. Gradually, however, we gave Him opportunity to live in our spirit. But still we were not willing to give Him full access to our inner being. This is why we need our inner man, our regenerated spirit, to be strengthened. Then Christ will be able to make His home in our hearts. He will not only abide in us and live in us, but spread into every part of our inner being and settle down there. </p>

<p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz3gtZ4b8KQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> It is important for us to see that Christ should be subjective to us in our experience. He abides in us, He lives in us, and He desires to make His home, to settle Himself, throughout our inner being. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKJAlLFJym4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO">CONSTITUTED OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAU4FvdXNIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> As Christians, we differ in the measure of Christ we have within us. Some have given more ground to Christ; others have given Him less room to grow in them. No doubt Paul’s measure of Christ was full. This means that Christ had been fully formed in him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91225" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Philippians 1:21</span> Paul could even declare, “To me to live is Christ.” Christ had been wrought into Paul and had actually become his constituent. Therefore, Paul was a man completely constituted of Christ. This was the reason he could say that to him to live was Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY3ZTqSRoHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> Dietitians often tell us that we are what we eat. The food we eat eventually becomes our constitution. It is wrought into our fibers and even our cells. If a person eats a great deal of a certain food, he will eventually become constituted of that food. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG7UoQa76xa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> By the time Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he had been a believer in Christ for nearly thirty years. Throughout those years, Christ had been more and more wrought into Paul’s inner being. Paul was continually eating Christ, partaking of Him. Eventually, having been constituted of Christ, he became a Christ-man. As one who was constituted of Christ, he could testify, “To me to live is Christ.” </p>
<p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgw8KRJc16q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> We today should be the continuation of Paul’s testimony. We are here to live Christ, to have Christ wrought into us until our mind, emotion, and will are constituted of Him. </p>

This implies that the word of Christ is living. In order for something to dwell in us or to inhabit us, it must be living. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP_5YQ4xj3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z">A LIVING PERSON</h2><p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8JkuGbXQLEB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> Paul’s expression in this verse indicates that the word of Christ is very much like a living person. Paul almost personifies the word of Christ; he tells us to let this word inhabit us, as if it were a living person. The word of Christ is actually the living Person of Christ. Moreover, according to the New Testament, the living Person of Christ is the Spirit. Jesus is the name of this Person, and the reality of this Person is the Spirit. For this reason, whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, it is the Spirit who comes. We have also pointed out that the Word and the Spirit are one. Hence, when the word of Christ dwells in us, the Spirit inhabits us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="354" id="354">[354]</span> </p>

If we would understand the meaning of this expression, we must differentiate between wisdom and knowledge. Knowledge is related primarily to the function of the mind, whereas wisdom is related to the function of our spirit. This means that if the word of Christ is to dwell in us in all wisdom, we need to exercise our spirit. If we use our mind to memorize the Word, the Word will then dwell in us in knowledge. Memorizing Bible verses is a function of the mind related to knowledge, not a function of the spirit related to wisdom. For the Word to dwell in us in all wisdom refers to its indwelling every way possible through the exercise of the spirit. Wisdom is deeper, finer, and more profound than knowledge. It comes from the exercise of the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="F0dlBCvTMMHz8TZjDG814kTWLxtwrG2Fp97z5APngXAwWFiOr0CkhKKWbXwwhx9XD"> The difference between knowledge and wisdom can be illustrated in married life. Suppose a brother’s wife is murmuring and even rebukes him. If he fights back by reasoning with her, he will exercise his mind with its knowledge. In this, there is no wisdom. But suppose while his wife is murmuring, he calls on the name of the Lord Jesus and prays. This is wisdom. To reason is related to knowledge, but to pray is related to wisdom. Pray-reading and singing may also be related to wisdom. The brother may also show wisdom by exercising his spirit to share a helpful testimony he heard recently in a church meeting. The point here is that knowledge involves the exercise of the mind, but wisdom involves the exercise of the spirit by such means as praying, pray-reading, singing, and testifying. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAN6o0k4ZK4wbCUGR_Vjs0Ec686vyQIm6bi8inm71-o9jsQfmolIoHnVNoOiMyBxz"> When Paul speaks in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91255" data-verses="Colossians 3:16">Colossians 3:16</span> of letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, he does not mention reading, which is an exercise of the mind. Rather, he mentions wisdom, which implies the exercise of the spirit. What issues from the exercise of the spirit is wisdom, but what comes through the exercise of the mind is knowledge. <span class="pg" data-page-id="355" id="355">[355]</span> </p>

Here Paul does not speak of teaching and admonishing in an ordinary way, but of teaching and admonishing in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Furthermore, Paul indicates that it is by singing that we let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. We may also teach and admonish by singing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPQbExYJvy3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy">SINGING TO THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X9cTcHXaIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> Because many of us were born into Christianity, raised in Christianity, and even constituted of Christianity, we must admit that, at least to some extent, we are still under the influence of the religion of Christianity, especially in the way we gather together for the meetings. Nowhere in the New Testament are Christians told that we should gather together and sit quietly, waiting for someone to start the meeting. According to the book of Psalms, when the children of Israel came together for the feasts three times a year, they began their meetings not in the temple, but at the foot of Mount Zion. As they ascended the mountain, they psalmed the songs of ascent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91256" data-verses="Psalms 120:1-134">Psalms 120 through 134</span>). Likewise, the church meetings should begin not in the meeting hall, but either in our homes or on our way to the meeting. The meeting should be an exhibition of our daily life, of the way we live at home, at school, or at work. The meeting should be full of singing and praising because we sing and praise the Lord day by day. I appreciate the chorus of the hymn, “This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all the day long.” But where can you find a Christian who praises the Lord all day long? Many Christians who sing this hymn do not praise their Savior in their daily living. But our daily life should be filled with singing to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCWMr91w516P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v"> Many of us have read the Bible for years without realizing that we can receive the Word of God by singing. Is it your practice to take a verse of the Bible not only by reading, but also by singing? Christians have been taught to study the <span class="pg" data-page-id="356" id="356">[356]</span> Bible and to read it, but not to sing it. We are thankful for the recovery of pray-reading the Word. Now we must go on to sing-read the Word of God. We need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom by singing. This is not my teaching; it is the charge given by the apostle Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91257" data-verses="Colossians 3:16">Colossians 3:16</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExWlc-oYe6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> Even though we have been reading Colossians for years, we have not paid adequate attention to taking the Word by singing. Many Christians claim to be scriptural. But instead of being wholly scriptural, they may be formal and religious. It certainly is scriptural to sing the Word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadOK1_JPKoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> We should sing the Word not only in the meetings, but especially in our daily life. In particular, we should sing the Word at home. When you are alone in your room or with others at the dining table, sing the Word of God. Singing the Word is an excellent way to exercise the spirit. To pray is to exercise the spirit, but to sing is an especially good way to exercise the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78Qew6vV-6XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5"> The longest book of the Bible is the book of Psalms, containing one hundred fifty psalms. This book was composed not merely for reading; it was written for singing, even for psalming. Psalming is more elevated than singing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91258" data-verses="Colossians 3:16">Colossians 3:16</span> Paul mentions psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Spiritual songs are usually short; hymns, of medium length; and psalms are usually longer compositions. We need to sing and psalm the Word of God. Psalming is higher, deeper, and more profound than singing. </p>

This means that we must let the word of Christ inhabit us in a rich way, not by mere knowledge from the mind, but by every kind of wisdom from our spirit, including singing and psalming. Oh, we need to sing and psalm the Word of God! To sing the Word is better than reading it, and to psalm the Word is even better than singing it. Psalming the Word includes <span class="pg" data-page-id="357" id="357">[357]</span> musing upon it and enjoying it. As we psalm the Word, we dwell upon it, muse on it, and enjoy it, thereby giving more opportunity for the Word to saturate us. </p>

<p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG6kIQb_Sxa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91276" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. The unsearchable riches of Christ are the fullness of the Godhead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91277" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). How all-inclusive and extensive these riches must be! The very fullness of the Godhead has become the unsearchable riches of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgxMqRIIZ6q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> As we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91278" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91279" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16-17">16-17a</span>, we see that for Christ to make His home in our heart means that His unsearchable riches must possess our entire being. They must fill our heart, including the mind, emotion, will, and conscience. No doubt, if our heart has been occupied and possessed by Christ, we shall also be one with Him in spirit. Then our whole inner being will be possessed by Christ and be one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s93GKcSaxINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> The word about the fullness of God being the riches of Christ and the riches of Christ possessing our inner being may be little more than a doctrine to us. We must go on to ask how in a practical way the riches of Christ can fill us. The fullness of the Godhead and the unsearchable riches of Christ are realized by the Spirit and in the Spirit. Furthermore, the Spirit is embodied in the Word. On the one hand, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91280" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91281" data-verses="Ephesians 3:17">17</span> Paul speaks of the riches of Christ and of Christ making His home in our heart; on the other hand, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91282" data-verses="Colossians 3:16">Colossians 3:16</span> he charges us to let the word of <span class="pg" data-page-id="362" id="362">[362]</span> Christ dwell in us richly. The word <em>richly</em> corresponds to “riches,” and the word <em>dwell</em> corresponds to “make His home.” The Christ with the unsearchable riches desires to make His home in our heart. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91283" data-verses="Colossians 3:16">Colossians 3:16</span> refers both to these riches and to the matter of the word of Christ inhabiting us, indwelling us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllYFPLLQ1NlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> Moreover, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91284" data-verses="Ephesians 3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>, if Christ makes His home in our heart, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God. We began with the fullness of the Godhead, and now we return to this fullness. The fullness of God, which is from eternity, has become the unsearchable riches of Christ. Now this Christ with His unsearchable riches is making His home in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of the Godhead. Therefore, here we have a full circle beginning with the fullness of the Godhead and also coming back to this fullness. We praise the Lord that through the Spirit and the Word we may experience the unsearchable riches of Christ and be filled unto all the fullness of God! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAVIlvdXtIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY2pzqSRIHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> Concerning the Spirit, there are two extremes, one found among fundamentalists and the other among Pentecostalists. Because they are afraid of the experience of the Spirit, certain fundamental Christians care primarily for Bible doctrine. But to have only the doctrine of the Bible without the Spirit is to have a lifeless body. The Spirit is embodied in the Word. Hence, the Word may be called the body of the Spirit. To separate the Spirit from the Word is to have a lifeless body. The Spirit is the life content of the Bible. Apart from the Spirit, the Bible is dead letters. Nevertheless, fundamental Christians are often afraid to hear about the experience of Christ, the Spirit, and the inner life. They represent one extreme. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG6kIQaLyxa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> The Pentecostalists represent another extreme. They may neglect the Word and emphasize the Spirit in an abnormal, unbalanced way. </p>
<p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgxMqRJs96q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> God’s economy avoids both extremes. In the economy of <span class="pg" data-page-id="363" id="363">[363]</span> God, the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate reaching of the Triune God to man. As we have seen, when the Spirit comes to us, the Triune God comes. Along with the Spirit, God gives us the Word. On the one hand, we have the Spirit as the ultimate and consummate reaching of the Triune God; on the other hand, we have the Word as the embodiment of the Spirit. We should never divorce the Word from the Spirit. Just as our life and our physical body are one entity, one complete living organism, so the Spirit and the Word are one. As human beings, we must have both a visible and tangible body and also an invisible and intangible life. In like manner, as believers, we need both the Word and the Spirit. Furthermore, just as it is the invisible life within our body which makes our body vigorous and active, it is the Spirit who causes the Word to be living. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s93GKcQOJINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> The Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit is with us. There is no need to fast and pray in order to receive the Spirit. We can receive this Spirit simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. From our experience we know that whenever we call, “O Lord Jesus,” we receive the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91285" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:3">1 Cor. 12:3</span>). Then the Spirit turns us to the Word. Many of us can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus with faith and love, we receive the Spirit. Automatically, we are drawn to the Bible. This indicates that the Spirit and the Word are one. God’s economy depends on both the Word and the Spirit. We must have both and never separate them. We need the Word as the body and the Spirit as the life. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllYFPLJUJNlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> If we would allow Christ to occupy us and make His home in us, we must be filled with the word of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91286" data-verses="John 14:23">John 14:23</span> the Lord Jesus says, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.” Here we see the connection between the Lord’s word and the Father and the Son coming to us and making an abode with us. It is difficult to say whether this abode is for the Father and the Son or for us. Actually, it is a mutual abode. On the one hand, the Lord makes us His abode; on the other hand, He is <span class="pg" data-page-id="364" id="364">[364]</span> an abode to us. This is proved by the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91287" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span> concerning abiding: “Abide in Me and I in you.” This refers to the mutual abiding and to the mutual abode. No doubt, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91288" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> is the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91289" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91290" data-verses="John 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> we have the mutual abode and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91291" data-verses="John 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, the mutual abiding. Because there is an abode both for the Lord and for us, we now can abide in Him and He can abide in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82it-m8U_QAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91292" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91293" data-verses="John 15:7">7</span>, for the Lord’s word to abide in us means that the Lord Himself abides in us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91294" data-verses="John 15:4">Verse 4</span> says, “Abide in Me and I in you.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91295" data-verses="John 15:7">verse 7</span> the Lord goes on to say, “If you abide in Me and My words abide in you....” These verses indicate that the Lord’s words are equal to the Lord Himself. If Christ is to abide in us in a practical way, His words must abide in us. We cannot have Christ in us experientially unless we have His words in us also. </p>
<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT9EKQn-0-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> We praise the Lord that we have Christ, the Spirit, and the Word! Because Christ is God, He is real; because He is the Spirit, He is living; and because He is the Word, He is very practical. None of us can deny that, as those who believe in Christ, we have the Spirit and the Word. How wonderful that the Spirit and the Word are one! </p>

We should not have the attitude that because we have acquired a certain amount of knowledge during our years as Christians, there is no need for us to come to the Word daily. Even though we have been eating for years, we continue to eat day by day in order to stay alive. It would be foolish to say that because we have eaten so often in the past, we no longer need to eat. In like manner, we must come to the Word every day, even several times during the day. We should begin each day with a good breakfast both physically and spiritually. Every day we need to take the living Word into us and be filled. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91305" data-verses="Philippians 4:13">Philippians 4:13</span> he testifies, “I can do all things in Him who empowers me.” It is somewhat easy to understand what it means to be able to do all things in the Lord who empowers us, but it is quite difficult to understand what it means to do all things in the name of the Lord. The name, of course, denotes a person. When we call someone by name, that person responds. Hence, a name denotes a person. Apart from the person, the name is empty and meaningless. Because the name denotes a person, to do things in the name of the Lord must mean to do things in His person. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuPZuoiFBpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q">PRAYING IN THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceRzHSTrOcDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> At the end of their prayers many Christians add the words “In the name of Jesus, amen.” They use the Lord’s name as a seal, stamp, or signature to endorse their prayers. According to the Bible, however, this is not the meaning of praying in the Lord’s name. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91306" data-verses="John 15:16">John 15:16</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.” Here the Lord speaks of asking the Father in the Lord’s name. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91307" data-verses="John 14:13-14">John 14:13 and 14</span> say, “And whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.” If we ask something of the Father in the name of the Son, it may be possible for our petition to use the Son’s name as a signature of endorsement. But we certainly cannot use the <span class="pg" data-page-id="370" id="370">[370]</span> Lord’s name in this way when we are asking something of Him directly. According to the basic truth revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91308" data-verses="John 14:1-2">John 14 and 15</span>, to be in the Lord’s name means to be one with the Lord, to live by the Lord, and to let the Lord live in us. The Lord came in the name of the Father and did things in the Father’s name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91309" data-verses="John 5:43">John 5:43</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91310" data-verses="John 10:25">10:25</span>). This means that He was one with the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91311" data-verses="John 10:30">John 10:30</span>) and lived by the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91312" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span>), and the Father worked in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91313" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span>). In the Gospels, the Lord as the expression of the Father did things in the Father’s name. In the Acts, the disciples as the expression of the Lord did even greater things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91314" data-verses="John 14:12">John 14:12</span>) in His name. Therefore, to be in the Lord’s name means to be one with Him in actuality. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexLMrNWfIzqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91315" data-verses="John 5:43">John 5:43</span> the Lord Jesus says, “I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me.” For the Lord Jesus to come in the name of the Father did not mean that He used the Father’s name as a stamp. The fact that the Lord came in the name of the Father means that He came with the Father and in the Father. When He came, the Father came also. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91316" data-verses="John 10:25">John 10:25</span>, the Lord Jesus said, “I told you, and you do not believe; the works which I do in the name of My Father, these testify concerning Me.” For the Lord to do works in the name of the Father is to be one with the Father and to do things in the person of the Father. For this reason, the Lord Jesus could say, “I and the Father are one” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91317" data-verses="John 10:30">John 10:30</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91318" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span> the Lord Jesus said that the living Father sent Him and that He lived because of the Father. The thought here is that the Lord Jesus was one with the Father and therefore was in the person of the Father and in the Father’s name. All these verses indicate that, according to biblical usage, to be in a person’s name means to be one with that person. Thus, the name is not merely a signature, stamp, or seal used as an endorsement to conclude a prayer. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwEv4oZ-IyG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT">EXPERIENCING CHRIST SUBJECTIVELY</h2><p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExWlU-oY-6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> Many Christians do not realize that as believers we should experience Christ subjectively. The Bible reveals that <span class="pg" data-page-id="371" id="371">[371]</span> God’s desire and intention is to work Christ into us. What could be more subjective than having Christ wrought into our very being? Paul refers to this when he speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91319" data-verses="Ephesians 3:17">Eph. 3:17</span>). As the extensive, all-inclusive One, the One anointed by God, Christ wants not only to dwell in us, but also to make His home in us. This certainly is a subjective matter. The root of the Greek word rendered “make home” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91320" data-verses="Ephesians 3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span> is the same as that for <em>house.</em> It is not adequate merely to speak of Christ dwelling in us, for this does not convey the full meaning of the Greek word. We must say that Christ wants to house Himself, make His home, in us. The experience of Christ housing Himself in us is indeed very subjective. However, for the most part, this experience is neglected by Christians today. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadOK9_JPqoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> The teachings among Christians mainly stress that Christ is our Redeemer and Savior, that as God Christ should be the object of our worship, and that Christians should improve their behavior. We fully believe that Christ is our Redeemer and Savior, that He is God, and that we should worship Him. However, according to the Bible, the point about Christians improving their behavior is questionable. What is meant by good behavior? We do not agree with good behavior that is merely the product of a person’s self-effort. But we definitely agree that we need good behavior which is the product of the Christian life transformed with Christ. When the Bible speaks of good behavior, it does not refer to the good behavior of the natural life. On the contrary, it denotes the proper living, or behavior, of a transformed life. The important matter here is that many Christians have missed the mark, the focal point, of God’s economy. They do not see from the Word of God that the Triune God desires to come into us to be our life, our life supply, and everything to us, even our person, that we may be one with Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78Qe46vl26XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5">COINHERENCE</h2><p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2IxGmhS-AfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> I wish to emphasize once again that to be in the name of the Lord is not merely to use His name as a stamp or <span class="pg" data-page-id="372" id="372">[372]</span> signature at the end of a prayer. It means to be in the person of the Lord Jesus. When Christ the Son came in the name of the Father, He did not use the Father’s name as a signature or stamp. Instead, He came in the person of the Father. We should not think that when the Lord Jesus came, only the Son came and not the Father also. No, when the Son came, the Father came in Him and with Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91321" data-verses="John 14:23">John 14:23</span> proves this: “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.” On the one hand, here the Lord speaks of the Father loving us; on the other hand, He speaks of the Father and the Son coming to us and making an abode with us. According to this verse, if we love the Son, the Father will love us. Then the Father and the Son will make an abode with us. This indicates that when the Son comes to us, the Father comes also. However, this does not mean that the Father comes alongside the Son. The Father comes in the Son, in the way of coinherence, of mutual indwelling. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91322" data-verses="John 14:11">John 14:11</span> speaks of the Son being in the Father and the Father being in the Son. The little word <em>in</em> is very important, for it points to the matter of coinherence. The Lord came in the Father and with the Father in Him. This is what it means to say that the Son came in the name of the Father. </p>

These are the four basic elements of the structure of these verses. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91335" data-verses="Philippians 2:5">verse 5</span> Paul presents Christ as our pattern: “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.” Then Paul goes on to describe this Christ, saying that He was obedient unto death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91336" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">verse 12</span> Paul speaks of working out our own salvation, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91337" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">verse 13</span> he goes on to say that God is operating in us. Therefore, we have Christ as the pattern of our salvation and we must work out our own salvation according to God’s operation in us. The issue of God’s operation within us is that we hold forth the word of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91338" data-verses="Philippians 2:16">v. 16</span>). Hence, the four basic elements in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91339" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-16">2:5-16</span> are Christ, salvation, God, and the word of life. In this message we shall consider how these four elements are related to one another. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-ifZ0q_kqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI">CHRIST AS THE PATTERN</h2><p data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRMBWfkMJMnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY"> Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ. If we would experience Christ and live Him, we must know Him as our pattern. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91340" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-11">2:5-11</span> Paul presents Christ as our pattern. We need to be deeply impressed with this pattern and even have it infused into us. </p>
<p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvkXAg9o0Xkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> Christ is wonderful; He truly is all-inclusive. From the book of Colossians we have seen that Christ is both all-inclusive and universally extensive. This all-inclusive Christ is nothing less than God. But even though He is equal with God, He “emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91341" data-verses="Philippians 2:7">v. 7</span>). He did not regard His equality with God as a thing to grasp. Rather, He laid aside <span class="pg" data-page-id="378" id="378">[378]</span> this equality and emptied Himself. This does not mean, however, that Christ was no longer God. It simply means that He put aside His outward expression of God. Although He subsisted in the form of God, He took on the form of a slave and became in the likeness of men and in the fashion of a man. As a result, He had the appearance of a man instead of the expression of God. On the one hand, having the form of God, Christ emptied Himself. On the other hand, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross. As the Savior, Christ has both divinity and humanity. He both emptied Himself and humbled Himself. Thus, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91342" data-verses="Philippians 2:6-8">verses 6 through 8</span>, we may speak of the self-emptying and self-humbling Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="LY3b3GAWOFJOmvN2cbErBRxwrBjRnSK7D62ke0j8mOyinQzXo2YxW2fi2ufAiHKu1"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91343" data-verses="Philippians 2:9">Philippians 2:9</span> says, “Wherefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name.” This verse indicates that God came in to exalt Christ. For Christ to be exalted means not only that He was uplifted to the third heaven from the lower parts of the earth; it also means that in a glorious way He was brought back with His human nature to the form of God. Before His incarnation, Christ did not have the human nature. But through incarnation He took on humanity. Then He brought this human nature to the cross, shedding His blood for our redemption. After His resurrection, He was uplifted to the heavens and with His human nature was brought back to the form of God in glory. Now He is our pattern. The pattern of the Christian life is the God-man Savior who emptied Himself and humbled Himself and who was exalted and glorified by God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX6sO_fT7nzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v">REPRINTING THE PATTERN</h2><p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO41bVLy4p6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> The very pattern revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91344" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-11">2:5-11</span> must now become our salvation. This is indicated by the words <em>so then</em> at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91345" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">verse 12</span>. After giving us a clear view of Christ as our wonderful pattern, Paul says, “So then, my beloved... work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” </p>
<p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSFzoImpB8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> As our pattern, Christ is both inclusive and exclusive. The pattern is exclusive because it excludes everything <span class="pg" data-page-id="379" id="379">[379]</span> worldly, fleshly, or sinful. There is no way for negative things to have any part in Him or access to Him. But, on the positive side, He is all-inclusive, for He is the God-man Savior who emptied and humbled Himself and who has been exalted and glorified by God. With such a pattern available to us, we now must work out our own salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfym99PBGL9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> To work out our salvation is to work out this pattern and to become in our experience a reprint of the pattern. Christ as the pattern can be compared to a page of type used in printing a book, and our subjective experience of the pattern becoming our salvation can be compared to the printing of the pages of a book. In making a book, each page of type is reprinted again and again until there are many copies. In our experience, the God-man Savior should be reprinted and become our subjective salvation. The very salvation we are to work out is Christ as our pattern. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuPZqojx5pnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q">SALVATION FROM MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS</h2><p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceRzDSSPycDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> The salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91346" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">2:12</span> is not salvation from the condemnation of God or from hell. Rather, salvation here refers to the salvation we experience day by day. In particular, it is salvation from murmurings and reasonings. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91347" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">verse 14</span> Paul says, “Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.” We need an instant salvation to deliver us from our murmurings and reasonings. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexLMvNUL4zqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> We have pointed out that the sisters have a particular problem with murmurings, and the brothers, with reasonings. Usually the wives are given to murmuring, and the husbands, to reasoning. Because we all are troubled by murmurings or reasonings, we need the kind of salvation that can rescue us, not only from God’s condemnation and from the lake of fire, but also from our murmurings and reasonings. This means that we need a subjective, moment-by-moment salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwEv8ob68yG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> We have seen that, as our pattern, Christ emptied Himself and humbled Himself and also was exalted and glorified by God. Sisters, do you think that while you are murmuring, God will come in to exalt you? Brothers, do you believe that while <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> you are reasoning, God will come in to glorify you? Surely God will not exalt us or glorify us when we are murmuring or reasoning. Oh, we need salvation from murmurings and reasonings! </p>
<p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOwDUFlnGf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> Both murmurings and reasonings are signs of rebellion and disobedience. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91348" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">verse 12</span> Paul says that the Philippians “have always obeyed.” We also need to obey—to obey Christ as our pattern. As the One who became our pattern, the Lord Jesus did not murmur or reason. Instead, He emptied Himself and humbled Himself. Now we must obey this pattern, realizing that Christ does not murmur or reason, but empties Himself and humbles Himself. When the brothers are tempted to reason, they need to remember the pattern of the self-emptying and self-humbling Christ. The brothers should then obey this pattern without reasoning. This obedience is the working out of our salvation. Whenever we obey Christ as our pattern, we automatically work out our salvation from our murmurings and reasonings. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrO6XLtfiSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> Christians often ask others if they have been saved. When I was asked this question as a young man, I answered strongly that I had been saved. But if I were asked this question today, I would reply, “What do you mean by ‘saved’? If you mean saved from God’s judgment and from the lake of fire, I most assuredly have been saved. However, if you mean saved from reasonings, I would have to admit that I have been saved in part, but not yet in full.” </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNynEYDSlP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> Years ago, I used to wonder why Paul included <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91349" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">verse 14</span> in this chapter. It seemed to me that what Paul had written was so high that there was no need for this verse. After saying that Christ was exalted and given a name above every name, that every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that we must work out our own salvation according to God’s operating within us, Paul suddenly tells us to do all things without murmurings and reasonings. It seemed to me that murmurings and reasonings were too insignificant to be mentioned here. However, after more experience I learned that we definitely need to be saved in a practical way from reasonings and murmurings. <span class="pg" data-page-id="381" id="381">[381]</span> </p>

First, according to His plan, He created the universe and all things in it. God’s deeds also include incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descending as the Spirit, and, in the future, Christ’s second coming, the kingdom, and the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. God is by no means inactive. On the contrary, He has accomplished a great many things. If it were not for God’s activity in creation, the universe would not have come into existence. The universe came out of God’s activity. </p>
<p data-content-id="-V7223f52MYBu9DyQ9J3bCV24CWpJnNTfbHd_yZfKDZbKPYsFs3GvbJI_KQbDX4I8"> Incarnation is an even more impressive matter than creation. Through incarnation God became a man. As a man, Christ accomplished the work of redemption, dying on the cross for our sins. In His resurrection He brought His humanity into God. How marvelous! </p>

This, of course, is true. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91375" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> does not say that the Son of God became flesh; it says, “The Word became flesh.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91376" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” This Word, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91377" data-verses="John 1:14">verse 14</span>, became flesh. This indicates that God Himself became a man. First, the Word became a man. Then in resurrection Christ, the last Adam in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91378" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> and <span class="pg" data-page-id="386" id="386">[386]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91379" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span> we have two important uses of the word <em>became:</em> the Word became flesh, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. First, Christ became a man in order to accomplish redemption. For this, He died on the cross and was buried. Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit. Our God today is the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCWM7930N16P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v"> God has passed through a marvelous process. He became a man by being born of a virgin in a manger. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91380" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> declares that unto us a child is born and that this child is called the mighty God. That child born of a virgin was the mighty God. This means that the mighty God actually became a child. Do you realize that one day our God became a child? The unique God, the only God in the universe, became a child! We may even speak of this child as the God-child. Of course, this term is not found in the Bible. However, the fact of God becoming a child is clearly revealed in Scripture. To speak of the God-child is not heresy; it is a divine fact. We are considering two crucial times the word <em>became</em> is used. The first is that the Word became flesh, God became a child born in a manger. </p>
<p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LJfhyB08qAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> As we have indicated, the second crucial time the word <em>became</em> is used is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91381" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>, where we are told that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Who was this last Adam? No doubt the last Adam was the man Christ Jesus, God incarnate. Through resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFrLHPxv9d_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> As Christians we all must recognize that the Word, which was God, became flesh. The very God actually became a child. We also must recognize that Christ, after His crucifixion and in resurrection, became a life-giving Spirit. Some Christians, however, oppose this teaching and say that it is heretical. They ask how Christ, the second of the Trinity, could be the Spirit, who is the third of the Trinity. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91382" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>, Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Is not the life-giving Spirit here the Holy Spirit? To deny this is to hold the heretical view that there are two life-giving Spirits. <span class="pg" data-page-id="387" id="387">[387]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG8cjElH9eYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb">THE PROCESSED GOD</h2><p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cJQqvax1hRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> We must turn away from traditional theology and come back to the pure Word of God. According to the Bible, the Triune God has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit. Based upon the revelation in the Word, we may say that today our God is the processed God. He is no longer unprocessed, or “raw.” To say that God has been processed means that He became a child born of a virgin and that, as a man, He was crucified, buried, visited Hades, and entered into resurrection. This certainly was a process. Therefore, we may speak of our God as the processed God. </p>
<p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nfeChx6WMZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> From the time of His birth through His resurrection, Christ was being processed. The entire span of His human life, from incarnation through resurrection, was a period of process. Now, having entered into the state of resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvcsMwEzC7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> Because Christ is the life-giving Spirit, it is easy for us to breathe Him in. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91383" data-verses="Romans 10:1">Romans 10</span>, God is not far from us. On the contrary, He is very near, even in our mouth. All we need to do is breathe Him into us. This surely is good news, glad tidings. </p>
<p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O0Dl5mM6LRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> The gospel is that the unique God, the Creator, one day became a man and passed through a process in order to become the life-giving Spirit for us to breathe in. The letter kills, but this Spirit gives life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91384" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">2 Cor. 3:6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyEnGC0vIz0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK"> Our God has done everything necessary to become the life-giving Spirit. Now we not only have God and the Savior—we also have the life-giving Spirit. The Jews do not know that God has become a man named Jesus Christ. Instead, they know God as the Creator and fail to recognize Him as the One who has been incarnated to be the Savior. Even many Christians today only know God and Christ in an objective way. They do not realize that, as the very God Himself, Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. We cannot separate God, Christ, and the Spirit. These three are one. We may enjoy the three-one God as the Spirit because He has come into our spirit and has made us one spirit with Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91385" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">First Corinthians 6:17</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> says, “He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.” How wonderful! </p>
<p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NDbG_g0ipcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> The consummation of God’s deeds, of all He has done, is the life-giving Spirit. First, God created all things. Second, through incarnation He became a man. Third, through death and resurrection He was processed to become the life-giving Spirit. Now God is not only the Creator, the Redeemer, and the Savior. Ultimately and consummately, He is the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is an all-inclusive drink for us to enjoy. Praise the Lord for the revelation in the Word that the very One who is our God, Creator, Savior, Redeemer, Lord, and Master is also the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit! </p>

God is a speaking God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91386" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1-2">Hebrews 1:1 and 2</span> say, “In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.” As a result of God’s doings, we have the life-giving Spirit, and as a result of God’s speaking, we have the Word. Furthermore, the Word is the word of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld2dkelFy_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5">THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</h2><p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGNQ9uJ3tRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> We may use electricity as an illustration of the Spirit and the Word. With the application of electricity, there is often the need for an antenna and a ground wire. By means of an antenna and a ground wire electricity may be applied in different ways and the electricity will flow. The Spirit may be compared to the antenna, and the Word, to the ground wire. Many Christians today concentrate on the Word as the ground wire, but they neglect the Spirit as the antenna. Many, especially those in the seminaries and Bible colleges, study the Bible, but neglect the Spirit, the antenna. At the other extreme are the Pentecostalists who emphasize the Spirit, the antenna, but do not adequately care for the Bible, the ground wire. We in the Lord’s recovery should be balanced and have both the antenna and the ground wire, both <span class="pg" data-page-id="389" id="389">[389]</span> the Spirit and the Word. If we are balanced concerning the Spirit and the Word, we shall experience the transmission, the flowing, of the divine electricity. </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP_5IQ5lH3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> As the heavenly electricity, God has been installed in us for our enjoyment. However, in order to enjoy Him, we need the Spirit and the Word. Praise Him that in our hands we have the Word and that in our spirit we have the life-giving Spirit! The Spirit and the Word are two great gifts. </p>

Now we shall go on to see that the word of life is identical to the living Christ. The Word is both the embodiment of the living God and identical to the living Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91396" data-verses="1John 1:1-2">First John 1:1 and 2</span> say, “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (for the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us).” These verses indicate that the word of life is the Son of God, Christ. Therefore, the word of life is identical to the living Christ. </p>

To say that God is triune means that He is three-one. The English word <em>triune</em> is derived from the Latin <em>tri-,</em> meaning three, and <em>-une,</em> meaning one. Hence, the word <em>triune</em> does not actually mean three-in-one; it means three-one. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LJflyDgUqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH">A Heavenly Language</h2><p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFrLDPzrRd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> Language is intimately related to culture and expresses various aspects of culture. However, in man’s culture there is nothing which is three-one. But God, the mysterious, invisible One, is triune; He is three-one. The expression three-one <span class="pg" data-page-id="394" id="394">[394]</span> is not that of an earthly language, but of a divine, heavenly language. </p>
<p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOwDMFlnmf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91397" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” In this <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91398" data-verses="John 1:1">verse one</span> clause says that the Word was with God, whereas another clause declares that the Word was God. To say that the Word was with God would seem to indicate that the Word and God are two. But to go on to say that the Word was God indicates that the Word and God are one. Are the Word and God one or two? We may say that they are two-one, even though there is not such an expression in our language because there is not such a fact in our culture. However, we need a divine language to express the divine reality. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrO6PLtfCSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd">Distinct but Not Separate</h2><p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNyncYDitP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> Today many fundamental Christians claim that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate Persons. However, according to the Bible, we may say that the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct, but They definitely are not separate. The Lord Jesus said, “I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91399" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span>). How, then, can the Father and the Son be separate? He also said, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91400" data-verses="John 14:9">John 14:9</span>). How, then, can the Son be a separate Person from the Father? Furthermore, the use of the Greek preposition which means “from with” in the Gospel of John <em>(para)</em> is very significant. The Lord Jesus, the Son, is not only from God, but also with God. While He is from God, He is still with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91401" data-verses="John 6:46">John 6:46</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91402" data-verses="John 8:16">8:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91403" data-verses="John 8:29">29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91404" data-verses="John 16:32">16:32</span>). Likewise, the Spirit was sent not only from the Father but from with the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91405" data-verses="John 15:26">John 15:26</span>). This indicates that when the Spirit comes from the Father, He comes with the Father. Therefore, although the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct, They cannot be separate. The Three of the Godhead are inseparable. Although They are three, They are truly one. In fact, They are three-one. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWa8DglJuV307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-">A Three-one Name</h2><p data-content-id="nHBw_AdnQIfkqKVM8Tgl0tVT-ZUN7CZLTRLJRhNrPdZcnD6qmiGxxSQio_uvcr2U-"> According to the Bible we have the unique God, who is called the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91406" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matthew 28:19 </span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="395" id="395">[395]</span> indicates that the Three of the Godhead have just one name. This verse speaks of baptizing believers into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Here we have a three-one name. This is a divine fact, although our language is not adequate to express it. </p>
<p data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wFaT0pr8WrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J"> Many Christians today, perhaps unconsciously, hold to tritheism, the belief in three Gods. The traditional teaching of the Trinity has a tendency toward tritheism. But we do not believe in tritheism; we believe in the revelation of the Triune God according to the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-ifB0rLUqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI"> Concerning the Godhead, many portions of the Word are rather puzzling. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91407" data-verses="Hebrews 1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> says that God has spoken to us in the Son. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91408" data-verses="Hebrews 1:8">verse 8</span>, the Son is addressed as God. Furthermore, speaking of God, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91409" data-verses="Hebrews 1:9">verse 9</span> then uses the expression “Your God.” According to grammar, this must mean the God of God. How are we to understand this? It certainly is mysterious. Verses such as these indicate that we need to be delivered from the natural, traditional, and religious way of understanding the Bible. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRMBOflo9MnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY">THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvkXYg_88Xkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> It is crucial for us to realize that, having passed through the various steps of a process, the Triune God today has become the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91410" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> says, “The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” Although the Spirit of God has always been in existence, this verse nevertheless says that the Spirit was not yet. The expression “the Spirit” here denotes the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is all-inclusive because it includes not only divinity, but also humanity, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. It includes all the three-one God is, has, and has accomplished and attained. Therefore, the Spirit is the totality of all the three-one God is, has, and has accomplished and attained. </p>

However, this understanding is not adequate. We must go on to see that the New Testament indicates that the Word is the Spirit. The Lord Jesus said, “The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91412" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>). Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91413" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17">Ephesians 6:17</span> even identifies the Word as the Spirit. Hence, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit, and the Word are one in a very mysterious way. </p>

We also indicated that the Word is the consummation of God’s speaking. But why is the Word the Spirit and the Spirit, the Word? I admit that this matter is very difficult to understand and explain. </p>
<p data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUlhTWqpP3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3"> As a help to our understanding, we may use the striking of matches as an illustration. Matches are made of phosphorus. Hence, a match is the embodiment of phosphorus. As such, in a very practical way it is identical to phosphorus. This means that the match is phosphorus and phosphorus is the match. Applying this illustration to the Bible and the Spirit, we may compare the Bible to the match and the Spirit to phosphorus. Furthermore, because a match is made of phosphorus and is the embodiment of phosphorus, it makes phosphorus available to us. The Triune God today is the Spirit, and the Spirit is embodied in the Word. Although it is rather difficult for us to handle the Spirit, we can easily carry a Bible. Just as we have phosphorus by having a match, so we have the Spirit by having the Bible. </p>

To use the illustration of the match, when these believers strike the Word, the “match” does not light, even <span class="pg" data-page-id="397" id="397">[397]</span> though they may love the Bible very much. If we want to light a match, it is not adequate merely to love the match. We need to strike the match in a proper way. In the same principle, if we would contact the Spirit embodied in the Word, we need to “strike” the “match” of the Word by exercising our spirit. </p>

For example, if we pray with the words <em>murmurings and reasonings</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91425" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">2:14</span>, we shall breathe in the breath of God. Furthermore, we shall come to hate our murmurings and reasonings and aspire to be saved from them. By pray-reading the Word, we respond to it. Then in our experience the Word is not a book in dead letters; instead, it is God’s breath, even His breathing. </p>
<p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV397c3iNRIiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> Sometimes when we pray-read the Word, we may pray a whole verse at one time. However, often it is better to pray-read word by word or phrase by phrase. No one can eat a whole chicken at once. Instead, we eat a little at a time. In the same principle, we should pray-read the Word a little at a time, perhaps even word by word. If we pray with the words <em>murmurings and reasonings</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91426" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">2:14</span>, we shall receive a divine injection, a heavenly inoculation, which will save us from our murmurings and our reasonings. </p>
<p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHVZJN4YfkJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> In our physical body, we sometimes develop a problem with our skin, perhaps an infection or a fungus. In some cases, neither cleansing nor application of medications to the skin will bring about healing. However, a physician may prescribe medication to be taken internally which will clear <span class="pg" data-page-id="404" id="404">[404]</span> up the whole problem. The Bible is a divine medication, the most effective antidote to all negative things. The way to apply the Word as an antidote is not merely to think about it, consider it, or analyze it. We receive the antidote of the Word by exercising our spirit to pray-read it. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld2dsenxe_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91427" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:16">Jeremiah 15:16</span> says, “Thy words were found, and I did eat them.” Like the prophet Jeremiah, we also would eat the Word of God. Some Christians, however, oppose this concept, claiming that the Bible is good only for reading and studying. But the Bible is not only for reading and studying, but also for eating. The Lord Jesus said, “Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91428" data-verses="Matthew 4:4">Matt. 4:4</span>). This indicates that every word of the Bible, even words such as <em>murmurings and reasonings,</em> can supply us with life. Hence, we may pray-read a verse like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91429" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">2:14</span> word by word. In this way, we shall live by every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NDbO_g0CpcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl">SINGING THE WORD</h2><p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV397c3jp9IiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> We may not realize how much we are influenced by traditional Christianity even in the way we read the Bible. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91430" data-verses="Colossians 3:16">Colossians 3:16</span> says, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.” Here Paul does not speak of reading, analyzing, or meditating on the Word. Instead, he encourages us to sing the Word. We should receive the word of Christ not only by reading, but also by singing, psalming, and praising. Whether or not we sing well, the Lord is pleased to hear us singing the Word. He is happy when we sing from our spirit and from our heart. If we do not know a melody to use in singing a particular verse, we may make up one of our own. The important thing is that we learn to sing the Word of God. I believe that one day in a meeting we may spend most of the time singing a book like Ephesians. </p>
<p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHVZJN6M_kJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> We have pointed out that the Lord Jesus said that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that <span class="pg" data-page-id="405" id="405">[405]</span> proceeds out of the mouth of God. The Word, however, is not only food to us and our life supply; it is also a spiritual antibiotic. We should not only be fed by the Word, but should also be inoculated with it against many different kinds of troubles, problems, weaknesses, and “diseases.” Murmurings and reasonings are spiritual diseases against which we need to be inoculated by the Word. Day by day we need to pray-read the Word and sing the Word in order to receive further inoculations. If we pray-read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91431" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">2:14</span>, we shall be inoculated against murmurings and reasonings. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld2dsel16_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5"> We need to take the Bible as a book of life. The whole Bible is the word of life. As the word of life, the Bible is food to us. Would it not be foolish only to study food and not eat it? If we would study our food and refuse to eat it, we would eventually die. Likewise, if we do not eat the Word, we shall die spiritually. It is crucial that we eat the Word by pray-reading it and by singing it. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGNQ1uJH1RwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> In pray-reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91432" data-verses="Philippians 2:14-16">2:14 through 16</span>, we should not simply pray-read these verses as a whole, but should concentrate on the important words and phrases. We need to pray-read the words <em>murmurings, reasonings, blameless, guileless, without blemish, children of God, crooked, perverted, generation, shine, lights, world, holding forth, word,</em> and <em>life.</em> We may strongly dislike murmurings, reasonings, and the crooked and perverted generation. Nevertheless, the words <em>murmurings, reasonings,</em> and <em>crooked and perverted generation</em> in these verses can supply us with life if we pray-read and sing them. We should hate murmurings, but we should appreciate pray-reading the word <em>murmurings.</em> Furthermore, we should not only eat these words, but also digest them and assimilate them so that they may become part of our constitution. </p>

The more I pray-read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91433" data-verses="Philippians 2:14-16">2:14-16</span>, the more I realize that we can give message after <span class="pg" data-page-id="406" id="406">[406]</span> message on these verses. We may give one message on murmurings, and another on reasonings. Then we need messages on being blameless and guileless. To be blameless is to be without defect in our outward behavior, and to be guileless is to be pure in our inward character. Outwardly, in our behavior, we need to be without defect; inwardly, in our character, we need to be pure. Surely such matters can be the subject of entire messages. However, Christians may read these verses and take them for granted. They may not inquire what Paul means here by blameless and guileless. </p>
<p data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGw4YpwRkkIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r"> Imagine how many messages we need on the expression “children of God”! As children of God, we have the divine life and nature. These matters are profound and require many messages to cover them adequately. </p>
<p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVxMePnrPBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> We also could give messages on being without blemish, and on the crooked and perverted generation. What is the difference between crooked and perverted? What is the generation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91434" data-verses="Philippians 2:15">verse 15</span>, and what does Paul mean by the world? If we ask questions such as these and if we pray-read these verses, we shall be impressed with the fact that the riches in the Word are inexhaustible. Day by day we need to receive these riches by pray-reading the Word and by singing it. </p>

We shall present the word of life to others and offer it to them. This is to magnify Christ and to live Christ. Christ Himself is the living Word, the word of life. For this reason, when we are filled with the word of life, we manifest Christ and magnify Him. This is the way to live Christ. </p>

As God’s children, we have His life and nature. Just as a child <span class="pg" data-page-id="407" id="407">[407]</span> has the life and nature of his father because he was born of him, not adopted by him, so we have the life and nature of God the Father because we were born of Him and not merely adopted by Him.

To say that this salvation is constant means that it is a salvation we may experience every day, every hour, and every moment. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7DJwN55Or0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt">A SUBJECTIVE SALVATION<br/>FOR MAGNIFYING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKIwdLEtGm4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91440" data-verses="Philippians 1:1-2">Philippians 1 and 2</span> Paul uses the word <em>salvation</em> twice. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91441" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> he says, “For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91442" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">2:12</span> he says to the saints in Philippi, “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” The salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91443" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> denotes the salvation Paul experienced during his imprisonment in Rome. A typical Jew, he was held a prisoner in Rome, far from his native land. Using today’s terms, Paul was held captive by the Roman imperialists. It certainly was a shameful, dishonorable thing for a Jew to be held in a Roman prison. Most of the time, Paul was probably chained to a guard. It certainly must have been an insult for an educated upperclass Jew to be chained to a guard in a Roman prison. It was also dishonorable for such an apostle of the Lord Jesus to be imprisoned in such a way. Nevertheless, Paul testified that his situation would turn out to him for salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAVI9vfDFIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91444" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> Paul is not referring to eternal salvation, the salvation from hell and the judgment of God. That salvation is objective. What Paul has in mind here is a very subjective, experiential salvation, a salvation experienced not once for all, but moment by moment. <span class="pg" data-page-id="412" id="412">[412]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY2prqQVkHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> When Paul said that he expected his situation to turn out for his salvation, he did not have in mind release from prison. Some readers of the book of Philippians may think that Paul’s expectation was that, through the prayers of the saints, especially those in Philippi, he would be released from prison. However, according to the grammatical construction of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91445" data-verses="Philippians 1:19-21">1:19-21</span>, this cannot be the meaning of salvation here. The salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91446" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">verse 19</span> is related to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91447" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span> about not being put to shame in anything and about Christ being magnified in his body, whether through life or through death. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91448" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">verse 20</span> we have the definition of the salvation mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91449" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">verse 19</span>. Therefore, salvation here consists of not being put to shame in anything, but of magnifying Christ in everything. </p>
<p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvkXQg_8cXkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> Salvation here certainly does not mean release from prison. Instead, it means that, no matter how difficult Paul’s situation was and no matter how insulting, he would not be put to shame in anything. Rather, Christ would be magnified in his body. Not even being chained to a guard would hinder Paul from magnifying Christ. This is what we mean by constant salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="LY3b3GAWOFJOmvN2cbErBRxwrBjBnQOXD62ke0j8mOyinQzXo2YxW2fi2ufAiHKu1"> Actually, the word <em>constant</em> is not adequate to describe the salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91450" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span>. All our words are related to our culture. If a certain matter does not exist in our culture, we shall not have a word for it. The salvation here is altogether wonderful and marvelous, and no word is sufficient to describe it fully. Not even in prison would Paul be put to shame. Instead of being put to shame, he knew that he would magnify Christ. This was Paul’s salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="mIS7O7a-NT_KDOKl-0XRFQVGIjRbbbta_H0Cio96dDINunJF9QeGmdjRtCHl84RqP"> Suppose instead of rejoicing in the Lord, Paul wept about his situation and complained, saying, “I’m an educated Jew and also an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, called, commissioned, and sent by Him. Now I’m in prison chained to a guard. How terrible!” If Paul had wept and complained, he would have been put to shame. However, Paul did not weep or complain. On the contrary, he rejoiced in the Lord. Anyone who visited him in prison may have been astonished and amazed. Perhaps Paul even testified to the jailer that <span class="pg" data-page-id="413" id="413">[413]</span> he was happy in the Lord and rejoiced in Him. Possibly Paul’s enjoyment of Christ in prison may have been a factor in bringing Onesimus, a runaway slave, to salvation. Anyone who observed Paul in prison would have seen a man praising the Lord and rejoicing. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfoTYS_Yb2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> When Paul was imprisoned in Philippi, he and Silas sang praises to the Lord. (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91451" data-verses="Acts 16:23-26">Acts 16:23-26</span>). To be sure, the Philippian believers knew of Paul’s experience there in prison. They knew that the praises of Paul and Silas brought in a great earthquake. No doubt, while in prison in Rome, Paul also exercised himself to sing praises to the Lord. Far from being found complaining or weeping, he could be found rejoicing in the Lord, singing praises to Him, and testifying concerning Him. This is constant salvation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUlhbWqZX3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3">ENJOYING A CONSTANT SALVATION TO LIVE CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="F0dlBCvTMMHz8TZjDG814kTWLxtsrG2Vp97z5APngXAwWFiOr0CkhKKWbXwwhx9XD"> Many of us have been Christians for years, but we have never heard anything about this constant salvation. We knew, of course, about eternal salvation. That kind of salvation is objective. I wish to make it very clear that I certainly do not belittle eternal salvation in any way. I treasure it and deeply appreciate it. In His eternal salvation God has rescued us from hell and from His righteous judgment. But day by day we need to go on to experience a constant salvation in our practical life. When Paul was in prison, what he enjoyed was not simply God’s eternal salvation with the hope it afforded him; he also enjoyed a constant salvation hour by hour. To enjoy this salvation is to live Christ. Actually to live Christ is to enjoy constant salvation in our daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAN6o0k4ZK4wbCUGR_Vjs0Ec686zyQI26bi8inm71-o9jsQfmolIoHnVNoOiMyBxz"> Every aspect of God’s salvation brings us out of something on the negative side and ushers us into something on the positive side. Negatively, Paul was saved from being put to shame; positively, Christ was magnified in him. What a wonderful salvation! </p>

We have seen that the salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91455" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> saved Paul in the particular situation of his imprisonment in such a way that he would not be put to shame, but instead would magnify Christ. Now we need to see that, according to the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91456" data-verses="Philippians 2:12">2:12</span>, constant salvation is also for the believers to be saved from ordinary things in their daily living. </p>
<p data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPQbYxYJfy3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy"> From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91457" data-verses="Philippians 2:14-15">verses 14 and 15</span> we see that these things include murmurings, reasonings, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness. These are general characteristics of the condition of fallen man everywhere. No matter where we may be, there will be murmuring, reasoning, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness. These may be found not only in society generally, but even in the family life of believers. It is common for wives to murmur, and for husbands to reason. A wife may complain about something, and her husband may vindicate himself. Then neither the wife nor the husband is blameless, and both may also have guile and blemishes. At times, a husband and wife are also crooked and perverted in their dealings with each other. Who can say that he has never been crooked in his relationships with others? Children may even be crooked in relation to their own parents. Although we have received God’s eternal salvation, to a certain extent we may still be crooked, not altogether honest and straightforward in certain matters. Thus, we need a constant salvation with respect to all the negative things in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91458" data-verses="Philippians 2:14-15">verses 14 and 15</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X9cPcHnCIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> Paul tells us that we need to work out our own salvation. By working out this salvation we shall be saved from murmurings, reasonings, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness. To be sure, it is not easy to be saved from such things. Paul deliberately used these words to indicate the fallen condition common to all. </p>

<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT9EuQm6A-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> Although Philippians is a short book, it is rich and profound. No other book in the New Testament reveals salvation in such a practical and experiential way. We know from the first chapter of Matthew that Christ became a man named Jesus and Emmanuel. Jesus means “Jehovah the Savior,” and Emmanuel means “God with us.” After I was saved, I treasured these names. However, I did not know their meaning in an experiential way until the Lord brought me into the reality of the book of Philippians. In this book we have the details of God’s practical, experiential, subjective, and constant salvation. Philippians presents God’s salvation in a way that is more practical and experiential than the way it is presented in Romans. Romans speaks of salvation more in a doctrinal way, but Philippians speaks of it more in an experiential way. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX6si_enTnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v">THE NEED FOR CONSTANT SALVATION<br/>IN OUR FAMILY LIFE AND CHURCH LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO41b5LzcF6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> God’s salvation in Christ is not only eternal, but also constant and practical. In a sense, eternal salvation is rather remote. We need a salvation that can be applied to our daily situations, especially to our married life and family life. Married life can be compared to a prison. Our spouse is the jailer, and our children are guards. For such a situation, we need a salvation that is practical, constant, and experiential. <span class="pg" data-page-id="420" id="420">[420]</span> The book of Philippians reveals a salvation that we can experience day by day, a salvation that we can enjoy in the “prison” of married life. </p>
<p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSFzEIk9h8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> We need to experience a present salvation not only in our family life, but also in the church life. In the church there are saints of many different nationalities and with all kinds of dispositions and personalities. In order for us to stay together in the church life, we need a present and practical salvation. This is especially necessary if we are to experience the church not only locally, but also as the new man universally. Hence, we need salvation for our family life, for our local church life, and for our life in the one new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfym9RPDCv9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> Suppose you plan to visit churches in different parts of the world. As you come in contact with saints of different cultures, nationalities, and dispositions, you will realize how much we need to experience God’s salvation in the church life. If we are to practice the church life with so many different brothers and sisters meeting together as one, we need the constant salvation revealed in the book of Philippians. </p>
<p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVxMmPnrvBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91474" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span> Paul says, “I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation.” As a prisoner in Rome, Paul needed a practical salvation. Suppose someone spoke to him about eternal salvation. Paul could have said, “Brother, don’t talk about something so remote from my present situation. I am a prisoner in chains. I need a salvation that can be applied to this situation.” </p>

This indicates that we need a salvation from all these negative things. If we are still crooked in some way, then, whether or not we are Christians, we are part of today’s crooked generation. To be saved from the crooked generation is to be saved from crookedness. We all need a salvation for today, the salvation revealed in the book of Philippians. <span class="pg" data-page-id="421" id="421">[421]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKIwhLFJim4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO">THE MEANS OF OUR DAILY SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAVIBvdX9IlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> In this message we shall see that we may have constant, daily salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the inward operation of the indwelling God. Salvation requires power. This means that a certain power is necessary to afford us a constant salvation. God’s means for the accomplishment of this salvation are unspeakably great. According to Philippians, the means are two: the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the inward operation of the indwelling God. Daily and even hourly we may be saved by these two means. </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY2pXqSRYHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> Please notice that the means of our daily salvation are not the bountiful supply of the Spirit of <em>God</em> and the operation of the <em>visiting</em> God. They are the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the inward operation of the indwelling God. The God who saves us is not one who merely visits us; He is the One who indwells us. On the one hand, Paul could say that his circumstances would turn out to him for salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. On the other hand, he charged the saints to work out their own salvation according to the inward operation of God. Thus, the bountiful supply of the Spirit and the inward operation of the indwelling God are the two means whereby we are saved in a practical way day by day. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG6ksQaLixa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj">AN ORGANIC UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgxMORJst6q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> When we believed in Christ, an organic union took place between us and the Triune God. We have actually been joined to the Triune God, united with Him. By believing in Christ we were born of God, and God was born into us. This divine birth makes the organic union possible. We were born of God when the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, came into our spirit. This transaction took place at the time we believed in the Lord Jesus, even though we probably did not realize it and were not conscious of it. Having come into our spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit remains there with His bountiful supply. <span class="pg" data-page-id="422" id="422">[422]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82itam8knQAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> We need to see what the bountiful supply of the Spirit includes. First, the bountiful supply includes the divine Person with the divine life and nature. Thus, the bountiful supply includes divinity, and divinity includes the divine life, nature, being, and person. In other words, it is God Himself. In the bountiful supply we have God with His life, nature, being, and person. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT9EuQnOs-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK">Humanity</h2><p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX6si_fjznzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> The bountiful supply also includes an uplifted humanity, a humanity with a proper life, living, nature, and person. The Lord Jesus is both God and man. Within Him there are both divinity and humanity. Thus, when He was on earth, He lived as God and also as man. All that the Lord passed through in thirty-three and a half years of life on earth is now in the all-inclusive Spirit. Therefore, divinity and humanity, including the human living of the Lord Jesus, are in the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO41b5LyIh6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz">Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension</h2><p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSFzEImZZ8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> On the cross the Lord Jesus died a wonderful death. The all-inclusive death of Christ dealt with every negative thing in the universe. By His death all sinful things were terminated. This wonderful death is also included in the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Christ’s resurrection and ascension are included as well. Now in the bountiful supply of the Spirit we have Christ’s divinity, humanity, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfym9RPB2T9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI">The Divine Attributes and Human Virtues</h2><p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuPZGojBxpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> The bountiful supply of the Spirit also includes the divine attributes and the human virtues. God is love and light, and He is holy and righteous. These are some of His attributes. Furthermore, as a man Christ has all the human virtues. <span class="pg" data-page-id="423" id="423">[423]</span> Both the divine attributes and the human virtues are in the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceRzvSS_6cDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> The submission and love we need day by day are also found in the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Although the Bible commands a wife to submit to her husband and a husband to love his wife, actually in ourselves we do not have either genuine submission or love. Instead of submission, we have rebellion. Instead of a proper love, we have an unbalanced, twisted love. True submission and love are in the bountiful supply of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexLMDNU7AzqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> As we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we partake of the ingredients of this supply without being aware of it. For example, we may love others without being conscious of the fact that we are loving. In like manner, we may be submissive without realizing that we are submissive. However, if we deliberately try to love or submit, our love or submission will not be genuine. True love and true submission are always spontaneous and not something of which we are conscious. A sister who is genuinely submissive to her husband has no consciousness of being submissive, for her submission comes out of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. </p>

For the working out of our own salvation we need this provision. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNynsYCWNP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91493" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-11">2:5-11</span> we have a record of Christ’s incarnation, death, resurrection, and exaltation. However, here nothing is said about Christ’s redemption. It seems that in these verses Paul purposely does not refer to the redemption of Christ. His purpose is to present the Lord Jesus and His incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and exaltation in such a way as to give us a pattern for our daily salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWa8zgktKV307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> Christ alone was qualified to accomplish redemption. We cannot share in this work. It would be blasphemy to say that we participate in the accomplishing of redemption. We enjoy Christ’s redemption, but we cannot participate in Christ’s work of redemption. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nHBw_AdnQIfkqKVM8Tgl0tVT-ZU97ANzTRLJRhNrPdZcnD6qmiGxxSQio_uvcr2U-">THE PATTERN AND THE STANDARD</h2><p data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wFaj0rvAWrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J"> Although we cannot share in Christ’s redemption, we need to be partners with Him in His human living, especially in His emptying Himself, humbling Himself, and in His not grasping equality with God as a treasure. Although the Lord subsisted in the form of God and was equal to God, He did not consider this equality a treasure to be grasped and retained. He did not insist on holding onto the form of God, but was willing to empty Himself by laying aside the form of God and putting on the form of a slave. We all should be partners with Christ in this self-emptying. This means that <span class="pg" data-page-id="430" id="430">[430]</span> instead of grasping what we have, we should lay these things aside and empty ourselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="-V7223f52MYBu9DyQ9J3bCV24CWdJm57fbHd_yZfKDZbKPYsFs3GvbJI_KQbDX4I8"> After Christ emptied Himself, becoming in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself to such an extent that He was obedient even unto the death of the cross. Then God raised Him from among the dead and highly exalted Him. Here we have not only a pattern for our constant salvation, but also the standard for this salvation. The pattern includes Christ’s experience from incarnation through crucifixion; the standard includes His experience from resurrection to exaltation. Daily we need to enjoy a salvation which has such a pattern and standard. </p>
<p data-content-id="p7U5wUxrU37WWc56d4-umduPPQbgxYJ_y3BFpuGFrPelG9dvTtgvkYc9gtKlTXizy"> Suppose the wife of a certain brother gives him a difficult time. The way for him to be saved in this situation is not to insist on his headship or on her subordination. He should not regard himself as a king and her as a subject. Neither should he use <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91494" data-verses="Ephesians 5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span> to insist that she submit to him. To do this would be to grasp his headship, his “husbandship.” This would not be in keeping with the principle that the Lord did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped. Although it is difficult for one who has the headship to lay it aside, this is just what the brother must do in order to experience the Lord’s constant salvation. Of course, the brother can be saved by the inward operation of God. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91495" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-8">2:5-8</span> comes before God’s operation, which is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91496" data-verses="Philippians 2:13">verse 13</span>. Surely God will operate in the brother to save him. Nevertheless, he must be willing to empty himself and lay aside his headship according to the pattern in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91497" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-8">2:5-8</span>. However, in most cases, a married brother grasps his headship and refuses to lay it aside. This may give rise to murmurings, reasonings, and bitter exchange of words. The brother here should contact the Lord Jesus and say, “Lord, You did not grasp equality with God, and I do not grasp my headship. Neither do I insist on my position as a husband. By Your gracious mercy, I lay aside my headship.” Simply by doing this, he experiences the first step of God’s constant salvation. Now he must go on to experience the rest by humbling himself, even unto death. Instead of feeling resentment toward his wife for having to lay aside his <span class="pg" data-page-id="431" id="431">[431]</span> headship, he should humble himself before her. This is to experience the pattern of constant salvation from incarnation to the death of the cross. If the brother experiences this, God will come in to raise him and exalt him. Then the brother will also experience the standard of God’s instant salvation. As a result, his wife may be humbled, troubled by the fact that she has been giving him a difficult time. Instead of reacting to her in a negative way, her husband emptied himself and humbled himself. Now she realizes that in his experience of Christ he is exalted and enthroned. He has experienced constant salvation with its pattern and standard. </p>
<p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X9c3cHXKIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91498" data-verses="Philippians 2:5-16">2:5-16</span> we see how to work out our own salvation. We also see the source and the power for a constant salvation. As we consider the pattern and the standard found here, we see that we need to be partners with Christ in His pattern and standard. This is the first aspect of the divine and rich provision for our constant salvation. </p>

I was also taught that, as Christians, we should follow the Lord Jesus in these steps. However, the more I tried to follow Him and imitate Him, the more my fallen nature was exposed. I realized from my experience that the traditional teaching of imitating Christ does not work, for I simply did not have a nature that could follow the Lord in this way. The Lord Jesus was God incarnate, a God-man, a man with the divine element. How could I, a fallen human being, one who lacked even the proper human element and entirely lacked the divine element, follow this God-man? The Lord Jesus has both the divine element and the proper human element. Although He put aside the form of God, He never laid aside the nature of God. The reality, essence, substance, of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="432" id="432">[432]</span> divine nature was still in Him. Thus, He was a man filled with the divine element. He could pass through the seven steps of His humiliation. However, I could not imitate Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadOKR_JP6oQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> Gradually I began to understand that to follow the Lord Jesus according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91500" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">Philippians 2</span>, we need to have God operating within us. In ourselves we are not able to follow the divine pattern or reach God’s standard. Praise the Lord that God is working in us! The very God who became incarnate in the Lord Jesus is now in us. This God is the infinite God, the eternal God, the One who created the universe by His word. Through incarnation, this eternal God came to live in the Lord Jesus. He made Jesus a pattern and uplifted Him according to the divine standard. Now this same God is operating in us. When I first realized this, I was overjoyed. Because God is operating in me, I am now a God-man. All genuine believers in Christ need to see that, as Christians, we are God-men. No longer need we live according to our fallen humanity, for God is now operating in us. Hallelujah, because God dwells in us and is operating in us, we are God-men! This inward operation of God is the second aspect of the divine and rich provision for constant salvation. </p>

Because we have proclaimed this truth, some have falsely accused us of teaching evolution into God. We certainly do not teach evolution into God. According to the Bible, we testify the fact that, as children of God, we have been born of God. Just as an offspring of a dog has the life and nature of a dog, and a child has the life and nature of his parents, so as children of God we have God’s life and nature. </p>

<p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfoDES-c_2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91519" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">2:17</span> Paul says, “But if even I am poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice together with you all.” In this verse Paul speaks of “the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith,” a phrase which is difficult for students of the Bible to understand. Here two matters are related to the believers’ faith: the sacrifice and the priestly service. Paul regards the believers’ faith as a sacrifice offered to God. The priestly service refers to the offering of sacrifices by a priest. In this verse Paul seems to be saying, “Philippians, I consider your faith as a sacrifice offered to God, and my offering of this sacrifice to Him is a priestly service.” In this message we shall consider the sacrifice of our faith. We shall not cover the matter of priestly service. </p>
<p data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUlxHWrtv3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3"> In the book of Philippians Paul uses certain extraordinary expressions such as “the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91520" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span>), “holding forth the word of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91521" data-verses="Philippians 2:16">2:16</span>), and “the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith.” If we would know the secret of experiencing Christ as revealed in this book, we need to understand these expressions. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="F0dlBCvTMMHz8TZjDG814kTWLx9wrHSpp97z5APngXAwWFiOr0CkhKKWbXwwhx9XD">FAITH AS A SACRIFICE OFFERED TO GOD</h2><p data-content-id="CAN6o0k4ZK4wbCUGR_Vjs0Ec68qvyScG6bi8inm71-o9jsQfmolIoHnVNoOiMyBxz"> What is the faith that can constitute a sacrifice offered to God? As believers, we all have some amount of faith. If we did not have faith, we could not be believers in Christ. Although we have faith, the question remains whether or not this faith can be regarded as a sacrifice offered to God <span class="pg" data-page-id="438" id="438">[438]</span> in a joyful way by the apostles. Paul was a New Testament priest. He says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91522" data-verses="Romans 15:16">Romans 15:16</span>, “That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.” As a gospel priest, Paul offered his converts to God as a sacrifice. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91523" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">Philippians 2:17</span> it is not the believers themselves which are the sacrifice; it is the faith of the believers which is considered a sacrifice. The thought in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91524" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">2:17</span> is deeper than that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91525" data-verses="Romans 15:16">Romans 15:16</span>. Do you think of your faith as a sacrifice which such a ministering one can offer to God? </p>
<p data-content-id="PlrvbBpD2zxx_8-X698IQTc85S36KiKDF52HYJhkJHFcO4Qc_4xEevBqOsx5k1dpA"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91526" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">verse 17</span>, Paul was willing to be poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and priestly service of the believers’ faith. Paul realized that one day he would be martyred. As a martyr, he would be a drink offering poured out upon the sacrifice of their faith. In the Old Testament a drink offering was poured out on one of the basic offerings. Without a basic offering, there could not have been the drink offering. Paul regarded his death as a martyr as a drink offering. The basic offering upon which this drink offering was to be poured was the faith of the believers in Philippi. It is very important for us to understand what kind of faith can become the sacrifice on which the drink offering is poured. Thus, in this message we shall seek to understand the faith to which Paul refers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91527" data-verses="Philippians 2:17">2:17</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s93WOcQOZINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ">FAITH, THE WORD, AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllYVLLJUZNlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> The faith in this verse is somewhat different from that mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91528" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span> says, “In whom you also, hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.” As a result of hearing the word of the truth and of believing in Christ, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit. In this verse we have the word, faith, and the Spirit. By hearing the word and believing it, we receive the Spirit. The word, faith, and the Spirit are one. <span class="pg" data-page-id="439" id="439">[439]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82i96m8UvQAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> The Word is the expression of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91529" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>). God is the source of the Word. When we have the Word, we have God, for the Word is God’s expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT9UOQn-k-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> According to the Gospel of John, the Word is both God and the Spirit. Furthermore, Christ is also God, the Spirit, and the Word. Christ is the Word, and the Word is God. Thus, there is a marvelous interrelationship between God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word. The Word is God and also the Spirit. At the same time Christ is both God and the Spirit. On the one hand, Christ is the Word; on the other hand, the Word is Christ. Likewise, God is the Spirit and the Spirit is God. Here we see the Triune God embodied in the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX68C_fTrnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> The Triune God is embodied in the Word, and the Word has come to us. The very Word which was with God and which is God became flesh and tabernacled among us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91530" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91531" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91532" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, this Word who became flesh was worshipped as God. Thomas said concerning Him, “My Lord and my God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91533" data-verses="John 20:28">John 20:28</span>). The Word is not only our God, but also the coming of our God to us. Our God comes to us embodied in the Word. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91534" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17">Ephesians 6:17</span>, the Spirit is the Word. The wonderful Triune God is embodied in the Word, and the Word has come to us. When the Word comes, God, Christ, and the Spirit come. The Three of the Triune God come with the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO41LZLy456Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> The first function of the Word is to infuse us with faith. I do not believe it is possible for someone to repeat a Bible verse ten times without being infused with faith. Suppose an atheist reads <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91535" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> and repeats this verse again and again. Even this atheist would be infused with faith through the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSFjkImpR8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> The faith infused into us through the Word is the function of the Spirit. Faith is both the issue of the Word and the function of the Spirit. When the Word comes to us and is contacted by us, we receive the Spirit. This means that when the Word reaches us and we touch it, the Word becomes the Spirit in our experience. Thus, the Word first comes to us and then it becomes the Spirit in us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="440" id="440">[440]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfymtxPBGb9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> The Word becoming the Spirit in our experience can be illustrated by the lighting of a match. The head of a match is a ball made of phosphorus. When we strike a match in a proper way, the phosphorus bursts into flame. Is the flame different from the phosphorus? No, it is simply the explosion of the phosphorus. In like manner, the Spirit is the “explosion” of the Word. When we experience this explosion, we are “burned” by the “fire.” This burning is faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuPJmojxJpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> As a young Christian, I earnestly desired to have faith. I read a number of books about faith. However, none of these books told me what faith is in actuality. Only in recent years have I discovered through my experience what faith is. Faith comes out of the word that infuses us with the divine element. Hence, faith is the issue of the word and of the Spirit’s function. When we have the word with the Spirit, we spontaneously have faith. As we have pointed out, faith, the word, and the Spirit are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceRjPSSPCcDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD"> If you consider this definition of faith in the presence of the Lord, you will worship Him. You will see that whenever there is genuine faith in you, the word is implied and the Spirit is realized. Apart from the word and the Spirit, it is impossible for us to have faith. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexLcjNU7gzqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v">STRENGTHENED BY THE ELEMENT OF FAITH</h2><p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwE_wobKkyG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91536" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16-19">Ephesians 3:16-19</span> says that when the Father grants us according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our inner man, Christ will make His home in our hearts by faith. Then, being rooted and grounded in love, we shall be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth, length, height, and depth, and know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. If we take time to pray-read these verses and to muse upon them, our faith will be strengthened. Something within us will be strengthened to realize that Christ is making His home in our hearts, that we are being rooted and grounded in love, that we are apprehending the dimensions of Christ, and that we are even being filled unto all the fullness of God. A certain element <span class="pg" data-page-id="441" id="441">[441]</span> has been infused into us to strengthen us, and this element is faith. </p>

<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadOax_ILGoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91576" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">Philippians 3:9</span> says, “And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith.” According to this verse, Paul’s own righteousness was intimately related to the law. If we are to be found in Christ, we must fulfill the condition of not having our own righteousness which is of the law, but a righteousness which is not our own—that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith. Therefore, the title of this message is “To Be Found in Christ in the Righteousness of God through the Faith of Christ.” In the righteousness of God we may be found in Christ, and this righteousness is through the faith of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78QO06uRW6XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5">THE EXCELLENCY OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2IxWqhTakfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91577" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">3:8</span> Paul speaks of “the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus.” The excellency of the knowledge of Christ does not refer to Christ’s knowledge; it refers to our knowledge of Christ. It is the knowledge by which we know what kind of Christ He is. This knowledge has its excellency. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX2zYkhNAtf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> Paul obtained the excellency of the knowledge of Christ through revelation. When he was in Judaism, he was under the law. His vision and his thought were occupied with the law. Paul earnestly sought the knowledge of the law and pursued it. To him, the knowledge of the law was so excellent that he was even willing to sacrifice for it. But one day on the road to Damascus, the Lord opened Paul’s eyes to see <span class="pg" data-page-id="450" id="450">[450]</span> God’s economy concerning Christ. From that time onward Paul turned from the excellency of the knowledge of the law to the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAlkhZXkxYs6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> In the four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians Christ is revealed not only as the all-inclusive One, but also as the all-extensive One. Christ Himself is the breadth, length, height, and depth. As such, His dimensions are immeasurable. Who can measure this height or depth? Peter received the revelation concerning Christ as the Son of the living God for the building up of the church. However, Peter did not see as much concerning Christ as Paul did. The revelation given to Paul issued in an excellent knowledge of the extensiveness of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX2zYkjZotf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> On account of the excellency of this knowledge, Paul was willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them to be refuse. In other words, after seeing the revelation concerning Christ, all other things became refuse, trash, dung. Spontaneously he realized that not only religion was refuse, dog food, but culture was refuse as well. Why did Paul count all things loss? It was because of the excellency of the knowledge of the extensive, all-inclusive Christ. Furthermore, he was willing to count all things loss in order to gain Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAlkhZXm10s6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW">TO GAIN CHRIST AND BE FOUND IN HIM</h2><p data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jF1PBVMTba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv"> To have the revelation concerning Christ does not mean we have already gained Christ. After seeing the revelation, there was the need for Paul to pursue in order to gain Christ. Likewise, we may have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, but Christ may not yet be ours in our experience. Therefore, like Paul, we need to pursue Christ that we may gain Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURAF6LjfonHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91578" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span> Paul speaks of gaining Christ, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91579" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">verse 9</span> he speaks of being found in Him. These are two aspects of one thing. Paul desired to gain Christ and be found in Him. To have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is one thing. However, it is another thing to gain Him and be found in Him. Although I may have seen the revelation concerning the extensiveness and all-inclusiveness of Christ, I <span class="pg" data-page-id="451" id="451">[451]</span> may be found in ethics, culture, or good behavior and not in Christ. If someone visits you at home, will you be found in Christ? You may declare, “Hallelujah, I am in Christ! I have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ.” However, this may be merely a declaration, not a fact of actual experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LJP1yB0sqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91580" data-verses="Philippians 2:14">2:14</span> Paul says, “Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.” Instead of being found in Christ, we may be found in our murmurings and reasonings. For example, a wife may murmur to her husband, and he may react by reasoning. In such a case, neither the wife nor the husband is found in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFrbTPxvtd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> We have spoken a great deal about Christ versus religion, culture, and philosophy. Nevertheless, most of the time we are found in our culture, self-imposed religion, and self-made philosophy. We may make up a certain policy for ourselves to follow in our married life or in the church life. Hence, others may find us not in Christ, but in our self-made policy concerning married life and the church life. This policy may be the source of much of our murmuring, reasoning, and criticizing. We may also use this policy as a yardstick for measuring others. Oh, it is crucial that, having the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we gain Him and be found in Him! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG8M3ElHteYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb">A NECESSARY CONDITION</h2><p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cJA-vaxlhRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> We have pointed out that there is a certain requirement or condition for being found in Christ. This condition is that we do not have our own righteousness which is of the law, but that we have the righteousness which is of God based on faith. It may seem to us at times that we are found in Christ. However, there will be no reality in these times unless we fulfill the condition of having the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ. To repeat, we need to be found in Christ in the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ. The phrase “in the righteousness of God” used in the title of this message points to the fact that this is the condition of being found in Christ in reality. Thus, the crucial aspect of the condition is the righteousness of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="452" id="452">[452]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nfeS1x6W8ZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY">THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD<br/>AND OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvc8YwEzy7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> At this point I would like to present a new definition, or interpretation, of righteousness as found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91581" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">3:9</span>. In this verse righteousness signifies a daily living which is right with God and man. Speaking of his past, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91582" data-verses="Philippians 3:6">3:6</span> that “as to the righteousness which is in the law,” he had become blameless. Before he was transferred into Christ, he was a Pharisee blameless in the law. Paul thought that in his daily living he was right with man and God. Actually he was not right with God at all. The righteousness which signifies a living that is truly right with God and man must be a righteousness which is of God. The expression “righteousness of God” does not simply mean that righteousness belongs to God; it also means that this righteousness is God Himself. For example, the terms life of God, light of God, and love of God do not mean merely that life, light, and love belong to God. The life of God is God Himself. The same is true of the light of God and the love of God. God Himself is light and love. In principle, this is also true of the righteousness of God. Just as the life of God and the light of God are God Himself, so the righteousness of God is God Himself. Therefore, the living which is right with both God and man must be God as our expression in our daily living, God Himself lived out through us. </p>
<p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O0Tx5m8iLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> This becomes more clear when we consider what it means to speak of our own righteousness. Our own righteousness is the expression of ourselves, the expression of “I.” My righteousness is just the living out of me. But the righteousness of God is God lived out from us. It is God becoming our daily living and expression. When we love others, our love is God expressed. Furthermore, our humility is not mere ethical humility; it is a divine humility, God Himself living out of us. If we are to be found in Christ, we must be in such a condition that God is expressed through us and becomes our daily living. </p>

The more we dig into this mine, the more we realize that its riches are inexhaustible. In one verse, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91595" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Philippians 3:10</span>, we see at least four “diamonds.” Here Paul first says “to know Him.” The pronoun “Him” here denotes Christ as the all-inclusive One. Second, this verse speaks of the power of Christ’s resurrection; third, of the fellowship of His sufferings; and fourth, of being conformed to His death. What riches are in this verse! </p>
<p data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nfeS5x7i0ZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91596" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">verse 11</span> Paul goes on to say, “If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.” Here we find another “diamond”—the out-resurrection from among the dead, the outstanding resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvc8UwFX-7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91597" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-16">3:7 through 16</span> Paul uses at least three different Greek words to express the thought of gaining. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91598" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span> he says that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them refuse that he “may gain Christ.” The King James Version renders the Greek here as “may win Christ.” But this does not convey Paul’s meaning. The Greek word means to secure, to obtain, to lay hold of. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91599" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span> Paul uses two other words which mean “obtain” and “lay hold of.” Thus, he speaks of gaining, obtaining, and laying hold of Christ. To lay hold means to grasp or to take possession. Paul’s desire was not only to gain Christ, but also to obtain Him and even lay hold of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O0T95kYKLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91600" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span>, Paul’s desire was to lay hold of that for which he had been laid hold of by Christ Jesus. On <span class="pg" data-page-id="458" id="458">[458]</span> the way to Damascus, Paul inquired of the One who had appeared to him, “Who art thou, Lord?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91601" data-verses="Acts 9:5">Acts 9:5</span>). When the Lord answered, “I am Jesus,” He laid hold of Paul. Now in Philippians Paul can say that he was seeking to lay hold of that for which Christ had laid hold of him. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyE3eC2r8z0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK"> When we were saved, Christ laid hold of us. Perhaps we did not realize this at first. But as all those who have tried to escape His grasp realize, it is impossible to run away from Him. Christ has indeed laid hold of us so that we may now gain Him, obtain Him, and lay hold of Him. </p>

Some readers may think that these expressions are mere repetitions. However, instead of being repetitious, they point to three stages of the securing of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91602" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span> Paul says, “I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ.” This marks the beginning of securing the Lord. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91603" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">verse 10</span> Paul goes on to say, “To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.” Here we have the second stage, the process of obtaining Christ. What we have in this verse is actually the way to obtain Him. Eventually, in the third stage, we lay hold of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91604" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">v. 12</span>). This is the completion of the securing of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexLcrNULozqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v"> We all have experienced the first stage, for we all have gained Christ. When we believed in the Lord and received Him, we gained Him. This was the beginning of our gaining of Christ. Now we need to gain Him continually. To gain Christ continually is to obtain Him. Eventually the completion of this process is that we lay hold of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwE_4ob6syG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91605" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span> that Paul did not regard himself as one who had already obtained.

However, if we would know the power of Christ’s resurrection, we must share in His sufferings and know the fellowship of His sufferings. </p>
<p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWasfglJ-V307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> In a very real sense, Christ’s sufferings have not yet been completed. When some hear this, they may say, “Christ died, was buried, and was resurrected once for all. Now He is on the throne. How can you say that His sufferings have not been completed?” Consider Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91610" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>: “Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.” To be sure, Christ is on the throne, but there is still a lack with respect to His sufferings. As the Head, Christ’s sufferings are complete. But the sufferings of Christ for the Body are not yet finished. Such sufferings are also called “His sufferings.” Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91611" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">Colossians 1:24</span> Paul regarded his own sufferings as the filling up of what is lacking of Christ’s sufferings for His Body. For this reason, Paul indicates in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91612" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Philippians 3:10</span> that we need to share in Christ’s sufferings. The sufferings of Christ for His Body are still going on, and we need to share in them. When Christ was on earth, He suffered. As those who follow Him, we must share in His sufferings for His Body. If we would know Christ by experiencing the power of His resurrection, we must share His sufferings. The process of obtaining Christ is related to His resurrection, His sufferings, and His death. To know Him we must share His <span class="pg" data-page-id="460" id="460">[460]</span> sufferings and be conformed to His death that we may experience the power of His resurrection. </p>

To gain Christ in this way is not simply to believe in Him or receive Him. It is to count all things as loss, to suffer the loss of all things, and then to count them as refuse. Paul was one who suffered the loss of all things and counted them refuse. He was free from all earthly entanglements. To gain Christ he had given up everything, including religion and culture, and counted it all as refuse, trash, dog food. Therefore, the way was clear for Paul to gain Christ and to be found in Him in order to know Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-iPd0r7MqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI"> The rendering “to know Him” is a literal translation of the Greek. Many versions, however, do not use the infinitive. Instead, they say “that I may know Him,” or “in order that I may know Him.” Nevertheless, according to the Greek, Paul was saying that he wanted to gain Christ and be found in Him to know Him. Like Paul, we need to be free from all earthly entanglements and also count everything as refuse. Then we shall be able to say, “Lord Jesus, I care only for You. I want to gain You, be found in You, and know You.” </p>
<p data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRMRSflYlMnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY"> We have pointed out that the obtaining in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91616" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span> is a continuation of the gaining of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91617" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">verse 8</span>. Paul’s desire was to gain Christ in order to know Him and obtain Him. Paul was seeking to gain Christ that he might obtain Him by knowing Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91632" data-verses="Philippians 3:12">verse 12</span> he goes on to say, “Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.” Here Paul admits that he had not yet attained the out-resurrection, but he continued to pursue that he may lay hold of it. For this out-resurrection, Christ had laid hold of him, and now Paul’s desire was to lay hold of the out-resurrection. The purpose of Christ in laying hold of him was that he might obtain the out-resurrection. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91633" data-verses="Philippians 3:11-12">verses 11 and 12</span> the out-resurrection is Paul’s goal, the object of his pursuit. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8Jk-KbUwLEB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91634" data-verses="Philippians 3:13-14">verses 13 and 14</span> Paul continues, “Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing—forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” Here we see that Paul did not reckon himself to have laid hold of the out-resurrection already. However, he pursued toward the goal, the goal of the out-resurrection, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGwoMpx1QkIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r">THE GOAL AND THE PRIZE</h2><p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVxcKPl_HBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> There is a difference between the goal and the prize. Paul pursued toward the goal for the prize of God’s high calling. Every calling has a purpose with a goal. What are the <span class="pg" data-page-id="466" id="466">[466]</span> purpose and goal of God’s high calling? The expression “high calling” used here does not mean that the calling is high; it means that this calling is from above, that is, from the heavens. Literally translated, the Greek means “the above calling.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91635" data-verses="Hebrews 3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span> Paul uses the term “heavenly calling.” The out-resurrection is both the purpose and the goal of God’s heavenly calling. Therefore, if we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91636" data-verses="Philippians 3:10-14">3:10-14</span> carefully, we shall realize that the out-resurrection is Paul’s subject. </p>
<p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz2AFZ6fAKQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> The term “out-resurrection” is found in the Bible only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91637" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">3:11</span>. According to my knowledge, most translations ignore the Greek prefix <em>ek,</em> which means “out.” Here Paul adds this prefix to the usual Greek word for resurrection. What was his reason for doing this? According to his vision and experience, Paul realized that God’s intention in the universe is altogether related to something which is new, something in resurrection, but resurrection in a very particular sense, not resurrection in an ordinary sense. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nfeS9x6WcZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY">OUT OF THE OLD CREATION<br/>AND INTO THE NEW CREATION</h2><p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvc8QwEzS7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> The common meaning of resurrection is that something dies and comes to life again. Lazarus was resurrected in this way. He had died, had been buried, and had even begun to smell bad. Then the Lord Jesus came and cried out, “Lazarus, come forth!” and Lazarus came out of the tomb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91638" data-verses="John 11:43-44">John 11:43-44</span>). Was the resurrection of Lazarus a case of the out-resurrection? No. Even though Lazarus was raised from the dead and came to life again, nothing of the new creation was wrought into him. Instead, he continued to be a person in the old creation. At most, Lazarus experienced restoration; he was restored from death to the natural life. But he was neither regenerated at that time nor did he receive a new constitution. Have you ever heard a message telling you that the resurrection of Lazarus was still in the realm of the old creation and that Lazarus was not resurrected into the new creation? The fact that Lazarus was not brought into the new creation through resurrection is proved in that one day he died again and his once-resurrected body was laid once more in a tomb. <span class="pg" data-page-id="467" id="467">[467]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O0T55mMqLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> The out-resurrection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91639" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">3:11</span> is very different from the resurrection of Lazarus. Did Paul expect to return to the tomb once he obtained the out-resurrection? Certainly not! The resurrection Paul was pursuing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91640" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> was something absolutely apart from the old creation and in the new creation. What Paul terms the out-resurrection refers to a resurrection out of the old creation and into the new creation. </p>

In these verses Paul says, “To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91643" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">verse 10</span> we see that Paul aspired to know Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death. He wanted to know Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ. Paul’s goal is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91644" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">verse 11</span>—attaining to the out-resurrection. In fact, this is the goal not only of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91645" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">verse 10</span>, but also of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91646" data-verses="Philippians 3:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span>. Paul counted all things refuse in order to gain Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91647" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">v. 8</span>) and be found in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91648" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">v. 9</span>), to know Christ, the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, that he might attain to the out-resurrection. According to grammar, this is the proper interpretation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91649" data-verses="Philippians 3:8-11">verses 8 through 11</span>. Paul’s goal was to attain to the out-resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV39rI3jptIiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> In this message we need to consider how to attain this goal of the out-resurrection.

He put on a body of blood and flesh. Did this body belong to the old creation or the new creation? Blood and flesh are part of <span class="pg" data-page-id="468" id="468">[468]</span> the old creation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91650" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:50">First Corinthians 15:50</span> says that “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.” This includes the flesh and blood of the Lord Jesus. The principle here is that nothing which belongs to the old creation has anything to do with the kingdom of God. Therefore, the body taken on by the Lord Jesus belonged to the old creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGNAhuJHFRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> During His years on earth, the Lord Jesus lived a human life. Was the Lord’s human living part of the old creation or of the new creation? Although the Lord Jesus had a body of flesh and blood belonging to the old creation and although He lived in the environment of the old creation, the life He lived did not belong to the old creation. On the contrary, the life lived by the Lord Jesus belonged wholly to the new creation. But how could He, a person with a body belonging to the old creation and dwelling in the environment of the old creation, live a life that belonged to the new creation? He could do this by continually dying to His old creation body and environment and living to God. This was the way He lived a life belonging entirely to the new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP_pUQ5Vv3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> We should not think that the Lord Jesus died only when He was crucified. No, He began to die, to live a crucified life, as soon as He was born. The Lord surely lived a human life, but it was a crucified life. By living a crucified life He died to the old creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8Jk-KbV0jEB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> The Lord’s living of a crucified life is illustrated by an incident which took place when He was twelve years of age. When His mother and father found Him after spending days looking for Him, His mother said, “Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91651" data-verses="Luke 2:48">Luke 2:48</span>). The Lord Jesus replied, “How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91652" data-verses="Luke 2:49">v. 49</span>). Here we see that even at the age of twelve the Lord was living a crucified life. Through His mother, Mary, He had received the life of the old creation. But instead of living according to this old creation life, He died to it and lived according to another life, according to the life of His Father. <span class="pg" data-page-id="469" id="469">[469]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgxc-RIoZ6q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> This message will focus on two words found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91664" data-verses="Philippians 3:14">3:14</span>—<em>goal</em> and <em>prize.</em> If we reach the goal, we shall receive the prize. Thus, pursuing toward the goal is for obtaining the prize. But what is the goal, and what is the prize? Many would answer that both the goal and the prize are Christ. Although such an answer may be regarded as correct, in this message we need to see from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91665" data-verses="Philippians 3:10-14">3:10-14</span> something particular concerning the goal and the prize. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s93WecR6xINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91666" data-verses="Philippians 3:10-13">Philippians 3:10-13</span> helps us understand the goal and the prize in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91667" data-verses="Philippians 3:14">verse 14</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91668" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">verse 11</span> we may say that the out-resurrection is actually a synonym for Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91669" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">verse 10</span> Paul speaks of knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings. This verse indicates clearly that if we would know Christ, we must know His resurrection. However, many Christians neglect this important matter. At most, they know only Christ and His death, not the power of His resurrection. Among Christians today rarely is there a proper and adequate message on the power of Christ. Few preachers speak of the power of Christ’s resurrection in the way Paul spoke. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllYVbLIw1NlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> We have pointed out that Paul’s desire was to gain Christ and be found in Him, to know Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings. Knowing Christ in this way is the result of gaining Him and being found in Him. The thought here is so deep that few Christians have given it the attention it deserves. Our natural mind cannot touch the depths of what it means “to know Him and the power of His resurrection.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="474" id="474">[474]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82i9qm-APQAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> At this juncture we need to ask an important question: Where is Jesus Christ today? In this message I would answer by saying that Christ is in resurrection. No doubt, on the one hand, Christ is in the heavens and, on the other hand, He is in us. However, I want to emphasize the marvelous fact that Christ today is in resurrection. One day, as the One who existed in eternity, Christ became a man by incarnation. Eventually, He was crucified and buried. Through death He entered into another realm, the realm of resurrection. In His preexistence, Christ was God and was with God in eternity; by incarnation He became a man in the flesh; and then, through crucifixion and burial, He entered into resurrection. Have you ever heard that Christ is now in resurrection? On the day of His resurrection angels told the women that Christ could not be found in the tomb, for He had risen from the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91670" data-verses="Luke 24:1-6">Luke 24:1-6</span>). This indicates that Christ is in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT9UeQl6A-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> Because Christ is now in resurrection, we cannot know Him experientially unless we know the power of His resurrection. Today some Christians know Christ in His incarnation and crucifixion. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91671" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> Paul aspires to know Him not only in His death, but even the more in His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="nHBw_AdnQIfkqKVM8Tgl0tVT-ZEJ7CZbTRLJRhNrPdZcnD6qmiGxxSQio_uvcr2U-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91672" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">verse 11</span>, a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91673" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">verse 10</span>, Paul says, “If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.” The expression “the out-resurrection” is puzzling. After Christ was resurrected, He became a person wholly in resurrection. Furthermore, the resurrection wherein Christ is today is not an ordinary resurrection, like the resurrection of Lazarus; it is an extraordinary resurrection. For this reason, Paul adds the prefix <em>ex</em> to the Greek word for resurrection to show that Christ’s resurrection is extraordinary. His resurrection is the out-resurrection. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wFKX0prsWrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J">A DEFINITION OF OUT-RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-iPF0rLEqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI"> To be in the out-resurrection means to leave everything of the old creation and to be brought into God. Although Lazarus was resurrected, he neither left the things of the old creation <span class="pg" data-page-id="475" id="475">[475]</span> nor was he brought into God. At the end of the coming age all the dead unbelievers will be resurrected. Nevertheless, that resurrection will not bring them out of the old creation, and it will not bring them into God. There is only one kind of resurrection which brings us out of the old creation and into God, and this is the resurrection of Christ. Thus, Christ’s resurrection is the outstanding resurrection. Christ is the unique One to pass out of the old creation and to enter into God. In the foregoing message we pointed out that Christ lived in an old creation body and environment for thirty-three and a half years. Through His death and resurrection He left the old creation behind and was brought into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRMRKflotMnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY"> We should not think that Christ was never in the old creation. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91674" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> Christ was the Firstborn of God’s creation. His physical body belonged to the old creation and, living in a carpenter’s home in Nazareth, He lived in the environment of the old creation. Eventually, He took the old creation upon Himself as a burden and nailed it to the cross. Now in resurrection Christ is absolutely out of the old creation and in God. All He is, all He has, and all He does are in God. This is the significance of the out-resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvkHcg_8MXkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR"> If we would know Christ, we must know this out-resurrection and attain to it. Paul’s words “attain to the out-resurrection” imply a goal. This goal, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91675" data-verses="Philippians 3:14">verse 14</span>, is the out-resurrection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91676" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">verse 11</span>. Hence, to attain to the out-resurrection is to arrive at the goal. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91677" data-verses="Philippians 3:12-13">verses 12 and 13</span> Paul confessed that he did not reckon himself as one who had attained to this goal. But forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things before, he pursued toward the goal of the out-resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="LY3b3GAWOFJOmvN2cbErBRxwrBzNnQOHD62ke0j8mOyinQzXo2YxW2fi2ufAiHKu1"> In a previous message I said that the goal is Christ Himself, and now I am saying that the goal is the out-resurrection. To say that Christ is the goal is to speak in a general way according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91678" data-verses="Philippians 3:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span>. But to speak in a specific way, the goal is the out-resurrection. If we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91679" data-verses="Philippians 3:14">verse 14</span> in relation to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91680" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">verse 11</span>, we shall see that the goal must be the out-resurrection. Therefore, in general the goal is Christ, but in particular the goal is the out-resurrection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="476" id="476">[476]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="mIS7O7a-NT_KDOKl-0XRFQVGIjBXbbtK_H0Cio96dDINunJF9QeGmdjRtCHl84RqP"> Now we need to ask an important question: Can we reach the goal of the out-resurrection in this age, or can we only run the race and hope to reach the goal in the coming age? Some may think that we must wait until the coming age to reach the goal. But if we do not arrive at the goal in this age, we shall not attain to it in the next age. We must endeavor to arrive at the goal during our lifetime. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfoDUS_YL2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91681" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">1:21</span> Paul says, “To me to live is Christ.” This Christ was his goal. Hence, for Paul to live was the goal—Christ as the out-resurrection. Furthermore, for us to live should also be the out-resurrection, for the very Christ whom we should live is Himself the out-resurrection. This means that day by day we should live the out-resurrection. For example, suppose a certain brother loves his wife very much. He needs to ask himself whether this love is natural or in resurrection. Even non-Christian husbands may love their wives in a natural way. If a brother loves his wife in resurrection, his love will be out of the old creation and in God. This shows that to live Christ is to live the out-resurrection, to live a life absolutely out of the old creation and in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUlxXWqZn3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3"> When I was young I wondered why it seemed difficult for Paul to reach the goal. I thought that the persecutions he suffered made this difficult. It seemed to me opposition from others hindered him in running the Christian race. Years later, through experience I came to see that it is easier for me to overcome persecutions than to love my wife in the out-resurrection and not according to the natural life. I have been in Christ for more than fifty years. During all this time I have been a zealous Christian. Having encountered many hindrances in the Christian race, I have learned that the greatest hindrance is the natural life with its thoughts and habits. The natural life frustrates in running the race toward the goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="F0dlBCvTMMHz8TZjDG814kTWLx9grG2lp97z5APngXAwWFiOr0CkhKKWbXwwhx9XD"> Have you ever asked yourself how much of your daily conversation is natural and how much is in the out-resurrection? Although you may not speak in an evil, slanderous way, your talk may be natural. You may speak many positive things, but your words may be spoken in a natural way, not in <span class="pg" data-page-id="477" id="477">[477]</span> resurrection. It is easy to improve our character, behavior, ethics, or morality, but it is extremely difficult to live in resurrection. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VkhYpqEszEkohI0F6R0N83nexLc3NV_IzqVhAyCL7Fhp8TfRs7fBRyk_6r_P86A2v">A MIND TO PURSUE THE OUT-RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwE_koaeIyG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91697" data-verses="Philippians 3:15">verse 15</span> Paul says, as a word of conclusion to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91698" data-verses="Philippians 3:1-14">3:1-14</span>, “Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you.” What does Paul mean by “this mind”? To answer this question we need to consider Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91699" data-verses="Philippians 3:13">verses 13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91700" data-verses="Philippians 3:14">14</span>: “Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing—forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” What Paul means by “this mind” is to have a mind to forget the things behind and to stretch forward to the things before in order to pursue toward the goal for the prize. </p>
<p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOwTMFnzOf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> We have pointed out that the goal is to live, walk, and have our being absolutely out of the old creation and in God. This is the goal of the out-resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91701" data-verses="Philippians 3:11">v. 11</span>). To pursue toward the goal of the out-resurrection is to pursue a life which is out of the old creation and wholly in God. This out-resurrection is actually Christ Himself in resurrection. We may also say that in His Person Christ portrays the out-resurrection. Before the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, there was no such portrait, for there was not yet such a thing as the out-resurrection. Before Christ’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="482" id="482">[482]</span> incarnation, God had not been joined to His creation. But one day the Son of God came into the old creation. When He was crucified, He brought the entire old creation to the cross and nailed it there. Hence, through crucifixion, Christ terminated the old creation. Furthermore, when He was buried, He brought the old creation, which was symbolized by the graveclothes, with Him into the tomb. When He was resurrected, He left the graveclothes behind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91702" data-verses="John 20:6-7">John 20:6-7</span>). This indicates that the old creation was left in the tomb. When Christ came forth in resurrection, He was a Person absolutely out of the old creation and in God. This is the meaning of the expression “the out-resurrection.” Christ attained to this out-resurrection through crucifixion and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrOqPLvbuSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> According to the New Testament, we should not separate the out-resurrection from the Person of Christ, for Christ Himself is actually the out-resurrection. This means that when we received the Lord Jesus, we also received the out-resurrection. However, throughout the centuries, from the first century until the present, this matter has not been proclaimed adequately. How we thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has opened our eyes to see what is the out-resurrection from among the dead! </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGNA5uJHlRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> Having “this mind” is related to pursuing the out-resurrection. To have this mind is to have the understanding and realization that, as those who have been chosen, redeemed, and regenerated by God, we must pursue one thing—to have our living out of the old creation and in God. This means that our whole life should be in the out-resurrection. We have seen that this out-resurrection is actually the dear, precious, excellent Person of Christ, the very One who, through crucifixion and resurrection, has passed out of the old creation and has entered into God. This wonderful One is far more excellent than the angels. Angels still belong to the old creation. They have not experienced crucifixion or resurrection. But after Christ was crucified and buried, He was resurrected out of the old creation and into God. Have you ever heard such a description <span class="pg" data-page-id="483" id="483">[483]</span> of the Lord Jesus? Hallelujah, Christ Himself is the reality of the out-resurrection! Now we must pursue a life which is this wonderful Person of Christ. With Paul we should be able to say, “To me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91703" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">1:21</span>). Paul could also testify that he had been crucified with Christ and that Christ lived in him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91704" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). The very Christ who lived in Paul is the One who, in His own Person, is the out-resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP_pMQ5VP3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> As long as we have our living in the old creation, we do not live Christ, even if the things we do are very good. Suppose someone lives according to an ethical standard higher than that of Confucius. Nevertheless, such a living is not Christ; it is merely an ethical living, the living of ethics in the old creation. We must seek not only to overcome sins, but also to overcome the best aspects of the old creation, including the ethics of the old creation. We need to pursue toward the goal—the goal of the out-resurrection, which is our dear and excellent Christ Himself. What a blessing it is to see this! How blessed we would be in our family life if we pursued a life which is out of the old creation and in God. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8Jk-SbVErEB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> We all need to have “this mind,” a mind to pursue Christ as the out-resurrection. For a young person to pursue this goal is not merely to improve his behavior or character or to become a better student. It is to live a life which is actually Christ Himself in resurrection. This is a life which is fully out of the old creation and in God. May we all have this unique mind. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGwoUpwR0kIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r">NOT OTHERWISE MINDED</h2><p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVxcSPnr_BvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91705" data-verses="Philippians 3:15">verse 15</span> Paul says that if in anything we are otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to us. Being “otherwise minded” is common among Christians today. Christians have hundreds of different ways of thinking, understanding, and realizing matters. Oh, how many minds there are among believers! But Paul encourages us to have one mind, “this mind.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="484" id="484">[484]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz2AdZ4b8KQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> Sometimes when I was preaching the gospel in China, others accused me of narrow-mindedness. They advised me not to say that Christ alone is the Savior. They claimed that it is too narrow-minded to preach that Jesus Christ is the unique Savior of mankind. I told them that, concerning Christ, I was not yet narrow-minded enough, that I needed to be narrowed down to nothing other than Christ Himself. Christians also have exhorted me not to be narrow-minded. In particular, they urged me not to say that the way we follow in the Lord’s recovery is the right way. I replied, “If this way is not right, I cannot follow it. But if it is the right way, I must both take it myself and encourage others to do so. Otherwise, I shall first cheat myself and then cheat other believers. You consider yourselves to be broad-minded. But actually you are cheating yourselves and others. You do not know the right way and you are not on it.” Concerning spiritual matters, God condemns man’s broad-mindedness. The Lord Jesus said that the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads unto life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91706" data-verses="Matthew 7:14">Matt. 7:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7DZ4N4N-r0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt"> According to the Bible, we have one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one church. The emphasis in the Word is on oneness. There is one Creator and one Savior, and it is utterly devilish to teach otherwise. </p>
<p data-content-id="3ZclQLu0tUjspzezVCoA71hxKIgVLFJym4vZI-cAvVVFEIMufWJ4cL5V8X0JClRwO"> The fact that Paul says that if we are otherwise minded, “this also God shall reveal” indicates that to be otherwise minded is to be lacking in revelation. If we are otherwise minded, we need revelation. For this reason, Paul does not say in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91707" data-verses="Philippians 3:15">verse 15</span> that God will teach us; instead, he says that God will reveal this to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAVY1vdXNIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> Believers cannot have one mind simply by reading the Bible in letters. When the Lord Jesus came, the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament had already been written. But even though the religionists searched the Scriptures, they were not willing to come to Christ that they might have life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91708" data-verses="John 5:39-40">John 5:39 and 40</span> the Lord Jesus said, “You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life, and it is these that testify concerning Me; and you are not <span class="pg" data-page-id="485" id="485">[485]</span> willing to come to Me that you may have life.” If we search the Scriptures without coming to the Lord, we shall have many different minds. Some may prefer Moses and others, Elijah or Jeremiah. Only when we come to Christ, the unique One, can we have one mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY25jqSRoHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> After His resurrection, the Lord said to His disciples, “These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91709" data-verses="Luke 24:44">Luke 24:44</span>). This indicates that in the Scriptures we need to see Christ. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91721" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapter one</span> he speaks of living Christ and magnifying Him; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91722" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span>, of taking Christ as our pattern, of shining as lights in the world, and of holding forth the word of life; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91723" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span>, of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and of pursuing toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91724" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul uses expressions that apparently are quite ordinary: “Rejoice in the Lord”; “Let your forbearance be known to all men”; and “In nothing be anxious.” Suppose as you are pursuing toward the goal for the prize someone suddenly encouraged you not to be anxious. Would you not consider this an interruption and say, “I am pursuing Christ. I want to arrive at the goal of the out-resurrection. Why do you talk to me about anxiety?” Many readers of Philippians treasure the first three chapters, but, perhaps unconsciously, they may consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91725" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> to be on a lower level than <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91726" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapters one through three</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="LY3b3GAWOFJOmvN2cbErBRxwrBzFnRq7D62ke0j8mOyinQzXo2YxW2fi2ufAiHKu1"> Years ago I appreciated the first three chapters of Philippians much more than I appreciated <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91727" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span>. It seemed to me that after ascending a high peak in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91728" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapters one</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91729" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">two</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91730" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">three</span>, Paul suddenly came down to a lower level in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91731" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span>. I could not understand why there was such a sudden change in Paul’s writing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="490" id="490">[490]</span> </p>

Paul had learned the secret of being able to do all things in the One who empowered him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91734" data-verses="Philippians 4:4">verse 4</span> he exhorts us to rejoice in the Lord always. We may think that it is easy to rejoice in the Lord. Actually, rejoicing in Him requires the out-resurrection. In order to rejoice in the Lord we need to be in Him as the One who empowers us. Thus, even the apparently simple matter of rejoicing in the Lord requires that we learn the secret. If we do not know the secret, we shall not be able to rejoice. </p>
<p data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUlxfWqZH3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91735" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> Paul says, “Let your forbearance be known to all men.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91736" data-verses="2Corinthians 10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span> he says, “I beseech you through the meekness and forbearance of Christ” (lit.). The forbearance mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91737" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> is not an ordinary forbearance or an ethical forbearance. It is the forbearance of Christ, a spiritual attribute or a virtue of Christ. This forbearance must become our forbearance, and then we should make our forbearance, the forbearance of Christ, known to all men. </p>
<p data-content-id="F0dlBCvTMMHz8TZjDG814kTWLx9orG2Fp97z5APngXAwWFiOr0CkhKKWbXwwhx9XD"> What is the meaning of forbearance, and why does Paul mention forbearance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91738" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> instead of some other virtue? If Paul had told us to let our love or kindness be made known to all men, this verse would not be a problem to us. But here Paul does not speak of love, kindness, humility, or some other human virtue. Instead, he singles out forbearance. We know what love, kindness, and humility are, but who can give an adequate definition of forbearance? If I had been asked years ago to define forbearance, I would have said that to forbear means to carry a heavy burden for a long period of time. However, this definition is natural. It does not help us to understand why Paul speaks of forbearance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91739" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> instead of some other virtue. </p>
<p data-content-id="CAN6o0k4ZK4wbCUGR_Vjs0Ec68q3yQIm6bi8inm71-o9jsQfmolIoHnVNoOiMyBxz"> After telling us to let our forbearance be known to all men, Paul goes on to say, also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91740" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">verse 5</span>, “The Lord is near.” Many expositors think that this means that the coming of the Lord is at hand. I dare not say that this meaning is not included; however, here Paul does not say that the Lord is <span class="pg" data-page-id="491" id="491">[491]</span> coming soon, but that He is near already. Then in the next verse Paul tells us not to be anxious in anything, but “in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving” to make our requests known to God. In the midst of making our forbearance known to all men, in not being anxious in anything, but in everything making our requests known to God, Paul declares that the Lord is near. </p>
<p data-content-id="PlrvbBpD2zxx_8-X698IQTc85S3iKgOnF52HYJhkJHFcO4Qc_4xEevBqOsx5k1dpA"> In ourselves, we are not able to make our forbearance known to all men, to be free from anxiety, or even to make our requests known to God. Some may think that it is easy to pray; actually, prayer is a difficult thing. In order to do all these things we, like Paul, must learn the secret. We also need to be in the One who empowers us. </p>

What he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91745" data-verses="Philippians 4:1-7">4:1-7</span> is based on what he has previously written about living Christ, magnifying Christ, taking Christ as our pattern, knowing the excellency of Christ, pursuing toward the goal, and living in the out-resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X9MLcHXaIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91746" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">4:1</span> he says, “So then, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, beloved.” We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91747" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span> that Paul aspired to be found in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91748" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">4:1</span> he tells us to stand firm in the Lord. Standing firm in the Lord is the key to letting our forbearance be known to all men. If we do not stand firm in the Lord, there is no way to make our forbearance known. In order to do anything we must have a proper standing. This is true of making known our forbearance. For this, we must stand firm in the Lord; that is, we must remain in Him. Hence, Paul’s word about standing firm in the Lord is equal to the Lord’s word about abiding in Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91749" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCWcz91w516P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91750" data-verses="Philippians 4:2">verse 2</span> Paul goes on to say, “I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord.” As those who stand firm in the Lord, we should also “think the same thing in the Lord.” Apart from the Lord, we cannot <span class="pg" data-page-id="492" id="492">[492]</span> think the same thing. If we would think the same thing in the Lord, we must first stand firm in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExW1E-oYe6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91751" data-verses="Philippians 4:3">Verse 3</span> continues, “Yes, I ask you also, genuine yokefellow, assist them, who contended with me in the gospel, with both Clement and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.” Here Paul is asking those who were genuine yokefellows to help Euodias and Syntyche to think the same thing. Paul seems to be saying, “These two sisters are my co-workers, but at least temporarily they are not in the Lord. I encourage you, genuine yokefellow, to do your best to bring them back to the Lord and help them to think the same thing in the Lord.” These sisters were co-workers who had labored with Paul and contended with him in the gospel and whose names were in the book of life. Nevertheless, for the time being they were not in the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadOat_JPKoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91752" data-verses="Philippians 4:4">verse 4</span> Paul says, “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.” When in our experience we are not in the Lord, we do not have any joy and we cannot rejoice. Formerly Euodias and Syntyche could rejoice, but now, because they are not in the Lord, they cannot rejoice in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78QOo6vV-6XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5"> There is a practical way by which we can know whether or not we are in the Lord. As long as you are not one with a certain brother or sister in the church, you are not in the Lord. Of course, as far as position is concerned, you are in Christ eternally. Nothing can affect our position in Christ. But practically and experientially we may not remain in Him. The fact that we are not one with a particular saint proves that we are not in the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2IxW2hSOIfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> It is very serious not to be one with even one brother or sister. Most of the saints have at least one other saint with whom they are not one. For example, suppose some sisters are serving together at a love feast. One sister may not like the way another sister is serving and she may refuse to serve with her. She may even walk away from this sister. By walking away from the sister, she actually walks out of the Lord. Instead of refusing to serve with the sister, she should make her forbearance known in that situation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="493" id="493">[493]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="vU-7UIiLi3WUZtkXsshxW836X9MPcGjqIWoXzhO1TGTnXlDOH47_mKx6Z7dUicue_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91767" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> Paul says, “Let your forbearance be known to all men.” Although we are familiar with the word <em>forbearance,</em> it is not easy for us to define it adequately. Many would say that forbearance is patience. However, this term is used at the end of a book which emphasizes the experience of Christ. Philippians is not primarily concerned with morality, behavior, character, or ethics. The subject of this Epistle is the experience of Christ. All four chapters of this book are related to the experience of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WoMKcGTFU97IHzLTs2f9xRXeCWc390UN16P3AheJf1GWOk4r8GCAoxLYqEt7KrC4v">MAKING CHRIST KNOWN</h2><p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExW1A-qMW6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> As we read the first several verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91768" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span>, we may not have the impression that these verses still have the experience of Christ as their subject. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91769" data-verses="Philippians 4:13">verse 13</span> says, “I can do all things in Him who empowers me.” “All things” must include the exercise of forbearance spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91770" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">verse 5</span>. Paul charged the saints to have forbearance. Certainly he himself lived a life of forbearance. Otherwise, he would have been hypocritical in exhorting others to make their forbearance known when he himself did not practice forbearance. Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91771" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> must be based on his own living, experience, and practice. Thus, forbearance must be an experience of Christ. Furthermore, the fact that Paul says that he can do all things in Him who empowers him is an indication that forbearance is Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadOap_LLGoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91772" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">1:20 and 21</span> Paul speaks of magnifying Christ and of living Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91773" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span> he presents Christ as our unique pattern and then speaks of holding forth the word of life. Holding forth the word of life is equal to expressing Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91774" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span> we see that Christ should be our goal and prize. We need to pursue toward the goal for the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91775" data-verses="Philippians 3:14">3:14</span>). Whether we are young or old, we all should pursue Christ. This was Paul’s concept when he said in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91776" data-verses="Philippians 3:16">3:16</span>, “Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.” We all should live Christ, magnify Christ, express Christ, and pursue Christ. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91777" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul speaks of standing firm in the Lord, rejoicing in Him, and letting our forbearance be known to all men. If we have a proper understanding of the subject of Philippians, realizing that this book is focused on the experience of Christ, we shall see that to make our forbearance known is actually to make Christ known. I believe that this was Paul’s thought. </p>
<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAVY9vdXtIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> The best way to understand the Bible is to get into the thought of the writer and grasp the major points according to which he wrote a particular book. No doubt, by considering the four chapters of Philippians, we shall see that Paul’s basic thought in this Epistle is that Christ was his living, pattern, goal with the prize, and power. In this book Paul is saying that we need to live Christ, take Christ as our pattern, pursue Christ as our goal, and experience Christ as our power. All this should result in a certain kind of living, a living which expresses Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY25rqSRIHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu">AN EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG60QQaLyxa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj"> What word would you use to describe a life that expresses Christ? Would you describe it as loving, submissive, patient, humble, kind? None of these words is adequate. Yes, a life that expresses Christ certainly is loving, submissive, patient, humble, and kind; however, it includes much more than this. It is significant that Paul does not use any of these terms in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91778" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span>. Instead, he uses the word <em>forbearance.</em> He does <span class="pg" data-page-id="501" id="501">[501]</span> not tell us to make our love or patience known, but to make our forbearance known. </p>
<p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgxcyRJs96q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91779" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> why does Paul tell us to make our forbearance known to all men? Why does he not speak of some other virtue, such as holiness or righteousness? What word would you have used if you were writing this Epistle? Perhaps some would use <em>faithfulness, obedience,</em> or <em>oneness.</em> But none of these words seems to fit. It does not seem adequate to say, “Let your faithfulness be made known,” or, “Let your oneness be made known.” Try as we may, we cannot find an adequate replacement for the word <em>forbearance.</em> Even though we cannot fully define forbearance or explain what it is, we sense as we read this verse that forbearance is the only word which is fitting in this verse. </p>
<p data-content-id="Dv6XOXVBqDX9q4gUmoDFzL4s93WScQOJINjMf8nSEH3gJvAtcDaXCBHpdovxnNHAJ"> When Paul says that we should make our forbearance known to all men, he indicates the fullness of our forbearance. A forbearance which can be made known to all is not a limited or partial forbearance; it is the fullness of forbearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="Sldoo9aLW5-tS6iNQj44DgSllYVXLJUJNlM-Th5QXBtFM0D3A2vv22d7U_c-IuVUt"> If we would understand the meaning of forbearance, we should not turn to books of philosophy or ethics. Instead, we need to turn to the Bible and seek to learn from the Scriptures the significance of forbearance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91780" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span>. As we have seen, this must be an expression of Christ. First Paul charges us to make our forbearance known to all men. Realizing that we are not able to do this, he goes on to say, “I can do all things in the One who empowers me.” This indicates that forbearance is at least part of the expression of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="g6T2l3U0pztlDDbYL-dc7ql82i9mm8U_QAPYSOuWik1W4uvZli6aRorhlTRuFWyV8"> That forbearance is related to the expression of Christ becomes even more clear when we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91781" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> in the context of the whole book of Philippians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91782" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">1:20 and 21</span> Paul speaks of magnifying Christ and living Him. Certainly making our forbearance known must involve living Christ and magnifying Him. This means that our forbearance must be the very Christ we live and magnify. We should not separate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91783" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> from the rest of the book. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91784" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapter one</span> Paul speaks of magnifying Christ and then, toward the end of the book, of making our forbearance known. The forbearance we make known must be the very Christ we magnify. <span class="pg" data-page-id="502" id="502">[502]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="eYgzT4LJTKah1iURLgI5lvtFT9USQn-0-J95RWvjQdmTq_bdHJSUzPieo_-I4eDcK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91785" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span> Paul presents Christ as our unique pattern. Certainly, forbearance must be related to Christ as our pattern. This means that forbearance must involve the experience and the expression of Christ as the pattern revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91786" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="5u2WHJMg8cCdQSeCiCm4mlhuX68e_fTbnzU_sIxl-eF8Ot1Ktq1IJkQJWLDNwaG_v"> As we have pointed out, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91787" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span> we have Christ as our goal. With Paul, we must pursue toward this goal. Christ as the goal toward which we pursue must include forbearance. Otherwise, how could Paul encourage us to pursue Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91788" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span> and then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91789" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> charge us to make something other than Christ known to all men? That would not be logical. For Paul to be consistent, what he charges us to make known in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91790" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> must be the very goal toward which he encourages us to pursue in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91791" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span>. Since Paul encourages us to pursue Christ, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91792" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> he must not be telling us to make something other than Christ known to all men. Since Paul speaks so much of Christ in the first three chapters of the book, what he says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91793" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> must also be related to Christ. Therefore, we believe that the forbearance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91794" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> is Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="NVB_sDYereKCvCkeM7-afjvO41LFLy4J6Xl4vknSWhrC3jk_-49HhtS1YCqV0mHRz"> If the word <em>forbearance</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91795" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> can be replaced by any other word, it must be the word <em>Christ.</em> Instead of saying, “Let your forbearance be made known,” we can say, “Let your Christ be made known.” This means to let the Christ whom we live and magnify, whom we take as our pattern and pursue as our goal, be made known to all men. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSFj4ImZJ8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ">MAKING OUR FORBEARANCE KNOWN</h2><p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfymttPB2D9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> Forbearance is Christ as our living. The Christ whom we live becomes the forbearance we exercise and make known. If we see this, we shall realize that forbearance is a matter of great significance. It is by no means an isolated virtue in the Christian life. On the contrary, forbearance is actually a synonym for Christ in our Christian living. On the one hand, we may say that our Christian life is Christ. On the other hand, we may say that the Christian life is a life of forbearance. To make our forbearance known, therefore, means to make our Christ known. <span class="pg" data-page-id="503" id="503">[503]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuPJ6ojBhpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> If we do not make known our forbearance, we shall have Christ only in doctrine or terminology, but we shall not have Christ in our experience. Young people, your parents may know that Christ is in you. However, you need to let Christ be made known to your parents by making your forbearance known to them. To all those whom we contact day by day we need to let our Christ be made known. This is to let our forbearance be known to all men. </p>

<p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LJPRyAAUqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> The Greek word for “forbearance” is composed of two words. The first is the preposition <em>epi</em> which, when added to another word, can have the meaning of extensive or full. This word is a component of the Greek word for “full knowledge” used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91814" data-verses="2Timothy 2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>. The second Greek word has various meanings: “reasonable, considerate, and suitable.” Thus, the meaning of the Greek is “extensively reasonable or fully reasonable.” </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFrb3PwLRd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn">AN ALL-INCLUSIVE VIRTUE</h2><p data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG8MTEnTdeYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb"> Based on the analysis of the Greek word, our spiritual experience, God’s activities in His economy, and the Lord’s living on earth, we can realize that to have adequate forbearance requires that we also have many other virtues. Forbearance is an all-inclusive virtue. </p>
<p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cJAavY1RhRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> Of the many human virtues, Paul chose to speak of forbearance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91815" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span>. As we shall see, this particular virtue is related to other important matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91816" data-verses="Philippians 3:1-2">Philippians 3 and 4</span>. For example, it is related to being able to do all things in Christ and also to learning the secret of contentment in all circumstances. Furthermore, in order to have forbearance we must be qualified according to what is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91817" data-verses="Philippians 3:15-16">3:15 and 16</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="2U562Q6El7hDktM4AnimPO2ExW18-oY-6j0n3gYJYxZ6VJaRl-ip_BYPBuPW0Mx2q"> Forbearance means to be fully reasonable, considerate, and suitable. This requires a genuine understanding of the situation at hand. Suppose two students are arguing about a <span class="pg" data-page-id="508" id="508">[508]</span> problem in mathematics. Unable to settle their argument, they bring the problem to you. But if you are ignorant of mathematics, it will not be possible for you to give them a fair and reasonable judgment. Even if you have the necessary understanding, you may lack wisdom to deal with the people involved. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ugtQBFtwwYxypLwrzzf-3bSadOaV_JPqoQW0c1HWWt8kcZ6HRTsPe8sJthbSphUdc">THE NEED OF FORBEARANCE<br/>IN OUR FAMILY LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="fs-YnYXY3XTOZTCDFYnOTvJ78QOQ6vl26XezaVbCauc0dBc5MeDvjfr81AXPYfhM5"> There is a great need of forbearance in our family life. A good family life is the product of forbearance. If a husband and wife show forbearance toward each other and toward their children, they will have an excellent married life and family life. However, if they do not exercise forbearance, they will seriously damage their life together as a family. </p>
<p data-content-id="I75Whw_2lIactTFjEcGd4sQ2IxWOhS-AfLuW42x4v6too0S44Sg4j235E-CMyLxFm"> In dealing with their children, parents should be neither too strict nor too tolerant. Both excessive strictness and excessive tolerance are damaging to children. Then what is the right way for parents to care for their children? The right way is the way which is full of forbearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="HHv5p5xhhvqbBAgD71rqSKHQX2z8kjZ4tf4KZM1b6AhRAfxghYaEFPuPxmHXMg91_"> Suppose a child does something wrong, and the matter is made known to his father. He should not rebuke his child in a hasty way or spank him in anger. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91818" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">Ephesians 6</span> Paul tells us not to provoke our children. Usually parents provoke their children by dealing with them in anger. If you are angry with your child, you first need to ask the Lord to take away your anger. Once your anger has been dealt with by the Lord, you need to exercise your understanding to realize why the child made that particular mistake. No doubt, the child was wrong. Nevertheless, you still must understand his situation. Perhaps he was wrong because you were careless. If you had not been careless in that particular way, the child would not have made that mistake. Because your carelessness afforded him the opportunity to do something wrong, you should not put the full blame on him. Rather, first you must blame yourself and then discipline the child. All this is included in exercising forbearance toward our children. <span class="pg" data-page-id="509" id="509">[509]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="XlpJ-t7vy8wV2y0uEESIiiIAlkh9Xm1ks6wKaWSARkdZjfWWI1zJ5PhfGUH4B5AYW"> Parents need to exercise wisdom in speaking to their children. A child may need correction, but the parents need to sense when is the right time to speak to him. A father should ask himself whether or not he should rebuke his child in front of other children or even in front of the mother. Sometimes it is not wise to discipline a child in the presence of others. How much wisdom we must exercise in caring for our children! If we do not have forbearance, we shall not exercise wisdom. On the other hand, if we do not have adequate wisdom, we shall not be able to exercise forbearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="kYSRJ78krkogZ2_o3TMcWxz0jF1rBVMDba3-HaoctjQLGHMbnxODGGMfBYeKWnCOv"> If we would show forbearance, we also need patience. Most parents find it difficult to be patient when they are disciplining their children. Suppose a brother is about to rebuke one of his children. It would be much better if he waited a few hours before saying anything. However, it is extremely difficult to wait even a few minutes, much less a few hours. The natural tendency is to deal with the children in haste. Such impatience is damaging. </p>
<p data-content-id="JSo6eVzxZR2eYBGZsI84b9zURAFeLjf4nHRtVm7aWB4R5ohOi_-PPs5qGKRdNUNct"> Impatience is also damaging in our married life. Suppose a brother feels it is necessary to speak to his wife about a certain matter that is not pleasant. If he is truly forbearing, he will wait for the right time to speak, a time when the conversation will be constructive. In the same principle, a wife needs to be patient with her husband and wait for the proper time to express her feelings about certain matters. However, to be patient and forbearing in such a way is very difficult for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LJPRyB0cqAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> As an all-inclusive virtue, forbearance implies not only understanding, wisdom, and patience, but also mercy, kindness, love, and sympathy. The list of virtues is almost endless. As we have pointed out, the Greek word rendered <em>forbearance</em> implies considerateness. To be forbearing is to consider the situation of others. If we would exercise forbearance in our married life and family life, we would have a pleasant married life and an excellent family life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFrb3Pxvdd_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn">NEEDED BY ELDERS</h2><p data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG8MTEl31eYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91819" data-verses="1Timothy 3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span> Paul indicates that the elders in a local church need to be forbearing. If the elders do not have <span class="pg" data-page-id="510" id="510">[510]</span> adequate forbearance, the church in their locality will not be built up. </p>
<p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cJAavaB9hRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91820" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91821" data-verses="Colossians 3:1">Colossians 3</span> that the church is the new man, made up of believers with different nationalities and cultures. A great deal of forbearance is needed to build up a church composed of saints with many different backgrounds. The elders need a proper understanding of all the saints and their particular characters. They also need to exercise wisdom in caring for them. If the elders lack understanding and wisdom, they will not be able to exercise forbearance and may cause a great deal of damage. For the building up among the saints in a local church, the virtue most needed by every elder is forbearance. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nfeSRx6mUZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY">NEEDED BY ALL THE SAINTS</h2><p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvc88wEDa7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> In the church forbearance is needed not only by the elders, but also by all the saints. We especially need to exercise forbearance when we come together in different groups for the church service. As we serve together in the church, we need to show forbearance toward one another. On the one hand, we should not reject anyone; on the other hand, we should not be excessively tolerant with someone who serves in a way that is not adequate. How we need forbearance! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O0TV5m8yLRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA">GOD’S FORBEARANCE</h2><p data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyE32C0fAz0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK"> The Bible reveals that in His economy God has exercised great forbearance. Immediately after the fall of man, God began to show forbearance in His dealings with man. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91822" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> from the viewpoint of forbearance, you will see how forbearing God was with fallen man. God exercised His understanding, fully realizing man’s situation and need. He also exercised His wisdom to deal with fallen man. </p>
<p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4NDL2_gEapcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> For the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, for the carrying out of His economy, God has always exercised forbearance. With His forbearance, He has understanding, wisdom, mercy, kindness, love, and grace. Even the rich supply of life is included in God’s forbearance. God never commands us to do anything without considering our need <span class="pg" data-page-id="511" id="511">[511]</span> and granting us His supply. If a parent charges his children to do a certain task but does not supply them with what they need, that parent is not forbearing. Forbearance always includes the adequate supply to meet the need. </p>
<p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV39rk3jZlIiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> As we read the Bible, we see that God dealt with different people in different ways. For example, He dealt with Adam in one way, with Abel in another way, and with Cain in yet another way. Some students of the Bible say that in the Scriptures there are different dispensations, different ways God deals with man. These dispensations are actually related to forbearance. For God to deal with people in a particular way during a certain age is for Him to show forbearance. Because God is forbearing, He knows how to deal with everyone. He may come to you in a certain way because He knows that you are a certain kind of person. However, He may approach another person in a very different way. </p>

When the preposition <em>epi</em> is added to other Greek words as a prefix, it often bears the meaning of full or extensive. Consider, for example, the word <em>epignosis</em> used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91844" data-verses="2Timothy 2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>. In this verse Paul speaks of “the full knowledge of the truth.” Hence, <em>epi</em> added to <em>gnosis</em> gives a word which means full knowledge. The use of this preposition as a component of the Greek word for “forbearance” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91845" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> indicates that the meaning of this word is to be fully reasonable, or fitting or suitable to the fullest extent. We need to have a full and extensive reasonableness and considerateness. Furthermore, we need to act in a way that is fitting and suitable to the fullest extent. All these meanings are included in the Greek word used by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91846" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="518" id="518">[518]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP_p8Q7Rj3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> The Greek word rendered <em>forbearance</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91847" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> is not actually a noun; it is an adjective used as a noun with a definite article. This use of an adjective as a noun serves to emphasize the meaning of the word. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91848" data-verses="1Timothy 6:17">1 Timothy 6:17</span> Paul says, “Charge those who are rich in the present age not to be high-minded.” This is more emphatic than saying, “Charge the rich man not to be high-minded.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91849" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> Paul deliberately uses an adjective as a noun in order to place special emphasis on forbearance. </p>

If we would be forbearing, we need to be merciful, kind, and compassionate. Furthermore, to forbear definitely requires a certain ability in a number of areas. We need the ability to understand, to be patient, to help others, and to afford them the necessary supply. In His forbearance toward us, God certainly has given us a rich supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="tloLXFRBK9M8i7cHaEaEpTDmSFjAImpB8uuE2cKfxoRvNNrkJjg1vLPkfk3GecFfQ"> God forbears with fallen man for a purpose. His purpose in showing forbearance is to accomplish His economy.

Now we need to see that forbearance is also related to rejoicing in the Lord. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91850" data-verses="Philippians 4:4">4:4</span> Paul says, “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.” Immediately after this he says, “Let your forbearance be known to all men.” If we do not rejoice in the Lord, we shall not be able to forbear. If we would make known our forbearance, we need to be happy and joyful in the Lord. Those who are sad or sorrowful cannot have forbearance. Instead, they find it easy to be upset, to complain, or to lose their temper. Forbearance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91851" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">4:5</span> is the issue, the result, of <span class="pg" data-page-id="519" id="519">[519]</span> rejoicing in the Lord, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91852" data-verses="Philippians 4:4">verse 4</span>.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91854" data-verses="Philippians 4:11">verse 11</span> Paul testifies, “I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91855" data-verses="Philippians 4:12">verse 12</span> he goes on to say, “I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want.” Because Paul had learned the secret of contentment, he was able to forbear with all the churches and all the saints. He says, “I can do all things in Him who empowers me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91856" data-verses="Philippians 4:13">v. 13</span>). According to the context, this includes the ability to make His forbearance known to the saints. </p>
<p data-content-id="i6oamoe-I7eS1mscXmV375EKwE_Uob68yG7oiRmzoTsee3xVvWuT5lPAvyTq-oYrT"> Consider Paul’s situation when he wrote the book of Philippians. His circumstances were not at all positive. He was a prisoner in Rome; he was opposed by the religionists; and even the saints, including the Philippians who had been faithful to supply his needs in the past, neglected him for a period of time. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91857" data-verses="Philippians 4:10">4:10</span> Paul says, “But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you caused your thinking for me to blossom anew; wherein you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.” The words <em>blossom anew</em> imply that Paul had passed through a “winter” in his experience, but now it was “spring,” with the Philippians’ concern for him blossoming anew. Although Paul alluded to his “winter” experience and the saints’ temporary neglect of him, he exercised great understanding in writing to them. As he was composing this Epistle, he exercised forbearance. Thus, the apostle Paul, one who was full of understanding concerning the situation and concerning the saints, was an excellent pattern of forbearance. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOwT8FlnGf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP">THE NEED FOR UNDERSTANDING AND WISDOM</h2><p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrOq_LtfiSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> Often we are not forbearing because of misunderstanding. In the church life often we may not understand the brothers and sisters. In our family life we may fail to understand our <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> husband or wife. This lack of understanding causes a lack of forbearance. Suppose Paul had misunderstood the Philippians. He certainly would not have written them such a marvelous Epistle. Instead, he might have pointed out that when he most needed their help, it was not forthcoming. Now that they remembered him and sent him a gift, it arrived too late. Paul, however, had a full understanding of God’s economy and His move; he also understood the subtlety of Satan’s attack. Moreover, he understood the saints in Philippi and their situation. To him everything was crystal clear. Thus, on his part there was no misunderstanding. He could exercise much forbearance in writing to the believers in Philippi. </p>
<p data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNy3sYDSlP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5"> In writing to the Philippians, Paul also exercised wisdom. He knew what to say and how much to say. If we read this Epistle carefully, we shall realize that Paul’s wording is very exact. Paul wrote in a way that was neither too lengthy nor too brief. Here we see Paul’s wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWaszgl5mV307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> Paul needed to exercise wisdom in writing to the Philippians, and there is the need for us also to exercise wisdom in our married life. Husbands need wisdom in speaking with their wives, and wives need wisdom in sharing matters with their husbands. Here I would emphasize the need for the wife to have wisdom toward her husband. Suppose a sister intends to talk about a particular matter with her husband. Before she says anything, she needs to exercise understanding, consideration, and wisdom. If she speaks to him at the wrong time or if she says too much to him concerning the subject at hand, she may cause him to become angry not only with her but also with others in the church life, even with the elders. Sometimes a husband becomes upset with the elders simply because his wife gives him information without exercising understanding, consideration, and wisdom. Even in passing on information to her husband, a sister needs a great deal of forbearance. For this, she needs a proper understanding of her husband and of his situation. If she realizes that her husband is a quick person, one who reacts hastily to things and who is easily angered or upset, she needs to consider how to help him to be patient and slow down. In particular, <span class="pg" data-page-id="521" id="521">[521]</span> she needs to consider how much she should speak to him. Perhaps at first she should share only part of the information. Before saying more, she should consider the atmosphere and discern whether it is the proper time for her husband to hear more. She may share something at one time, something further at another time, and the remainder at still another time. If the sister is forbearing, exercising understanding, consideration, and wisdom, the result of her speaking with her husband will be very profitable both for their married life and for the church life. </p>

<p data-content-id="GzGytyESVJqIw6OW5vfTk6HmAVohvcjFIlFfKk1GsJVTnKxlPKH8avKDRUdOOcyo4"> We have repeatedly emphasized that the book of Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ. To experience Christ we need to live Him that we may magnify Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91866" data-verses="Philippians 1:20-21">1:20-21</span>). Then we need to take Him as our pattern and pursue Him as our goal. In our Christian life we should have the unique mind—the mind to pursue Christ and gain Him. After covering these aspects of the experience of Christ, Paul, somewhat to our surprise, speaks in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91867" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> of forbearance and anxiety. On the positive side, we need forbearance; on the negative side, we should not have any anxiety. </p>
<p data-content-id="cP3pYAL7Bamg0XMfYwYeVB-rY2J3qT1kHZBN8RQ_-6_pHc12nXtpKiu79dcgI1eWu"> Why at the conclusion of such a profound book on the experience of Christ does Paul mention forbearance and anxiety? Apparently there is no connection between the matters covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91868" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapters one</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91869" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">two</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91870" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">three</span> and Paul’s word about forbearance and anxiety. Years ago, I did not consider it worthwhile for Paul to speak of anxiety. According to my concept, he should have continued to speak about higher things, although I was not clear what these higher things should be. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YNuoin_XHT6M4nlNbEsvMDLNG6EMQYfSxa8jhutaWt6CBx0KC9cAuCVB__dMRpHwj">THE CIRCUMSTANCES ASSIGNED BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="EWDtMieHwekZc9utzvynZEWVgxsuRLoZ6q3BirGpDkNm1-O9Hapm4gH2vv83x6iKM"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91871" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91872" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">2:6</span> Paul talks about the heavenlies. In your experience day by day are you in the heavenlies or in anxiety? More often than not, we are in anxiety, not in the heavenlies. After the fall of man, human life became a <span class="pg" data-page-id="526" id="526">[526]</span> composition of anxiety and worry. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91873" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> carefully, you will see that anxiety comes from the environment assigned to us by God. For example, we have anxiety with respect to our children. From the moment a child is born, his parents worry about him. Those who do not have children may dream of having a child one day. But they do not realize the worry and anxiety associated with giving birth to a child and raising him. Everything that affects the living of our children gives rise to anxiety. We may worry about their breathing, their diet, and their clothing. Most parents can testify that as far as their children are concerned, their days are filled more with anxiety than with happiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="zAMr31HBR38A7FG2spHTO1H4LJ_xyB08qAJDY5L48iUs1XNDI1Ec1fPRwcd4txmOH"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91874" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> indicates that fallen man is also anxious about making a living. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91875" data-verses="Genesis 3:17">Genesis 3:17</span> the Lord said to the man, “Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91876" data-verses="Genesis 3:19">verse 19</span> the Lord says, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” Because man must labor to maintain his existence, he is full of anxiety. Every farmer is anxious about his crops. He worries about the weather and also about damage caused by disease and insects. Actually there is not one kind of work which leaves us free from anxiety. Even those who are successful in their profession are anxious about their work. Anxiety is unavoidable. </p>
<p data-content-id="aCoDuFDqWxr_4i_8ydfb80eRFrrXPxv9d_peZjOWC-D6LJzhRbpgt7hsA6vt7cEYn"> There is also a good deal of anxiety related to married life. Young people desire to be married. Married life is good, but it involves more worry and anxiety than happiness. I encourage all the young people to get married at the proper time, but they should not expect a married life free from anxiety. </p>
<p data-content-id="bu7HDJdR5eC2fTSyq4vn9bfgG88zElH9eYcc9DMrgSwwnBnOi2xD3U8NvMasp-mvb"> Human life is full of anxiety. Angels, however, are not subject to anxiety because they do not have any circumstances to worry about. They do not marry, and they do not need to be concerned about earning a living or taking care of a family. It is not even necessary for angels to sleep. Some people make the mistake of trying to live as if they were angels. But God has ordained all the circumstances of human life, even though these circumstances give rise more to <span class="pg" data-page-id="527" id="527">[527]</span> anxiety than to happiness. It seems that sorrow always lasts longer than happiness. There may be a short period of happiness and then a much longer time of sorrow, worry, or anxiety. </p>
<p data-content-id="qdtteUhCmixS9LlSsxVmlOO7cJw6vax1hRjnxxmQmmCv0Zxko1PcuWJbfshso3ngJ"> What is God’s purpose in assigning circumstances to us which cause anxiety? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91877" data-verses="Romans 8:1">Romans 8</span>, in addition to redemption and the indwelling Spirit, we need “all things.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91878" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Verse 28</span> says, “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose.” To be sure, included in “all things” are sufferings, anxieties, and worries. In order for God to perfect us, sufferings are necessary. From our experience we know that virtually every matter included in “all things” involves anxiety. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yJgQlA3D3mTqove1atQvir3nfeixx6WMZcFGFkXTw53u8wYDAIpdsmoWcEbqF9PpY">THE TOTALITY OF HUMAN LIFE<br/>AND OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="8-IQ_AQqDomaTtkQlpbcrAEjvcMcwEzC7zv3EtTJYnOp1PYphKyOc_Ll5Rq9I3pFn"> As an elderly person, I have passed through a great many experiences in human life. Under the sovereign hand of the Lord, I have been in a great many different circumstances. I have known poverty, and I have known what it is to have my needs supplied. I can testify that in all the circumstances of human life anxiety is present. <em>Anxiety</em> is a word that can sum up human life. The totality of human life is anxiety. If you ask an older person about anxiety, he will tell you that he has known anxiety almost every day of his life. </p>
<p data-content-id="0awGIosbJJTcKYsqrXag_fT3O0j15mM6LRxsdSKTJt_0tv8i5nuXau1tJAxfw40UA"> Paul speaks of anxiety in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91879" data-verses="Philippians 4:6">4:6</span> because he realizes that it is the totality of man’s life. Paul also realized that forbearance is the totality of a proper Christian life. Paul knew that human life is constituted of anxiety and that the Christian life is constituted of forbearance. Thus, to live Christ is to have forbearance without anxiety. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wEJgZdsogaVst8AXNWb3JhpyEHWC0vIz0AdTrGBvJ6MdCBiswdLx2HsXvdekHOjK"> It is not possible to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91880" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">Philippians 4</span> adequately simply by studying this chapter in letters. We need experience with the Lord in order to understand Paul’s meaning. Fifty years ago I did not have a proper understanding of this chapter. But through many years of study and experience, <span class="pg" data-page-id="528" id="528">[528]</span> both in human life and in the Christian life, the Lord has opened my eyes to see that the genuine Christian life is a life of forbearance. I have come to realize that just as anxiety is the totality of human life, so forbearance is the totality of the Christian life. This is the reason Paul uses the words <em>forbearance</em> and <em>anxiety</em> together in charging the saints. Positively, we should make known our forbearance. All those who come in contact with us should know our forbearance. Negatively, we need to have a life without anxiety. </p>
<p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4ND7W_g0ipcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> To be a proper human being we need to be Christians, and to be normal Christians we need to have the church life. However, if we are to have the proper and genuine church life, we need a life full of forbearance but without anxiety. To have such a life is to live Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV39bE3jpdIiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG">LIVING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHV5RN683kJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91881" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> Paul says, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” Years ago, I began to read books on this verse. However, I could not understand what it meant for Christ to live in me. The explanation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91882" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> is found not in Galatians, but in Philippians. In Philippians Paul says not only that Christ lives in us; he goes on to reveal that to live is Christ. To live Christ surpasses simply having Christ live in us. Living Christ means that we have a life full of forbearance but without anxiety. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld290elFy_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5"> Any amount of anxiety decreases the measure of Christ in our experience. Even a little anxiety causes the measure of Christ to diminish. The extent to which Christ is present in our daily life is determined by the amount of forbearance and anxiety. If we have forbearance, we have Christ. But if we have anxiety, we are short of Christ. In your living day by day, how much forbearance do you have and how much anxiety? Which is greater—the degree of forbearance or of anxiety? Probably most of us would have to admit that in our daily life we have more anxiety than forbearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGNwtuJ3tRwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> I wish to emphasize the fact that to live Christ is to have forbearance but no anxiety. If we have forbearance we shall not have anxiety. But if we have anxiety, we shall <span class="pg" data-page-id="529" id="529">[529]</span> not have forbearance.

<p data-content-id="hU3CMwRx0LpRyqCu1NICVxHfymd1PAiv9qof-8XKxeDgw18aV7lMSUO4Cao-7CQTI"> We have pointed out repeatedly that the subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ. In the first three chapters of this Epistle, the standard of Paul’s writing is very high. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91895" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span>, the concluding portion of this book, Paul seems to descend to a lower level in emphasizing forbearance and anxiety. </p>
<p data-content-id="UVMK_ZcOFCyYMpEyPYmrpLpAuP5iohlBpnKh4mMjE226ykw4tTdwPvp7N3lXsBI4Q"> More than fifty years ago, I was troubled by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91896" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">Philippians 4</span>. I appreciated Paul’s words in the first three chapters. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91897" data-verses="Philippians 1:1">chapter one</span> we see that we should magnify Christ by living Him; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91898" data-verses="Philippians 2:1">chapter two</span>, that we should take Christ as the pattern of the Christian life; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91899" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">chapter three</span>, that Christ is far superior to all things of religion and culture and that we must count all things loss in order to pursue Him and gain Him. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91900" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> Paul suddenly talks about forbearance and anxiety. I realized that forbearance was a virtue, but in my opinion Paul’s word about forbearance could not compare with what he had written in the three previous chapters. Furthermore, I was troubled by the fact that Paul emphasized anxiety. But in recent years the light on the issue of forbearance versus anxiety has gradually become brighter and brighter. Now I have a <span class="pg" data-page-id="534" id="534">[534]</span> deep appreciation for Paul’s words, “Let your forbearance be known to all men” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91901" data-verses="Philippians 4:5">v. 5</span>) and, “In nothing be anxious” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91902" data-verses="Philippians 4:6">v. 6</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MfKLXl3KECIWBwRW4PMSe1CceRTLSQLOcDO0OrE73oU5Hcx8TpimUOWDIBHoOnpLD">TWO LIVES</h2><p data-content-id="1rwBFSuAa7SUWKJ5yrD70efbOwjcFlnmf9eGgXIm-F3k4wVe0rZAjCVnHCEeo_BLP"> Anxiety is the totality of the natural human life. Day by day and even hour by hour, the common human life is filled with anxiety. Every normal human being is anxious. The more sober you are in mind, the more anxious you will be. If you are a person who is thoughtful and careful, you will have a great deal of anxiety. Sensitive people are especially bothered by anxiety. Those who are unusually dull or insensitive may not have much anxiety, but those who are sensitive usually have many anxieties. </p>
<p data-content-id="9CSvhVbzZpI_yuyvMEcWAUNhrOafLtfCSPi33h8HCbzK5NYLeomA9HkGy6uJ2ZUmd"> Just as anxiety is the totality of common human life, so forbearance is the totality of the proper Christian life. Hence, the words <em>anxiety</em> and <em>forbearance</em> represent two kinds of lives. Among human beings there are only two kinds of lives: the human life and the Christian life. Human life is a life of anxiety, whereas the Christian life is a life of forbearance. If we see this contrast, we shall realize that it is a matter of great importance for Paul to emphasize forbearance and anxiety in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91903" data-verses="Philippians 4:1">chapter four</span> of Philippians. He emphasizes forbearance and anxiety because they represent two different kinds of lives. Every human being is subject to anxiety. But if we are a Christian according to the divine standard, we shall have a life full of forbearance and without anxiety. The first point I would emphasize in this message is that forbearance and anxiety represent two kinds of lives. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jKIslLkuVd4YxhpvtX15sgWxNyHMYDitP4jU2OWBor3qP2eEFU8DcQMrn18i-F8a5">TWO SOURCES</h2><p data-content-id="TjDduM-2ZVn8BKCoS76wo4HJWacTglJuV307yF7WTM-kD7GoPKxswWypJNch4KPg-"> Second, forbearance comes from God, and anxiety comes from Satan. This means that forbearance and anxiety represent two different sources—God and Satan. </p>

God gives us forbearance so that we may accomplish His purpose. God has a purpose with us individually, with our families, and with us <span class="pg" data-page-id="535" id="535">[535]</span> in the church. In order to carry out God’s purpose related to us, to our families, and to the church, we need forbearance. If we lack the all-inclusive virtue of forbearance, it will be impossible for us to fulfill God’s purpose. This means it will not be possible for us to allow God to fulfill His purpose with us, with our family, and with the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-i_R0rLUqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI"> God has a threefold purpose with every one of us. He has a purpose for us individually, a purpose for us in relation to our family, and a purpose for us in the church life. It is crucial for us to realize that God has such a threefold purpose concerning us. For the fulfillment of such a divine purpose, we need forbearance. Without forbearance we shall not allow God to fulfill His purpose with us, with our family, or with the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRMheflo9MnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY"> We have seen that forbearance means to be utterly reasonable, considerate, and understanding in dealing with others. If we are forbearing, we shall have the wisdom and the ability to supply others with what they need. We shall also have the full knowledge of what to say to them and when to say it. For example, a parent who is forbearing will know how and when to speak to his children. If we do not exercise forbearance in our family life, we shall not be able to build up our family for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Not only is forbearance the totality of the proper Christian life; it is also the means given by God for the fulfillment of His threefold purpose with each of us. How precious that the source of forbearance is God! The forbearance we exercise and make known to others comes from God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wyWOUYyVhOrdA20x4ufSziAVvk3Ig_88Xkl7d0tWbCFbk2IhOzz4fnR1PcBrZWlQR">Satan, the Source of Anxiety</h2><p data-content-id="LY3b3GAWOFJOmvN2cbErBRxwrBDZnQO3D62ke0j8mOyinQzXo2YxW2fi2ufAiHKu1"> The source of anxiety is Satan. Anxiety comes from Satan to frustrate the fulfillment of God’s purpose. Do not think that God assigns anxiety to us. In the foregoing message I said that anxiety comes from the circumstances assigned by God. To say that anxiety comes from God’s assignment is quite different from saying that anxiety is God’s assignment. Because of the fall, God has assigned sufferings to us. For example, God has ordained that women experience suffering <span class="pg" data-page-id="536" id="536">[536]</span> in childbearing. He also ordained that men cope with thorns and thistles. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91904" data-verses="Genesis 3:17-19">Genesis 3:17-19</span>, say, “Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee...in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” Although God has assigned such sufferings, He has not assigned anxiety. After God made His assignment, Satan came in to cause anxiety through the sufferings assigned by God. Anxiety does not come from God. It comes from God’s adversary, Satan, who uses the sufferings ordained by God to cause anxiety in human life. Therefore, anxiety comes from Satan and represents Satan, whereas forbearance comes from God and represents God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mIS7O7a-NT_KDOKl-0XRFQVGIjxDbbdS_H0Cio96dDINunJF9QeGmdjRtCHl84RqP">How God Uses Satan</h2><p data-content-id="ZcHduBEQR8hQqcqxApnRXaVjfozAS_oT2ybh34s8Br7Mh2oTc0eazh5uPOMn9JX0D"> The Bible reveals that God uses Satan. We see this especially in the book of Job. When I first read this book, I was troubled by the fact that Satan had access to God’s presence in the heavens. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91905" data-verses="Job 1:6">Job 1:6</span> says, “Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.” The next verses record a conversation between God and Satan. I wondered how this conversation could take place. Why would God allow such an evil one to talk with Him? Why did He not destroy Satan, or at least drive him away? God used Satan to deal with Job. Job was righteous and perfect in himself; however, he did not truly know God. Thus, Job needed to be broken, to be dealt with thoroughly by God. God used Satan to accomplish this work, allowing Satan, within certain prescribed limits, to do certain things to Job. </p>
<p data-content-id="AN6OhYBHndb8gG-OCgSxHiZaUlBDWqpP3wTRSDcFbOIMfORRPHeeNosxbC5gQhkI3"> From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91906" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:1">2 Corinthians 12</span> we see that God also permitted a messenger from Satan to afflict Paul. Paul realized that his thorn in the flesh came from Satan. He says, “And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="91907" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7">v. 7</span>). The principle is the same both in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="537" id="537">[537]</span> case of Paul and of Job. Just as Satan was permitted by God to afflict Paul, he was allowed to afflict Job. </p>

<p data-content-id="nHBw_AdnQIfkqKVM8Tgl0tVT-Z0R7DtzTRLJRhNrPdZcnD6qmiGxxSQio_uvcr2U-"> In the foregoing message we pointed out that forbearance and anxiety represent two kinds of life, that forbearance comes from God and anxiety comes from Satan, and that forbearance and anxiety cannot coexist. Furthermore, we saw that to live Christ as our forbearance is to have a life free from anxiety. Now in this message we shall consider some further matters related to a life full of forbearance but without anxiety. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="6t5aWPpKWe-_VF6iUK8-7l6-wF6P0oPAWrIlNPa8IFwjh1qXHLi3sAM2dUSJjgo2J">ONE WITH THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="RHd54Ge9E7hnx9InDOKgygdg-i_d0pfkqMY48xMiSHSYoWHVm6pZGM_QXZ-cIJozI"> If we live Christ, we are truly one with the Lord. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91922" data-verses="Philippians 4:4">4:4</span> Paul says, “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.” To rejoice in the Lord is to be one with Him. When we are one with the Lord, we are not anxious about anything, for we are not only under the Lord’s sovereign hand, but we are in the Lord Himself. If we live this kind of life, how could we be anxious? The more we practice being one with the Lord, the more we shall realize that His destiny is our destiny. If He wants us to stay on earth for a longer period of time, He will keep us alive. But if it is His desire that we go to Him, He will take us to Himself. Since everything depends on His will and since we are one with Him in a practical way, there is no reason for us to be anxious. </p>
<p data-content-id="sjoURSdn1G_m6CnMAYLzqorBRMhSfnsJMnXwy_ToUEFc3JjFLnZkcRyAEJMQJt5gY"> When we are separated from the Lord, we are anxious about everything. Everything in human life gives rise to anxiety. But when we are one with the Lord, we are separated <span class="pg" data-page-id="542" id="542">[542]</span> from the natural human life and its anxiety. If we would make our forbearance known to all men and not be anxious in anything, we need to practice being one with the Lord. This is the reason Paul charges us to rejoice in the Lord before he exhorts us to make known our forbearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="_F2dM-M9yaNNR-CUhMZGdBa4ND7e_g0CpcXK74OjSwG-LwakFjYwp7lyi6Fi_tDbl"> When I had a problem with my health a few months ago, I was bothered. One day the Lord checked with me and asked me if I was one with Him. When I said that I was one with Him, it was as if He said, “Since you are one with Me, you should not be anxious about your health.” </p>
<p data-content-id="BxIvNV1CGZDjAN8V_JLbY1eV39bM3jp9IiKc7WitGeN9l5XQOlVnTiwwUMMte2eDG"> We become anxious whenever we are not one with the Lord in a practical way. Doctrinally speaking, we are always one with Him. However, quite often we are not one with Him in practice. We may give messages to the saints, telling them that we are one spirit with the Lord. But in our daily living we need to be tested to see if we have the actual experience. If we are one with the Lord actually and practically, we shall not be anxious. </p>
<p data-content-id="xwWYfK22fKCWIDD0IQ5SWApSHV5ZN6M_kJ_Q7TIXpe_hDNNs-gjHNSwR8DHzzdOrZ"> Even though Paul was a prisoner in Rome, he was not anxious about anything, because he was one with the Lord actually, practically, and thoroughly. He could even say that to die was better than to live. Paul was so one with the Lord that he knew that the Lord was his destiny. Not only was Paul’s destiny in the hand of the Lord—his destiny was the Lord Himself. Because Paul was one with the Lord, he knew that Satan could not do anything to him, even though he might send a messenger, a thorn in the flesh, to buffet him. Paul was not worried about what Satan might do, for the Lord was his destiny. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rZBN0pi_0gNsEE3UbS0--pQld298el16_xKRsfSy2R4vHATxMrDVu2eolwJ1Dx1y5">THE SECRET OF SATISFACTION</h2><p data-content-id="d-0UqHiS2DfgaCK9_1p1UfiYGNwluJH1RwJgCKH3lRZF32-MaP-O3vCtF629gQ46U"> If we are truly one with the Lord in our experience and something negative happens to us, we need not be anxious or troubled. If we are not one with the Lord in a practical way, virtually every person, every matter, and every thing will bother us. We may be disturbed by our husband or wife or by our children. When we are not one with the Lord, nothing will be satisfactory to us. For example, apart from the <span class="pg" data-page-id="543" id="543">[543]</span> Lord, no job is satisfying. The secret of satisfaction is to be one with Christ. When we are one with the Lord, we can be satisfied with our circumstances, and we can be forbearing with everyone, every thing, and every matter. Only when we are one with Christ can we be forbearing to the uttermost and be satisfied in all situations. </p>
<p data-content-id="QkWwVd3qJN4WukuU5yuI28RNP_ZQQ5Vf3Y2M3eE3IeVhOWjKB-7ltU9CZww0CZQ_z"> If we would not have any anxiety, we must recognize that all afflictions, sufferings, calamities, disasters, and catastrophes are assigned by God. We also must be one with the Lord in our experience. Yes, we may realize the necessity of passing through suffering and affliction. But if we would be free from anxiety, we need something more than this realization. We must also be one with the Lord. Otherwise, eventually our circumstances or the things which happen to us will cause anxiety, and we shall not be satisfied with anything or anyone. </p>
<p data-content-id="KhKDaQRS2HhJJZ6-FWe60CK8JkOObVE7EB7W04ELBcWimulCek4CfSdlBrroYP8Vy"> The older a person becomes, the more difficult it is for him to be satisfied. Throughout the years I have observed a good number of elderly persons who did not have Christ. The older they were, the more dissatisfied they became. Some were disgusted with almost everything and everyone. If we do not practice being one with the Lord, our situation will also become worse as we grow older. Out of a feeling of dissatisfaction, we may blame our circumstances or the members of our family. It is easy to satisfy a child or a young person, but difficult to satisfy someone who is older. This fact should motivate us to be one with the Lord in a practical way that we may be free from anxiety and have a life of forbearance. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="l8XvIF3SNhyR0MacDZ7m9rCcGwYIpwRkkIwn9DE6yFqyYQayejJuytdn8CDBEOT7r">PRAYER AND PETITION WITH THANKSGIVING</h2><p data-content-id="OkBpi6eOZwjHoQ1EgNu-wqIwVxsOPnrPBvkuoG7L5gqBzzJX5VgPERSb7BbeWF0pU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91923" data-verses="Philippians 4:6-7">4:6 and 7</span> Paul says, “In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.” Paul certainly composed these verses in a very thoughtful way. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91924" data-verses="Philippians 4:6">verse 6</span> he speaks of prayer, petition, and thanksgiving. Prayer is general and <span class="pg" data-page-id="544" id="544">[544]</span> includes the essence of worship and fellowship; petition is special and is related to particular needs. According to Christian experience, to pray is to have fellowship, communion, with the Lord and to worship Him. Daily we need to have a time to contact the Lord, to have fellowship with Him, and to worship Him. During the course of our fellowship, we may have particular requests. Thus, we not only pray in a general way, but make petitions to the Lord in a particular way. We offer our petitions to the One with whom we are having fellowship. Petition, therefore, is a special request made during the course of our prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="4q9MAuE101YHpfFnqFts1nWwz2wBZ4bMKQfoxdUAUaqu4Oxct_WEqNOI3azuMGPak"> It is significant that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="91925" data-verses="Philippians 4:6">4:6</span> Paul does not speak of prayer, petition, <em>and</em> thanksgiving, but of prayer and petition <em>with</em> thanksgiving. Both our prayer and petition should be accompanied by thanksgiving to the Lord. Recently I once again learned the lesson of being thankful to the Lord. When I asked the Lord to restore my health, I was rebuked by Him for not thanking Him for the measure of health I still had. Whenever we are ill, we need to say, “Lord, I thank You that I am still healthy to a certain degree. Lord, I am ill, but I am not so ill that I cannot minister Christ to the saints. But, Lord, You know that I am not altogether healthy. Therefore, I ask You to improve my health and make me fully healthy again.” We all need to learn to petition the Lord in this way. </p>
<p data-content-id="o0WOVL3vfhEmwcp078ZOnxqt7DpkN49mr0Hz0TCMxPbkDkoOvXybdtmdboBHr6qyt"> Suppose a brother prays that the Lord will change his wife. If he prays in this way, the Lord may ask him why he does not offer thanks for his wife. Then the brother should pray, “Lord, I thank You for giving me a good wife.” After offering thanks to the Lord, he then may proceed to ask Him to transform his wife. </p>
