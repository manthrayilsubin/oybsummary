In previous Life-studies we have covered six books written by Paul: Romans, Hebrews, Ephesians, Colossians, Galatians, and Philippians. In these six books the basic and crucial truths concerning Christ and the church are revealed. The other four Epistles written by Paul are 1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jdyqs46wmuS0ibK74qeFbAazIJWQrBjUlHJvRJAOxtOtbM7TvFAljY4iLSn4F2wZF"> Of the fourteen Epistles written by Paul, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Romans, and Hebrews are very basic and may be regarded as a group. First Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon may also be considered a group. We believe that the arrangement of the books in the New Testament is according to the Lord’s sovereignty. In this sovereign arrangement, the four books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon are put together as a group. </p>
<p data-content-id="zR7eDGVWOGRfmVrhHbHQk_uaNuKfru9PmGP-h_P09tUMef2KN0Z10cJ8CWx7SKm2g"> Perhaps you are wondering how the other four of Paul’s Epistles—1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians—relate to the first two groups of writings. The first group, composed of six books, contains the basic revelation concerning Christ and the church, whereas the second group, composed of four books, deals with God’s economy regarding the church. This group covers the dispensation of God with respect to the church. First and 2 Corinthians strengthen both of these groups of Epistles. In these two books we see some further and richer revelation concerning Christ and the church. On the one hand, in 1 and 2 Corinthians we have further riches of Christ; on the other hand, these books <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> strengthen the economy of God concerning the church. Then what about 1 and 2 Thessalonians? In these Epistles Paul shows us our hope, the hope of glory, that is, the appearing of our dear Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="QDbj9cmb90iNs_aGTp1ZIpIzl1kXUxi2-rt9powTfvVwEtU6uDIZ1WLZpUHoba1Hn"> First Timothy unveils to us God’s dispensation concerning the church. It is not easy to present such a brief yet all-inclusive summary of this book. Only when we dig into the depths of this Epistle do we realize that this is the subject. If we get into the depths of this book, we shall see that it can be summarized as a book which speaks of God’s dispensation, His New Testament economy, concerning the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ki0GeBu872JWpG9qm8UtJ4bT-87Ylokc0P-12Q3TJbOK4T-A9LDd8MkNTKkmUsR0-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94897" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">1:4</span> Paul uses the marvelous term “God’s dispensation.” This dispensation is an economical administration. Hence, it refers to God’s economy. God’s economy is revealed in four expressions found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="94898" data-verses="1Timothy 3:1">1 Timothy 3</span>: Great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifested in the flesh; the church is the house of the living God; the church is the pillar and base of the truth. God’s dispensation is related to the great mystery of godliness, to the manifestation of God in the flesh, and to the church as both the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. When God’s dispensation is put together with these four matters, we see that 1 Timothy does in fact reveal God’s economy concerning the church. </p>

On the one hand, an inoculation is positive; on the other hand, it is negative, for it indicates that we need to be protected from a disease that could kill us.

Eternal life is the means and power to carry out the divine realities of the faith. Godliness is a living that expresses the divine reality, an expression of God in all His riches. Faith (subjective) is the response to the truth of the faith (objective), receiving and participating in the divine realities. Conscience is a test and check to preserve us in the faith.</p>

According to many Bible teachers, these three books are called pastoral Epistles, books that give instructions on how to pastor, shepherd, a church. Because the term pastoral as applied to these books is too shallow, I prefer not to use it. I admit, however, that there is an element of pastoring, of shepherding, in these books. But it is altogether too superficial to speak of them as pastoral Epistles. If we look into the depths of these books and realize that they speak respectively of God’s dispensation concerning the church, inoculation against the decline of the church, and the maintenance of the order of the church, we shall realize that Philemon should be put together with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="EN4PVGAc-7eqi8EmXrtOINjdwYa6jLhN2jtwotPAJ7N7I33QKgJu54hISDhduhfVD"> In Philemon we have an illustration of the believers’ equal status in the new man. Although Philemon was a master, and Onesimus was a slave, they shared an equal status in the new man. As we shall see, Onesimus ran away from his master, but was saved through Paul in prison. Then <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> Paul sent him back to Philemon not as a slave, but as a dear brother in Christ. Therefore, here we see an illustration of the equal status of all believers in the new man. If we put this Epistle together with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, we shall know how to have a proper local church life. </p>

But in this chapter there is the matter that God’s dispensation is versus differing teachings. What is the focus of God’s revelation, the focal point of God’s economy, His dispensation? God’s economy is to dispense Himself in Christ through the Spirit into His chosen people so that they may have the divine life and nature to be Christ’s Body, the new man, the church, to express God in the universe. This is the crucial point. </p>

In answering this question we must observe the principle that in understanding a sentence, a phrase, or even a word of the Bible, we need to consider the context, not only of the paragraph in which the verse is found, but sometimes of the entire book or even of the whole Bible. With this principle as our basis, we need to consider Paul’s use of the word charge in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95085" data-verses="1Timothy 1:18">verse 18</span> in the context of the chapter as a whole. The charge here covers the main points presented in the previous seventeen verses.

<p data-content-id="ppGSFBdi8A8q_TxbSBz_b79UsJOegpgmv8iCjX2Se9oQcpahFwP3Lyl4hRjtD6xpv"> At this point we need to see something concerning the grouping and the timing of Paul’s Epistles. Although Philemon is grouped with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, it was actually written earlier, during Paul’s first imprisonment. Paul was imprisoned the first time because of the Jews, not because of persecution carried out by the Roman Empire. We know from Acts that Paul appealed to Caesar and this caused him to be sent to Rome, where he was imprisoned. During his first imprisonment, Paul wrote four books: Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. Thus, according to the time it was written, Philemon should be grouped with Colossians, Philippians, and Ephesians; however, in content it should be grouped, not with these Epistles, but with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. Philemon was written not long before Paul’s release from prison. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> the book of Philippians he expressed his expectation that soon he would be released and visit the churches. Not long afterward, Paul’s expectation was fulfilled. Having been released, he traveled to Ephesus, where Timothy was, and from Ephesus he went into Macedonia. From Macedonia Paul wrote the first Epistle to Timothy. Then from Macedonia he went to Nicopolis, where he wrote the Epistle to Titus. First Timothy and Titus, therefore, were written after Paul’s release from his first imprisonment. After approximately a year, Caesar Nero suddenly began to persecute Christians. At that time, Paul was accused of being the outstanding leader among the Christians. He was arrested and imprisoned again, this time due to Nero’s persecution. From prison, he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95090" data-verses="2Timothy 4:1">chapter four</span> he indicates to his dear child Timothy that he was ready to depart, to be martyred, to be poured out as a drink offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="vwkJm9ePJgdYvAPRiWRpkfc876iQSO7fb1sBTiUHCdbZDEpLTZYp5wiINQjZ19AOt"> During Paul’s first imprisonment, the churches were tested. This test showed that decline and degradation had set in. This decline was altogether due to differing teachings, teachings that were different from the ministry. This was the reason Paul charged Timothy to war a good warfare. </p>
<p data-content-id="WCb1_oznaIpXaRJwFpqDBsjzb3m5EAH0T_53DL_G1Wacz__uh_oyD1sYdu54EzxwL"> Throughout the centuries, the degradation and decline of the church has had one source: teachings which differ from the ministry of the apostles. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95091" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span> we see that at the beginning of the church life, the believers continued in the teachings of the apostles. These teachings were <em>the</em> ministry. What the apostles taught and preached was nothing other than Christ and the church. They preached a Christ who had been incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended in order that, as resurrection life, He might be imparted into His believers to produce the church. This is the focal point of the teaching of the apostles, and it is crucial for us to see it. No doubt, in the Bible there are teachings concerning many things. However, the focus of the ministry of the apostles was the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and glorified Christ to be our Savior, our life, and everything to us so that we may become His Body, the church. This is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> vital focus of the New Testament revelation, and this is God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="2wgj0-h73CTPChY6_YposYcjzRNntdcmmzLE6a8Cr2t-Ot2Lp4RyFJQqkgT-LT2_5"> We need to contact the Word and receive God by the Spirit through the Word. Then we shall have faith. By coming to the Word, we are infused with God, and spontaneously faith operates within us to bring us into an organic union with God. The more we enjoy God’s infusion, the more we become one with Him. However, this vital matter has been lost for centuries. Knowing the importance of this, Paul charged Timothy to fight a good fight, to war a good warfare. </p>
<p data-content-id="u8dBNz9hGWarPcwyyyxWxbWh1j6FdWmE0nfYJ3tT2Jfni0o_uwSlsxvlsDe5gq2n-"> On the one hand, Timothy was to war against the differing teachings of the dissenters. On the other hand, he was to carry out God’s dispensation according to the apostle’s ministry. If we wish to carry out God’s dispensation, we must do it not according to the teachings of traditional Christianity nor according to systematic theology, but according to the apostle’s ministry. </p>
<p data-content-id="fM6XB1U7ePyY3ANDewrjpOEtd-1zGXRvQ7UeZRFhwIHYSByva326rtt9j40fFJnpv"> Furthermore, God’s dispensation concerns the gospel of grace and eternal life. These are two basic elements in the gospel. This gospel is for the glory of the blessed God; it is for the expression, the manifestation, of the blessed God. </p>
<p data-content-id="IVNRIQts4k-Qzj0kEt_Y0ZlzRXdNxguEGuxWEIPe0aa9PWqmgAubUHtsq9QQpHsQm"> When Paul was in prison the first time, dissenters rose up to teach differently. These differing teachings were the seed of the church’s decline. Paul realized the situation even while he was in prison. We know this by the contents of books such as Colossians and Philippians. Especially in Colossians we see that certain isms—Judaism, Gnosticism, asceticism—had crept into the church life. These differing teachings caused dissension and decline. Thus, Paul charged his faithful co-worker to fight the good fight against the differing teachings and fight for God’s dispensation. </p>
<p data-content-id="HfeLlVaxNPIqUZTaG8r49IiBpyrofVRVqLJBoEsvmYuv6SlWJn27HkfDJD8cz0QPA"> Today we also must be on the alert for differing teachings. Throughout the centuries, the church has been poisoned and corrupted by such teachings. If we are not on guard, differing teachings may also cause damage to the Lord’s recovery. In the past we have seen the damage caused by differing teachings propagated in a subtle, hidden way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="21" id="21">[21]</span> This has helped the leading ones in many churches to learn the important lesson of being watchful for differing teachings. We must not allow any differing teachings to come into the Lord’s recovery. The recovery is strictly for the carrying on of <em>the</em> ministry. By this I do not mean my ministry, but the ministry of the apostles, which began with Peter and is still being carried on today. All true apostles teach and preach the same thing, even the one thing—God’s New Testament economy. The focus of our preaching and teaching is Christ and the church. To teach and preach God’s economy concerning Christ and the church is to war a good warfare. </p>

<p data-content-id="3V0cGh5BMcBQefTo_tImIoFUSZuIsDQSItP1YBQdk22dbD6bvGlfhSt0cM0u5tovf"> In the <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95106" data-verses="1Timothy 1:1">first chapter of 1 Timothy</span> Paul lays a good foundation to speak of the church life in a positive way. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95107" data-verses="1Timothy 2:1">2:1</span> he goes on to say, “I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men.” If we would have a proper church life, we must first have a prayer life. The leading ones, those who minister the Word in the church, should take the lead to have such a prayer life. A prayer ministry is the prerequisite for the administration and shepherding of a local church. Thus, Paul exhorts Timothy that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men. This is the first word concerning the positive aspect of the church life Paul gives after speaking of God’s economy and after charging Timothy to war the good warfare for God’s economy. Timothy had to take the lead to have a prayer life. </p>
<p data-content-id="GsLpVJUHFBOxjJzcUcmDP4-sAnFqVHitw4SvaaARSzm9SwWL2aT2LieTouACqtOH0"> A prerequisite for having a proper church life in the Lord’s recovery today is to have a prayer life. A proper church is a praying church. A church that is without prayer is pitiful. Prayerlessness is a sin. All in the Lord’s recovery must be prayerful and stand against the sin of prayerlessness. The elders in the churches must take up Paul’s charge to “first of all” pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="cTvRW77g0VLkDMLKXZ7WI8-vzvV0Cyik6Go7jGYY_tm1Sc3nmKngzx-zcvDhYHsP5"> Of the fourteen Epistles written by Paul, ten were written to churches and four to individuals. Romans was written to all the believers in Rome, and Hebrews was written not to <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> individuals, but to believing Hebrews addressed corporately. Ephesians, Philippians, Galatians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians were all written to churches. However, the four Epistles of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon were written to individuals. Some may think that these Epistles are not related to us because they were written to individuals. However, we should be today’s Timothy, Titus, and Philemon. In particular, each individual saint needs to be a Timothy. </p>
<p data-content-id="YRqNCdMs1MHSzKlKbFAMBi0bPLNKCHuLQ_99U_1qWzdb8oLlMKVzVY2CBEOfF9g-F"> If we would be a Timothy, we must take the lead not to argue, gossip, or criticize, but to pray. Whenever we hear some news, good or bad, concerning a particular church, we should pray. Do not discuss the situation, do not gossip about it, and do not criticize. Just pray! Likewise, if you hear something about a saint or about an elder, pray for that one. The first requirement to have a proper church life is to pray. Oh, we all need to practice this! If we exercise ourselves to have a prayer life, the church will be living and uplifted. If some would be today’s Timothys to take the lead to pray, the others will follow. This can be illustrated by the way a flock of sheep follows the few who take the lead. If you, as a Timothy, take the lead to pray, the congregation in your locality will follow. </p>
<p data-content-id="cTvRW77g0VLkDMLKXZ7WI8-vzvV0CyiBwGo7jGYY_tm1Sc3nmKngzx-zcvDhYHsP5"> Instead of talking so much and even instead of working so much, we should pray more. Should you hear that a saint is weak or backsliding, do not talk about that person, and do not criticize him. Moreover, do not immediately go to visit him. Instead, pray for him. Whether or not you should visit him depends on the Lord’s leading. After you pray about the matter, if the Lord leads you to visit that one, simply follow the Lord and visit him. But do not do anything presumptuously. If the Lord does not lead you to visit a backsliding saint, you should not visit him on your own. It is possible that even in visiting the saints we may be presumptuous. Yes, visiting a backsliding saint is a presumptuous sin if it is done in ourselves apart from prayer and the Lord’s leading. But if through our prayer the Lord definitely leads us to visit a certain one, that visitation will be effective. <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="YRqNCdMs1MHSzKlKbFAMBi0bPLNKCHuqb_99U_1qWzdb8oLlMKVzVY2CBEOfF9g-F"> We should also pray whenever we hear of problems among the saints. We should not presume that we are experienced and qualified to solve problems. Such an attitude is not only presumptuous; it is also blasphemous, for it is to consider ourselves as God. If we learn about a problem between brothers, we should bring this matter to the Lord in our prayer. </p>
<p data-content-id="EN4PVGAc-7eqi8EmXrtOINjdwYa6hLhB0jtwotPAJ7N7I33QKgJu54hISDhduhfVD"> The first thing the elders should do in caring for the church is pray. Do not make decisions without praying. Do not either criticize someone or praise him without first praying for him. Before doing anything, we need to pray. Furthermore, our prayers should not be light or superficial; they must be thorough. Only after we have prayed for a matter thoroughly should we make a decision concerning it, not by ourselves independently, but in oneness with the Lord and according to His leading. If the elders practice in this way the church life in our locality will be uplifted and proper. </p>
<p data-content-id="D2g4hMR9WZGc7nLiaUUKWUAWnwPvb-IPM8TUg3T6nnQMD_ij6dME1LUzyCrwsGgCN"> Brother Nee often told us that in reading the Bible we need to touch the spirit of the writer. The Bible in black and white letters can be likened to a human body, and the writer’s spirit can be likened to the life, or to the spirit, in the body. Within the “body” of the Bible, there is the writer’s spirit. If we touch Paul’s spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95108" data-verses="1Timothy 2:1-7">2:1-7</span>, we shall sense his burden that those who take the lead in the church life must have a prayer life. In these verses Paul seems to be telling Timothy, “I have shown you a clear picture of God’s economy and how it is versus different teachings. I have also pointed out to you that, in His mercy, the Lord has made me a pattern of His economy. I have also charged you solemnly to war the good warfare on behalf of God’s economy. Now deep in my spirit is the burden to exhort you to pray. I exhort that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men. Do not think that teaching comes before prayer. No, prayer must be first, and teaching, second.” </p>
<p data-content-id="S0eTYOWYjJCkmlrCNRY2GKApqgLJ8px3gnLzQjlD2UQhwkoA3ptD5ZAmeHDJKGETx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95109" data-verses="1Timothy 2:1">2:1</span> Paul mentions petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings. Prayer is general, with the essence of worship and fellowship. Petitions are special and are for <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> particular needs. The Greek word rendered “intercessions” means approach to God in a personal and confiding manner, that is, intervening, interfering, before God in others’ affairs for their benefit. In addition, we must offer thanksgiving. Often when we hear good news about certain churches, elders, or saints, we praise them instead of giving thanks to God for them. If the situation in a certain church is good, it is because of God, not because of the church. Likewise, if a particular elder or saint is doing well, it also is because of God’s grace. Therefore, instead of praising a church or a person, we should give thanks to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="gC3UUPj6cEEN55iNA9kUgi96znqOlz6Lm7EGk2wsK7E9CIM8nMuauIUkqCgF_TBXf"> In mentioning petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings, Paul’s spirit was very burdened concerning the importance of prayer. He wanted his dear spiritual children to pray. Again and again I would emphasize the fact that we can have a proper church life only if we have a prayer life. I can testify that I have never prayed more than I have during the past several years. I can also testify that I have seen definite answers to my prayers. Recently, my activity was limited for a time so that I could rest and care for my health. When I heard about certain needs, I prayed for them. Perhaps the Lord limited me that He might impress me with the fact that prayer is more important than work. May we all learn the lesson that the way to have a good church life is to pray. This is crucial. If our talking is turned into praying, the church in our locality will be transformed. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95130" data-verses="1Timothy 2:8-15">2:8-15</span> Paul devotes one verse (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95131" data-verses="1Timothy 2:8">v. 8</span>) to the brothers and seven verses to the sisters (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95132" data-verses="1Timothy 2:9-15">vv. 9-15</span>).

<p data-content-id="h1FSYu3NX9haREMmgHzgYcnfyXbS3Jg0Fwwls_tBoCO9SPx_hM7SOQMcTh-0TsVli"> Concerning the brothers, Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95133" data-verses="1Timothy 2:8">verse 8</span>, “I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and reasoning.” In a local church the leading ones must have a prayer life, as they were charged in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95134" data-verses="1Timothy 2:1-2">verses 1 and 2</span>, to set an example of prayer for all the members to follow by praying always in every place. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95135" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">Ephesians 6</span> Paul tells us to pray at every time, but here he says to pray in every place. Although it is possible for us to pray at every time, morning, afternoon, evening, and night, it may not be possible for us to pray in every place. The requirement to pray in every place is more demanding than that to pray at every time. If we can pray in every place, we can surely pray at every time. But even if we are able to pray at every time, it still may not be possible for us to pray in every place. For example, it is not possible to pray in certain worldly places. Since you cannot pray in those places, <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> you should not go there. If you can pray in a particular place, it is permissible for you to be there. But if you cannot pray in a certain place, you should not be there. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95136" data-verses="1Timothy 2:8">verse 8</span>, the brothers must bear the unique burden to pray in every place. Pray at work, at home, and in your car. As men, we should be those who pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="U2wGFzAwRCJuqmxh9x9Yl3_VURW_cU8Jn3OWrFpG6VePcsOE7qW0cjG6PGgLZFr_K"> It is significant that Paul opens <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95137" data-verses="1Timothy 2:8">verse 8</span> with the words, “I will.” This expression is stronger than “I wish” or “I exhort.” Paul’s use of the word “therefore” indicates, as we pointed out in the previous message, that the elders, the leading ones, are to take the lead in prayer and pave the way for others to follow them to have a prayerful life. In the first message of this Life-study we covered some very important matters related to God’s dispensation. But no matter how important these matters are, they cannot be carried out without the prayer of the brothers. Knowing this, Paul said, “I will therefore that men pray in every place.” </p>
<p data-content-id="u8dBNz9hGWarPcwyyyxWxbWh1j6FbWmE8nfYJ3tT2Jfni0o_uwSlsxvlsDe5gq2n-"> As I am speaking about this matter of praying in every place, I am deeply burdened. I would beg you all, especially the leading ones, from now on to have another kind of life—a life of praying in every place. If you pray in every place, your living will be transformed, and the church in your locality will be transformed also. Some brothers may not be entirely satisfied with the church in their locality. The only way for the church in your locality to be satisfying to you is for you to pray at every time and in every place. Instead of discussing the situation of the church, pray for the church. The normal life of the brothers in the church is to pray in every place. </p>

Without Wrath and Reasoning</h2><p data-content-id="kVxuivPS9X1V1UyRsTkZUSzzmqLrwjddlAImj63iPzxJ0GssWH8z5RRuT2iUfEmHJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95138" data-verses="1Timothy 2:8">verse 8</span> Paul also urges the brothers to pray “without wrath and reasoning.” Wrath and reasoning kill our prayer. Wrath is of our emotion, and reasoning is of our mind. To have a prayer life and pray unceasingly, our emotion and mind must be regulated to a normal condition under the control of the Spirit in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jdyqs46wmuS0ibK74qeFbAazIJWQuBjJpHJvRJAOxtOtbM7TvFAljY4iLSn4F2wZF"> The Greek word for reasoning means disputatious reasoning. What Paul is speaking of here is not normal or ordinary reasoning, but a reasoning filled with disputation. We must avoid this if we are to pray properly. </p>
<p data-content-id="zR7eDGVWOGRfmVrhHbHQk_uaNuKfuu9WrGP-h_P09tUMef2KN0Z10cJ8CWx7SKm2g"> Paul’s word about not having disputatious reasonings is related to his admonition to lift up holy hands. If we close our eyes and lift up our hands, we shall be able to pray. But if we open our eyes to consider others and reason about their situation, we shall not be able to pray. Instead of lifting up our hands, we may clasp them behind our back. Who can pray with his hands clasped behind his back? But if we lift up our hands and refrain from disputatious reasoning, we shall be able to pray in a proper way. </p>
<p data-content-id="aEKl80V54f6JnuNGhGdo1wLQtRZcx28KgDsoovI_tOOVIhCRbUegDwWw7eImz0JQk"> From experience I have learned that our prayer life can be affected by our mood. If I do not keep myself in a proper mood, my prayer life is put to death. Anger always destroys our prayer life for a period of time. If a brother loses his temper with his wife, he may find that he cannot pray properly for a few days. If we are to have a prayer life, we must learn not to be moody or angry with others. By the Lord’s grace that is with our spirit, we must exercise a strict control over our emotion. </p>

Clothing in Greek implies deportment, demeanor. Clothing is the main sign of a sister’s demeanor, and it must befit her saintly position. </p>
<p data-content-id="01fk51LgpcuYxasdF-O3G0WMbVgWFedZtCK7a9bApoFUcxLWaosbbWX1Q809qThtc"> The Greek word rendered modesty literally is shamefastness, that is, bound or made fast by an honorable shame (Vincent), implying not forward or overbold, but moderate, observing the proprieties of a woman. </p>
<p data-content-id="7wlz5c3TBvsgN13eHWF9qs0hFR4Hc8BnLWztWYkZwsEQ3FftqIBxXczVNR0yhMa6U"> Sobriety denotes sober-mindedness, self-restraint. It means to restrict oneself soberly and discreetly. The sisters in a local assembly should clothe themselves with these two virtues—shamefastness and self-restraint—as their demeanor. </p>

For a sister to learn in silence and in all subjection is to realize her position as a woman. This safeguards the sisters from the presumption of overstepping their position in the local assembly. </p>

For a woman to teach in this way or to exercise authority over a <span class="pg" data-page-id="37" id="37">[37]</span> man is to leave her position. In God’s creation man was ordained to be the head, and woman was to be in subjection to man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95145" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:3">1 Cor. 11:3</span>). This ordination should be kept in the church. The word quietness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95146" data-verses="1Timothy 2:12">verse 12</span> refers to silence from speaking. </p>

<p data-content-id="Rtdop0ZDZCwfZfnB-FPuN6azyRdKiYuS02dS5T38ZK1M0Oddf9rezYiMl-E85IJzA"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95177" data-verses="1Timothy 3:1">verse 1</span> Paul speaks of oversight, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95178" data-verses="1Timothy 3:2">verse 2</span>, of overseers. The Greek word rendered <em>oversight</em> is <em>episkope,</em> from <em>epi</em> meaning “over” and <em>skope</em> meaning “sight”; hence, oversight, denoting the function of an overseer. The Greek word translated <em>overseer</em> is <em>episkopos</em> from <em>epi</em> and <em>skopos</em> meaning “seer”; hence, overseer (bishop, from Latin <em>episcopus</em>). An overseer in a local church is an elder (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95179" data-verses="Acts 20:17">Acts 20:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95180" data-verses="Acts 20:28">28</span>). The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; and overseer, denoting the function of an elder. It was Ignatius in the second century who taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. This teaching is also the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government. Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the eyes of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="N8JwSRMLxqw4OgBgdHCtYQi9VZBbDpd0UWMP5zIn5uHY5kdJFGEjQB9q4VeEcK-qh"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95181" data-verses="1Timothy 3:1">verse 1</span> Paul tells us that if anyone aspires to oversight, he desires a good work. Aspiration with a pure motive differs from ambition with an impure motive. It is the Lord’s desire that many brothers have the aspiration spoken of here. For the Lord’s recovery and for the building up of the local churches, there is the need of the proper leading ones. Hence, aspiration for oversight is not only justifiable, but even admirable. On the one hand, we condemn ambition; on the other hand, we appreciate the fact that many brothers have the aspiration for oversight. A brother with this kind of aspiration truly desires a good work. </p>

<p data-content-id="U2wGFzAwRCJuqmxh9x9Yl3_VURW_dU8ou3OWrFpG6VePcsOE7qW0cjG6PGgLZFr_K"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95182" data-verses="1Timothy 3:2">verse 2</span> Paul says, “The overseer then must be without reproach, husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach.” Paul first mentions the qualification of being without reproach. This does not denote perfection in the eyes of God, but an irreproachable condition in the eyes of man. An overseer must be one with a good reputation. There should be no ground for others to speak evil of him. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="MB3vpRQ-uHq7qpTzm8SKn147bJZr0Oid13KEtSm7BmJi6jnhWkhuaKBfr0sMdy5J-">2. Husband of One Wife</h2><p data-content-id="VmNQZkTbEhFHcnW_tODWvUVTxkAOsV0aqQawAEBJj0MWN1nYfoGRYkSGTDRVE3q6n"> An overseer should be the husband of one wife. This implies the restraint of the flesh, which is necessary for an elder. It keeps an elder in a simple and pure married life, free from the tangle of a complicated and confused marriage. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="iJ3HTIBT6JSLCcT54mk-giE7SdJUxmVcqr-LK0YV9Nm9H96Ek80CkDOgiaJpAsx9D">3. Temperate</h2><p data-content-id="1qEzFLCxRYl7H4L30QbgjoRReXer58evoXeUZWPYjRG9ELzNy6dY6EWMTUn5is62h"> An overseer should be temperate. Temperate here means self-controlled, moderate. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="9Smf7SUWjn2SWjpx7teh4pesshlxzcacVXuvfmSMcF8OAjqa8hUmgDk1QbVcLjY2F">4. Of a Sober Mind</h2><p data-content-id="j1mDP1tAZC-MYJgFOtHZHTRwfJlKWZS5VVxo0jG_Ey440xNI27_7dsqXd_20_J4z3"> To be of a sober mind is not only to be sensible, but also to be discreet in understanding. In 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus Paul uses the words sober and sobriety a number of times. All the saints in the church life need to be sober in <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> their understanding. All must have the virtue of sobriety. If we have the Christian virtue of sobriety, we shall be very discerning and full of insight. However, we shall be quiet, not talkative. A talkative person is not a sober person. One who is sober is keen in his understanding, but slow to speak. </p>
<p data-content-id="TEeAhbdYtKWqw6yI1MgC4TcMs-e_cTklJj_mMj8MVB_R8fXfyoAbJmk8kbhCK3EQJ"> In our fellowship as Christians, it is very important that we understand others. Should someone come to you for fellowship, you should not say very much. Instead, listen while the other party does the talking. However, many have the habit of interrupting the other party and speaking too quickly. If we are to have the proper fellowship with others, we need to be inwardly like a calm lake. Talkativeness, however, stirs up the water and causes the lake to become muddy. </p>
<p data-content-id="n0hXPNXPprPDGpTK5P3ogZWTSTqlIO0YgC2B9NILDpLlZItEuDjuJ8Gm0FV2YoqbJ"> The elders should take the lead in all positive aspects of the church life. They should take the lead in prayer and in exhibiting the virtue of sobriety. If a brother is able to be silent for fifteen minutes while someone is having fellowship with him, he is able to meet this qualification to be an elder. When anyone is speaking to him, the elder should be a calm, tranquil lake, clear and transparent. This is one of the qualifications of an overseer. Talkativeness disqualifies a brother from being an elder. A proper elder is one who is quiet, calm, keen in understanding, and very discerning. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="6w2Mwlk5y8PJGz2CVGlS2BAAY0u8tF36U3AUESMCajH9mQVwlR7b4NG1_xK7eTfsW">5. Orderly</h2><p data-content-id="Rtdop0ZDZCwfZfnB-FPuN6azyRdKiYu_92dS5T38ZK1M0Oddf9rezYiMl-E85IJzA"> The Greek word rendered orderly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95183" data-verses="1Timothy 3:2">3:2</span> also means decorous. To be orderly, decorous, is to have behavior that always fits the situation. It is to be neither too fast nor too slow, neither too bold nor too timid. A decorous person is one who always does what is fitting. One who is decorous talks when talk is necessary and is silent when silence is required. He can also laugh when laughter is appropriate. </p>
<p data-content-id="s0SceBHxfYRRzuUtQgrWqNkhbaakaODe6HIqEhxMmgp28cYIo4zFBmieX618p6nmb"> This one qualification shows how difficult it is to be an elder. It is not too much to say that being an elder is the most difficult task on earth. How difficult it is to meet even the one qualification of being orderly or decorous! Even in <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> the way he uses the telephone an elder should be decorous. On the one hand, he should not talk too long; on the other hand, if his conversation is too brief, he may offend others. It is possible to go to an extreme even in the matter of the way we use the telephone. One extreme is that a brother takes the telephone off the hook, refusing to talk to anyone. Another extreme is that his telephone conversations are too long. Neither is orderly. </p>
<p data-content-id="wZ6ElHpztYhlIyd7KKARNOCorYf4dOeyeNqnRD7FYLkTdvkl-P2d3b3e01SD2fwdi"> Elders should also be orderly in the way they speak to others. Sometimes they need to speak loudly; at other times, they should speak softly. </p>
<p data-content-id="LCa_t3dxTDQd_nIGbao_eCfiBf3dYcVVNSGQKyP7vdy9o4Wvb8BuJivNrIs73pMVx"> Furthermore, they should be orderly in the way they have their hair cut. To have hair that is either too long or too short is not orderly. By these few examples we can see that the requirements of eldership are virtually without limit. </p>
<p data-content-id="mY-FFReUkEiYHX_Huns6HwcbgTQRU4E5ZyGC1C9aE6KtVdVwotK4c3eOVSEegBjsk"> Because the requirements of an elder are so many and so difficult, it is surely vain for anyone to be ambitious for eldership. Those who have this ambition simply do not know how difficult it is to be an elder. If a brother does not have a genuine aspiration with a pure motive for the Lord’s recovery, he should not desire to be an elder. He should seek to fulfill his ambition outside the church, not in pursuing the eldership. The church is not an arena for a brother to satisfy his ambition. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZO-YN-NQeWP0QHXFl3j6foqIASnx5eIqUSweah3MEkR1G70HvqWjV-7vnMGDjkV2E"> The eldership is very demanding, and the requirements are extremely high. For this reason, I sympathize with the elders. From experience I know that they will receive telephone calls even in the middle of the night. They have no choice but to answer the telephone and take care of the situation of the one who calls. </p>
<p data-content-id="AkF9ZrENbnPA0KDTX6YGEFZroCrRVuwMTvwN6rCuNsJG0mg1TwXvv1vShee4OEHrI"> At this point I would like to speak a word of comfort and encouragement to those who are children of elders. An elder’s children may be troubled by the fact that their father gives so much of his time to the church. If an elder fails to give adequate time to the church life, he cannot fulfill his responsibility properly. However, because the church takes so much of his time, he has relatively little time to devote <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> to his children. I would encourage the children of elders to realize that for their father to give his time to the church is very acceptable to God. Temporarily the children may have some hardship. But the Lord will reward them. Instead of being disappointed by their situation, they should be glad that their father has consecrated his life and time to the Lord’s recovery. Eventually, the children of an elder will enjoy the Lord’s reward. </p>
<p data-content-id="F6UVrglQG1-twcyM4TpCcH-XLwHvGFBIcelG8YielY5i86yDEm5pJWXXS1az6gHxG"> To be an elder is a great blessing to one’s family and to the church. It is surely worthwhile for a brother to aspire to oversight. Although being an elder is a most difficult job, it is a great blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="CdSjXbpuP87Dm-ld8UFuafdDIfuP2BgpuOB1gCf8kpf83Rpvsw7fObd7WHAnfbfDI"> Those who are elders in the churches in the Lord’s recovery are burdened by the Lord and chosen according to the insight, oversight, and foresight of the spiritual eyes of the church. They are not elected, and they are very different from those who may be called elders in different denominations. </p>

Paul has covered the matters of the differing teachings, the dispensation of God, the need for the leading ones to have a prayer life so that all the other brothers may follow, and the charge to the sisters to remain in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety. Furthermore, the elders have been established and the deacons have been appointed. A church that has all these characteristics is certainly wonderful. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95211" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">verse 15</span> Paul tells us that the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95212" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">verse 16</span> he goes on to declare: “And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, who was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.” In these verses Paul presents an extremely high standard for the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="F6UVrglQG1-twcyM4TpCcH-XLwHvFFBdWelG8YielY5i86yDEm5pJWXXS1az6gHxG"> Among Christians today the standard of the church is far below God’s standard revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95213" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15-16">3:15 and 16</span>. In order to reach this standard, the church must have all the characteristics described in the first two and a half chapters of 1 Timothy. There must be no differing teachings, and God’s economy must be practiced continually. The leading ones must have a prayer life, and all the other brothers must follow them to pray in every place. Furthermore, the sisters should remain in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety. Then the government of the church must be established with the two offices of elders and deacons. It is our expectation to practice this kind of church life. We praise the Lord that in His recovery we have seen such a church life at least <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> to a certain extent. Whenever God’s standard for the church is attained as outlined in 1 Timothy, the church will function as the house of the living God and the pillar and base upholding the truth. This is also the great mystery of godliness, the manifestation of God in the flesh. Not only was the Lord Jesus the manifestation of God in the past; the church today should also be the manifestation of God. This is the goal, the aim, of these four Epistles written by Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="CdSjXbpuP87Dm-ld8UFuafdDIfuP1Bg4lOB1gCf8kpf83Rpvsw7fObd7WHAnfbfDI"> Even though Paul witnessed the beginning of the decline of the church, he was not disappointed or discouraged. Because he had both insight and foresight, he could be encouraged. He knew that some day and somehow the church would reach God’s standard. The majority of the believers may decline, but a small number at least would be chosen, preserved, and established to practice the church life according to the divine standard. </p>
<p data-content-id="PcMiyod2Il6edI3nU6PPh17q3ELaDF2o3zxkKqOjzEv4lulb17Efn0IeOVnCxNjLl"> We in the Lord’s recovery can testify of the great difference between the recovery and today’s organized Christianity. Reconciliation between the two is impossible. All the saints should be encouraged that the situation in the Lord’s recovery is heading toward God’s standard. This standard is that the church should function as the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and as the great mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh. The church life today must be the manifestation of God in the flesh. When visitors, including those who have not yet believed in the Lord, come to the meetings and behold such a manifestation, they will no doubt be greatly surprised. They may say, “What is this? It is different from anything we have seen elsewhere. It is even different from the church services in religion.” Yes, the church is different; it is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the manifestation of God in the flesh. Every local church must reach this standard and continue according to it. There should be no decline; rather, we should maintain God’s standard until the glorious appearing of our Head, the Savior, Jesus Christ. </p>

When he wrote this book, he was hoping to come shortly to see Timothy. </p>

<p data-content-id="qJklXtcDv7OF6QfW1JkKUJYUK6KrrTK9qdCcEOiBvx2lczLKwoX2n7EqOwgZ_eOeD"> According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95216" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">verse 15</span>, the church is the house of God. The Greek word rendered house may also be translated household. The same word is used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95217" data-verses="1Timothy 3:4">3:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95218" data-verses="1Timothy 3:5">5</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95219" data-verses="1Timothy 3:12">12</span>.

The reality of this house as the dwelling place of the living God is in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95222" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Eph. 2:22</span>). We must live and act in our spirit so that God can be manifested in this house as the living God. </p>
<p data-content-id="yGDV7YSawdBesaACh4U5NAzJRIfbY4Y95qxeLBSW6yc6_Kp4A6ipXDG5HDYOISHDB"> As God’s dwelling place, the church is both God’s house and His household, His family. In the Old Testament, the temple and God’s people, His family, were two separate things. But in the fulfillment in the New Testament, the dwelling place and the family are one. The family is God’s dwelling place, and God’s dwelling place is His family. As we have indicated, the Greek word for house may be translated either as house or household. According to God’s New Testament economy, God’s family is His house. These are not two separate things; they are actually one. We are God’s family and also His temple, His dwelling place. </p>
<p data-content-id="8sD8_tMkx55iXBHPPO2V_OFuk0RIDtXwEp9dkiYOBL3cD5HPcTtAkYKLt2-ET74RJ"> In speaking of the church as the house of God, Paul specifically refers to God as the living God. The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church rather than merely objective. An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless. The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living. Because He <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> is living, the church is also living in Him, by Him, and with Him. A living God and a living church live, move, and work together. The living church is the house and the household of the living God. Hence, it becomes the manifestation of God in the flesh. </p>

A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="Bc_0rQwrfFVkYaD3THCruFAy0UOPiM-pXbZ1ft5gBVMXUv6I-7dhGbFD0CoVwl1wc"> The church as the house of the living God is both the pillar which bears the truth and the base which upholds the pillar.

This economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95223" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Col. 2:2</span>) and the church as the mystery of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95224" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4">Eph. 3:4</span>). Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the contents of the reality of God’s New Testament economy. </p>

At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95277" data-verses="1Timothy 3:1">chapter three</span>, Paul reached the high point of the four Epistles of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, presenting a glorious picture of the church. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95278" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1-5">4:1-5</span>, he describes something very dark, something much in contrast to the situation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95279" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15-16">3:15 and 16</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="XgvE_3AbMS4q4D3VIih3LlNnVhUUlfOdCKz3orXmirMK0UIZdc0C27NuwHjOjtZ5v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95280" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">4:1</span> Paul uses the expression “the Spirit says expressly.” This is the Spirit who dwells in our spirit and speaks to us there (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95281" data-verses="Romans 8:9-11">Rom. 8:9-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95282" data-verses="Romans 8:16">16</span>). We need to exercise our spirit that it may become keen and clear to listen to the Spirit’s speaking and be kept from the deceiving spirits and teachings of demons. </p>
<p data-content-id="kVxuivPS9X1V1UyRsTkZUSzzmqLrzjd8qAImj63iPzxJ0GssWH8z5RRuT2iUfEmHJ"> Many in today’s Pentecostal movement follow the Old Testament way of prophesying and say, “Thus saith the Lord.” This expression cannot be found in the New Testament. In the New Testament we see the principle of incarnation. According to this principle, God does not speak directly. Rather, He speaks through man. First, in Jesus Christ God became incarnated and mingled with man. Now after the death and resurrection of Christ, it is possible for <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> Him to be one spirit with those who believe in Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95283" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Corinthians 6:17</span> Paul declares, “He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.” This refers to the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the regenerated human spirit. In the New Testament it is this mingled spirit which does the speaking. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95284" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">4:1</span> does not say, “The Spirit of God says,” nor, “The Holy Spirit says.” Instead, this verse reads, “The Spirit says....” According to the principle of incarnation revealed in the New Testament, this implies our spirit. We have seen that the principle of incarnation means that divinity is brought into humanity and works with humanity. Hence, when the Spirit speaks, He speaks within our spirit, through our spirit, and out from our spirit. If there were no one who was truly one spirit with the speaking God, there would be no way, according to the New Testament principle, for God to speak. </p>
<p data-content-id="9Smf7SUWjn2SWjpx7teh4pesshlxxcacdXuvfmSMcF8OAjqa8hUmgDk1QbVcLjY2F"> Paul took the lead to be one spirit with the Lord. Because he was one with Him in this way, Paul was able to speak a great deal for the Lord. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95285" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">1 Corinthians 7</span> Paul says definitely that concerning a particular matter he does not have a word from the Lord, but that he gives his opinion, his judgment, as one who has received the mercy of the Lord to be faithful (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95286" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:25">v. 25</span>). But as we read this portion of the Bible today, we see that Paul’s word is in fact the word of the Lord. When Paul spoke, the Triune God, who has been processed to become the Spirit and who was mingled with Paul’s regenerated spirit, spoke from within him. We also have such a mingled spirit within us today. It is in and through this mingled spirit that the Spirit speaks expressly. </p>
<p data-content-id="j1mDP1tAZC-MYJgFOtHZHTRwfJlKUZS5dVxo0jG_Ey440xNI27_7dsqXd_20_J4z3"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95287" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">First Timothy 4:1</span> is a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95288" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15-16">3:15 and 16</span>. No doubt, these latter verses were Paul’s words. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95289" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">4:1</span> Paul says that the Spirit speaks expressly. Where was the Spirit speaking? There can be no doubt that the Spirit was speaking from within Paul. As Paul was writing to Timothy about the church as the house of God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the great mystery of godliness, the Spirit was speaking in his spirit. This is not the Spirit who suddenly descends upon us and causes us to prophesy, “Thus saith the <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> Lord.” The speaking of the Spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95290" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">4:1</span> is according to the way of incarnation. The Spirit spoke from within Paul’s spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="TEeAhbdYtKWqw6yI1MgC4TcMs-e_eTkpLj_mMj8MVB_R8fXfyoAbJmk8kbhCK3EQJ"> If we would hear the speaking of the Spirit, we need to exercise our spirit. Only our spirit can listen to the speaking of the Spirit. The mind is not qualified for this; it lacks the ability to listen to the Spirit’s speaking. The Spirit speaks to our spirit, and our spirit responds to the Spirit. Therefore, as we read 1 Timothy, we must exercise our spirit to listen to the Spirit speaking from within the spirit of the apostle Paul. </p>

The later times, or after times, refer to times after the writing of this book. This differs from the last days in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95292" data-verses="2Timothy 3:1">2 Timothy 3:1</span>, which denote the closing period of this age. </p>
<p data-content-id="Rtdop0ZDZCwfZfnB-FPuN6azyRdKgYuz72dS5T38ZK1M0Oddf9rezYiMl-E85IJzA"> As he was writing this Epistle, Paul realized that in time to come some would depart from the faith. In this verse the faith is objective and refers to the contents of our belief. On the one hand, Paul was bold and encouraged, not in the least disappointed. He believed that the church was the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and even the mystery of godliness. On the other hand, deep within his spirit, he knew that certain so-called believers would depart from the faith, from God’s New Testament economy. Paul could know this because the Spirit who was mingled with his spirit revealed it to him. This departure from God’s New Testament economy would be the beginning of the decline of the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="s0SceBHxfYRRzuUtQgrWqNkhbaakYODS4HIqEhxMmgp28cYIo4zFBmieX618p6nmb"> Paul says that those who depart from the faith will give heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons. Many Christians do not realize that, according to the Bible, there are two categories of evil spirits. The deceiving spirits in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95293" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">4:1</span> are in contrast to the Spirit, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95294" data-verses="1John 4:1">1 John 4:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95295" data-verses="1John 4:3">3</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95296" data-verses="1John 4:6">6</span>. These are the fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion and became his subordinates, who work for his <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> kingdom of darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95297" data-verses="Matthew 25:41">Matt. 25:41</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95298" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>). Demons are the unclean and evil spirits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95299" data-verses="Matthew 12:22">Matt. 12:22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95300" data-verses="Matthew 12:43">43</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95301" data-verses="Luke 8:2">Luke 8:2</span>) of the living creatures on earth in the pre-adamic age who joined Satan’s rebellion and were judged by God (see <em>Life-study of Genesis,</em> Message Two). After being judged, they became demons, working on earth for Satan’s kingdom. The demons differ from the deceiving spirits, the fallen angels. The fallen angels are in the air, whereas the demons are active on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="wZ6ElHpztYhlIyd7KKARNOCorYf4fOe-cNqnRD7FYLkTdvkl-P2d3b3e01SD2fwdi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95302" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">verse 1</span> Paul speaks of both the deceiving spirits in the air and the demons on earth. Among Christians today there are deceptive doctrines which come from the deceiving spirits in the air and also teachings which originate with demons. The history of the church has proved that Paul was right in saying that such teachings and doctrines would come in and that those who depart from the faith would give heed to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="LCa_t3dxTDQd_nIGbao_eCfiBf3dacVZDSGQKyP7vdy9o4Wvb8BuJivNrIs73pMVx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95303" data-verses="1Timothy 4:2">verse 2</span> Paul continues, “In the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron.” The phrase “in the hypocrisy of men who speak lies” modifies teachings of demons in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95304" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1">verse 1</span>. The teachings of demons are carried out in the hypocrisy of those who lie. This indicates that demons and lying speakers collaborate to deceive people. These hypocrites work together with evil spirits and demons to bring in deceitful teachings and demonic doctrines. </p>
<p data-content-id="mY-FFReUkEiYHX_Huns6HwcbgTQRW4E1XyGC1C9aE6KtVdVwotK4c3eOVSEegBjsk"> The conscience of hypocritical liars has lost its sense as if seared with a hot branding iron, an iron used to brand the slaves and cattle of a certain owner. This book strongly stresses the conscience. In the church life the love which is contrary to envy and discord is of a good conscience (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95305" data-verses="1Timothy 1:5">1:5</span>). Those who thrust away a good conscience become shipwrecked regarding the faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95306" data-verses="1Timothy 1:19">1:19</span>). The serving ones in the church must hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95307" data-verses="1Timothy 3:9">3:9</span>). To keep a good and pure conscience is to keep the conscience sensitive in its function. This will safeguard us from the demonic and hypocritical teachings of deceiving liars. <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> </p>

He is one who serves people with Christ. For example, if we say that a man is a serving one of a particular meal, we do not mean, of course, that he belongs to the meal. We mean that he serves others with that meal. In like manner, although it is true that a minister of Christ belongs to Christ, the main thought here is that he serves others with Christ, ministering Christ to them.

<p data-content-id="7wlz5c3TBvsgN13eHWF9qs0hFR4HQ8BOFWztWYkZwsEQ3FftqIBxXczVNR0yhMa6U"> In today’s Christianity there are a great many ministers who belong to Christ, but very few of them minister Christ to others.

<p data-content-id="_PDNxA2HViBGWQO7xsrePdJMpY3eoFVj0LKfSCGNky7YxMDNzis2_KcKBpXgDX2Wr"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95320" data-verses="1Timothy 4:6">Verse 6</span> confirms this understanding of the expression “a good minister of Christ.” Here Paul says, “Laying these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have closely followed.” By “these things” Paul means all he has covered thus far in <span class="pg" data-page-id="70" id="70">[70]</span> this Epistle. Just as a steward lays different courses of food before guests at a dinner, so a good minister of Christ should lay “these things” before the believers. Furthermore, Paul’s use of the term “being nourished” indicates that his concept is that of supplying life to others. It is significant that here Paul does not say “being taught,” but “being nourished” with the words of the faith. If we would minister Christ to others, we ourselves must first be nourished. Being nourished with Christ, we shall have Christ as food, as life supply, to minister to others. The words “being nourished” give us the ground to say that a good minister of Christ does not merely teach others about Christ, but ministers Christ into others as food. Others should be able to testify of us that we have nourished them with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Bc_0rQwrfFVkYaD3THCruFAy0UOPsM-pfbZ1ft5gBVMXUv6I-7dhGbFD0CoVwl1wc"> Throughout the years, my aim in the ministry has been to nourish the saints. No doubt I have passed on a good deal of knowledge. But I can testify that in every message, I exercise my spirit not just to pass on knowledge, but, while I am giving forth a certain kind of knowledge, to supply something nourishing to the Lord’s people. My desire is to minister the riches of Christ as food that the saints may be nourished. Recently, many have written me letters telling how they have been richly fed with Christ through the messages. </p>
<p data-content-id="xjhYFUXGtMKBKu-AhMSGrP9Sm4HRCYd5iOAoLpR_eEb57Ra2ELJ9dwjqEyB2t8lbh"> If you have a heart to care for others in the Lord’s recovery, you should not give them mere teaching. Whenever you fellowship with others concerning Christ, you may give them some knowledge. But while you are teaching them, you need to exercise your spirit to minister spiritual food that they may be nourished. If you do this, you will be a good minister of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="rxLy_0MnNJ2rBVskxjWqRtAEEyOrv3hAoFPs3THTD7ut03xoy64MVKD0HwHhLqtF0"> With Paul and Timothy we see an excellent pattern. As we have pointed out, Paul told Timothy to lay “these things before the brothers,” referring to the things which he was writing in this Epistle. However, before Timothy could lay these things before others, he first had to feed on them himself. He had to digest them, assimilate them, and allow them to saturate his inner being. Then he would be able <span class="pg" data-page-id="71" id="71">[71]</span> to lay them before the brothers. Today we should follow Timothy’s example and lay before the saints the things with which we have been nourished by the Lord through the ministry. How wonderful the church life would be if we all did this! However, if we turn from the ministry and seek to produce something different, we may give place to differing teachings. It was not Timothy’s intention to teach anything different from what Paul taught. Rather, he would lay before the brothers what he had received from Paul. </p>
<p data-content-id="dvZqsRdBmzePY8u4HI5SDnOMo-XVjsndWvgqXKPYeZcq9H4lbRpYwaEP74ZaAeASc"> At this point, I would like to say a word concerning my burden in putting out the Life-study Messages. The aim of these messages is to produce groceries for the local churches. My burden is not mainly to “cook” these spiritual groceries; it is to produce them and supply them to the churches that every local church may be a well-stocked supermarket, filled with a variety of nourishing foods. If the leading ones in a local church lay before the saints the riches contained in the Life-studies, the saints will be abundantly nourished. I have received many letters testifying that this has happened. </p>
<p data-content-id="QDbj9cmb90iNs_aGTp1ZIpIzl1kXdxi26rt9powTfvVwEtU6uDIZ1WLZpUHoba1Hn"> It is a fact of history in the Lord’s recovery that any church which follows the ministry is strong and blessed. But those churches which neglect the ministry and try instead to do something on their own have become a failure. However, in saying these things, I wish to make it very clear that I by no means insist that the churches or the saints read the Life-study Messages. To repeat, my burden is to produce groceries. The churches and the saints are free either to use them or to disregard them. But if the saints cast away the nourishment found in these messages, I wonder what they will feed on. We are what we eat. If we eat the “groceries” produced in today’s religion, we shall be part of religion. Let me say in frankness and honesty that the leading ones need to take “these things” and lay them before the saints that they may be nourished. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ki0GeBu872JWpG9qm8UtJ4bT-87YsokcwP-12Q3TJbOK4T-A9LDd8MkNTKkmUsR0-"> Paul’s expression “laying these things before the brothers” is very significant. We need to be impressed with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> fact that this also is part of the Bible, the Word of God. I do not charge anyone to lay my words before the saints. It is not my practice to charge the churches to do anything. Representatives of hundreds of churches can testify that I do not charge them to do things. I do not even know many of the things that take place in the church in Anaheim, where I live. I am very glad that the elders take action regarding many things without letting me know. This is a strong proof that I am not a pope. Very much to the contrary, I am a little servant of the Lord, a farmer burdened to produce groceries for the saints. Far from charging the churches to do anything, I simply long that they feed on the spiritual riches the Lord has given us. Do not lay Witness Lee’s teaching before the brothers. Instead, present them the riches, the groceries, the Lord has shown us from the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="lCk-Fqu6PPSUJz-DE3XHQ3ih-dvD-yvGa4is89CgV3zwSZa7ejiRaONv1TKmviISf"> I am deeply burdened by the fact that many who love the Lord Jesus and seek Him have been deceived and frustrated. We must find a way to share with them the spiritual riches the Lord has provided us. Many who truly love the Lord are starving. We must take up the burden to supply them with food. We all need to be good ministers of Christ, serving others with His riches. Let us first be nourished ourselves and then minister this nourishment to all the people of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="OxYNPJljrjBNe0-iZirlpjHCOPf3WzXwy1OQARmeVWLSH0-_dJsKpulbYZYApkWXV"> We would emphasize that being nourished is for the growth in life. This is a matter of life and it differs from merely being taught, which is a matter of knowledge. To minister Christ to others requires that we ourselves first be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="lCk-Fqu6PPSUJz-DE3XHQ3ih-dvD_yvbW4is89CgV3zwSZa7ejiRaONv1TKmviISf"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95367" data-verses="1Timothy 3:1">chapter three</span> Paul comes to the high point of God’s economy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95368" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15-16">3:15 and 16</span> we see the divine standard. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95369" data-verses="1Timothy 5:1-16">5:1-16</span> Paul comes down to the human level. On the one hand, in the church life we must have the divine standard; on the other hand, we must care for matters on the human level. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95370" data-verses="1Timothy 5:8">5:8</span>, for example, Paul speaks of providing for our own relatives. All the instructions in this chapter are very human, normal, and ordinary. Nothing is special, miraculous, or supernatural. The whole book is written in the same principle. This is necessary for the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="OxYNPJljrjBNe0-iZirlpjHCOPf3XzXp_1OQARmeVWLSH0-_dJsKpulbYZYApkWXV"> The principle of presenting both the divine standard and the human level is found not only in 1 Timothy, but also in the Epistles of Ephesians and Colossians. In Ephesians Paul first writes concerning the church according to the divine standard. Afterward, on the human level, he writes about husbands, wives, parents, children, slaves, and masters. In like manner, in Colossians Paul first writes about Christ according to the divine standard. Then he speaks on a human level about family matters. In 1 Timothy Paul does not come to the human level directly. Rather, he comes to this level by giving instructions to Timothy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95371" data-verses="1Timothy 5:1-16">5:1-16</span> Paul tells Timothy how to deal with the saints of different ages. My burden in this message is to cover four points from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95372" data-verses="1Timothy 5:1-16">5:1-16</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> </p>

We should never think that if we reach God’s standard, we no longer need to be human. Some believers have been influenced by the false teaching that Christians should be like angels, that it is no longer necessary for them to lead a normal human life. Many monks and priests in Catholicism have a living that is abnormal. Furthermore, the requirement that priests and nuns not be married not only is contrary to humanity, but has its source in demons. According to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95373" data-verses="1Timothy 4:1-3">4:1-3</span>, forbidding others to marry is a demonic teaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="LCa_t3dxTDQd_nIGbao_eCfiBf3dUcVZLSGQKyP7vdy9o4Wvb8BuJivNrIs73pMVx"> We all need to learn to be human. In fact, the more spiritual we are, the more human we shall be. If we would live Christ, we must learn to be human in a genuine way. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was very human. </p>
<p data-content-id="mY-FFReUkEiYHX_Huns6HwcbgTQRY4E1fyGC1C9aE6KtVdVwotK4c3eOVSEegBjsk"> To damage humanity is to ruin both the means and the channel created by God for His economy. The reason demons and fallen angels forbid marriage and command people to abstain from foods is that their intention is to destroy mankind. Thus, we in the church must be human and follow the standards of normal human living. Some have falsely accused us of not being human. We utterly repudiate these allegations. In the church life we definitely emphasize the proper humanity. I can testify that I myself live in a normal human way. If you examine my living, you will find me to be very human. I am not a “saint” or an angel; I am simply a human being. Furthermore, I encourage all the elders to be human. The elders should not help the saints in their locality to be like angels. We appreciate the angels, but we do not want to imitate them. Instead, we prefer to be human. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZO-YN-NQeWP0QHXFl3j6foqIASnx1eImeSweah3MEkR1G70HvqWjV-7vnMGDjkV2E"> We should be human Christians. On the one hand, we have the divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95374" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>); on the other hand, we are normal human beings. The fact that we have the divine nature with the divine life does not mean that we shall ever be deified. Rather, we are to live a genuinely human life by the divine life and nature. In this way we shall be able to <span class="pg" data-page-id="79" id="79">[79]</span> live the highest human life, a life like that of the Lord Jesus. When He was on earth, He lived a human life by means of the divine life and the divine nature. The Lord’s human living was by the divine life. Our human living should be the same. Thus, we all must learn to be human. </p>
<p data-content-id="AkF9ZrENbnPA0KDTX6YGEFZroCrRZuwAZvwN6rCuNsJG0mg1TwXvv1vShee4OEHrI"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95375" data-verses="1Timothy 5:1-16">5:1-16</span> we see that Paul instructed his young co-worker Timothy to contact the saints in a human way. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95376" data-verses="1Timothy 5:1">Verse 1</span> says, “Do not upbraid an elderly man, but entreat him as a father.” To entreat an elderly man as a father is surely to behave in a very human manner. In relation to brothers who are a generation older than they, the younger brothers should deal with them as fathers. </p>
<p data-content-id="F6UVrglQG1-twcyM4TpCcH-XLwHvKFBAYelG8YielY5i86yDEm5pJWXXS1az6gHxG"> Paul also tells Timothy to entreat “younger men as brothers; elderly women as mothers; younger women as sisters.” Timothy was not to assume an elevated position as a bishop, regarding himself as superior to others. On the contrary, he was to behave as a brother to younger brothers and sisters, as a son to a father, and as a son to a mother. In the church life there are many fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters. To deal with the saints as such is to behave humanly. </p>
<p data-content-id="CdSjXbpuP87Dm-ld8UFuafdDIfuP6BghqOB1gCf8kpf83Rpvsw7fObd7WHAnfbfDI"> Our contact with the saints must be in a proper atmosphere and with the right attitude and spirit. The atmosphere, attitude, and spirit in our contact with others mean a great deal. If a young brother assumes some kind of elevated position in relation to an elderly man, the relationship between them will be damaged. But if he would contact him as a son speaking to a father, their fellowship will be intimate, loving, touching, and even inspiring. </p>
<p data-content-id="PcMiyod2Il6edI3nU6PPh17q3ELaMF2N7zxkKqOjzEv4lulb17Efn0IeOVnCxNjLl"> Suppose that in my relationship with the saints I conduct myself as a teacher and treat the saints as my pupils. If this is my attitude, my contact with the saints will be quite poor. But if I am very human in my relationships with the saints and regard myself as a brother among brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, the contact will be loving and intimate. What a difference it makes when we are truly human in our relationships to one another! I repeat, in the church life we all must be human. <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> </p>

His word not to upbraid an elderly man, but to entreat him as a father is a word of wisdom. It is a matter of wisdom not to rebuke sharply an elderly man. In dealing with saints of different ages, we need not only love, but also wisdom. We need to realize whom we are contacting. Are we speaking to an elderly brother or sister? Then we must speak to them as a son to a father or mother. Are we contacting a younger brother or sister? Then we must speak to them as a brother to a brother or a brother to a sister. Furthermore, we should speak one way to a father, another way to a mother, and in other ways to brothers and sisters. For example, in our human family we do not speak in the same way to all members of the family. We do not talk to our father in the same way as we do to our mother. If we speak the same way to all members of our family, we are indeed foolish. In all our relationships with saints of different ages we need wisdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="vwkJm9ePJgdYvAPRiWRpkfc876iQZO7fX1sBTiUHCdbZDEpLTZYp5wiINQjZ19AOt"> If we exercise wisdom, we shall speak differently to saints of different ages. The brothers will talk to brothers in a way appropriate to brothers, but they will speak to sisters in a way appropriate to sisters. This is wisdom. We must not speak to a young sister in the same way as we do to an elderly man. Furthermore, one sister may embrace another. But a young sister should not show her love for a brother, young or old, by embracing him. Do not love the saints in a foolish way. Instead, always exercise wisdom, realizing whom you are contacting. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WCb1_oznaIpXaRJwFpqDBsjzb3m5PAH4V_53DL_G1Wacz__uh_oyD1sYdu54EzxwL">IN ALL PURITY</h2><p data-content-id="2wgj0-h73CTPChY6_YposYcjzRNnmdcqgzLE6a8Cr2t-Ot2Lp4RyFJQqkgT-LT2_5"> Third, all our dealings with the saints must be “in all purity” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95378" data-verses="1Timothy 5:2">5:2</span>). Every contact with the brothers and sisters in the church life must be pure in every way. We need to be pure in our motive and intention. </p>
<p data-content-id="u8dBNz9hGWarPcwyyyxWxbWh1j6FWWmI-nfYJ3tT2Jfni0o_uwSlsxvlsDe5gq2n-"> In the contact between brothers and sisters there is especially the need for all purity. For this reason, a brother and sister who are close to the same age should not <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> talk privately in a closed room. Either another brother or another sister should be present. Consider the example of the Lord Jesus. He spoke to Nicodemus in a house alone at night, but He talked to the Samaritan woman out in the open during the day. This indicates that the contact between brothers and sisters must be in all purity. </p>

The elders are the authority, or the government, of a local church. Thus, to deal with the elders is to deal with the authority, the government, the administration, of the church. For centuries there has been a debate among Christians over the kind of administration there should be in the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95390" data-verses="1Timothy 5:17-25">5:17-25</span> Paul touches the crucial matter of the church’s administration. </p>

For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle a threshing ox, and, The workman is worthy of his pay.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95392" data-verses="1Timothy 5:18">verse 18</span>, the expression “double honor” includes material supply. Especially those who labor in word and teaching should receive this necessary supply. All the elders should be able to take the lead in a local church, but some, not all, have a special capacity in teaching. The word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95393" data-verses="1Timothy 5:17">verse 17</span> denotes the general speaking of doctrines, and teaching denotes instructions concerning particular things. Those who labor in word and teaching may be fully occupied, devoting all their time to this. Therefore, the church and the saints should care for their living. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95394" data-verses="1Timothy 5:18">verse 18</span> Paul refers to what the Scripture says about not muzzling a threshing ox and about the workman being worthy of his pay. <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> </p>

AN ACCUSATION AGAINST AN ELDER</h2><p data-content-id="5cupZmuc-kv8L6F0B-ezTgOZCaZ4ehaqvwzXN7FpS9gnnhiPRZJU-Kz07UZg8st1s"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95395" data-verses="1Timothy 5:19">verse 19</span> Paul goes on to say, “Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses.” According to the Greek here, the accusation made against an elder should not merely be verbal; rather, it should be put in writing. To make an accusation against an elder is a very serious matter. For the sake of accuracy, it should be put in writing and not merely be spoken. Furthermore, it should not be received except on the word of two or three witnesses. </p>
<p data-content-id="4E07MIdp57h1sxuA3mR6lpfzIN4I0BjelJVcsmBLIMeisYmzAxsZ3GVbD4sRfubny"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95396" data-verses="1Timothy 5:19">Verse 19</span> is simple, but it implies something very important. The fact that Timothy was charged by Paul to receive an accusation against an elder indicates that the apostles have authority to deal with the elders after they have been appointed by the apostles to be elders. There is no doubt that the written accusation against an elder was to be presented to Timothy. Who, then, was Timothy? According to those who are in favor of a hierarchical system in which the bishops are over the elders, Timothy is regarded as a bishop. But as we have previously pointed out, according to the New Testament, bishops are elders, and elders are bishops. These terms are synonymous and refer to the same people. We know from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95397" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95398" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:6">2:6</span> that Timothy was an apostle. Furthermore, in the book of 1 Timothy we see that Timothy was the representative of the apostle Paul. Therefore, for an accusation to come to Timothy was for it to come to an apostle. We would expect such an accusation to come to the apostles because they were the ones who had appointed the elders. </p>
<p data-content-id="o3shf443e3LoDfc2_aYhXie0Qale5eZ6xkSAH5amWK3O1DQqZTOUTRMJ7xQfoGyfq"> Some have had the concept from reading Brother Nee’s book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> that once apostles have appointed elders in a particular local church, the apostles do not under any circumstances have the right to interfere with the affairs of that church. This, however, is a misunderstanding of Brother Nee’s word. In another book, <em>Church Affairs,</em> Brother Nee points out that after the elders have been appointed by the apostles, they should take the lead in the church according to the apostles’ teaching. If the elders <span class="pg" data-page-id="85" id="85">[85]</span> lead others astray or if they are wrong in some way, accusation against them can be made by the saints to the apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="3V0cGh5BMcBQefTo_tImIoFUSZuMvDQPAtP1YBQdk22dbD6bvGlfhSt0cM0u5tovf"> However, an apostle is not a pope. If we read the New Testament carefully, we shall see that the elders are not appointed by anyone who is a dictator or who exercises autonomous authority. On the contrary, elders are appointed in the way of life. As the saints in a particular locality meet together to worship God and to serve the Lord, it will be manifested that certain brothers have a greater degree of maturity than others. Although no one will be fully mature, some will be comparatively mature. Not even in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95399" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> did Paul regard himself as matured in full. Because maturity is relative, the qualifications of an elder are not absolute. In other words, an elder’s qualifications are comparative. Among all the saints in a local church, certain brothers, by comparison, are more qualified and mature than others. These brothers are manifested as such before the eyes of the church, and all the saints clearly realize that these are the ones who should be appointed elders. This appointment does not come either by a vote of the congregation or by the exercise of autonomous authority. Instead, elders are selected according to the insight and foresight of the saints. Based upon the saints’ insight and foresight, the apostles then appoint certain ones to be elders. The apostles minister the Word, bring others to the Lord’s salvation, and edify them after they are saved; they also establish these believers as a local church. Therefore, they have the standing and the position to say that those who have been manifested as relatively more mature than others should be appointed elders. </p>
<p data-content-id="GsLpVJUHFBOxjJzcUcmDP4-sAnFuWHi054SvaaARSzm9SwWL2aT2LieTouACqtOH0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95400" data-verses="1Timothy 5:20">verse 20</span> Paul continues, “Those who sin reprove before all that the rest also may be in fear.” The fact that apostles can rebuke elders who sin indicates that the apostles have authority over the elders. The expression “before all” refers to the whole church. A sinning elder should receive public reproof because of his public position. If an elder is reproved publicly, the rest of the elders will be “in fear.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="86" id="86">[86]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="cTvRW77g0VLkDMLKXZ7WI8-vzvVwByiB0Go7jGYY_tm1Sc3nmKngzx-zcvDhYHsP5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95401" data-verses="1Timothy 5:21">Verse 21</span> says, “I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels that you guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality.” The elders in a local church are God’s deputy authority. Dealing with them is a solemn thing before God. Hence, the apostle solemnly charged Timothy before God, Christ, and the angels to do it in such a way that the chosen angels, the good angels with God’s authority, may see that His authority is established and maintained among His redeemed people on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="YRqNCdMs1MHSzKlKbFAMBi0bPLNOBHuqf_99U_1qWzdb8oLlMKVzVY2CBEOfF9g-F"> Paul’s use of the term “chosen angels” indicates that here he is dealing with administration, government, authority. The book of Daniel indicates that the chosen angels are authorities, representatives of God’s administration. Paul deliberately uses the term “chosen angels” to indicate that here his instructions are related to administration, government, and authority in the church. Paul not only charged Timothy before God and Christ Jesus, but also charged him before the chosen angels. </p>
<p data-content-id="EN4PVGAc-7eqi8EmXrtOINjdwYa-iLhBwjtwotPAJ7N7I33QKgJu54hISDhduhfVD"> Paul’s charge to Timothy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95402" data-verses="1Timothy 5:21">verse 21</span> was to “guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality.” To guard is to observe and keep. Prejudice refers to prejudgment, condemnation, before hearing the case, and partiality refers to inclination, favor, or bias. The words “without prejudice” imply without prejudgment to the credit of the accuser, whereas “doing nothing by way of partiality” implies no perverted favor to the accused elder. On the one hand, Timothy was not to take sides with those who made an accusation against an elder. To give them credit in a hasty way would be to show prejudice. On the other hand, Timothy was not to be partial, not to show perverted favor, to the elder against whom the accusation was made. Therefore, in handling an accusation against an elder, three matters should be observed: first, there must be the word of two or three witnesses; second, there should be no prejudice; and third, nothing should be done by partiality. No credit should be given privately to the accusers, and there should not be any perverted favor toward the one accused. <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95411" data-verses="1Timothy 6:1-2">verses 1 and 2</span> he speaks concerning slaves. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95412" data-verses="1Timothy 6:3">verse 3</span> he suddenly refers to teaching differently and not consenting to healthy words. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95413" data-verses="1Timothy 6:7">verse 7</span> he begins to talk about the love of money. Apparently the dealing with slaves has nothing to do with different teachings, and the different teachings are not related to the love of money. Nevertheless, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95414" data-verses="1Timothy 6:1-10">6:1-10</span> Paul put these things together. This is indicated by the word “if” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95415" data-verses="1Timothy 6:3">verse 3</span> and the word “for” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95416" data-verses="1Timothy 6:7">verse 7</span>. The use of these words at the beginning of these verses indicates that they are a continuation of the foregoing verses. </p>
<p data-content-id="iJ3HTIBT6JSLCcT54mk-giE7SdJQ1mVBmr-LK0YV9Nm9H96Ek80CkDOgiaJpAsx9D"> In studying the Bible we should not be careless. Even little words such as “if” and “for” deserve our attention. Paying attention to words such as these often can bring in light. These words not only enable us to see the continuation in thought; they also afford a way for light to come in. Because by the Lord’s mercy we have received so much light from the Word, we can say that in the recovery we know the Bible in the way of life, light, and spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="1qEzFLCxRYl7H4L30QbgjoRReXev98e2lXeUZWPYjRG9ELzNy6dY6EWMTUn5is62h"> In the United States today there are different kinds of theology. Certain seminaries teach modernistic theology, which denies the authority of the Bible and teaches that Jesus was merely a man, that His death on the cross was not for redemption but was merely an act of martyrdom, and that He did not rise from the dead. In the theology departments of some secular colleges and universities, religion and theology are regarded merely as part of man’s culture. <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> However, in other seminaries fundamental theology is taught. Nevertheless, the standard concerning the truth is not very high. The highest standard of theology found among Christians today in the United States is that which has its source in the teachings of the Brethren, especially as those teachings were made popular by Dr. C. I. Scofield and his famous Reference Bible and correspondence courses. Although Scofield adopted nearly all the teachings of the Brethren, he rejected the Brethren way to practice the church life. The leading teacher among the Brethren was J. N. Darby. Anyone who calls himself a theologian but who is not familiar with the writings of Darby is not a theologian of the highest caliber. </p>
<p data-content-id="9Smf7SUWjn2SWjpx7teh4pesshl13ca5XXuvfmSMcF8OAjqa8hUmgDk1QbVcLjY2F"> In 1925 I wrote to Brother Nee asking him which book, according to his knowledge, would be the best to help me understand the Bible verse by verse. As a young believer, I was eager to obtain a thorough knowledge of the Word of God. I wanted to understand every verse of the Bible, from the first verse in Genesis to the last verse in Revelation. Brother Nee told me that the best help in knowing the Bible in this way was Darby’s <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible.</em> Eight years later he gave me a copy of this five volume work. </p>
<p data-content-id="j1mDP1tAZC-MYJgFOtHZHTRwfJlOSZSYWVxo0jG_Ey440xNI27_7dsqXd_20_J4z3"> J. N. Darby and his contemporaries were great teachers of the Bible. According to history, the Bible was opened more to the Brethren teachers than to anyone who had gone before them. These Brethren teachers did not know the Word merely according to tradition or according to letters in black and white; they knew the Bible according to fresh light which came directly from the Lord. Having been enlightened by the Lord, they received the vision and the revelation of many truths in the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="ppGSFBdi8A8q_TxbSBz_b79UsJOajpgmr8iCjX2Se9oQcpahFwP3Lyl4hRjtD6xpv"> Christians today often talk about the Bible in dead letters. Some are familiar with Bible geography and history; they also know certain elementary teachings. However, they may not have any light or revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="vwkJm9ePJgdYvAPRiWRpkfc876iURO7ff1sBTiUHCdbZDEpLTZYp5wiINQjZ19AOt"> We have pointed out that it is possible for Christians to speak of certain Bible doctrines as if they were nothing <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> more than old-womanish tales. For some, even the doctrine of justification by faith is a “tale.” For example, a particular Lutheran pastor in China fifty years ago taught justification by faith. Nevertheless, he himself was an opium smuggler. As far as he was concerned, justification by faith was nothing more than a “tale.” Concerning this matter, he was altogether without light or revelation. One day an elderly lady evangelist from Norway, who was very prevailing in the preaching of regeneration, stopped this Lutheran pastor after a meeting and asked him if he had been regenerated. When he tried to tell her that he had been regenerated, she said that simply by looking at his face, she knew that he had not been regenerated. This Lutheran pastor was insulted and so much filled with hatred for this lady evangelist that he plotted that night to murder her. But at that very hour the Holy Spirit enlightened him and rebuked him, and he repented and cried to the Lord. The next morning when this lady evangelist saw him, she looked at his face and said, “Praise the Lord, you have been regenerated!” Then in the meeting this pastor gave his testimony with great impact. This influenced hundreds of young people to be saved. The case of this Lutheran pastor illustrates the difference between knowing the Bible merely according to the black and white letters and knowing the Word according to the shining of the divine light. </p>
<p data-content-id="WCb1_oznaIpXaRJwFpqDBsjzb3m9HAH0X_53DL_G1Wacz__uh_oyD1sYdu54EzxwL"> Among Christians today there are many old-womanish tales. Not only are there “tales” about doctrine, but also “tales” having to do with so-called miracles. A certain Pentecostal pastor once told me about teeth that were supposedly filled miraculously with gold. Another Pentecostal minister claimed that in a certain meeting a person in the congregation miraculously spoke in Chinese. Both stories, however, were nothing more than “tales.” </p>
<p data-content-id="2wgj0-h73CTPChY6_YposYcjzRNjudcmizLE6a8Cr2t-Ot2Lp4RyFJQqkgT-LT2_5"> The apostle’s teaching in 1 Timothy is far superior to old-womanish tales. Furthermore, in this Epistle there is no mention of miraculous things. On the contrary, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95417" data-verses="1Timothy 5:23">5:23</span> Paul tells Timothy, “No longer drink water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> weaknesses.” Here Paul does not exercise a miraculous gift to heal his co-worker. Instead, he encourages Timothy to be human, not religious, and to care for his health in a human way. </p>
<p data-content-id="u8dBNz9hGWarPcwyyyxWxbWh1j6BeWmE4nfYJ3tT2Jfni0o_uwSlsxvlsDe5gq2n-"> Many of those who teach the Bible do not have any light or revelation.

Where can you hear a message from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95418" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span> on the subject of God’s dispensation in the New Testament? By the Lord’s mercy, He has shined upon us and made known His truth. For this reason, I hope that reputable theologians and professors will study the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages, even study them in a critical way. I believe that if they study our writings, they will receive light. </p>

Furthermore, Paul charges the slaves who have believing masters to serve them in a proper way. Paul concludes <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95422" data-verses="1Timothy 6:2">verse 2</span> with the words, “These things teach and exhort.” </p>

<p data-content-id="kVxuivPS9X1V1UyRsTkZUSzzmqLv1jddpAImj63iPzxJ0GssWH8z5RRuT2iUfEmHJ"> Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95423" data-verses="1Timothy 6:3-4">verses 3 and 4</span> Paul goes on to say, “If anyone teaches differently and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness, he is blinded with pride.” To teach differently is to teach things that differ from the apostles’ teaching centered on Christ and the church. The “healthy words” here refer to the health of life. The sound teaching of the apostles ministers healthy teaching as the supply of life to people. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are words of <span class="pg" data-page-id="95" id="95">[95]</span> life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95424" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>); hence, they are healthy words. The healthy words of the Lord are the source of the teaching according to godliness. When the Lord’s words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching according to godliness. The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness—a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jdyqs46wmuS0ibK74qeFbAazIJWUrBjFvHJvRJAOxtOtbM7TvFAljY4iLSn4F2wZF"> Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95425" data-verses="1Timothy 6:3">6:3</span> concerning teaching differently indicates that even his teaching concerning slaves was according to the healthy words of the Lord Jesus. Paul’s teaching was according to godliness. However, because some did not consent to healthy words, they taught differently. They did not teach according to godliness. Thus, there is definitely a connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95426" data-verses="1Timothy 6:2-3">verses 2 and 3</span>. </p>

God’s desire is to produce men of God by dispensing Himself into those who believe in Christ. A man of God is one who partakes of God’s life and nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95447" data-verses="John 1:13">John 1:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95448" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>) and thus becomes one with Him in His life and nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95449" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>) and thereby expresses Him. This corresponds to the mystery of godliness, which is God manifest in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95450" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Tim. 3:16</span>). </p>

Timothy must flee the negative things previously mentioned in this Epistle. He should pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and meekness. It is significant that Paul does not tell Timothy to pursue power, gifts, miracles, and theological training. Furthermore, as we shall see, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95452" data-verses="1Timothy 6:12">verse 12</span> Paul does not charge him to fight for his theology or to lay hold on the doctrinal knowledge he has accumulated. However, many Christians today pursue power, fight for doctrines, and lay hold on theological knowledge, and they charge the younger generation to do the same. They also promote natural gifts, talents, and abilities. But in 1 Timothy very little is said of man’s ability. Concerning the eldership, Paul tells Timothy that an <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> elder should be apt to teach. This refers to the ability to instruct others like a parent helping a child with homework. Paul’s emphasis in 1 Timothy definitely is not on power, gifts, or natural ability. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZO-YN-NQeWP0QHXFl3j6foqIASn1-eIDWSweah3MEkR1G70HvqWjV-7vnMGDjkV2E"> Paul charges Timothy to pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and meekness. Righteousness is a matter of being right with people before God according to God’s righteous and strict requirements. If we would be those who carry out God’s dispensation for the building up of local churches as the expression of Christ, we must pursue righteousness. We must seek to be right with God and man. </p>
<p data-content-id="AkF9ZrENbnPA0KDTX6YGEFZroCrVSuwhQvwN6rCuNsJG0mg1TwXvv1vShee4OEHrI"> In the second place, we should pursue godliness, the expression of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95453" data-verses="1Timothy 4:7">4:7</span> Paul told Timothy to exercise himself unto godliness. A man of God should not pursue power or miraculous gifts. Instead, he should pursue righteousness and godliness; he should seek to be right with God and man in order to be a living expression of God in every way. This is to live a daily life which manifests God. </p>

Faith is to believe in God and His word and to trust in Him and His word. As we have pointed out, faith involves an organic union by contacting God through the Word and in the Spirit. Faith, therefore, denotes a living union. Instead of pursuing a great work, we should pursue the organic union with the Triune God. </p>

<p data-content-id="elT0gVUK5kyUGgKSQdziJQQPv3mhPkq55liRMPE9ZXoKYOukxDqjoQxtA8Eapfi4x"> Paul also speaks of endurance and meekness. We should pursue endurance, the ability to bear sufferings and persecutions, and also meekness, which is a proper attitude in facing opposition. It is certain that if we live a godly life, we shall suffer. The world opposes God. If we live God and also live out God, expressing Him, we shall be opposed and attacked by the godless world. Thus, we should pursue endurance, and we should also pursue meekness. </p>

In particular, it is to fight for Christ as the embodiment of God and for the church as the Body of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tsOv7-7aI3P8Y7ydZ4tQKtPbdI21Il45zMdhBqIQGE1kAwgtSK3_HgXEIRjvK4cx5">LAYING HOLD ON ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="h1FSYu3NX9haREMmgHzgYcnfyXbWxJgRJwwls_tBoCO9SPx_hM7SOQMcTh-0TsVli"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95459" data-verses="1Timothy 6:12">verse 12</span> Paul also says, “Lay hold on the eternal life to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.” The eternal life here is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which is eternal. Eternal denotes the nature more than the time element of the divine life. To fight the good fight of the faith in the Christian life, especially in the Christian ministry, we need to lay hold on this divine life and not trust in our human life. Hence, in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, the eternal life is stressed again and again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="95460" data-verses="1Timothy 1:16">1 Tim. 1:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95461" data-verses="1Timothy 6:19">6:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95462" data-verses="2Timothy 1:1">2 Tim. 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95463" data-verses="2Timothy 1:10">10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95464" data-verses="Titus 1:2">Titus 1:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95465" data-verses="Titus 3:7">3:7</span>). To bring forth God’s dispensation concerning the church in 1 Timothy, to confront the process of the church’s decline in 2 Timothy, and to maintain good order in the church life in Titus, this life is a prerequisite. </p>
<p data-content-id="U2wGFzAwRCJuqmxh9x9Yl3_VURW7aU8oq3OWrFpG6VePcsOE7qW0cjG6PGgLZFr_K"> We have been called to the eternal life of God. We were born of the human natural life, but we were reborn of the divine eternal life when we were called by God in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="MB3vpRQ-uHq7qpTzm8SKn147bJZvzOid53KEtSm7BmJi6jnhWkhuaKBfr0sMdy5J-"> The words “confessed the good confession before many witnesses” may refer to Timothy’s confession of the faith at his baptism. At that time Timothy probably confessed a good confession of the eternal life before many witnesses, as we all should do, believing and being assured that he had received the life of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="VmNQZkTbEhFHcnW_tODWvUVTxkAKrV0amQawAEBJj0MWN1nYfoGRYkSGTDRVE3q6n"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95466" data-verses="1Timothy 6:11-12">Verses 11 and 12</span> are a marvelous summary of nearly the whole New Testament. A man of God should pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and meekness; he should fight for God’s New Testament economy and lay hold on eternal life. All these matters are essential aspects of the New Testament. In contrast, the beasts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95467" data-verses="Revelation 13:1">Revelation 13</span> and the lake of fire in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95468" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">Revelation 20</span> cannot compare with these essential aspects. We today must fight the good fight of the faith. This means that we must fight <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> for Christ as the embodiment of God and for the church as the Body of Christ. Furthermore, we must not merely fight objectively, but fight subjectively by laying hold on eternal life. We should not do anything apart from this life. We should speak to our husband or wife and to our children not by the natural life, but by the eternal life. Even in the matter of buying a pair of shoes, we should live according to the eternal life to which we have been called. As today’s Timothys, we need to lay hold on eternal life. </p>
<p data-content-id="iJ3HTIBT6JSLCcT54mk-giE7SdJQ2mVQsr-LK0YV9Nm9H96Ek80CkDOgiaJpAsx9D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="95469" data-verses="1Timothy 6:12">verse 12</span> Paul specifically says that we have been called to eternal life. No other book in the New Testament speaks of “the eternal life to which you were called.” This is a particular characteristic of 1 Timothy. Do you realize that you have been called to eternal life? This eternal life does not mainly refer to blessings in the future. To be called to eternal life does not mean that we have been called to enjoy blessings in heaven. Eternal life should be our life today, a life for our present daily living. By our first birth, the physical birth, we received the Adamic life. But because we have been called to eternal life, we should no longer live the Adamic life, the natural life. Yes, we must be truly human, even Jesusly human, but not in our natural life. On the contrary, we need to live a human life by the eternal life. We have been called to this life, and now we need to live it. </p>
<p data-content-id="1qEzFLCxRYl7H4L30QbgjoRReXev-8ejuXeUZWPYjRG9ELzNy6dY6EWMTUn5is62h"> I am deeply burdened concerning this matter of being called to the eternal life. I am especially concerned for those dear saints who have been distracted from the eternal life to which we have been called and who have become preoccupied with other things. We have been called uniquely to eternal life. This life, the divine life, is actually the Triune God Himself. Having been called to eternal life, we now should lay hold on this life, live this life, and have our whole being according to this life. </p>

This indicates that we must focus our attention on life. Every aspect of our Christian walk must be something to which God can give life. </p>
