<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="EpQqr6LrdD_KwyXe2sKuufMtA60Mtv0vPQ31R5-MBHHNZFqcCHLPXL7HdJwQYlQQf">A WORD OF INTRODUCTION</h2><p data-content-id="Dll3DuRRWmEY_e7wOtGyp8m7CCaCmQMg-F4ZlLCgTuqjITUyNx32870TbZn89SK21"> The Bible is God’s speaking. It has two sections. In the first section, the Old Testament, God spoke by the prophets, and in the second section, the New Testament, He spoke in the Son (in the Person of the Son, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61214" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1-2">Heb. 1:1-2</span>). This section is composed of the four Gospels, the book of Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation. While He was in the flesh, the Son began to speak in the four Gospels. After His resurrection, He continued to speak as the Spirit through the Apostles (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61215" data-verses="John 16:12-14">John 16:12-14</span>). Thus, the New Testament is just the Son’s speaking to us, His ministering Himself as life and everything that we may become His Body, His expression, the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="SnnIBcYQ6GOgEVU9Y-WDRt-N3h3ImDxhJIJAeeHvCpNIcZtm5FOuu8yTWPrFWwKrI"> The Bible is a book of life. This life is nothing less than the living Person of Christ. In the Old Testament Christ is portrayed as the coming One. In the New Testament, the One whose coming was predicted has come. Thus, the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old. St. Augustine once said that the New Testament is contained in the Old, and the Old Testament is expressed in the New. These two testaments are actually one, revealing one Person who is our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="griJiQSzWDsTHQrY15c2IqyddG8P7qlHqfQNmQzPjsR2H__7IlxH4gAwVvsjwJPy_">THE OPENING WORD<br/>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="ermM79o3c7gIZ6fj0t83Ef8spv9-RnI7GLl4Rg4SnJsEHKTtBz-MXbVRwcSoiwm-8"> Nearly all Christians are bothered by the first page of <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> the New Testament. It has many names that are difficult to pronounce. But this page is the first part of the New Testament. In any kind of writing, both the opening word and the closing word are important. When many Christians come to the New Testament, they skip over the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61216" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">chapter one</span> of Matthew and start reading at <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61217" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">verse 18</span>. It seems that in their New Testament there is no such paragraph as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61218" data-verses="Matthew 1:1-17">Matthew 1:1-17</span>. But thank God for this rich portion of the Word! This genealogy of Christ is an abstract of the whole Old Testament. It includes everything except the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis. If we would know the meaning of this genealogy, we need to know the entire Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vZ4c2FmvRhFYy9KXWfewGcUWRrnhpGivAsvf60EPiaORrMA-PvfbxqIsqyp_yVRSc">A LIVING PICTURE OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="WWGHooZ2WvfHwkZEtdUYcnp0llmzdOzoCt58J59Q4MzZapG0HpWdhZ-zZkqTUkubc"> We need to say a word concerning the New Testament. The New Testament is simply a living picture of a Person. This Person is too wonderful. He is both God and man. He is the mingling of God with man, for in Him the divine nature and the human nature are mingled together. He is the King, and He is a bondslave. He is wonderful!</p>
<p data-content-id="2xgZ0nXLKCi_8HSb7r0qyibcJwUBRo9SRNcNIlG6PuipELBsVUNCwYBGZffenbxQi"> No human being has ever spoken words like He spoke, words so profound, yet so clear. For example, Jesus said, “I am the bread of life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61219" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>), and, “I am the light of the world” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61220" data-verses="John 8:12">John 8:12</span>). Plato and Confucius were two great philosophers, and people appreciated the things they said, but neither of them could say, “I am the light of the world.” No one else could say, “I am the life,” or, “I am the way,” or, “I am the reality” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61221" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>). These are simple words and short sentences—“I am,” “I am what I am,” and “I am that I am”—but they are great and profound. Can any of us say that we are the light of the world or that we are the life? If we did, we would surely be sent to a mental hospital. But Jesus could say these things. How great He is!</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uhrNT43xO_qwGlqNZpptA32VH3ZuwgINmCaNJZiID-2svPbLWpCwg9eHFIuy4yQvW">FOUR BIOGRAPHIES OF ONE PERSON</h2><p data-content-id="fleo7fcOpJvNrupbaAzldTYaU7g_109ySLIOr03uj0FOd-46ncgem8mYMh50SmrxS"> Jesus is all-inclusive. With Him there are many aspects. No one can exhaust in language who and what He is. Who <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> else in history has four unique biographies written of him? Although the New Testament is a short book, it begins with four biographies of one Person, four books telling us of the life of Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="I4LvZeA_P9SNvkT0wtxtqp_MOfy-joEe3nm1uxTCEmY8YFFYDNpWDh0N7PwE6T6OX"> Each of us has four sides: the front and the back, the right and the left. If you look at me from the front, you can see seven holes on my face. But if I turn my back to you, all the holes disappear. On my right side you can see a little hole, and on my left side, another little hole. If you would make an accurate copy of my image, you need to take a picture of every side. This is exactly what has been done in the New Testament.</p>
<p data-content-id="H8IQbnycPGz-R9aFVTCkNy3-7dPc132MKtfElw_Lm43sW6JLe8ZN8PPqIIykp2K_u"> Why do we have four Gospels? Because Christ has at least four main aspects. Christ is great! Because He is all-inclusive and unsearchably rich, He needs several biographies. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John present different aspects of Christ because each writer was a different kind of person. Matthew, for instance, was a tax collector. Among the Jewish people in ancient times, a tax collector was a despised person. Nevertheless, Matthew wrote the first biography of Christ. Mark was an ordinary man, and Luke was a physician and a Gentile. At first, John was a common fisherman, but eventually he became the very aged, experienced apostle. Each wrote a different biography about the same Christ. This living Person needs many biographies.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="XjNhnxq8pOBRIQJgfNj4HIL6cPBWvooVWpyDh1eEHtno6bC8_SGyD6n6kKA8O2GNB">THE EXPANSION OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="k8a9Mehyf9H71QPewDInv1Q3Aq069jLZd9yw23ONbZ7XFqXXrLNjP1qqvKoJw6HIh"> The book of Acts is the expansion of this wonderful Person. It is the branching out of the all-inclusive Christ. This Christ has expanded from one Person to thousands and thousands of persons. He was once the individual Christ, but in Acts He has become a corporate Christ. Following the Acts, we have all the Epistles, which give a full definition of this wonderful, universal, great Man. Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body: this is the universal Man, Christ and the church. Finally, we have the book of Revelation as the consummation of the New Testament. This book gives us a full picture of the Body-Christ, the individual Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> incorporated with all His members to become the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JRY8MaLJKtf6efzbzG58lbjhcIkVg09yHQu46f5uWlaIY-J16MAf81zwk8d8J-hvN">THE ORDER OF THE FOUR GOSPELS</h2><p data-content-id="zeI6BsewlXT9QG5Y864_M3uULTdtKevtEil80zoGzPhHgqih6rw1YfLAvzeK55gIY"> Let us return to the four Gospels. If I were to arrange the four Gospels, I would put the Gospel of John first. When reading the Bible, many Christians start with John and then proceed to read Luke, Mark, and Matthew. The human concept is the exact opposite of the divine. The divine concept starts with Matthew and proceeds through John; the human thought starts with John and goes back to Matthew. Many of us would begin reading the New Testament with John because John is so wonderful. It is a book of life. After John, we would read Luke because Luke is a book of the Savior, telling us of many cases of salvation. Then, of course, we would come to Mark because Mark is short and simple. People read Matthew last because Matthew is too difficult, too mysterious. Not only is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61222" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">chapter one</span> difficult to understand; the parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61223" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> and the prophecies in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61224" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapters twenty-four</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61225" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">chapters twenty-five</span> are also difficult. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61226" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61227" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61228" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span>, the Sermon on the Mount, are especially difficult. No one can practice it! You strike me on the right cheek, and I turn to you the left. You force me to walk one mile, and I walk two miles. You take my outer garment, and I give you my inner garment. This is too much! Only Jesus can do it! Thus, many place Matthew last. John is dear and precious. In John, Jesus is everything, and we do not need to do anything. Hence, we like John, but not Matthew. We may not say this in plain words, but we have such a feeling in our heart. Nevertheless, the divine order is best. God put Matthew first.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="abSJWp_OwRzajN9ql34uZdMG6nyF2_ct6UGsDGXLuJJ-nMTFTDNm0IxFal6L5FIAr">THE GENERAL SKETCH</h2><p data-content-id="bxL4Xdo_wuMUnW9-yOhGcTntiYMT5Z5QqCEsbK7COLzrP4JRhUioM-j2smfPMA4Nf"> With every book of the Bible we need a general sketch. The general sketch of Matthew is:</p>
<p class="quotesm" data-content-id="qIPXFTTqQB63s-xSEjzWM1c5CbCrQRlETbglenJKAt55NkZWNqM-G2-4TYyM6p0p7"> Christ is Jehovah God incarnated to be the King-Savior who came to establish the kingdom of the heavens (the <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> heavenly rule) by saving His people from sin (of rebellion) through His death and resurrection.</p>

The central thought of Matthew is:</p>
<p class="quotesm" data-content-id="0b4FGv9be2FPEifP5IOzb9iXulAm4Jvxpwry4Tqquizz_t8SLS7hnCkKKnf5q6lHb"> Christ, as Jesus (Jehovah the Savior) and Emmanuel (God with us), is the King, the Baptizer, the light, the Teacher, the Healer, the Forgiver, the Bridegroom, the Shepherd, the Friend, the wisdom, the rest, the greater temple, the real David, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, the greater Solomon, the Sower, the seed, the Feeder, the bread, the crumbs under the table, the Christ, the Son of the living God, the rock for the church, the Builder of the church, the Founder of the kingdom, the present Moses, the present Elijah, the Head of the corner, the Lord, the resurrected One, the One with authority, and the One ever-present to His people in resurrection.</p>

<p data-content-id="7gOUzACjtGFQwhTPxMOjxTfP-z5pCXkSeLBKMv-G9vbSz9FwafEz5B7ukzfuDDj_q"> How rich Christ is in the book of Matthew, even richer than in John. As Jesus and Emmanuel He is another thirty-three items to us. We must enjoy Him and partake of Him. We need to experience Him in all these aspects in resurrection, not in the natural state. He is the ever-present One. Matthew begins with “God with us” and ends with “Lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the completion of the age.” How wonderful this is!</p>

<p data-content-id="xT_UZXnNTr4EKhCRQA-M3mQ_0LEcIPkkzx1gjA5pn5v100-KzMBYBIM75WRWfJSbp"> Among the four Gospels only two, Matthew and Luke, have genealogies. Matthew tells us that Jesus is the proper descendant of the royal family, that He is the legal heir of the royal throne. Such a person surely needs a genealogy telling of His origin and descent. Luke presents Jesus as a proper, normal man. To show Jesus as a proper man also requires a genealogy. In Mark, Jesus is pictured as a bondslave, as one <span class="pg" data-page-id="6" id="6">[6]</span> sold into slavery. A bondslave has no need of a genealogy; hence, Mark does not include one. John tells us that Jesus is God. “In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God.” With Him there was no beginning, no descent. He is eternal, with no beginning of life nor end of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61229" data-verses="Hebrews 7:3">Heb. 7:3</span>). In the beginning was God! For John to talk about His genealogy would be ridiculous.</p>
<p data-content-id="rrHHs6EB2hifkbOEsDvdjsK31fhIeANh58k6aj_wsbQZxSyrmyshzF2TGMpzE32_a"> With anybody else, no matter who he is or how many biographies people write about him, the genealogy will be exactly the same. But Jesus has two genealogies. Later on we shall see how these genealogies eventually become one. Once again we see that He is wonderful. In every aspect, He is too wonderful.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="dWQGQdEDRC5zuJZX8AMIf2Vr4GlgC5d74WTtePoRmZt-8k_JsT4Mkew34IjKVg9Nt">A. The Generation of Christ</h2><p data-content-id="QRe98RapaaaKaU9rvUrwonnvgQ29XFHwo0MNs9lb0EHIgRGLmx9NJZbe_kkxe-sUH"> Now we come to the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. We need to realize who Jesus is. Who is Jesus? We may answer by saying that He is the Son of God, but this genealogy does not have such a term. Rather, it calls Him the son of David and the son of Abraham. Because Jesus is so wonderful, it is difficult to say who He is.</p>
<p data-content-id="KQtTXmFXrPslnaSFbZUEED9dYBzobq-W2fVGm40PJRyaqhCmMxfi9Y-SX06t3vdRz"> Jesus is the mingling of God with man, the mingling of divinity with humanity. This is the generation of Jesus. The generation of Jesus means that He is the mingling, the wonderful mingling. In this generation we have the mingling of the divine Being with so many human beings, with all kinds of people. We should no longer think that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61230" data-verses="Matthew 1:1-17">Matthew 1:1-17</span> is just a list of names.</p>
<p data-content-id="l2KaTr_EtXQZHQHojlDtFEB9DlHISdj89KCjc7XWkauiPfcbMlkYte7eKt5OLxP2N"> The generation of Christ is composed of:</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="OxkYcRq8v6B7_MmBZGDr2t-nXX4eJDCaUrjxjOW5CR5JzI0x6mWbwtXLMT_PvkFVK">1.

The poor people, the little people, are also included in the generation of Christ. Christ was ranked not only with the patriarchs and with the kings, but also with a group of civilians. He was not only of the great ones, of the royal ones, but also of the little ones. From this picture of the generation of Christ, we can see that it includes all kinds of people.</p>
<p data-content-id="YGzD_YG4vTnIweS_DzVjv96THQf_MjMY1-7P2uJlME-fgOaZdIg57DhGUoi5FJ-VW"> This generation includes both the called ones, like Abraham, and the ones carried away to captivity. In this brief record we have the words “carrying away” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61233" data-verses="Matthew 1:17">v. 17</span>). Abraham was called out of Babel, the origin of Babylon. The generation of Christ includes not only the called ones, but also the backsliders. Perhaps five years ago you were a called one, but today you are a backslider. Do not be disappointed. The generation of Christ includes you. This generation includes Jeconiah, a king who was dethroned and carried away to Babylon as a captive. Have you ever been dethroned? Do not think you have not. In your Christian life you sometimes have been dethroned. Once you were a king, but you lost your kingship and became a backslider. Our forefather Abraham came from Babylon; yet you went back, not willingly, but were carried back. Praise the Lord that the generation of Christ includes even the fallen ones!</p>
<p data-content-id="EpQqr6LrdD_KwyXe2sKuufMtBokMtv0vPQ31R5-MBHHNZFqcCHLPXL7HdJwQYlQQf"> After captivity there was the recovery. Hence, we have another name, Zerubbabel, the name of recovery. Many captives returned with Zerubbabel. The generation of Christ includes all kinds of people: good ones, bad ones, called ones, fallen ones, and recovered ones. If I were to ask you which kind you are, you may say that firstly you were a called one, then a fallen one, and finally a recovered one. You were an Abraham, you became a Jeconiah, but today you are a Zerubbabel. We are all Zerubbabels. We are the called ones, the fallen ones, and the recovered ones. <span class="pg" data-page-id="8" id="8">[8]</span> </p>

The Four Remarried Women</h2><p data-content-id="SnnIBcYQ6GOgEVU9Y-WDRt-N0yHImDxhJIJAeeHvCpNIcZtm5FOuu8yTWPrFWwKrI"> According to Jewish custom, a writer of a genealogy would never include a female name; he would include only the names of males. But in this brief genealogy five women are mentioned. These five women are like the fingers of my hand: four form one group and the other one stands alone. Four of these five women were remarried, and one of the four was a harlot. It seems that the divine record here would not mention the good ones, such as Sarah or Rebekah, but the bad ones. Listen to the divine record: “David begot Solomon of the wife of Uriah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61234" data-verses="Matthew 1:6">1:6</span>). The record does not even give her name; it gives only her history in order to remind us of what kind of person she was.</p>
<p data-content-id="griJiQSzWDsTHQrY15c2IqydRV8P7qlHqfQNmQzPjsR2H__7IlxH4gAwVvsjwJPy_"> Do you know the history of Tamar? She was the daughter-in-law of Judah. Judah begot twins of his daughter-in-law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61235" data-verses="Genesis 38:24-30">Gen. 38:24-30</span>). How terrible! The second woman named is Rahab, the harlot of Jericho, and the third, Ruth, a Moabitess. The Moabites were not allowed to enter the congregation of the Lord even to their tenth generation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61236" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:3">Deut. 23:3</span>). The Moabites are descendants of Moab, who was born of Lot with his daughter. The fourth woman was Bathsheba, the wife of a Canaanite named Uriah whom David murdered. David took her to be his wife, and with her he begot Solomon.</p>
<p data-content-id="ermM79o3c7gIZ6fj0t83Ef8sk8t-RnI7GLl4Rg4SnJsEHKTtBz-MXbVRwcSoiwm-8"> Why does this brief record mention all these women? It is because they are our representatives. Do not think you are so pure, that you are more pure than these women. Trace your own origin. If you do, you will find out by what way and of whom your grandfather was born, by what way and of whom your father was born, and by what way and of whom you were born. We are worse. But the worst ones are included in the generation of Christ! Praise the Lord! He is truly the Savior of sinners.</p>
<p data-content-id="5Y773SPR77C2H0B4RbzP5Eeim_iypWlUDUYHIQCu6uAD4q_U_UK0S2LqwPxdyeFfU"> The number four signifies all the creatures, including the entire human race.

<p data-content-id="N-ZaYPyZqODWNh5PVTFlqZDLK4yHS3WtXnGfD2YNzWmPzlEiEdCjCFgT0nq9Pqwmq"> If we were to write a biography of Christ and there were <span class="pg" data-page-id="9" id="9">[9]</span> no biographies of Him in the Bible, we would not dare to write it this way. We would hide all these impure grandmothers and give the names of the good grandmothers, such as Sarah and Rebekah. But the Holy Spirit did not mention Sarah, Rebekah, and all the good ones; however, He purposely included these impure ones. If this divine record had listed the names of the good women without the names of the impure ones, I would be in doubt about the present situation of the church. I would say, “Look at today’s situation in the church. Not many are very pure.” Do not think that you are so pure, so clean. We are not pure. Nevertheless, the generation of Christ includes both good ones and bad ones. In fact, it includes more bad ones than good ones.</p>

First, he was a type of Christ inheriting the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61240" data-verses="2Samuel 7:12">2 Sam. 7:12b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61241" data-verses="2Samuel 7:13">13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61242" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:5">Jer. 23:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61243" data-verses="Luke 1:32-33">Luke 1:32-33</span>). Second, Solomon had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61244" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">Matthew 12</span> we see that Christ also had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. In this chapter Christ referred to Himself as the greater Solomon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61245" data-verses="Matthew 12:42">v. 42</span>). A greater than Solomon was there, and He spoke words of wisdom. No human words are as wise as the words of Christ. Third, Solomon built the temple of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61246" data-verses="2Samuel 7:13">2 Sam. 7:13</span>). As the son of David, Christ builds up God’s temple, the church.</p>

The Son of Abraham</h2><p data-content-id="iJ-JWg9P3xZ8Q3yk35qxWJvNnyszXfY0xApHTpaS7APGWnGrnD-m4GMXFNWJAqgjl"> Christ is also the son of Abraham. This book of generation says only that Christ is the son of David and the son of <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> Abraham, not the son of anyone else. In the Old Testament there was a clear prophecy that Christ would be the son of Abraham. Isaac was a type of Christ. With Isaac as a type of Christ there were also three main aspects. First, Isaac brought the blessing to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61247" data-verses="Genesis 22:18">Gen. 22:18a</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61248" data-verses="Galatians 3:16">Gal. 3:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61249" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">14</span>). Second, he was offered to God unto death and was resurrected (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61250" data-verses="Genesis 22:1-12">Gen. 22:1-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61251" data-verses="Hebrews 11:17">Heb. 11:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61252" data-verses="Hebrews 11:19">19</span>). Third, he received the bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61253" data-verses="Genesis 24:67">Gen. 24:67</span>). This is a type of Christ as the promised One who brought the blessing to all nations, who was also offered to death, who was resurrected, and who, after His resurrection, will receive His Bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61254" data-verses="John 3:29">John 3:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61255" data-verses="Revelation 19:7">Rev. 19:7</span>). One day the Holy Spirit, typified by Abraham’s servant, will bring the spiritual, divine, heavenly Rebekah to her heavenly Isaac.</p>
<p data-content-id="1NlUiB6cqeI91503fx4qrNzXxLrpKOXRa3xvO1PRw0sPdI5EgqZugm8rhfzHxNWsD"> The son of Abraham received the bride, and the son of David built up the temple. With Christ, the Bride is the temple, and the temple is the Bride. This is why it says that Christ is the son of Abraham and the son of David. He offered Himself unto death and was resurrected, now He is building God’s temple, and in the future He will receive the Bride. Christ also spoke wisdom and brought God’s blessing to all nations. He is the One to fulfill all of these things. In the four Gospels we can find each of these six aspects. The Gospels reveal that Christ came to inherit the kingdom, that He offered Himself unto death and He was resurrected, that He spoke the word of wisdom, that He brought blessing to all people, that He is building up God’s house, and that He will come to receive the Bride. Christ is surely the real Isaac and the real Solomon.</p>
<p data-content-id="9o9l0SO1tmu1IVKdCtKONp_Xou3GW-tFY26QDUqZpb00l5gAxChgESrXFWYCatnW3"> As the son of David, Jesus was a great blessing to the Jews. But as the son of Abraham, He brings blessing to all the Gentiles. As the son of David, He is for the Jews; as the son of Abraham, He is for us all. If Jesus were only the son of David, He would have nothing to do with me. Praise the Lord that He is also the son of Abraham! All nations are blessed in Abraham’s seed, which is Christ. This blessing is the participation in the Triune God. The blessing which God promised to Abraham was the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61256" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Gal. 3:14</span>), <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the Triune God. By Christ as the son of Abraham, we have the Spirit, and we share in the Triune God. Hallelujah!</p>

Abraham</h2><p data-content-id="VWbxdricdU_hA3RMoyfDeQBVtnTDbWNHRQkxOey9YYiINMi1fnT-KoMPfyrnENiAe"> The genealogy in Matthew begins with Abraham, but the genealogy in Luke goes back to Adam. Matthew does not cover Adam and his descendants, but Luke does. What is the meaning of this difference? Luke is a book of God’s salvation, whereas Matthew is a book of the kingdom. God’s salvation is for the created and fallen race represented by Adam, but the kingdom of the heavens is only for God’s chosen people, the called race represented by Abraham. Therefore, Matthew starts from Abraham, but Luke traces the genealogy back to Adam.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="iJ-JWg9P3xZ8Q3yk35qxWJfNlhczXfY0xApHTpaS7APGWnGrnD-m4GMXFNWJAqgjl">1. Called</h2><p data-content-id="1NlUiB6cqeI91503fx4qrNDX8YrpKOXRa3xvO1PRw0sPdI5EgqZugm8rhfzHxNWsD"> In the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis God tried to work with the created race, but He did not get through. The created race failed Him. Man fell to such an extent that all mankind rebelled against God to the uttermost, and built the tower and city of Babel to express their rebellion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61257" data-verses="Genesis 11:1-9">Gen. 11:1-9</span>). So God gave up the created and fallen race, and He called one, Abraham, out of that race to be the father of another race. Out of a place filled with rebellion and idolatry, a place where everyone was one with Satan, God called a man named Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61258" data-verses="Genesis 12:1-2">Gen. 12:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61259" data-verses="Hebrews 11:8">Heb. 11:8</span>). From the time God called him out of Babel (later Babylon) into Canaan, God gave up the Adamic race and invested all His interest in this new race, with Abraham as its head. This is <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> the called race, the transformed race. It is not a race according to nature, but a race according to faith.</p>
<p data-content-id="9o9l0SO1tmu1IVKdCtKONpPXk9nGW-tFY26QDUqZpb00l5gAxChgESrXFWYCatnW3"> God’s kingdom is for this race. It could never be with the fallen race. Thus, Matthew, dealing with the kingdom of the heavens, begins with Abraham. Because the book of Luke concerns God’s salvation (and surely salvation must be for the fallen race), his genealogy goes back to Adam. After being saved in Luke, we are spontaneously transferred from the fallen race to the called race. We used to be descendants of Adam; now we are descendants of Abraham. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61260" data-verses="Galatians 3:7">Galatians 3:7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61261" data-verses="Galatians 3:29">29</span> tell us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ is a son of Abraham. Whose son are you? Are you the son of Adam or the son of Abraham? We are the real Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61262" data-verses="Romans 2:29">Rom. 2:29</span>). Our grandfather is Abraham. We are in the same category he is. If we were not descendants of Abraham, then we would have no share in the book of Matthew. We would not even have a share in the short book of Galatians, because Galatians was written to the descendants of Abraham. Only if we are descendants of Abraham do we have a share in Galatians. Praise the Lord that we are the sons of Abraham! “If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61263" data-verses="Galatians 3:29">Gal. 3:29</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="griJiQSzWDsTHQrY15c2IqCdUUcP7qlHqfQNmQzPjsR2H__7IlxH4gAwVvsjwJPy_"> Abraham was called out by God. The Greek word for church, <em>ecclesia</em>, means “the called out ones.” Thus, we in the church are also the called out ones. Abraham was called out of Babel, the place of rebellion and idolatry, into the good land, which typifies Christ. We also were in Babel. We were fallen, we were rebellious, and we worshipped idols. Today the whole human race is in Babel. We used to be there, but one day God called us out and put us into Christ, the high land. We were called by God into “the fellowship [the participation] of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61264" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1 Cor. 1:9</span>). “To those who are called,...Christ, [is] God’s power and God’s wisdom” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61265" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">1 Cor. 1:24</span>).</p>

Justified by Faith</h2><p data-content-id="5Y773SPR77C2H0B4RbzP5Euij9CypWlUDUYHIQCu6uAD4q_U_UK0S2LqwPxdyeFfU"> Abraham, as a called one, was justified by faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61266" data-verses="Genesis 15:6">Gen. 15:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61267" data-verses="Romans 4:2-3">Rom. 4:2-3</span>). The fallen ones depend on their work, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> the called ones believe in God’s work, not in their own work. No fallen person can be justified by works in the sight of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61268" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Rom. 3:20</span>). Therefore, the called ones, having been called by God out of the fallen race, put no trust in their own effort; they trust in God’s work of grace. Abraham and all other believers are like this. “They who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61269" data-verses="Galatians 3:9">Gal. 3:9</span>). The blessing of God’s promise, “the promise of the Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61270" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Gal. 3:14</span>), is for the believing ones. By faith we received the Spirit, which is the reality and realization of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61271" data-verses="Galatians 3:2">Gal. 3:2</span>). Thus, both Abraham and we are associated with Christ and joined to Him by faith. It is by faith in God’s work of grace that God’s called people are justified by Him and participate in Christ, their eternal portion.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="N-ZaYPyZqODWNh5PVTFlqZzLP6SHS3WtXnGfD2YNzWmPzlEiEdCjCFgT0nq9Pqwmq">3. Living by Faith</h2><p data-content-id="tGZCwtHghQxryExdqI-PSUTDU-JO0W6ZQuXll7QUSOhP8Y9PFcEwJYM4qtd1Tupk-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61272" data-verses="Hebrews 11:8">Hebrews 11:8</span> says that Abraham was called, and that he answered this call by faith. Then, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61273" data-verses="Hebrews 11:9">verse 9</span> says that he also lived in the good land by faith. As the called one of God, not only was Abraham justified by faith, but he also lived by faith. As one called by God, he should no longer live and walk by himself, but live and walk by faith. For Abraham to live and walk by faith meant that he had to reject himself, to forget himself, to set himself aside, and to live by Someone else. Whatever he had by nature had to be set aside.</p>
<p data-content-id="hDAJsMIF7Rr7uQuwu37BeeAdWzLdQPazI7nCFzbHlTwqEml0yfZPEzAKysM2KiatC"> If we compare <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61274" data-verses="Genesis 11:31">Genesis 11:31</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61275" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">12:1</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61276" data-verses="Acts 7:2-3">Acts 7:2-3</span>, we see that when God called Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees, he was very weak. Abraham did not take the initiative to leave Babel; his father, Terah, did. This forced God to take away Abraham’s father. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61277" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Genesis 12:1</span> God called him again, telling him to leave not only his country and his kindred, but also his father’s house, which meant not to bring anyone with him. But once again Abraham, like us, was weak and he took Lot, his nephew (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61278" data-verses="Genesis 12:5">Gen. 12:5</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="UQ-0mvjA2048kTR2fcUMd_U54JNDywXiS7irtLaYPT3xlo1wXE2N_vnPIWnJh3Y0e"> What is an Abraham? An Abraham is a person who has been called out, who no longer lives and walks by himself, and who forsakes and forgets everything he has by nature. This is exactly the message of the book of Galatians. <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61279" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span> says that we are the sons of Abraham and that we should live by faith, not by our works. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61280" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> says that to live by faith means “no longer I who live, but Christ.” I, the natural I who came out of the fallen race, have been crucified and buried. Thus, it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me. This is Abraham. If we are true Jews, the real descendants of Abraham, we must leave everything and live by faith. We must forget about all that we can do and repudiate all that we are and have by nature. This is not easy.</p>
<p data-content-id="MXw_qbkhjqaSRjjhv3l4r3H0gInns_i2Wn9YDe1F5-tDaKc1VP2-t8yhzkWzA3axH"> Christians appreciate Abraham very much. However, we should not esteem Abraham too highly. He was not that outstanding. He was called, but he did not dare to leave Babel; his father took him out. This forced God to remove his father. Then Abraham relied on his nephew, Lot. After this, he put his trust in his servant, Eliezer (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61281" data-verses="Genesis 15:2-4">Gen. 15:2-4</span>). It seemed that God was saying, “Abraham, I don’t like to see your father with you, I don’t like to see your nephew with you, and I don’t like to see Eliezer with you. I want you to have no one to rely upon. You must rely on Me. Don’t depend upon anything else or anything you have by nature.” This is believing in God, walking in Him, and living by Him. It is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me.</p>
<p data-content-id="VWbxdricdU_hA3RMoyfDeQBVq3zDbWNHRQkxOey9YYiINMi1fnT-KoMPfyrnENiAe"> If we are real Jews, then we are real Abrahams. In order to be an Abraham, we must believe in the Lord. To believe in the Lord is to become associated with Him. Abraham was called out of the fallen race, and he became associated with the Lord. All the sons of Abraham must likewise be associated with Christ. “If ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed.” In other words, if we are the seed of Abraham, we belong to Christ and we are associated with Christ. If we would be associated with Christ, we must repudiate ourselves and take Christ as everything. This is believing in Christ, and this believing is righteousness in the eyes of God. Do not try to do anything. Simply believe in Christ.</p>

But God says, “Come out of that. You are the called race. Don’t try, don’t do, and don’t work any <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> more! Forget your past. Forget what you are, what you can do, and what you have. Forget everything, and put your full trust in Me. I am your good land. Live in Me, and live by Me.” These are the real Abrahams, the real Galatians. As the sons of God, they trust in God and forget about themselves. These are the ones who make up the generation of Christ. We all must be Abrahams, those who forget their past, give up what they are and have, and put their trust in Christ, their good land. Today our walk and our living must be by faith in Christ. If so, then, as heirs of God’s promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we shall participate in Christ as God’s blessing.</p>
<p data-content-id="1NlUiB6cqeI91503fx4qrNDX2KLpKOXRa3xvO1PRw0sPdI5EgqZugm8rhfzHxNWsD"> At a certain time the Lord asked Abraham to offer Isaac, the one God had given according to His promise, for a burnt offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61282" data-verses="Genesis 22:1-2">Gen. 22:1-2</span>). The Lord had given Isaac to Abraham; now Abraham had to give Isaac back to the Lord.

Last month or last week you may have experienced Christ in a certain way, but today the Lord says, “Consecrate that experience. That was a real experience of Christ, but don’t keep it.” Again, the lesson is to never trust in what we have, not even in what God has given us. If God has given you something, it must be given back to Him. This is the daily walk by faith. To walk in the presence of the Lord by faith means that we do not hold on to anything, not even to the things given by God. The best gifts, given by the Lord Himself, must be given back to Him. Do not keep anything as something to rely on; rely only and always on the Lord. Abraham did this. Eventually he lived and walked in the presence of God purely by faith.</p>

<p data-content-id="noJLwnldamOmRe0zpuBYpl1XPSXeHDzQoGfSF2WO7NRymA3WaD3VAFdTLqa9GK2Cr"> God had promised Abraham a son. Sarah, wanting to help God fulfill his promise, made a proposal to Abraham. Sarah seemed to say, “Look, Abraham, God promised to give you a seed, an heir to inherit this good land. But look at yourself—you are nearly ninety years of age! And look at me—I’m too old! It is impossible for me to bring forth a child. We must do something to help God fulfill His purpose. I have a maid named Hagar. She is quite good. Surely you could have a son by her” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61295" data-verses="Genesis 16:1-2">Gen. 16:1-2</span>). This is the natural concept, and it is quite tempting. Many times our natural concept has some proposal to get us out of the spirit. Often our natural concept says, “Here is a good source. Do it this way.” But such a proposal will surely keep us from God’s promise!</p>
<p data-content-id="6ro0SLhPgeHawhHchwRaS8pp1zil9MXljXGO7SQlWomtHaF1SqlnMmKkaVi1kXlN8"> Abraham took Sarah’s proposal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61296" data-verses="Genesis 16:2-4">Gen. 16:2-4</span>), and the result was Ishmael (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61297" data-verses="Genesis 16:15">Gen. 16:15</span>). This terrible Ishmael is still here today! Acting on Sarah’s proposal did not help God; rather, it frustrated Abraham from fulfilling God’s purpose. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p data-content-id="RY9q0kGVK_zA5JdFczeiSmsRSp5eD2ESq_eMP1IIUgARJQj9mVihVadUTPO8j7gB8"> The lesson we derive from this is that, as the called race, whatever we do on our own results in an Ishmael. Whatever we do on our own in the church life, even in the preaching of the gospel, will only produce an Ishmael. Do not produce Ishmaels! Terminate yourself! Did you not cross over that great river, the Euphrates? When you were called out of Babel, you crossed that great river and you were buried there. You were terminated there. Do not live by yourself or do anything by yourself. Instead, you should say, “Lord, I am nothing. Without You, I can do nothing. Lord, if You don’t do anything, then I won’t do anything. If You rest, I rest. Lord, I put my trust in You.” This is easy to say, but difficult to practice in our daily life.</p>

He waited until their natural energy had died out, <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> until they had come to realize it was impossible for them to bring forth a child.</p>
<p data-content-id="wjzBcT7J6ui_V8UtAPCPwdAnGBqAg1bbw4Kza4AlsYjGZY2KkuvEEU070GEFQH0QA"> Abraham wanted to keep Ishmael and rely on him, but God rejected Ishmael (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61300" data-verses="Genesis 17:18-19">Gen. 17:18-19</span>). We also like to keep our own work and rely on it, but God does not accept it. Eventually, God asked Abraham to cast out Ishmael and his mother (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61301" data-verses="Genesis 21:10-12">Gen. 21:10-12</span>). This was difficult for Abraham to do. But he had to learn the lesson of not living by himself, the lesson of giving up his own effort and not doing anything by himself. He had a son, but he had to give him up. This is the lesson of Abraham and the lesson in the book of Galatians.</p>
<p data-content-id="L1V4B15iT8t8XHXTxZNHKLN2E0SQnR84piFFafclBwiFgUtbMWcb2uScp6PfcM1wd"> Participating in Christ requires that we never rely on our own effort nor on anything we are able to do. Just as Ishmael was a frustration to Isaac’s inheriting of God’s promise, so our own effort or work will always frustrate our participation in Christ. We must forsake all that we are and all that we have in order to trust God’s promise. We must renounce everything of our natural life; otherwise we cannot enjoy Christ. After our natural strength has been exhausted, the promise of God comes. After Ishmael was cast out, Isaac had the full position to participate in the blessing of God’s promise. The termination of our natural effort, the forsaking of what we can do or have done, is “Isaac,” the inheriting of God’s promised blessing, which is Christ. We have been baptized into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61302" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>, Gk.). Having been terminated in Christ, we are now His, and we have Him as our portion. Thus, we are Abraham’s seed, God’s called race, and heirs according to God’s promise (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61303" data-verses="Galatians 3:29">Gal. 3:29</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="mh_ZDLd4wfV9ecWhlGiJnCGojqtkN-Sl4FYH04rsPyWtgzpRWtbuwFt_0RHicTjCA"> What is Isaac? Isaac is the issue of the life and walk by faith. This is Christ. Isaac was a full type of Christ inheriting all the riches of the Father. We all must experience Christ in such a way; not by our doing, striving, or endeavoring, but simply by trusting in Him. Our trust in Him will issue in Isaac. Only Isaac is the real element of the generation of Christ. Not all the children of Abraham of the flesh are the children of God; only in Isaac will God have <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> His children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61304" data-verses="Romans 9:7-8">Rom. 9:7-8</span>). Therefore, God considered Isaac as Abraham’s only son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61305" data-verses="Genesis 21:10">Gen. 21:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61306" data-verses="Genesis 21:12">12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61307" data-verses="Genesis 22:2">22:2a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61308" data-verses="Genesis 22:12">12b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61309" data-verses="Genesis 22:16-18">16-18</span>), the only one to inherit the promise concerning Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61310" data-verses="Genesis 26:3-4">Gen. 26:3-4</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="ZBEfLYwnFQMIktZO1CK-QTCJdoEKKx_55o0glLaVuMsWNmNHaosd8tvUYD9QEc1P0"> Although we are the race of Abraham today, are we walking in the way of Ishmael, or are we living in the way of Isaac? The way of Ishmael is to fulfill God’s purpose by our own energy and work. The way of Isaac is to put ourselves into God, trusting Him to do everything to fulfill His purpose for us. What a great difference between these two ways! Ishmael has nothing to do with Christ. Whatever we do, whatever we try to accomplish, has nothing to do with Christ. We must have Isaac. If we would have Isaac, we must cast out Ishmael, stop our work, and place ourselves into the very working of God. If we let Him fulfill His promise for us, then we shall have Isaac.</p>

Jacob and Esau were more intimate; they were twins. Jacob means a superseder. He supersedes others, puts them under him, and climbs above them. When he and his older brother Esau were coming out of the womb, Jacob held Esau’s heel. Jacob seemed to be saying, “Esau, don’t go yet! Wait for me. Let me go first!” Jacob was a real heel-holder. The meaning of the name Jacob is the heel-holder, the supplanter. Beat others down. Put them under your feet by any deceitful means. That is Jacob.</p>
<div id="displayv"> </div> </div><div class="section" data-section="3">
<p data-content-id="Chl3aMiPFcjFkhkJ5MA9gvA_7uJ7hcvOauPup_2HSo4llszt0h-8cMcqRzfr2UJUB"> Because God had already chosen Jacob, all his endeavors were in vain. Jacob needed a vision. He did not need to supplant others, because God had chosen him to be number one. Even before the twins were born, God had told the mother that the younger would be the first, and the elder would be second. It is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61312" data-verses="Malachi 1:2-3">Mal. 1:2-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61313" data-verses="Romans 9:13">Rom. 9:13</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="PsdTGyvkVznrKHx5GNFcVBvA_y8UBN6Jki2lR4GRPnasll_URh5etnXSwSlIIFZmK"> Unfortunately, Jacob did not realize this. If he had, he never would have tried to do anything. Rather, he would <span class="pg" data-page-id="21" id="21">[21]</span> have said to Esau, “If you want to go out first, just go out. No matter how much you try to be first, I will still be first. You can never beat me because God elected me.” Jacob, however, did not know this. Even when he had grown up, he still did not realize it. Therefore, he was constantly supplanting. Wherever he went, he supplanted. He supplanted his brother (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61314" data-verses="Genesis 25:29-33">Gen. 25:29-33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61315" data-verses="Genesis 27:18-38">27:18-38</span>), and he supplanted his uncle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61316" data-verses="Genesis 30:37">Gen. 30:37—31:1</span>). He schemed and he stole from his uncle, Laban. Yet, all his labor was in vain. God could say, “Stupid Jacob. You don’t need to do that. I will give you more than what you have gained.” But Jacob kept striving. Although he was a descendant of Abraham, according to his striving and his nature, he was altogether a descendant of the Devil. Do you see this? Positionally speaking, Jacob was a descendant of Abraham, but dispositionally speaking, he was a child of the Devil.</p>
<p data-content-id="-ZHK3T1CDyWPzitDGxi-v5i0PeTXyeVW08cjyfHtVx1oVgCPdC7wSFuzbiDLeLgcG"> What did Jacob need? He needed God’s dealing. Hence, God raised up his brother, Esau, and then his uncle, Laban, to deal with him. God even raised up four wives plus twelve male helpers and a female helper. There was a great deal of suffering in the life of Jacob, but this suffering came from his striving, not from God’s election. The more Jacob strove, the more he suffered. We may laugh at Jacob, but we are exactly the same as he. The more we try to do something, the more problems we have.</p>
<p data-content-id="pq7HUDkjfwdOKycLKi0OdJCXE0YKmTqI4CJrpHVLc4_RGrWPdspXg4wm2numC_IeB"> In Christ, we need, firstly, the life of Abraham. We need to forget what we are, live by Christ, and trust in Him. Secondly, in Christ we have no need of Ishmael, our doing; we need Isaac, His doing. Thirdly, we do not need Jacob, but Israel. We do not need the natural Jacob, but the transformed Israel, the prince of God.</p>

But, I assure you, the more you stop, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> better. The more you stop, the more He will stand up. Try it.

<p data-content-id="uhrNT43xO_qwGlqNZpptA3GVC35uwgINmCaNJZiID-2svPbLWpCwg9eHFIuy4yQvW"> The genealogy of Christ is a matter of the birthright, and the birthright is mainly the association with Christ and the participation in Christ. Jacob’s supplanting was not justified, but his seeking after the birthright surely was honored by God. Esau despised the birthright and sold it cheaply (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61320" data-verses="Genesis 25:29-34">Gen. 25:29-34</span>). Thus, he lost it and was not able to get it back, even when he regretted and wept for it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61321" data-verses="Genesis 27:34-38">Gen. 27:34-38</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61322" data-verses="Hebrews 12:16-17">Heb. 12:16-17</span>). He had lost the blessing of participating in Christ. This should be a warning to us. Jacob respected and sought the birthright, and he obtained it. He inherited God’s promised blessing, the blessing of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61323" data-verses="Genesis 28:4">Gen. 28:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61324" data-verses="Genesis 28:14">14</span>).</p>

Reuben should have had the first son’s portion, which was the birthright. The birthright included three elements: the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Although Reuben was the <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> first son, he lost his birthright because of his defilement (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61326" data-verses="Genesis 49:3-4">Gen. 49:3-4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61327" data-verses="1Chronicles 5:1-2">1 Chron. 5:1-2</span>). Then the double portion of the land went to Joseph. This must have been due to his purity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61328" data-verses="Genesis 39:7-20">Gen. 39:7-20</span>). He was the son closest to his father and the one most after his father’s heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61329" data-verses="Genesis 37:2-3">Gen. 37:2-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61330" data-verses="Genesis 37:12-17">12-17</span>). Each of Joseph’s two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, received a portion of the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61331" data-verses="Joshua 16:1-2">Joshua 16 and 17</span>). Thus through his two sons he inherited two portions of the good land.</p>
<p data-content-id="H8IQbnycPGz-R9aFVTCkNyH--dvc132MKtfElw_Lm43sW6JLe8ZN8PPqIIykp2K_u"> The priesthood portion of the birthright went to Levi (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61332" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:8-10">Deut. 33:8-10</span>). Levi was very much after God’s heart. In order to fulfill God’s desire, Levi forgot his parents, his brothers, and his children and only took care of God’s desire. Thus, he received the priesthood portion of the birthright.</p>
<p data-content-id="XjNhnxq8pOBRIQJgfNj4HI76ZPhWvooVWpyDh1eEHtno6bC8_SGyD6n6kKA8O2GNB"> The kingship, another portion of the birthright, was given to Judah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61333" data-verses="Genesis 49:10">Gen. 49:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61334" data-verses="1Chronicles 5:2">1 Chron. 5:2</span>). If we read Genesis, we find the reason for this. When Joseph was suffering under the conspiracy of his brothers, Judah took care of him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61335" data-verses="Genesis 37:26">Gen. 37:26</span>). He also took care of Benjamin in time of suffering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61336" data-verses="Genesis 43:8-9">Gen. 43:8-9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61337" data-verses="Genesis 44:14-34">44:14-34</span>). Because of this, I believe, the kingship went to Judah.</p>

Our birthright is also composed of these three elements: the double portion of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship. We are in Christ, and we can enjoy Him in double portion. We are also priests and kings of God. However, many Christians have lost their birthright. They have been saved and can never be lost, but they have lost their extra portion of Christ. If we would enjoy the extra portion of Christ, we must keep our birthright.</p>
<p data-content-id="JRY8MaLJKtf6efzbzG58lbThZLEVg09yHQu46f5uWlaIY-J16MAf81zwk8d8J-hvN"> All Christians have been reborn as priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61339" data-verses="Revelation 1:6">Rev. 1:6</span>). But today many have lost their priesthood. Because they have lost their praying position, it is hard for them to pray. If we would keep our priesthood, we must be like the Levites, and forget our father, our brothers, and our children and take care of God’s interest. God’s desire, not our families, must be first. If God’s desire has first place in our hearts, then we shall be close to Him and keep the priesthood. <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> </p>

We all need to be on the alert. We have the position to possess the birthright and we have it already, but maintaining it depends on whether or not we keep ourselves from being profane or becoming defiled. We have seen that Esau lost his birthright because he was profane and that Reuben lost his birthright because of his defilement. But Joseph inherited the double portion of land because of his purity; Levi obtained the priesthood because of his absolute separation unto the Lord; and Judah received the kingship because of his care for his suffering brothers. We need to keep ourselves pure for the extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ; we need to separate ourselves absolutely to the Lord with a heart caring for the Lord’s desire above all things; we need to care lovingly for our suffering brothers. If we are like this, we shall surely keep our birthright. The extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship will be ours. Even today we can enjoy Christ in a double measure. We can pray, we can rule, and we can reign. Then, when the Lord Jesus returns, we shall be with Him enjoying the inheritance of this earth. We shall be priests contacting God continually and kings reigning over the people.</p>

Judah and his eleven brothers became the fathers of the twelve tribes which formed the nation of Israel as God’s chosen people for Christ. Hence, all Judah’s brothers were related to Christ.

You may say that there was no excuse for Tamar’s deed and that incest always involves both sides.

<p data-content-id="ZBEfLYwnFQMIktZO1CK-QTSJX60KKx_55o0glLaVuMsWNmNHaosd8tvUYD9QEc1P0"> Because we come from a different background and have little understanding of the birthright and of its meaning to the people in those days, I need to say a word about it. In Tamar’s time, the birthright meant a great deal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61351" data-verses="Genesis 38:6-8">Gen. 38:6-8</span>). As I pointed out in the last message, the birthright included a double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. The double portion of the land refers to the double enjoyment of Christ. The land is Christ, and the double portion of the land is not the ordinary, common enjoyment of Christ, but something special, something extraordinary in the enjoyment of Christ. Both the priesthood and the kingship are also related to Christ. For the generation after Abraham, the birthright was altogether a matter of inheriting Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61352" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>, we are told that when we were unbelievers, we were without Christ. But by believing in the Lord Jesus, we have been brought into the birthright. We have been put into Christ, Christ has become our portion, and He will even be our double portion. Through Him, in Him, and with Him we have the priesthood and the kingship. Christ Himself is our good land, our priesthood, and our kingship.</p>
<p data-content-id="k8a9Mehyf9H71QPewDInv1w3Ao069jLZd9yw23ONbZ7XFqXXrLNjP1qqvKoJw6HIh"> Now we can understand why Tamar was anxious to have the birthright. She knew that if she were cut off, she would be through with God’s promise. And God’s promise was simply the promise of Himself to be the portion of His chosen people in Christ. Tamar was not willing to miss this blessing.</p>
<p data-content-id="JRY8MaLJKtf6efzbzG58lbDhcKkVg09yHQu46f5uWlaIY-J16MAf81zwk8d8J-hvN"> Tamar was the wife of the first son of Judah. This son should have inherited the birthright. But Tamar’s husband <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> was wicked in the eyes of the Lord, and the Lord took his life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61353" data-verses="Genesis 38:7">Gen. 38:7</span>). The Lord also slew Judah’s second son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61354" data-verses="Genesis 38:8-10">Gen. 38:8-10</span>). According to the ancient regulations, Judah should have arranged for his next son to marry Tamar in order that a son might be brought forth to inherit the birthright. Judah, however, did not fulfill his responsibility. In a sense, Judah cheated Tamar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61355" data-verses="Genesis 38:11-14">Gen. 38:11-14</span>). But Tamar did not give up; rather, she even used an unseemly means to obtain the birthright. Whether the means was unseemly or not, Tamar did her best to get that birthright.</p>
<p data-content-id="zeI6BsewlXT9QG5Y864_M3OUIT9tKevtEil80zoGzPhHgqih6rw1YfLAvzeK55gIY"> To have the birthright is simply to gain Christ. In order to gain Christ, we must be ready to take a way that does not seem to be the best way. Let me tell you a story that illustrates this, but try to understand me; do not misunderstand me. In the past, some young people in China were inspired by my preaching, believed in the Lord Jesus, and desired to be baptized. However, their parents, who were Buddhists, were very much opposed to this. When they learned that their children were planning to be baptized, they gave them no opportunity to leave home. The young people prayed about this. Eventually, they told their parents that they had to be in school for a certain half-day period. That was surely a lie, for they did not go to school; they went to the church to be baptized. Although they told a lie, it was a pure lie. Their intention in telling that lie was very pleasing to God. If you want to gain Christ, you should not care for the way. Do not be religious; do not keep the rules and regulations. Gain Christ! You need to gain Christ. By any means, get the birthright.</p>
<p data-content-id="abSJWp_OwRzajN9ql34uZdsG5nSF2_ct6UGsDGXLuJJ-nMTFTDNm0IxFal6L5FIAr"> It was through an unseemly means that Tamar acquired the birthright. But in the divine record in the Bible, the name of Tamar is not a bad name. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61356" data-verses="Ruth 4:12">Ruth 4:12</span> indicates that this name is sacred. In this verse the elders said, “And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah.” The name of Tamar is sacred because she did not care for anything sinful; she cared only for the birthright. The significance of this for us today is that if we care <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> for Christ and are seeking Him, any way we can truly gain Him is the right way.</p>

Tamar conceived twins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61358" data-verses="Genesis 38:27-30">Gen. 38:27-30</span>). At the time of delivery, one boy, Zarah, tried to come out first, but he did not succeed. He put out his hand, and the midwife marked it with a scarlet thread, indicating that he would be the firstborn. However, Pharez preceded him to be the firstborn. Thus, the first became the last, and the last became the first. The midwife was surprised. This is a good illustration of how to gain the birthright. Pharez inherited the birthright. Man did not choose him, but God sent him. This proves that it is not up to man’s endeavoring; it is up to God’s choice. The mother’s story tells us one side: that we should be anxious for the birthright, trying our best to obtain it; the son’s story tells us the other side: that although we may strive to obtain the birthright, it is actually a matter of God’s choice, not our efforts (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61359" data-verses="Romans 9:11">Rom. 9:11</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7g0rDrezCXC5s6MFVJBApkX75iitKXphqKl7HV7td-Bm1Ca7BQcE0ftTX5VYe6b"> I remember a story concerning D. L. Moody. One day a student at his Bible institute said to him, “Mr. Moody, by reading the New Testament I have learned that all the saved ones are the chosen ones, predestinated by God before the foundation of the world. Now I have a problem. If I preach the gospel and convince people to believe, I may do something wrong and persuade someone whom God has not chosen. What shall I do?” Moody replied, “My son, just go ahead to do your best. As people enter the door, they will see written on the outside, ‘Whosoever will may come.’ But once they have entered the door, they will look back and see written on the inside, ‘Chosen before the foundation of the world.’” Tamar’s story means, “Whosoever will may come.” Tamar willed and Tamar came. But her son’s story means, “Chosen before the foundation of the world.” Perhaps you are today’s Tamar, striving and laboring to obtain the birthright. But once you gain it, you will look back and see that you were chosen before the foundation of the world. <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> The birthright does not depend on us; it depends on His choice.</p>

Rahab was a harlot in Jericho (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61361" data-verses="Joshua 2:1">Josh. 2:1</span>), a place cursed by God for eternity. Although she was a harlot in such a place, she became a grandmother of Christ. How could a harlot become a grandmother of Christ? In order to answer this question, we need to find the principles. The entire population of Jericho was destroyed except Rahab, her family, and her possessions. She was saved because she turned to God and God’s people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61362" data-verses="Joshua 6:22-23">Josh. 6:22-23</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61363" data-verses="Joshua 6:25">25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61364" data-verses="Hebrews 11:31">Heb. 11:31</span>). After she turned to God and His people, she married Salmon, a leader in the army of the leading tribe of Judah and one of the men sent by Joshua to spy out Jericho. At that time, Salmon became acquainted with Rahab and, in a sense, saved her. Eventually, Rahab married him, and they brought forth a godly man named Boaz.</p>
<p data-content-id="7gOUzACjtGFQwhTPxMOjxT_P9wZpCXkSeLBKMv-G9vbSz9FwafEz5B7ukzfuDDj_q"> Now we must pay our full attention to the principles governing our association with Christ. The first principle is that, no matter what our background is, we must turn to God and to God’s people. Second, we must marry the proper person, not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense. After we have turned to God and to God’s people, we must be joined, built up, and involved with the proper person. Third, we must bring forth the proper fruit. Then we will be fully in the portion of the birthright of Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="_2JrVSLNabiegt69WzyiQXVXDZvT9uEtQ7AfAV04vYLNdH2qCFSklycgubXid-ZQb"> It seems that many Christians today have lost their birthright. They do not have Salmon and Boaz. If you would have a Salmon and a Boaz, you must become involved with the proper believers, with the proper leading ones in the leading tribes. Then you need to bring forth the proper fruit, Boaz, who will be a forefather of David. We must turn to the Lord, and we must turn to the Lord’s people; we must also take care of how we become involved with others. If we become involved with the proper persons, surely we shall bring forth the proper fruit. This will keep us in the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> </p>

Boaz is a type of Christ, and Ruth is a type of the church. The book of Ruth tells us that Boaz redeemed Ruth; he also redeemed the birthright for her. This means that Christ, as our real Boaz, has redeemed both us and the birthright.</p>
<p data-content-id="rrHHs6EB2hifkbOEsDvdjsq30fBIeANh58k6aj_wsbQZxSyrmyshzF2TGMpzE32_a"> Boaz redeemed his kinsman’s inheritance and married the man’s widow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61365" data-verses="Ruth 4:1-17">Ruth 4:1-17</span>); hence, he became a notable forefather of Christ, a great associate of Christ. As a brother and a Boaz, you should take care of others’ birthright of Christ, not only your own birthright. In other words, you should not only take care of your own enjoyment of Christ, but also others’ enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="dWQGQdEDRC5zuJZX8AMIf21r5HFgC5d74WTtePoRmZt-8k_JsT4Mkew34IjKVg9Nt"> Ruth was the daughter-in-law of Naomi. As we read this story, we see that Ruth and Naomi had lost the enjoyment, the birthright, but according to God’s regulation there was a way to restore the birthright, to redeem it. But it had to be redeemed by someone else. The principle is the same in the church life today. If I lose the birthright, the brothers have a way to redeem it for me. Quite often, some dear ones lose their enjoyment of Christ. In a sense, they become Naomi or Ruth. If so, you need to be a Boaz, able to redeem the lost birthright and marry the redeemed one.</p>
<p data-content-id="QRe98RapaaaKaU9rvUrwonHvhRW9XFHwo0MNs9lb0EHIgRGLmx9NJZbe_kkxe-sUH"> Suppose I am a real Ruth who has lost her husband. To lose the husband means to lose the enjoyment of the birthright. I have the birthright, but I have lost the enjoyment of the birthright. Thus, I need you, as my brother, to redeem my birthright. But you need to be somewhat richer in Christ. You need to have some riches with which to redeem my birthright. Then you pay the price to regain my birthright, and you also marry me. This means that you become involved with me. This kind of spiritual involvement will produce Obed, the grandfather of David. Boaz became one of the great forefathers of Christ. In a spiritual sense, he was the one who enjoyed the largest and richest portion of Christ. If a brother becomes a Boaz to me, he will be the one with <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> the greatest enjoyment of Christ. Because he redeemed my birthright and became so involved with me, our involvement in the Lord will eventually bring forth the full enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="KQtTXmFXrPslnaSFbZUEEDddZBTobq-W2fVGm40PJRyaqhCmMxfi9Y-SX06t3vdRz"> In the church life today we need to have a number of Boazes. The book of Ruth tells us that there was another kinsman who was even closer to Ruth than Boaz was. But that man was selfish; he only took care of his own birthright. He was afraid that taking care of another’s might mar his own. This is exactly today’s situation. Some brothers should take care of me, the poor Ruth, but they are selfish in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ. Even in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ it is quite possible to be selfish. However, a Boaz will be generous and pay the price to redeem my birthright. All this indicates that we should take care of not only our own birthright, but also others’ birthright. Day by day we should take care of others’ enjoyment of Christ. The more we do this, the better.</p>

We may say that Ruth was certainly a good woman, but she had a great shortage. Although she herself was not involved in incest, her origin was a matter of incest. Ruth belonged to the tribe of Moab (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61367" data-verses="Ruth 1:4">Ruth 1:4</span>). Moab was the son of Lot, the fruit of Lot’s incestuous union with his daughter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61368" data-verses="Genesis 19:30-38">Gen. 19:30-38</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61369" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:3">Deuteronomy 23:3</span>, the Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation. Thus, Ruth was an excluded one. However, not only was she accepted by the Lord, but she became a wonderful person who partook of the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="4PJTyNjfqAKbyEk3eogO78nbK16nQXL-AMqdSkFRm2vp-8_AX0kxeelCMA8_ZCa6R"> Although, as a Moabitess, Ruth was not allowed to enter the congregation of the Lord, she was seeking God and God’s people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61370" data-verses="Ruth 1:15-17">Ruth 1:15-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61371" data-verses="Ruth 2:11-12">2:11-12</span>). This reveals a most prevailing principle: no matter who we are or what our background is, as long as we have a heart which seeks after God and God’s people, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ. Ruth married Boaz, a godly man among <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> God’s people, and brought forth Obed, the grandfather of David the king.</p>
<p data-content-id="oUxK-ZRocSItbN5-m5Y87WvGWIKTOz6xjU5saHviBbmquh7aupE46pUsF5AAlvLsU"> Boaz’s mother was Rahab, a Canaanitess, and his wife Ruth was a Moabitess. Both were Gentiles. Nevertheless, they were associated with Christ. This is a strong proof that Christ is joined not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles, even the Gentiles of a low and mean class.</p>

Although the Bible does not have much to say about Jesse, what it does say about him is important. Isaiah <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61373" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">chapter eleven</span> speaks twice regarding Jesse. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61374" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span> says that Christ will be the shoot (“rod” should be “shoot,” Heb.) out of the stem of Jesse and a branch out of the root of Jesse. Christ came out of him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61375" data-verses="Isaiah 11:10">Isaiah 11:10</span> says that Christ is the root of Jesse, indicating that Jesse came out of Christ. Jesse is a man altogether out of Christ; he is also a person who brings forth Christ. Christ comes out of him, and he comes out of Christ. Christ was his branch, and Christ was also his root. We need light from the Lord to understand these things.</p>
<p data-content-id="YGzD_YG4vTnIweS_DzVjv9aTAR__MjMY1-7P2uJlME-fgOaZdIg57DhGUoi5FJ-VW"> What is a Jesse?

Christ branches out of you, and you come out of Christ. Christ is our source, and Christ is also our issue. This means that we are one with Christ and very closely associated with Him. We are in Him, and He is in us. He issues out of us, and we are rooted in Him.

In the Bible the number eight signifies resurrection, a new start. The eighth day is the first day of the second week; hence, it signifies something new, something of resurrection. When Samuel came to anoint the king of God’s people, Jesse presented his seven sons to him. Samuel looked at them and said, “The Lord hath not chosen these.” When Samuel learned that there was an eighth one, David, he sent for him and anointed him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61376" data-verses="1Samuel 16:10-13">1 Sam. 16:10-13</span>).

He was the ending of one and the beginning of the other because he was very much in the enjoyment of Christ. If we would have the rich enjoyment of Christ, we shall often need to be the end of one situation and the beginning of another situation.

Solomon is the result not only of transgression and repentance, but of transgression, repentance, and God’s forgiveness. Here we see two marriages. The first was a marriage between David and Bathsheba. The second was a spiritual marriage, the marriage of David’s transgression and repentance with God’s forgiveness. God’s forgiveness married David’s transgression and repentance. This marriage brought forth the man named Solomon who <span class="pg" data-page-id="37" id="37">[37]</span> built the temple of God.

<p data-content-id="VWbxdricdU_hA3RMoyfDeQRVv0TDbWNHRQkxOey9YYiINMi1fnT-KoMPfyrnENiAe"> I hope the Lord will show you what human words cannot say. If you have been and still are a typically good person who has never murdered others, who has never transgressed, and who has never needed to repent, then God does not need to forgive you. If this is the case, then there will never be a Solomon, and the temple of God will never be built up. As we have seen, the building up of God’s temple comes from man’s transgression and repentance plus God’s forgiveness.</p>
<p data-content-id="iJ-JWg9P3xZ8Q3yk35qxWJPNmyMzXfY0xApHTpaS7APGWnGrnD-m4GMXFNWJAqgjl"> One day I said to the Lord, “Lord, my transgression and repentance need Your forgiveness. But, Lord, You know better than I that Your forgiveness also needs my transgression. My transgression needs Your forgiveness, and Your forgiveness needs my transgression. If I have no transgressions, then You don’t have a place to spend Your forgiveness.” When I said this to the Lord, it seemed that He said, “Yes. Because of your transgression and repentance, I do have an opportunity to spend My forgiveness. I am happy about this.” But you should never say, “Let us do evil that good may come.” You must do your best. But no matter how hard you may try to do everything right in the eyes of the Lord, sooner or later something will happen. Suddenly, you will murder, take over others, transgress. However, after you transgress, there will be a way for you to repent. If you repent, God will be ready to forgive you. Then you will beget a son and name him Solomon. The name Solomon means “peaceful” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61386" data-verses="2Samuel 12:24">2 Sam. 12:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61387" data-verses="1Chronicles 22:9">1 Chron. 22:9</span>). But Solomon also has another name, “Jedidiah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61388" data-verses="2Samuel 12:25">2 Sam. 12:25</span>), which means “beloved of the Lord.” To you, Solomon means “peaceful,” but to the Lord, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> means “beloved of the Lord.” This son will be the one who will build up the house of God, today’s church.</p>
<p data-content-id="1NlUiB6cqeI91503fx4qrNTXwILpKOXRa3xvO1PRw0sPdI5EgqZugm8rhfzHxNWsD"> You need to be right in the eyes of God all the time. But be assured that your being right is not good for building up the church. However, you should not say, “Let me do wrong!” I tell you, even if you try to be wrong, you will discover that you are not able to do wrong. I do not know what kind of sovereignty this is. But one day you will do something awful. All the brothers will shake their heads, unable to believe that you could have done such a thing. Nevertheless, you have done it! Then you need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61389" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psalm 51</span>, make it your psalm, and go to the Lord, saying, “Lord, I repent. Against Thee and only Thee have I done this evil thing. Forgive me.” After this repentance, you will have another marriage, the marriage of your transgression and repentance with God’s forgiveness. This will bring forth a Solomon, one who is peaceful to you and beloved of the Lord. This person will build up the church, God’s temple. At that time you will be very useful in the building up of the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="9o9l0SO1tmu1IVKdCtKONpfXptXGW-tFY26QDUqZpb00l5gAxChgESrXFWYCatnW3"> You may say, “What about today? What shall we do—wait for that kind of person to come?” No, do not wait. Your waiting does not avail. We should just walk in the presence of the Lord and let the Lord do it. As Charles Wesley said in one of his hymns, “’Tis mercy all!” Yes, it is altogether a matter of God’s mercy. Forget about your background, your situation, or what may happen in the future. You simply need to trust in the Lord’s sovereign mercy. If you have a heart for Him and for His people, He will work everything out. He will give you the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.</p>

Nathan also was the son of David. The genealogy in Matthew says that the son of David was Solomon, and the genealogy in Luke says that the son of David was Nathan. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61392" data-verses="1Chronicles 3:1">1 Chronicles 3:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61393" data-verses="1Chronicles 3:5"> 5</span>, we see that these are two different persons. Luke’s record is the genealogy of David’s son Nathan, who was Mary’s forefather, whereas Matthew’s record is the genealogy of David’s son Solomon, who was Joseph’s forefather. One genealogy is the line of Mary, the wife’s line; the other genealogy is the line of Joseph, the husband’s line. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David, but they were from two families descended from the same grandfather. One family is the family of Solomon; the other is the family of Nathan. Under God’s sovereignty Mary and Joseph, descendants of these two families, were betrothed and brought forth Christ. Christ may be counted as the descendant of David through both Solomon and Nathan. This is the reason He has two genealogies. <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="2xgZ0nXLKCi_8HSb7r0qyjLcAiUBRo9SRNcNIlG6PuipELBsVUNCwYBGZffenbxQi"> Solomon’s relationship with Christ was not direct. Strictly speaking, Solomon was not a direct forefather of Christ. His relationship with Christ was indirect through his descendant Joseph’s marriage to Mary, of whom Christ was born (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61394" data-verses="Matthew 1:16">Matt. 1:16</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="uhrNT43xO_qwGlqNZpptA2mVPlJuwgINmCaNJZiID-2svPbLWpCwg9eHFIuy4yQvW"> The Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon’s descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be the descendant of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61395" data-verses="2Samuel 7:13-14">2 Sam. 7:13-14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61396" data-verses="2Samuel 7:16">16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61397" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:5">Jer. 23:5</span>).

Rehoboam</h2><p data-content-id="iJ-JWg9P3xZ8Q3yk35qxWI_NjzszXfY0xApHTpaS7APGWnGrnD-m4GMXFNWJAqgjl"> We proceed to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61398" data-verses="Matthew 1:7">v. 7</span>). With Rehoboam, the kingdom of David was divided (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61399" data-verses="1Kings 11:9-12">1 Kings 11:9-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61400" data-verses="1Kings 12:1-17">12:1-17</span>). Of the twelve tribes, one tribe was kept for David’s sake (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61401" data-verses="1Kings 11:13">1 Kings 11:13</span>), that is, for Christ. Christ needed the kingdom that belonged to the house of David because Christ had to be born as the heir of David’s throne. If the whole kingdom had been dissolved, nothing would have remained to allow Christ to be born as David’s royal heir. Thus, God preserved one of the tribes for David. Apparently it was preserved for David; actually it was preserved for Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="1NlUiB6cqeI91503fx4qrMjX1KrpKOXRa3xvO1PRw0sPdI5EgqZugm8rhfzHxNWsD"> After this division, the kingdom of David was in two parts: the northern part, called the kingdom of Israel, and the southern part, called the kingdom of Judah. The northern part was called the kingdom of Israel, a universal name, because it was made up of the ten tribes of Israel; the southern part was called the kingdom of Judah, a local name, because it was composed of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin. As far as you are concerned, which title has the better meaning—the kingdom of Israel or the kingdom of Judah? I would surely favor the kingdom of Israel, for that is something universal, something for the majority. I would never favor Judah, because Judah is too local, too narrow. However, although the kingdom of Israel was more universal than that of Judah, in the genealogy of Christ, not one <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> name of the kings of Israel is included. They were universal, but they were excluded from the generation of Christ. They were excluded because they were not associated with Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="9o9l0SO1tmu1IVKdCtKONovXsv3GW-tFY26QDUqZpb00l5gAxChgESrXFWYCatnW3"> This picture, like all other items in the Old Testament, was written for our learning, and it is a type of the occurrences in the New Testament age. We see the same thing today. In principle, at the beginning the church was one. But after a certain time, the church was divided, not into two parts, but perhaps into more than two thousand parts. Some may say, “Were not those in the kingdom of Israel still the people of God?” Certainly they were. They were the people of God, but they were outside of the line of Christ. What does this mean? To be outside of the line of Christ means that, although you are God’s people, you are not for Christ. You are for something other than Christ. Consider the situation today. We are all real Christians, and we are all God’s people. But are we solely, purely, fully, and ultimately for Christ or are we for something else? If you are for something other than Christ, then you are outside of the line of Christ. For this reason, none of the kings of the northern kingdom, the larger and more universal kingdom, is included in the genealogy of Christ.</p>

Matthew omitted three generations which are found in 1 Chronicles—Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah.</p>
<p data-content-id="noJLwnldamOmRe0zpuBYpkVXMS3eHDzQoGfSF2WO7NRymA3WaD3VAFdTLqa9GK2Cr"> This must have been due to the evil marriage of Joram to the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, which corrupted his descendants (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61407" data-verses="2Chronicles 21:5-6">2 Chron. 21:5-6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61408" data-verses="2Chronicles 22:1-4">22:1-4</span>). Ahab was the king of the northern kingdom, and his wife Jezebel was a wicked woman who was fully related to idols. Because she was one with the Devil, she corrupted her husband. They brought forth a daughter, and Joram, one of the kings of Judah, <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> married her. This woman taught Joram to worship idols, to be one with the idols. Thus their family was corrupted. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61409" data-verses="Exodus 20:5">Exodus 20:5</span>, three generations of Joram’s descendants were cut off from the generation of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61410" data-verses="Exodus 20:5">Exodus 20:5</span> says that anyone who forsakes God and worships idols corrupts himself and will suffer God’s curse for three or four generations. Therefore, three generations of King Joram were cut off from the genealogy of Christ. Here we must learn a lesson. If we would be associated with Christ, we should never be involved with anything related to idols. God is a jealous God and He will never tolerate idolatry.</p>

One generation—Jehoiakim—was omitted from the genealogy of Christ. This must have been because he was made king by Pharaoh of Egypt and collected tax for Pharaoh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61413" data-verses="2Kings 23:34-35">2 Kings 23:34-35</span>). Because he was so closely related to Egypt, he was excluded from the genealogy of Christ. Egypt represents the world. From these two records we see that anyone who is related to idols or associated with the world will be excluded from the generation of Christ.</p>

Perhaps this was a case in accordance with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61421" data-verses="Deuteronomy 25:5-6">Deuteronomy 25:5 and 6</span>, which say that if a man dies without a son as his heir, his brother must marry his wife in order to produce a son to be his heir.

He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God’s temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61424" data-verses="Zechariah 4:7-10">Zech. 4:7-10</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="PsdTGyvkVznrKHx5GNFcVAPA-ycUBN6Jki2lR4GRPnasll_URh5etnXSwSlIIFZmK"> Without this return from captivity, it would have been impossible for Christ to be born at Bethlehem. The Old Testament definitely predicted that Christ, as the descendant <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> of David, would be born in Bethlehem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61425" data-verses="Matthew 2:4-6">Matt. 2:4-6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61426" data-verses="Micah 5:2">Micah 5:2</span>). Suppose none of the people of Israel had returned to Judah, and the time came for Christ to be born at Bethlehem. No one would have been there. Now we can understand why God commanded the captives to return. God’s commandment that the captives return was not only for the rebuilding of the temple but also the preparation for Christ to be born in Bethlehem.</p>
<p data-content-id="-ZHK3T1CDyWPzitDGxi-v4C0OdzXyeVW08cjyfHtVx1oVgCPdC7wSFuzbiDLeLgcG"> It is exactly the same today. Some may ask, “What is the difference between remaining at Babylon and returning to Jerusalem? Isn’t it the same, as long as we worship God and walk in the spirit?” It may be all right with you, but it is not all right with Christ. Christ needs some people to bring Him to Bethlehem. You may worship God and you may walk in the spirit in Babylon, but be assured that Christ could never be born into humanity through you. This requires a specific place. You must return from Babylon to Judah. When the time came for the Lord Jesus to be born, some Israelites, descendants of the returned captives, were waiting in Judah. At that time, Joseph and Mary were not in Babylon; they were in Judah. For Christ to come to earth, some of His captured people had to return. For His second coming, Christ also needs some of His captured people to return from their captivity to the proper church life.</p>

Luke’s record says “as was supposed.” A literal translation would be “as to the law.” This indicates that Joseph was not actually the son of Heli, but was reckoned as his son according to the law. Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, Mary’s father. This might have been a case according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61429" data-verses="Numbers 27:1-8">Numbers 27:1-8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61430" data-verses="Numbers 36:1-12">36:1-12</span>, in which a regulation was made by God that if any parents had only daughters as heirs, their inheritance should go to the daughters; the daughters then must marry a man of their own tribe in order to keep their inheritance within that tribe.

Joseph the Husband of Mary,<br/>of Whom Jesus Was Born</h2><p data-content-id="2xgZ0nXLKCi_8HSb7r0qyjLcLwUBRo9SRNcNIlG6PuipELBsVUNCwYBGZffenbxQi"> At this point, the record of this genealogy does not say “Joseph begot Jesus,” as mentioned of all the foregoing persons; it says, “Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61434" data-verses="Matthew 1:16">v. 16</span>). Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61435" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Gen. 3:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61436" data-verses="Isaiah 7:14">Isa. 7:14</span>). Christ could not have been born of Joseph, because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, of whose descendants none could inherit the throne of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61437" data-verses="Jeremiah 22:28-30">Jer. 22:28-30</span>). If Christ had been born of Joseph, he would have been excluded from the throne of David. However, Mary was a virgin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61438" data-verses="Luke 1:27">Luke 1:27</span>) and a descendant of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61439" data-verses="Luke 1:31-32">Luke 1:31-32</span>), the right person of whom Christ should be born. The marriage of Joseph with Mary brought him into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ’s genealogy for the bringing forth of Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="uhrNT43xO_qwGlqNZpptA2mVF3ZuwgINmCaNJZiID-2svPbLWpCwg9eHFIuy4yQvW"> Now we need to examine the chart (p. 52) which shows that the generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus. The first name is God, and the last name is Jesus. It proceeds from God to Adam, from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob and on to David. After David, it is divided into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph. Eventually, in God’s sovereignty, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary to Joseph to <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> bring forth Christ. If we spend time to consider this chart, we shall realize how wonderful is God’s sovereignty.</p>
<p data-content-id="fleo7fcOpJvNrupbaAzldSIaW7g_109ySLIOr03uj0FOd-46ncgem8mYMh50SmrxS"> All marriages are under God’s sovereignty, especially marriages related to Christ. From God to David the genealogy was one line, and from David to Jesus it was two lines; yet these two lines were united through the marriage of Joseph and Mary. The Jesus who was brought forth by Mary fulfills the prophecies: the prophecy concerning the seed of woman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61440" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Gen. 3:15</span>); the prophecy of a virgin bringing forth a son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61441" data-verses="Isaiah 7:14">Isa. 7:14</span>); the prophecy of Abraham having a seed who would bring blessing to all the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61442" data-verses="Genesis 22:18">Gen. 22:18</span>); the prophecy to Isaac and Jacob, which was the same as the prophecy made to Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61443" data-verses="Genesis 26:4">Gen. 26:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61444" data-verses="Genesis 28:14">28:14</span>); the prophecy made to Judah that Judah would be the royal tribe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61445" data-verses="Genesis 49:10">Gen. 49:10</span>); and the prophecy made to David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61446" data-verses="2Samuel 7:12-13">2 Sam. 7:12-13</span>). Although the birth of Jesus fulfilled many prophecies in the Old Testament, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah. Seemingly, the descendants of Jeconiah were still in the royal line. But according to God’s sovereignty, Mary, the mother of Jesus, married Joseph, a descendant of Jeconiah, who seemed to be in the line of the royal family. Apparently, Jesus was the descendant of Jeconiah; actually, He was not. He was the descendant of David. Only God can arrange such a thing. Praise Him!</p>
<p data-content-id="I4LvZeA_P9SNvkT0wtxtqovMMfy-joEe3nm1uxTCEmY8YFFYDNpWDh0N7PwE6T6OX"> If you consider your history, the history of your salvation, you will see that the principle is the same. Do not think that the marriage of Joseph and Mary was an accident. It was no accident; rather it was planned by the sovereign hand of God. Likewise, your association with Christ—your salvation—was not an accident; it also was planned by the divine hand. Sometimes I have thanked the Lord and said to Him, “I am so happy that You did not put me on earth in 20 B.C., but in the twentieth century. You put me on this earth in a place where the missionaries came with the Bible. One day I was born of a Christian mother. Later, I was given the opportunity to hear the gospel, and I was saved. Hallelujah!” This was no accident. Neither was your association with Christ an accident. God carefully planned it all. God <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> has arranged all this for little people like us. This is not an insignificant matter. When we enter eternity, we may be very surprised. We may shout, “Praise the Lord!”</p>

Being a virgin, she was different from the other four women mentioned in this genealogy. Mary was pure and unique. She conceived of the Holy Spirit, not of man, to bring forth Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61448" data-verses="Luke 1:34-35">Luke 1:34-35</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61449" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">Matt. 1:18b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61450" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">20b</span>). This account of the four remarried women and the one virgin proves that all the persons recorded in this genealogy were born of sin, except Christ, who was born in holiness.</p>

In Luke’s genealogy, the title Christ is not mentioned. Luke mentions the name Jesus because Luke proves that the Lord came to be a man, not to be the Anointed One, the King, the Messiah. Matthew, on the contrary, proves that Jesus is the King, the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament. Hence, he added the word, “Who is called Christ.”</p>

So, the carrying away itself became a landmark, a landmark of shame. At that time, the landmark was not a person; it was the carrying away to Babylon.

The number fourteen is composed of ten plus four. Four signifies the creatures. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61457" data-verses="Revelation 4:6">Revelation 4:6</span> we have the four living creatures, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61458" data-verses="Revelation 7:1">Revelation 7:1</span> we have “the four corners of the earth” and “the four winds.” The number ten signifies fullness. We often speak of one tenth, meaning the tenth part of fullness (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61459" data-verses="Genesis 14:20">Gen. 14:20</span>). Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61460" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">Matthew 25:1</span> we have ten virgins. Look at your two hands and your feet: you have ten fingers and ten toes. Thus, the number ten denotes fullness, and the number fourteen signifies the creatures in full.</p>
<p data-content-id="BAT3tbUvVYvhzf1Tj6xzep9afaNnOzxTohz2kDGkCytGBciUNm3iv8X8Y54w7alas"> Three times of fourteen generations indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with the creatures in full. This is very meaningful. The Persons of the Triune God are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This genealogy is of three sections: the section of the fathers, the section of the kings, and the section of the civilians, including the captured ones and the recovered ones. God the Father fits into the section of the fathers, God the Son fits into the section of the kings, and God the Spirit fits into the section of the civilians. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> is wonderful! Therefore, three times fourteen means the mingling of the Triune God with His creatures. This record of the generation of Christ indicates the mingling of the Triune God with these human creatures.</p>
<p data-content-id="xT_UZXnNTr4EKhCRQA-M3nA_yLEcIPkkzx1gjA5pn5v100-KzMBYBIM75WRWfJSbp"> The Triune God has been traveling through Abraham and Isaac, Jacob and Judah, Boaz and Obed, Jesse and David, and then through many other generations to Mary and Joseph. Finally, Jesus came. Who is Jesus? Jesus is the Triune God traveling through all the generations and coming forth as the mingling of divinity with humanity.</p>
<p data-content-id="rrHHs6EB2hifkbOEsDvdjta3zfhIeANh58k6aj_wsbQZxSyrmyshzF2TGMpzE32_a"> Three times fourteen is forty-two. Forty is the number of trials, temptations, and sufferings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61461" data-verses="Hebrews 3:9">Heb. 3:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61462" data-verses="Matthew 4:2">Matt. 4:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61463" data-verses="1Kings 19:8">1 Kings 19:8</span>). Christ is the forty-second generation. Forty-two signifies rest and satisfaction after trials. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61464" data-verses="Numbers 33:5-48">Numbers 33:5-48</span> shows us that the children of Israel traveled through forty-two stations before they came into Canaan. According to the record of the Old Testament, the Israelites suffered all the way through these forty-two stations. They were tried, they were tempted, and they were tested. They had no rest. However, after passing through these forty-two stations, they entered into rest. This not only happened in the past, but will happen again in the future. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61465" data-verses="Revelation 13:1">Revelation 13</span>, we see that there will be forty-two months, three and one-half years. These forty-two months will be the concluding part of the final seven years, the last week mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61466" data-verses="Daniel 9:24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</span>. There are seventy weeks: the first seven weeks, then sixty-two weeks, and then the last week, each week representing seven years. The second half of these last seven years, a period of forty-two months, will be the great tribulation, and it will be awful. There will be many trials, testings, temptations, and sufferings. But, when these forty-two months have been completed, the kingdom will come and there will be rest. From Abraham through Mary was a time of sufferings, tests, and temptations. After all the generations of trials, temptations, and sufferings, Christ came as the forty-second generation to be our rest and satisfaction. With Him we have complete rest and full satisfaction. <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="dWQGQdEDRC5zuJZX8AMIf3Fr-GlgC5d74WTtePoRmZt-8k_JsT4Mkew34IjKVg9Nt"> If we read the history in Chronicles, we shall discover that the generations from Abraham to Christ were actually forty-five generations. Why then does Matthew have only forty-two? By deducting from the forty-five generations the three cursed generations and the one improper generation, and by making David two generations (one of the fathers and one of the kings), the generations become forty-two, which are divided into three ages of fourteen generations each.</p>
<p data-content-id="QRe98RapaaaKaU9rvUrwom3vmQ29XFHwo0MNs9lb0EHIgRGLmx9NJZbe_kkxe-sUH"> Remember: this is not only a life-study, but also a Bible study. Hence, we need some knowledge. We need to see that the record of Matthew is not a record according to history, but a record according to doctrine. The record of John, on the contrary, is according to history, for John wrote his Gospel according to the events of history. According to history, it was forty-five generations, but according to Matthew’s doctrinal purpose, it was forty-two generations. Matthew must have had a doctrinal purpose in saying that from Abraham to David was fourteen generations, from David to the carrying away was another fourteen generations, and from the carrying away to Christ was still another fourteen generations. It was not inaccurate for Matthew to say this. Three generations were omitted because they were not qualified, and a fourth generation was disqualified and cut off. But there was a wonderful person, David the king, who was doubly qualified. He became two generations, closing one section and opening another. He brought in the kingship, for through him the kingdom was established. Therefore, by David’s being counted as two generations, this genealogy of Christ can consist of forty-two generations in three sections, each with fourteen generations.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="KQtTXmFXrPslnaSFbZUEECtdeBzobq-W2fVGm40PJRyaqhCmMxfi9Y-SX06t3vdRz">HH. “To the Christ”</h2><p data-content-id="l2KaTr_EtXQZHQHojlDtFFR9FlHISdj89KCjc7XWkauiPfcbMlkYte7eKt5OLxP2N"> Let us now consider the words “to the Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61467" data-verses="Matthew 1:17">v. 17</span>). Luke’s record begins with Jesus and traces back to God, a total of seventy-seven generations. Matthew’s record proceeds from Abraham to Christ. Luke goes back and up to God; Matthew comes forward and down to Christ. All the generations were <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> directed toward Christ and brought forth Christ. Without Christ, there are just forty-one generations; there is no goal, no consummation, and no conclusion. Forty-one is not a good number; we must have the number forty-two. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations, fulfilling their prophecies, solving their problems, and meeting their needs. Christ came to fulfill all the prophecies, the prophecies of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and David. Without the coming of Christ, all these prophecies would have been in vain. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him. From this point on, the whole New Testament is the full expounding of this wonderful Christ. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament—the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation—tell us how this Christ fulfills all the prophecies, solves all our problems, and meets all our needs and how He is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come! <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="abSJWp_OwRzajN9ql34uZcMG_1CF2_ct6UGsDGXLuJJ-nMTFTDNm0IxFal6L5FIAr">A. By God’s Sovereignty</h2><p data-content-id="bxL4Xdo_wuMUnW9-yOhGcSntoKMT5Z5QqCEsbK7COLzrP4JRhUioM-j2smfPMA4Nf"> The birth of Christ was prepared and carried out by God’s sovereignty (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61468" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">1:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61469" data-verses="Luke 1:26-27">Luke 1:26-27</span>). By His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David. Marriage is a mystery. It is not easy to bring two persons together, especially when it concerns the birth of Christ. It was not a simple matter to bring Joseph and Mary together. Look into the history here. According to the genealogy of Christ in Matthew, Joseph was a descendant of Zerubbabel, a returned captive. Zerubbabel, a leader of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of the royal family, led the captives from Babylon to Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61470" data-verses="Ezra 2:2">Ezra 2:2</span>). Eventually, he also took the lead in rebuilding the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61471" data-verses="Ezra 3:8">Ezra 3:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61472" data-verses="Ezra 5:2">5:2</span>). Joseph was his descendant. If there had been no return of the captives, where would Joseph have been born? He would have been born in Babylon. The same would have been true for Mary, also a descendant of the returned captives. If the forefathers of <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> Joseph and Mary had remained in Babylon and if both Mary and Joseph themselves had been born there, how could Jesus have been born of Mary in Bethlehem? Now we can see God’s sovereignty in bringing back the forefathers of Joseph and Mary.</p>
<p data-content-id="qIPXFTTqQB63s-xSEjzWM0c5JJSrQRlETbglenJKAt55NkZWNqM-G2-4TYyM6p0p7"> By His sovereignty, God placed both Joseph and Mary in the same city, Nazareth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61473" data-verses="Luke 1:26">Luke 1:26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61474" data-verses="Luke 2:4">2:4</span>). If they had lived far away from each other, it would have been difficult for them to come together in marriage. Joseph and Mary not only were descendants of the returned captives, but also lived in the same little town. This allowed them to come together in marriage.</p>
<p data-content-id="0b4FGv9be2FPEifP5IOzb8iXtkgm4Jvxpwry4Tqquizz_t8SLS7hnCkKKnf5q6lHb"> Furthermore, when we examine the genealogies in Matthew and Luke, we discover that Joseph was a descendant of the royal line, the line of Solomon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61475" data-verses="Matthew 1:6-7">v. 6-7</span>), and Mary was a descendant of the common line, the line of Nathan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61476" data-verses="Luke 3:31">Luke 3:31</span>). Although Joseph and Mary came together in marriage, Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph. Apparently, He was born of Joseph; actually, He was born of Mary (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61477" data-verses="Matthew 1:16">1:16</span>). This was absolutely a matter of God’s sovereignty.</p>
<p data-content-id="7gOUzACjtGFQwhTPxMOjxSfP9yZpCXkSeLBKMv-G9vbSz9FwafEz5B7ukzfuDDj_q"> As we have seen in a previous message, the curse recorded in Jeremiah disqualified any descendant of Jeconiah from inheriting the throne of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61478" data-verses="Jeremiah 22:28-30">Jer. 22:28-30</span>). If, in actuality, Jesus had been born of Joseph, He would have been disqualified from the throne of David. Because Joseph was still in the royal line, he was a royal descendant according to man’s eyes. By the marriage of Mary, Jesus’ mother, with Joseph, Jesus was apparently associated with this royal line. Again, we see God’s sovereignty. God found a young woman, also the descendant of David, to bring forth Christ. Jesus was born of her and was actually the seed of David qualified to inherit the throne of David.</p>
<p data-content-id="_2JrVSLNabiegt69WzyiQW1XAZPT9uEtQ7AfAV04vYLNdH2qCFSklycgubXid-ZQb"> By this sovereign arrangement, Jesus was both an ordinary person and the heir of the royal throne. This is the reason He has two genealogies, one in Luke, telling us of His common status, and another in Matthew, telling us of His royal status. His common status came from Mary, and His royal status came from Joseph. Thus Jesus was born by <span class="pg" data-page-id="55" id="55">[55]</span> God’s sovereignty. None of us was born under this kind of God’s sovereignty. None of us was born under this kind of sovereignty. Only Jesus was qualified to enjoy such a sovereign arrangement.</p>

Through Mary’s Surrender</h2><p data-content-id="xT_UZXnNTr4EKhCRQA-M3nQ_2KEcIPkkzx1gjA5pn5v100-KzMBYBIM75WRWfJSbp"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61479" data-verses="Luke 1:26-38">Luke 1:26-38</span>, the birth of Christ was carried out through Mary’s surrender. Here I would say a word to the young people. It was not easy for a young virgin like Mary to accept the commission to conceive a child. If I had been she, I would have said, “Lord, if You would ask me to do anything other than this, I would do it. But You ask me to conceive a child! This is not humanly possible; it is neither moral nor ethical. I can’t do it!” For us to read this record is easy. However, suppose a young sister among us were to receive such a commission tonight. Could she accept it? This is not an insignificant matter. Mary might have said, “Gabriel, don’t you know that I am espoused to a man already? How can I conceive a child?” Who among us would accept such a commission? If an angel spoke such a word to you, could you accept it?</p>
<p data-content-id="rrHHs6EB2hifkbOEsDvdjtK33ehIeANh58k6aj_wsbQZxSyrmyshzF2TGMpzE32_a"> After listening to the word of the angel, Mary said, “Behold the slave of the Lord; may it be to me according to your word” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61480" data-verses="Luke 1:38">Luke 1:38</span>). This may appear simple, but the price was extremely high. To bring forth Christ Mary paid a very high price—the cost of her whole being. It is not easy to bring forth Christ; it is not cheap. If we would bring forth Christ, we must pay a price. Mary did.</p>
<p data-content-id="dWQGQdEDRC5zuJZX8AMIf3Vr6HlgC5d74WTtePoRmZt-8k_JsT4Mkew34IjKVg9Nt"> Joseph reacted immediately, planning that he would put Mary away secretly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61481" data-verses="Matthew 1:19">v. 19</span>). Thus, Mary was in trouble. I assure you, whenever you accept the commission to bring forth Christ, you will find yourself in trouble. All the angels will understand you, but not one human being will understand. Do not expect anyone to be like the angel Gabriel. Everyone will misunderstand you. In fact, the person closest to you may misunderstand you the most. Nevertheless, in large measure, the birth of Christ was accomplished through Mary’s surrender. <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> </p>

Of the Holy Spirit’s Power</h2><p data-content-id="KQtTXmFXrPslnaSFbZUEEC9daCzobq-W2fVGm40PJRyaqhCmMxfi9Y-SX06t3vdRz"> However, Mary’s surrender was not directly related to the conceiving of Jesus. The conceiving of Jesus was directly related to the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61482" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">vv. 18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61483" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61484" data-verses="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</span>). Without the Holy Spirit, Mary’s surrender would have meant nothing. No matter how much we may surrender, without the power of the Holy Spirit our surrender means nothing. Do not estimate your surrender too highly. Our surrender means little; it simply affords the opportunity for the Holy Spirit’s power to come into us and accomplish something.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="l2KaTr_EtXQZHQHojlDtFFB9BmHISdj89KCjc7XWkauiPfcbMlkYte7eKt5OLxP2N">D. With Joseph’s Obedience and Coordination</h2><p data-content-id="OxkYcRq8v6B7_MmBZGDr2s-nWWYeJDCaUrjxjOW5CR5JzI0x6mWbwtXLMT_PvkFVK"> Although there was the sovereignty of God, the surrender of Mary, and the power of the Holy Spirit, there was the need of Joseph’s obedience and coordination (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61485" data-verses="Matthew 1:19-21">vv. 19-21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61486" data-verses="Matthew 1:24-25">24-25</span>). What would have happened if Joseph had insisted on a divorce? He was planning this. However, he was the person selected by God for the birth of Christ. Therefore, he was not so rough and quick; rather, he was considerate and thoughtful. Because at that time Joseph was a young man, I would take this opportunity to say a word to the young people: Do not make decisions too fast or act too quickly. Be a little slow and give the Lord a chance to come in. At least, give the matter another night. During that night, the angel may come and speak to you. This happened to Joseph. While he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61487" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">v. 20</span>). Joseph obeyed the word of the angel.</p>
<p data-content-id="4PJTyNjfqAKbyEk3eogO79HbK36nQXL-AMqdSkFRm2vp-8_AX0kxeelCMA8_ZCa6R"> Suppose you were engaged to a young girl and discovered that she was with child. Would you still take her? To take such a woman would surely be a shame. Therefore, not only Mary paid a price, but Joseph also paid a price. The bringing forth of Christ cost him a great deal, for it caused him to suffer shame.</p>

Fulfilling the Prophecies</h2><p data-content-id="GG0jVDEuoavrpqtC1HE9nAYNulCvAEH1UunQPf5rqTlNUlNE_qFrJtcxYz1n2ssP9"> The birth of Christ was a great fulfillment of prophecies in the Old Testament. The first prophecy in the Old <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> Testament is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61488" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>. There are no prophecies in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61489" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapters one</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61490" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">two</span> of Genesis, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61491" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">chapter three</span>, after the fall of man, after the serpent had worked himself into man through the woman, God gave a promise. In giving this promise, God seemed to say, “Serpent, you came in through the woman. Now I shall deal with you by the seed of this woman.” Thus, the promise concerning the seed of the woman was the first prophecy in the Bible.</p>
<p data-content-id="cdG-MvNWEFq-9QUaONLGA1-gjE4uyB6xpASdwLNvKZicfk5RoZOf8Be_AOitaHsdh"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61492" data-verses="Matthew 1:22-23">1:22 and 23</span> this promise is fulfilled by a virgin conceiving a child. This child came to be the seed of the woman. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61493" data-verses="Galatians 4:4">Galatians 4:4</span> Paul says that Christ was born under the law and also was born of the woman. Christ came not only to fulfill the law, but also to fulfill the promise that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent.</p>

God Becoming Flesh</h2><p data-content-id="Dll3DuRRWmEY_e7wOtGyp9m7GS6CmQMg-F4ZlLCgTuqjITUyNx32870TbZn89SK21"> However, it is difficult to find a verse which says that God became man. What the Bible says is this: “The Word was God...and the Word became flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61495" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61496" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). Man is a good term, but flesh is not. If I tell you that you are a man, you will be happy. But if I say that you are flesh, you will not be happy because the word flesh is not a positive term. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61497" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span> Paul says, “Great is the mystery... Who was manifested in the flesh.” Although flesh is not a good term, the Bible says that God was manifest in the flesh.</p>
<p data-content-id="SnnIBcYQ6GOgEVU9Y-WDRs-NyxHImDxhJIJAeeHvCpNIcZtm5FOuu8yTWPrFWwKrI"> It is not easy to understand what the Bible means by the flesh. In the Bible the flesh has at least three meanings. First, in a good sense, it means the meat of our body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61498" data-verses="John 6:55">John 6:55</span>). Our body has meat and bone, blood and skin. This is physical. Second, flesh means our fallen body. God did not create fallen flesh; He created a body. When man fell, the poison of Satan was injected into his body, and the body was corrupted and became the flesh. Therefore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61499" data-verses="Romans 7:18">Romans 7:18</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> says, “For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells.” This indicates that the fallen body, the body of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61500" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>), is called the flesh. All human lusts come from this flesh. Hence, the New Testament has the term “the lusts of our flesh” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61501" data-verses="Ephesians 2:3">Eph. 2:3</span>). Third, the flesh, especially in the New Testament, means the fallen man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61502" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Romans 3:20</span> says, “By the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him.” In this verse flesh is the fallen man.</p>
<p data-content-id="griJiQSzWDsTHQrY15c2IrydWUcP7qlHqfQNmQzPjsR2H__7IlxH4gAwVvsjwJPy_"> Nevertheless <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61503" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says, “The Word [which was God] became flesh.” As we have seen, flesh means the fallen man. How, then, shall we interpret <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61504" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>? The Word was God, and the Word became flesh. Great is the mystery that God was manifest in the flesh. The Bible says that God became flesh and that flesh is not the created man, but the fallen man. Can we say that God became a fallen man? This surely is a difficult matter.</p>
<p data-content-id="ermM79o3c7gIZ6fj0t83Ee8sj9N-RnI7GLl4Rg4SnJsEHKTtBz-MXbVRwcSoiwm-8"> However, there are two verses that can help us. The first verse is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61505" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span>, which says that God sent “His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.” This verse does not say “the flesh of sin”; it says “the likeness of the flesh of sin.” The other verse is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61506" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” The serpent lifted up on a pole in the wilderness was not actually a serpent with poison; it was a brass serpent made in the likeness of a real serpent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61507" data-verses="Numbers 21:9">Num. 21:9</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61508" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span> is the word of the Lord Jesus to Nicodemus. The Lord told him that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must He Himself be lifted up on the cross. When Jesus was on the cross, in the eyes of God He was in the form, the likeness, of a serpent. But as was the case with the brass serpent in the wilderness, there was no poison in Him because He was not born of a fallen man. He was born of a virgin.</p>
<p data-content-id="5Y773SPR77C2H0B4RbzP5Feih9CypWlUDUYHIQCu6uAD4q_U_UK0S2LqwPxdyeFfU"> Now we must clearly differentiate two points: Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and He was born of a virgin. His source was the Holy Spirit, and His element was divine. Through the virgin Mary as a means, He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking “the likeness of the flesh,” “the likeness of men” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61509" data-verses="Philippians 2:7">Phil. 2:7</span>). However, He did not have <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> the sinful nature of the fallen flesh. He knew no sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61510" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:21">2 Cor. 5:21</span>), and He had no sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61511" data-verses="Hebrews 4:15">Heb. 4:15</span>). He had flesh, but it was the “likeness of the flesh of sin.” In appearance He was made in the form of a fallen man, but in actuality there was no fallen nature within Him. His birth was exactly the same in principle. Apparently, He was the son of Joseph; actually, He was the son of Mary.</p>
<p data-content-id="N-ZaYPyZqODWNh5PVTFlqYDLN6SHS3WtXnGfD2YNzWmPzlEiEdCjCFgT0nq9Pqwmq"> Why was the Lord Jesus viewed by God as being in the form of a serpent when He was on the cross? Because, since the day man fell (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61512" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Gen. 3:1</span>), the serpent had been in man, and he made every man a serpent. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61513" data-verses="Matthew 3:7">Matthew 3:7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61514" data-verses="Matthew 23:33">23:33</span>, both John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus called people the “generation of vipers,” that is, serpents, indicating that all fallen ones are descendants of the serpent. We all are little serpents. Do not think that you are good. Before you were saved, you were a serpent. This is the reason the Lord Jesus died on the cross to suffer God’s judgment. When Jesus was on the cross, He was not only a man, but was also in the form of a serpent. In the eyes of God, for all of us serpentine people, He took on the form of a serpent and died on the cross. Perhaps you have never heard that Jesus took the form of a serpent, the likeness of the flesh of sin. You have heard that Jesus is God and that He took the form of a man, but not that He also took the form of a serpent. How wonderful He is!</p>
<p data-content-id="tGZCwtHghQxryExdqI-PSVjDW-JO0W6ZQuXll7QUSOhP8Y9PFcEwJYM4qtd1Tupk-"> We are fallen flesh, and Jesus came into this flesh that He might bring God into humanity. In Him, the divine Person of God was mingled with humanity. The birth of Christ was not simply to produce a Savior, but also to bring God into man. Although humanity was fallen, God did not take on any part of this fallen nature. God took only the likeness of the fallen flesh, and through this He mingled Himself with humanity. We should not think of Jesus in the way many others think of Him. We must realize that Jesus is nothing less than God Himself mingled with fallen humanity, taking the form of humanity, but without man’s sinful nature. This was the birth of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="60" id="60">[60]</span> </p>

And He is not only Jehovah—He is Jehovah with something else. The name Jesus means “Jehovah the Savior” or “the salvation of Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61515" data-verses="Matthew 1:21">Matt. 1:21</span>). This wonderful Person is the very salvation which Jehovah renders people. He Himself is salvation. Because Jehovah Himself becomes salvation, He is the Savior.</p>
<p data-content-id="MXw_qbkhjqaSRjjhv3l4r230iInns_i2Wn9YDe1F5-tDaKc1VP2-t8yhzkWzA3axH"> Do not think that when we call Jesus we are just calling the name of a man. Jesus is not simply a man; He is Jehovah our salvation, Jehovah our Savior. This is simple, yet profound. When you call on Jesus, the whole universe realizes that you are calling on Jehovah as your Savior, Jehovah as your salvation.</p>
<p data-content-id="VWbxdricdU_hA3RMoyfDeRxVo3zDbWNHRQkxOey9YYiINMi1fnT-KoMPfyrnENiAe"> The Jews believe in Jehovah, but not in Jesus. In a sense, they have Jehovah, but they do not have salvation or the Savior. We have more than the Jews have, for we have Jehovah the Savior, Jehovah our salvation. This is why we have such a wonderful feeling when we call on Jesus. Even if you were to say that you hate Jesus, there would still be a feeling within you. If you were to say, “I hate Abraham Lincoln,” there would be no feeling. If you say, “I hate Jesus,” some feeling is there. Abraham Lincoln has nothing to do with you, but Jesus does. Many have said, “I hate Jesus,” and later were caught by Jesus. Whoever calls on the name of Jesus will be saved. If you touch the name of Jesus, you will be touched by Him. When we preach the gospel, it is good to help people call on Jesus. As long as they call on Jesus, something will happen.</p>

The name Jehovah, which is not used until <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61517" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, is used especially when God relates to man.

Whenever we call on His name, He saves us from sin and brings us into rest, into the enjoyment of Himself. A line in a hymn speaks about saying the name Jesus a thousand times a day. The more you say, “Jesus,” the better. We must learn to speak the name of Jesus all the time. Jesus is our salvation. Jesus is also our rest. Whoever calls on the name of the Lord Jesus shall be saved and enter into the rest.</p>

When no one else can control you—neither our parents, your husband, your wife, or your children—the King of kings will do something. Simply call on the name of Jesus. If you do, you will enjoy Jehovah, the Savior, salvation, the presence of God, and also the kingship of Jesus. Jesus the King will be born in you, and He will establish His kingdom within you. This is the very Jesus Christ we find in Matthew.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZBEfLYwnFQMIktZO1CK-QSyJboEKKx_55o0glLaVuMsWNmNHaosd8tvUYD9QEc1P0"> The Christ in Matthew is the Savior-King and the King-Savior who sets up the kingdom of the heavens within us and over us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61532" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> not only gives us the origin of this King; it also gives us the presence of this King. This King’s name is Jesus. Whenever we call on His name, we have the sense that He is ruling within us by saving us. He is setting up the kingdom of the heavens within us. Hallelujah, this is our Christ!</p>

We have spent considerable time on the names of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and even on the names of Tamar and Rahab. The last two names, however, Jesus and Emmanuel, are more than wonderful. Although the last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61534" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> seems to deal with the birth of Christ, it actually deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel. In this message I am burdened to give you a hint concerning how to dwell on these names.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="xT_UZXnNTr4EKhCRQA-M3ng_xZkcIPkkzx1gjA5pn5v100-KzMBYBIM75WRWfJSbp">J. Jesus, the Name Given by God</h2><p data-content-id="rrHHs6EB2hifkbOEsDvdjt63xNRIeANh58k6aj_wsbQZxSyrmyshzF2TGMpzE32_a"> Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name called by man. The angel Gabriel told Mary that the child she would conceive was to be called Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61535" data-verses="Luke 1:31">Luke 1:31</span>). Later, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and also told him to call the child Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61536" data-verses="Matthew 1:21">Matt. 1:21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61537" data-verses="Matthew 1:25">25</span>). Hence, Jesus was a God-given name.</p>

<p data-content-id="RY9q0kGVK_zA5JdFczeiSnsRRoZeD2ESq_eMP1IIUgARJQj9mVihVadUTPO8j7gB8"> The name Jesus includes the name Jehovah. In Hebrew, the name God means the mighty One, God the Almighty; and the name Jehovah means I Am—I Am That I Am (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61538" data-verses="Exodus 3:14">Exo. 3:14</span>). The verb “to be” in Hebrew not only refers to the present, but also includes both the past and the future. Hence, the correct meaning of Jehovah is I Am That I Am, the One who is now in the present, who was in the past, and who will be in the future and in eternity forever. This is the name of Jehovah. Only God is the eternal One. From eternity past to eternity future, He is <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> the I Am. Therefore, the Lord Jesus could say of Himself, “Before Abraham came into being, I am” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61539" data-verses="John 8:58">John 8:58</span>). He also said to the Jews, “Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins,” and, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61540" data-verses="John 8:24">John 8:24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61541" data-verses="John 8:28">28</span>). We must realize that Jesus is the great I Am and believe in Him as the great I Am.</p>
<p data-content-id="siyQbSV0SohaqmYKfSlv6AKPl4vEsUaPjFHZdHjhPAHuAdGGRBtHAnI_Y6uooFPTK"> Because the name of the Lord is the I Am, we may say, “Lord, You told me that Your name is I Am. Then, what are You?” His answer will be, “I am whatever you need.” The Lord is whatever we need. If we need salvation, He Himself will be salvation to us. We have a signed check with the space for the amount left blank, and we may fill in whatever we need. If we need one dollar, we may insert one dollar. But if we need one million dollars, we may insert one million dollars. If we feel that we need one billion, we simply fill in this amount. The check covers whatever we need. Whatever you need, Jesus is. Do you need light, life, power, wisdom, holiness, or righteousness? Jesus Himself is light, life, power, wisdom, holiness, and righteousness. Everything we need is found in the name of Jesus. How high and how rich is this wonderful name!</p>

Jesus is Jehovah-Savior, the One who saves us from all negative things: from our sins, from hell, from God’s judgment, and from eternal condemnation. He is the Savior. He saves us from everything God condemns and from everything we hate. If we hate our temper, He will save us from it. He saves us from the evil power of Satan, from all our besetting sins in our daily life, and from every bondage and addiction. Hallelujah, He is the Savior!</p>

Do not ask Him to give you salvation. Instead, you should say, “Lord Jesus, come to me and be my salvation.” Jesus will never give you salvation. He will come to you as <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> salvation. We believers do not realize how much we need to be saved. Every day, every hour, and even every moment we have something from which we need to be saved.</p>
<p data-content-id="AMeKwzHaA87tn2N6tT4Rr0JNTBg0YW7zhCax78ywwyp7bWoV-OlwmAuNfNDsSlGfi"> In the messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61542" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> we spoke about the need to grow in life. But what does it mean to grow in life? On the positive side, to grow in life is to enter into the riches of what Christ is. On the negative side, it is to be delivered from certain things, or to forsake certain things. Although we are small men, we have accumulated many negative things. Probably you do not realize how many negative things you have accumulated. Wherever we go, we collect things. We pick up a great many negative things, and we acquire a number of habits from which we need to be saved. As you are reading this, you may not sense that you need salvation from anything. Suppose, however, you were suddenly raptured to the heavens. If you were taken to the heavens right now, you would immediately sense that you need a great deal of saving. To grow in life is simply to be saved from all unnecessary things, from all that is not needed for our living. If you have the light, the exposure of the fourth-day lights, you will say, “Lord, save me!” At such times we realize that Jesus is truly Jehovah as our Savior and our salvation.</p>

No name is as high and as exalted as the name of Jesus. Whether you hate Jesus or love Him, whether you are for Him or against Him, you realize that the name of Jesus is a special name. History tells us that during the past two thousand years, everyone has recognized that His name is the highest name, that it is an extraordinary name. My burden in this message is to point out to you that this exalted name of Jesus is for us to do many things.</p>

To Believe In</h2><p data-content-id="-ZHK3T1CDyWPzitDGxi-v4i0OfzXyeVW08cjyfHtVx1oVgCPdC7wSFuzbiDLeLgcG"> Firstly, the name of Jesus is for us to believe in (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61544" data-verses="John 1:12">John 1:12</span>). We all must believe in the name of Jesus. This is not <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> an insignificant matter. We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus. When we preach the gospel, we should help people not only to pray, but also to make a declaration to the whole universe that they believe in the name of Jesus. Whenever a sinner comes to believe in the Lord Jesus, he should declare, “Today I believe in the name of Jesus!” This makes a great difference.</p>

Among some Christians there is a controversy regarding the name in which they baptize people. Some argue strongly that we must baptize people only in the name of Jesus. Others insist on the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These two groups argue, debate, and fight. Actually, it is not a matter of <em>in</em> the name, but of <em>into</em> the name. We baptize people into the name of Jesus. The name needs the person, and the name is the person. Without the person, the name means nothing. To be baptized into the name of Jesus means to be baptized into His Person. Suppose a certain young man has just believed in the name of Jesus. What should we do? We should baptize him into the name of Jesus, that is, put him into Jesus. This is not a ritual nor a ceremony of accepting a religious member. It is an act of faith in which we take one who believes in the name of Jesus and put him into this name, baptizing him into the Person of Jesus. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61547" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Romans 6:3</span> says that many of us have been baptized into Christ Jesus, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61548" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Galatians 3:27</span> says, “As many as were baptized into Christ.” This is the reality of being baptized into the name of Jesus.</p>

(<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61550" data-verses="Acts 3:6">Acts 3:6</span>). Immediately the man was healed. Then Peter said to the people, “In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene...this man stands before you well” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61551" data-verses="Acts 4:10">Acts 4:10</span>). This testifies that the name of Jesus is also a healing name. We may call on the name of Jesus for healing from any kind of sickness.</p>

As defiled persons, we were washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of Jesus and by the Spirit of God. I read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61553" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span> for years without seeing a crucial point: in the name and by the Spirit. The name is closely related to the Person and to the Spirit. If the name of Jesus were an empty name, how could it wash us? How could it sanctify and justify us? This would be impossible. However, this name is linked to the Spirit. The Spirit is the Person of the name and the reality of the name. Therefore the name can wash us, sanctify us, and justify us. The Spirit is one with the name. Jesus is the name of the Lord, and the Spirit is the Person of the Lord. When we call on the name of a real person, that person comes. The name of Jesus is linked with the Person who washes us, sanctifies us, and justifies us. This is not merely doctrine or theory—it is reality. When we believe in the name of Jesus and are put into the name of Jesus, we are placed into a living Person, that is, in the Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit washes us, sanctifies us, and justifies us.</p>

To Call Upon</h2><p data-content-id="k8a9Mehyf9H71QPewDInv0g3Co069jLZd9yw23ONbZ7XFqXXrLNjP1qqvKoJw6HIh"> The name of Jesus is for us to call upon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61554" data-verses="Romans 10:13">Rom. 10:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61555" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:2">1 Cor. 1:2</span>). I was a Christian for at least thirty-five years before I found the secret of calling on the name of Jesus. I thought that calling on the name of Jesus was the same as <span class="pg" data-page-id="70" id="70">[70]</span> praying. Eventually, from the record of the Bible, I discovered that praying is one thing and calling is another. Fifteen years ago, I did a great deal of praying, mostly on my knees. I did not know the secret of calling upon the name of Jesus, nor did I know that calling is different from praying.</p>
<p data-content-id="JRY8MaLJKtf6efzbzG58laTheKkVg09yHQu46f5uWlaIY-J16MAf81zwk8d8J-hvN"> Many of us have experienced praying, but with little inspiration. However, when we call on Jesus for five minutes, we are inspired. Try it! Many of us can testify that when we prayed in the old way, we sometimes prayed ourselves to sleep. But calling on the Lord never puts us to sleep. On the contrary, it stirs us up.</p>
<p data-content-id="zeI6BsewlXT9QG5Y864_M2eUKT9tKevtEil80zoGzPhHgqih6rw1YfLAvzeK55gIY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61556" data-verses="Acts 9:14">Acts 9:14</span> says that Paul, when he was Saul of Tarsus, tried to damage all the saints. He intended to go from Jerusalem to Damascus to bind all those who called on the name of Jesus. This verse does not say that he was about to bind all those who prayed to Jesus, but all those who called on Jesus. By this one verse we can see that the early Christians were those who called on Jesus. Whenever they prayed, they called. They called upon the name of Jesus, and that became a mark of recognition.</p>
<p data-content-id="abSJWp_OwRzajN9ql34uZc8G7nSF2_ct6UGsDGXLuJJ-nMTFTDNm0IxFal6L5FIAr"> The Bible does not say that whoever prays shall be saved. It says that whosoever <em>calls</em> upon the name of the Lord shall be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61557" data-verses="Romans 10:13">Rom. 10:13</span>). Suppose that I am a sinner and I believe in the Lord Jesus. You help me to pray, and I say, “Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. You are my Savior. You love me. You died on the cross for me. Thank You.” Although it is good to pray this way, praying like this makes it very difficult for the Spirit to get into us. However, if you would help me to call, “O Lord Jesus,” louder and louder, it would make a big difference. When you preach the gospel, do not try so hard to change people’s thinking. Instead, help them to open up their being, their heart and their spirit, from deep within and to use their mouths to call upon the name of Jesus. If you help new believers to call on the name of Jesus in this way, the door will be open wide for the Spirit to enter in. There is no need to pray with vain words. After calling on the name of Jesus ten times, you will be in the heavens. Your sins will be forgiven, your burden will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="71" id="71">[71]</span> lifted, and you will have life eternal. You will have everything.</p>
<p data-content-id="bxL4Xdo_wuMUnW9-yOhGcSXtjZsT5Z5QqCEsbK7COLzrP4JRhUioM-j2smfPMA4Nf"> Even for a believer of many years, the best way to touch the Lord Jesus, to enjoy the Lord Jesus, to share something of the Lord Jesus, is not to say very much, but to go to the Lord and call, “Jesus! Jesus! Lord Jesus!” Call on the name of Jesus and you will taste something. “The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61558" data-verses="Romans 10:12">Rom. 10:12</span>). Many times, our words are too vain. It is better just to call, “Jesus.” If you call on His name, you will taste Him and enjoy Him. The name of Jesus is a wonderful name. We all need to call on Him.</p>

This does not mean that we pray a long prayer and conclude it with the words “in the name of Jesus.” That is too formal. However, I do not oppose this, for I have done this many times. Rather, I would say that in our prayer it is good to call on the name of Jesus and say, “O Jesus! Jesus! I come to pray!” In the name of Jesus, you will have a real burden to pray, and it will be very easy to have the assurance that your prayer has been heard and answered. If we call on the name of Jesus, we shall have the assurance that we shall receive what we have asked.</p>
<p data-content-id="8XQplTzgFw0d9u0jTMRBvzLnx7-1erLKEAGGMtft9sE8pal-KhVU1cBScTAbr_uVi"> After the Lord Jesus told us to pray in His name, He proceeded to say that the Spirit will come to dwell in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61562" data-verses="John 14:13-17">John 14:13-17</span>). This indicates that the indwelling Spirit has very much to do with our prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus. In order to pray in the name of Jesus, we need the Spirit. When we are in the Spirit, we are in the reality of the name of Jesus in which we are praying.</p>

Whenever you come to a Christian meeting, you must realize that you are being gathered once again into the name. We have been put into the name of Jesus, but we are not yet very deep into Him. Hence, we need to come back again and again to be gathered into His name. We can all testify that after every meeting we have had the sense deep within that we have entered further into the Lord. The Christian gatherings will bring us more deeply into the appreciation of the name of Jesus.</p>

To know the power of the name of Jesus, use it to cast out demons. Demons know the power of the name of Jesus better than we do. Demons are subtle. From our experience in China, where there were many cases of demon possession, we have learned that when we cast out demons, we must tell them that this Jesus is not the ordinary, common Jesus, but that He is the designated Jesus. We must say, “Demon, I come in the very name of Jesus, the Son of God, who was incarnated to be a man, who was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, who was raised in Nazareth, who died on the cross for my sins and for the sins of this person that is possessed, who was resurrected from the dead, and who has ascended to the heavens. I come in the name of this Jesus, and I command you to leave!” Immediately, the demon will depart. However, if you say, “I cast you out in the name of Jesus,” the demon will not listen. Demons know the power of the name of Jesus. When you cast out a demon, there is no need to pray that much.

<p data-content-id="l2KaTr_EtXQZHQHojlDtFFx9ElnISdj89KCjc7XWkauiPfcbMlkYte7eKt5OLxP2N"> Satan hates the name of Jesus. In 1935 the church in my home town was revived, and we were all burdened to preach the gospel. Every night we went to the streets to preach. One night, as we were preaching on a street corner, a man about thirty years of age was very bold to scoff at the name of Jesus. A brother went up to him in a very nice way and asked if they could have a little talk. When he agreed, the brother asked, “Have you ever met Jesus?” He said, “No.” Then the brother asked, “Have you ever heard of Jesus?” Again, he said, “No.” After that, the brother said, “Has Jesus done something bad to you?” He said, “Never.” Then the brother inquired, “You have never met Jesus, and He has never done anything bad to you. Why then do you hate Him?” He replied, “Although I’ve never met Him and although I’ve never been damaged by Him, I still hate Him.” Then the brother asked, “Why don’t you hate me?” The man answered, “I don’t hate you; I hate Jesus.” “Why?” inquired the brother. “I don’t know,” said the man. Then the brother asked, “Sir, may I relate a fact to you?” The man consented and the brother said, “Let me tell you, you do not hate Jesus. It is someone else who hates Jesus. Why? Because you have never met Jesus. It is not you!” When the man asked the brother who it was who hated Jesus, the brother answered, “It is the Devil within you who hates Jesus.” By all this we see that Satan utilizes people to attack the name of Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61566" data-verses="Acts 26:9">Acts 26:9</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> </p>

When you are about to talk to others about Plato or Abraham Lincoln, you do not feel ashamed; but whenever you talk to people about Jesus, a strange feeling comes over you. When the Chinese speak about Confucius, they feel glorious. We should also feel glorious whenever we speak to others about Jesus, but often we do not have a glorious feeling. Instead, we have a rather strange feeling. This is devilish! In this universe and on this earth there is a devilish element that is against Jesus. You have no problem as long as you are talking about the world situation, the economy, science, and so many things; but whenever you talk about the name of Jesus, you have a strange sense. This comes from the Devil. Because Satan and all his demons hate the name of Jesus, we must proclaim it all the more. We must be bold with this name and say, “Satan, Jesus is my Lord! Satan, stay away!” We need to shout the name of Jesus.</p>

The Pharisees warned Peter and John not to preach in the name of Jesus, not to do anything or say anything in His name. It was all right to preach the Bible, but not to preach in the name of Jesus. Satan hates the name of Jesus because he knows that God’s salvation is in this name. The more we preach in the name of Jesus and the more we pray to Jesus, the more people will get saved. This is the reason Satan hates this name.</p>

Whenever you have some experience of Jesus, you will be able to say that He is God with you. Jesus is nothing less than God with us. This is our experience. God told us that His name is Jesus. But as we receive Him and experience Him, we say that Jesus is God with us. This is wonderful.</p>
<p data-content-id="griJiQSzWDsTHQrY15c2IrCdQWcP7qlHqfQNmQzPjsR2H__7IlxH4gAwVvsjwJPy_"> Often we turn to our mind and ask the question, “Is this Jesus the very God?” We may be confident that He is the Son of God, but we may not yet be assured that He is actually God Himself. When I was young, I was taught by some fundamental Christian teachers to be careful of saying directly that Jesus was God. I was taught that the Son of God was different from God Himself. Therefore, I was told not to say directly that Jesus was God. I was told that I must pray through Jesus to God. I received a teaching that suited the human concept. However, after much practice, the more I prayed, the more I realized that this Jesus was simply God with me. To argue by theory is one thing; to experience the fact is another thing. Quite often, Christians do not agree with their experience; instead, they agree with their concepts. <span class="pg" data-page-id="76" id="76">[76]</span> </p>

Deep within, do you not have the sense that, according to your experience, Jesus is God? You do, but you dare not say this in doctrine. However, you should not consider Jesus as someone other than God. Jesus is nothing less than God Himself. He is not only the Son of God, but also God Himself. Some good writers have said that apart from Jesus we can never find God. God is with Jesus, and God is Jesus. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was not only with God, but the Word was God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61573" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>).

We have heard that Jesus is our comfort, our rest, our peace, and our life. Jesus is so much to us. If we would experience Him, we would immediately say, “This is God! This is not God far away from me, or God in the heavens, but God with me.” Whenever we experience Jesus in a certain way, we realize that Jesus is God with us. Jesus is our salvation. After we experience this salvation, we say, “This is God with us to be our salvation.” Jesus is our patience. But when we experience Him as our patience, we say, “This patience is God with me.” Jesus is the way and the truth, but when we experience Him as the way and the truth we say, “This way and this truth are just God with me.” Hallelujah, Jesus is God with us!

<p data-content-id="YGzD_YG4vTnIweS_DzVjv8aTLCf_MjMY1-7P2uJlME-fgOaZdIg57DhGUoi5FJ-VW"> If we pay attention to the four Gospels, we shall see that John and Mark contain no record of Christ’s youth. John tells us that Christ is God. With God there is neither youth nor old age. God is ancient, yet unchanging. Thus, there is no problem of youth with God. In Mark, Christ is revealed as a slave. No one cares about the youth of a slave. On the contrary, both Luke and Matthew record the youth of Christ. However, as was the case with the genealogies, there is a difference between these two records of Christ’s youth.</p>

Hence, Luke’s record testifies and demonstrates the humanity of Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61582" data-verses="Luke 2:21-52">Luke 2:21-52</span>). The items of Christ’s youth recorded by Luke show that Jesus was a proper, normal man. Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day according to Jewish law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61583" data-verses="Luke 2:21">Luke 2:21</span>). Also, according to Jewish custom, He was named Jesus on the eighth day, not on the first day. <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> He was offered to God with the sacrifice of a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61584" data-verses="Luke 2:22-24">Luke 2:22-24</span>). The fact that Mary and Joseph could only afford a small sacrifice shows that they were poor. They nevertheless fulfilled the requirement of the law. Furthermore, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem every year at the time of the feast of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61585" data-verses="Luke 2:41">Luke 2:41</span>). This was also according to the law requiring that all Israelite males attend the feasts three times a year. Luke specifically notes that Jesus was brought to the feast when He was twelve years old (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61586" data-verses="Luke 2:42">Luke 2:42</span>). Luke also records that Jesus grew physically, that He became strong in His spirit, and that He found favor with God and man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61587" data-verses="Luke 2:40">Luke 2:40</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61588" data-verses="Luke 2:52">52</span>).

Luke did not include this point, but Matthew, ignoring all the points covered by Luke, dwells on it. By this we see that the Bible has an intention: in Luke it is to prove that Jesus was a man; in Matthew it is to show that Jesus was a kingly child. We shall now consider Matthew’s record to see how Jesus was such a kingly child.</p>

Through the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61594" data-verses="Matthew 2:1">Matthew 2</span>, we see that Judaism was very much for the Bible. However, hardly anyone in that religion knew that Christ had come. We find no record in the New Testament that some of those religious people went to find Christ. On the contrary, there is a record that some pagan men, magi, came to find Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61595" data-verses="Matthew 2:1-12">2:1-12</span>).

This star did not appear in the Holy Land. It appeared to men far away—far away from the Holy Land; far away from the holy city; far away from the holy temple and the holy religion; far away from the holy Bible, the holy people, and the holy priests. Far away from all these holy things, the shining star appeared to some pagan men in a pagan land. The shining of that star stirred up these pagan wise men regarding the King of the Jews. I do not know how these wise men were stirred up regarding the King of the Jews, and I do not want to guess. There have already been too many imaginations concerning these wise men. At any rate, they came from the East, the Orient, and realized that the star indicated the King of the Jews.</p>

Which do you prefer to have—the Bible or the star? It is best to have both. I like to have the Bible in my hand, and I like to see the star in the heavens. It is best to be both a pagan and a Jew as well. As to the Bible, I am a Jew; as to the star, I am a pagan wise man. <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> </p>

This trouble came from their natural concept. Although we may have the Bible and the star, we must recognize that trouble may come from our natural concept. The wise men saw the vision and, realizing that it indicated the King of the Jews, they assumed that they should go to Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish nation, where the King of the Jews was presumed to be (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61597" data-verses="Matthew 2:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>). Their decision to go to Jerusalem did not come from the light of the star. They went to Jerusalem because they were distracted from the right track by their natural concept. Jerusalem was the wrong place. It was the capital and the city where the temple was located, but it was not the place where Jesus was born. Because the wise men were misled, they caused a serious problem and nearly caused the young child Jesus to be killed. If it had not been for the sovereignty of God, the young Jesus would have been killed as a result of their mistake. Their error cost the lives of many young ones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61598" data-verses="Matthew 2:16-18">vv. 16-18</span>). Be careful: you may have the Bible and the star, but do not follow your natural concept.</p>

Your human concept distracts you from the right track. Whenever you are distracted like this, you need the Bible. After you have arrived at the wrong place, you need the right book. After the magi had gone to Jerusalem, the wrong place, they were corrected through the Scriptures. From the Scriptures they learned that the right place was Bethlehem, not Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61599" data-verses="Matthew 2:4-6">vv. 4-6</span>). If they had not been misled by their natural concept, the star certainly would have led them directly to the place where Jesus was in Bethlehem. But they were distracted and went astray. Thus, they needed to be corrected by the knowledge of the Bible. When the magi had been corrected by the Scriptures, had departed from Jerusalem, and had been restored to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> right track, the star appeared again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61600" data-verses="Matthew 2:9">v. 9</span>). Living vision always goes along with the Scriptures.</p>
<p data-content-id="5Y773SPR77C2H0B4RbzP5F-ig8iypWlUDUYHIQCu6uAD4q_U_UK0S2LqwPxdyeFfU"> However, none of the religious people in Jerusalem went with the magi to Bethlehem. This is quite strange. If you had been a priest among those priests, would you not have gone with the wise men to see if Jesus had actually been born in Bethlehem? If I had been there, I certainly would have gone to find out for myself whether or not Christ had actually been born. But none of them went. They had knowledge and they could tell people that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem; yet, none of them went for themselves. Although they were for the knowledge of the Bible, they were not for the living Person of the Messiah.</p>

Many are very scriptural, but they care only for the Scriptures, not for the living Christ. If the Jewish religionists had cared for Christ, they would have gone to Bethlehem, which was not far from Jerusalem even by the ancient method of travel. Although Bethlehem was not far, none of the scribes, elders, or priests bothered to go. This proves that you can have the knowledge of the Bible without having a heart for the living Christ. To have the vision is one thing, to have the knowledge of the Bible is another thing, and to have a heart for the living Christ is still another thing. We all need to pray, “Lord, give me a heart for You. I want to see the vision and I want to know the Bible. But even more, I want to have a heart that seeks You.”</p>

<p data-content-id="UQ-0mvjA2048kTR2fcUMd-E57KtDywXiS7irtLaYPT3xlo1wXE2N_vnPIWnJh3Y0e"> Christians often say that to know the Lord it is sufficient to have only the Bible. In a sense, I agree with this. However, in another sense—I say this carefully—I do not agree fully. Although we have the Bible, we still need a <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> living vision. The Bible does say that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, but it does not say where, on what street, or in which house. The living star led the wise men to the city of Bethlehem and also to the exact street and the house where the child was. At that place, the star stopped (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61602" data-verses="Matthew 2:9">v. 9</span>). The magi did not need to knock on any doors; they knew where Jesus was. This proves that we all need a clear, up-to-date vision that leads us directly to the place where Jesus is.</p>
<p data-content-id="MXw_qbkhjqaSRjjhv3l4r2X0jLHns_i2Wn9YDe1F5-tDaKc1VP2-t8yhzkWzA3axH"> The magi not only found Christ; they also worshipped Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61603" data-verses="Matthew 2:11">v. 11</span>). Among the Israelites, no one was allowed to receive worship from others. That was considered an insult to God, a blasphemy against Him. According to them, only God was worthy of people’s worship. But the wise men worshipped a child, and that child was God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61604" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span> says, “Unto us a child is born...and his name shall be called...The mighty God.” The child found by the magi was called the mighty God. The wise men worshipped Him and they offered to Him gold, frankincense, and myrrh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61605" data-verses="Matthew 2:11">v. 11</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="VWbxdricdU_hA3RMoyfDeRRVo1zDbWNHRQkxOey9YYiINMi1fnT-KoMPfyrnENiAe"> We need to know the meaning of the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh. In the typology of the Bible, gold signifies the divine nature. This indicates that the child Jesus had the divine nature. He was divine. Frankincense signifies the fragrance of resurrection. According to our naturally religious mentality, the resurrection of Jesus came only after His death. However, before He died, Jesus told Mary and Martha that He was the resurrection and the life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61606" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>). Thus, even before He died, He was the resurrection. The life Christ lived on this earth was a life of resurrection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61607" data-verses="Luke 2:52">Luke 2:52</span> tells us that even in His childhood He found favor with God and man. That was not something natural; it was the life of resurrection. The record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61608" data-verses="Luke 2:1">Luke 2</span> reveals that the child was an extraordinary child. He was a unique child because He was a child in resurrection. In His entire human life and living there was the fragrance, the sweetness of resurrection. Death could not hold Him or even touch Him. Not only was He the life—He was resurrection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="85" id="85">[85]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="iJ-JWg9P3xZ8Q3yk35qxWIPNhzszXfY0xApHTpaS7APGWnGrnD-m4GMXFNWJAqgjl"> Myrrh signifies death and also the fragrance of death. Among the human race, death has no fragrance; however, with Jesus there was the fragrance of death.</p>
<p data-content-id="1NlUiB6cqeI91503fx4qrMTX3KrpKOXRa3xvO1PRw0sPdI5EgqZugm8rhfzHxNWsD"> When the wise men presented the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh, I do not believe they knew the meaning of the gifts they offered. They surely offered their gifts under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. They presented gold, frankincense, and myrrh, signifying that the child Jesus had the divine nature; that His life would be a life of resurrection, full of the fragrance of frankincense; and that His life would be full of the fragrance of death.</p>
<p data-content-id="9o9l0SO1tmu1IVKdCtKONofXuv3GW-tFY26QDUqZpb00l5gAxChgESrXFWYCatnW3"> When Jesus was twelve years old, He went to Jerusalem with His parents (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61609" data-verses="Luke 2:42">Luke 2:42</span>). Because He was burdened to see what people were doing in His Father’s house, the temple, He stayed in Jerusalem after the feast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61610" data-verses="Luke 2:43">Luke 2:43</span>). Mary and Joseph did not understand Him. They looked for Him and eventually found Him in the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61611" data-verses="Luke 2:44-48">vv. 44-48</span>). In a sense, Mary rebuked Him. If I had been Jesus, I would have rebuked her. I would have fought back and said, “Don’t you know what I’m doing here? Why do you come to bother Me?” If we read Luke’s account, we shall see that Jesus did say something to them. He said, “Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61612" data-verses="Luke 2:49">v. 49</span>). After He said this, He went along with them and returned with them to Nazareth. That was a real killing to Him. His intention was killed, and in that killing we can smell myrrh. That was not the fragrance of frankincense; it was the sweet aroma of myrrh.</p>
<p data-content-id="jWJDrXi0NxUWMWq2CUmg6kL_ZB5lLfiNazIkG_ULjfpKhVo9UEA7069QsaB-TuwJ5"> If we read the four Gospels, the biographies of Jesus, we shall see that in the life of Jesus the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh were very prevalent. He was always living the resurrection life, and He was constantly under the killing of the cross. He did not wait until thirty-three and a half years had passed before He went to the cross to be crucified. Throughout His whole life He was continually being crucified on the cross. Thus, He had not only the fragrance of resurrection, but also the sweet myrrh of the cross. <span class="pg" data-page-id="86" id="86">[86]</span> </p>

However, due to the vision that came through the star, the wise men paid their full respect to the kingly child, not caring about the place. Therefore, they offered to Him the three precious items. Each of these items signifies some precious element of the Lord Jesus’ nature and life. In nearly every page of the four Gospels, we see the preciousness of the Lord’s divinity, the fragrance of His resurrection life, and the sweet aroma of His sacrificial death. Even in the early days, soon after the Lord’s birth, the wise men did such an appropriate thing. It exactly suited the Lord’s nature and life. Their offering was certainly presented under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p data-content-id="noJLwnldamOmRe0zpuBYpklXOS3eHDzQoGfSF2WO7NRymA3WaD3VAFdTLqa9GK2Cr"> It may be that these precious treasures offered by the magi provided for the Lord’s trip from Judea to Egypt and from Egypt to Nazareth. The worship and offering of the wise men truly accomplished something.</p>

This other way, not the original way, was the right way. Whenever we find Christ and meet Him, we are always told not to return to the original way. Finding Christ and meeting Him always turns us to another way.</p>

The Bible tells us that the living star is Christ. It was prophesied that Christ would be the star (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61615" data-verses="Numbers 24:17">Num. 24:17</span>), He came as the star (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61616" data-verses="Matthew 2:1">Matt. 2</span>), and He remains as the star (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61617" data-verses="Revelation 22:16">Rev. 22:16</span>). He is shining. How can <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> we have Christ as the star? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61618" data-verses="2Peter 1:19">2 Peter 1:19</span>, the star is associated with the Bible. Peter tells us to take heed to the “prophetic word made more firm.” If we take heed to this sure word, something within us will dawn, and the daystar will arise in our hearts. To take heed to the sure word is to pay attention to the living Word. It is not just to read the Word; it is to enter into the Word until something arises within us. We may call this the dawn or the daystar. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61619" data-verses="2Peter 1:19">2 Peter 1:19</span> the daystar is actually the morning star. The word in Greek is <em>phosphoros</em>, a light-bearing substance. A piece of phosphorus can shine in darkness. Christ is the real phosphorus shining in today’s darkness. However, the Word cannot shine over you unless you take heed to it. You must take heed until something begins to shine within you. That shining will become the phosphorus in your heart. Then you will have the daystar. You will be like the wise men, and something from the heavens will shine over you.</p>
<p data-content-id="L1V4B15iT8t8XHXTxZNHKKd2C2SQnR84piFFafclBwiFgUtbMWcb2uScp6PfcM1wd"> Christ is the star. The Bible says that the followers of Christ are stars also. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61620" data-verses="Revelation 1:20">Revelation 1:20</span> tells us that all the leading ones in the proper church life are stars. They are stars because they are the shining ones. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61621" data-verses="Daniel 12:3">Daniel 12:3</span> says that the righteous will shine like stars. Those who turn others to righteousness, who turn them from the wrong way to the right way, will shine like stars.</p>
<p data-content-id="mh_ZDLd4wfV9ecWhlGiJnDWokqNkN-Sl4FYH04rsPyWtgzpRWtbuwFt_0RHicTjCA"> Today there are only two ways to have the star shining over you. According to the first way, you must come to the sure Word and open up your whole being to the Word—your mouth, your eyes, your mind, your spirit, and your heart—until something rises up in you and shines over you. That is Christ. The second way is to come to the shining saints, the followers of Christ. If you come to them, you will receive light. You also will receive some leading, for they will lead you to the place where Christ is.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZBEfLYwnFQMIktZO1CK-QSSJaokKKx_55o0glLaVuMsWNmNHaosd8tvUYD9QEc1P0"> Both ways of having the star are linked to the Spirit and the church. Immediately after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61622" data-verses="Revelation 22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>, which says that the Lord Jesus is the morning star, the following verse says, “And the Spirit and the bride say....” This proves that, as the morning star, the Lord Jesus is linked to the Spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> and to the church, which is the Bride. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61623" data-verses="Revelation 3:1">Revelation 3:1</span> says that the Lord Jesus has the seven Spirits and the seven stars, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61624" data-verses="Revelation 1:20">Revelation 1:20</span> says that the seven stars are the angels of the churches. These verses show that the stars are linked not only to the Spirit, but also to the churches. If we would have the living star or the living stars, we need the Spirit and the church. By the Spirit and through the church, it will be easy to have the heavenly vision so that we may find Christ and render our appreciation to Him.</p>

Never say, “Let us do evil, that good may come.” If you do evil, good will not come.

Although you know the story, you may still need more light. Mary <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> conceived a child in Nazareth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61627" data-verses="Luke 1:26-27">Luke 1:26-27</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61628" data-verses="Luke 1:31">31</span>). According to the prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61629" data-verses="Micah 5:2">Micah 5:2</span>, however, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem. Under God’s sovereign arrangement, Caesar Augustus ordered the first census of the Roman Empire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61630" data-verses="Luke 2:1-7">Luke 2:1-7</span>). This forced all the people to return to their native places. Mary and Joseph were forced to return to Bethlehem, their home town. Immediately after they arrived in Bethlehem, the child Jesus was born. The mistake of the magi aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born. Then Joseph received guidance in a dream to take the child to Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61631" data-verses="Matthew 2:13-15">Matt. 2:13-15</span>). This enabled God to fulfill the prophecy of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61632" data-verses="Hosea 11:1">Hosea 11:1</span>. After Herod had died, Joseph received word in another dream to return to the Holy Land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61633" data-verses="Matthew 2:19-20">vv. 19-20</span>). When Joseph had returned and had learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem. Therefore, he went to Nazareth, where Jesus was raised (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61634" data-verses="Matthew 2:21-23">vv. 21-23</span>). For this reason Jesus was called Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p data-content-id="vZ4c2FmvRhFYy9KXWfewGd0WVrnhpGivAsvf60EPiaORrMA-PvfbxqIsqyp_yVRSc"> What does all this mean? It means that when Jesus was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident. Sometimes I have even used the word “sneaky” to describe it. Everyone called Him Jesus of Nazareth, for He was a Nazarene. But the Bible said that Christ would be born in Bethlehem. The hidden way of Christ’s birth bothered all the religious people. When Philip met Jesus, he realized that Jesus was the Messiah. Then Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth. Immediately Nathanael said, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61635" data-verses="John 1:45-46">John 1:45-46</span>). Did Philip give Nathanael the wrong information? It is difficult to say. Philip only knew that Jesus was the son of Joseph and that He was a Nazarene. Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He had not been born in Nazareth, but in Bethlehem. Nathanael was troubled. However, Philip did not argue with him; he simply said, “Come and see” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61636" data-verses="John 1:46">John 1:46</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="WWGHooZ2WvfHwkZEtdUYcmJ0hlmzdOzoCt58J59Q4MzZapG0HpWdhZ-zZkqTUkubc"> On another occasion, Nicodemus, who had come to know Jesus, tried to argue with the Pharisees concerning Him. The Pharisees asked him, “Are you also from Galilee?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61637" data-verses="John 7:52">John 7:52</span>). Galilee was a Gentile region, and the Bible says “Galilee of the nations” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61638" data-verses="Matthew 4:15">Matt. 4:15</span>). The Pharisees seemed to say to Nicodemus, “Are you from Galilee? We know that Jesus came out of Galilee. But out of Galilee there comes no prophet.” Apparently, Jesus was from Galilee, from Nazareth; actually, He was born in Bethlehem. That was His somewhat hidden and secret way of appearing to people.</p>

The tabernacle was covered with rough, tough badgers’ skin; outside, it did not appear to be very attractive. Inside, however, was fine linen, gold, and precious stones. The spiritual principle of the church is the same. Do not look at the church from the outside. You need to come inside the church. I am sure that if the Apostle Paul would come to visit you, you would be surprised. You would ask, “Are you Brother Paul? I thought that the Apostle Paul would be like a shining angel. But what are you? You are just a small man without a comely appearance.”</p>

<p data-content-id="fleo7fcOpJvNrupbaAzldS4aQ7g_109ySLIOr03uj0FOd-46ncgem8mYMh50SmrxS"> We must keep this principle today. In order to find Christ, we must have the shining star. We must not go according to the outward appearance, but according to what is within. If you would know the church or the saints, do not be bothered by the outward appearance. Do not give any value to outward things, such as huge cathedrals, large church buildings, or pipe organs. Forget all that. Jesus had nothing outstanding outwardly. He was a little Nazarene, One who grew up in a province that was called “Galilee of <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> the nations” and who was raised in a city despised by people—“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” But if you “come and see” and get into Him, you will appreciate Him and be caught by Him. Likewise, you need to come into the church and stay with the church for some time. If you do, you will find something precious. The same is true with the seeking saints. The more they seek the Lord, the more they hide their experiences of spiritual things. You need to go to them and stay with them. Then you will get into them and find the riches that are within them. You will see the frankincense, the myrrh, and many other precious treasures. Then you will be attracted and caught. This is the way to find Christ and to appreciate all He is and all His precious items, the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh.</p>

Others have guessed that it refers to the Hebrew word for branch, <em>netzer</em>, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61642" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span>. But I do not think that we have to guess that much. We know that in appearance Jesus was a Nazarene. This was spoken by the prophets.</p>

<p data-content-id="UQ-0mvjA2048kTR2fcUMd905xaNDywXiS7irtLaYPT3xlo1wXE2N_vnPIWnJh3Y0e"> Matthew <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61647" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> covers the recommendation and the anointing of the King. In this chapter firstly the recommender of the King, John the Baptist, is himself recommended. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61648" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3:1</span> says, “Now in those days John the Baptist came.”</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="MXw_qbkhjqaSRjjhv3l4r1n0ob3ns_i2Wn9YDe1F5-tDaKc1VP2-t8yhzkWzA3axH">1. Born a Priest</h2><p data-content-id="Chl3aMiPFcjFkhkJ5MA9gtg_5vJ7hcvOauPup_2HSo4llszt0h-8cMcqRzfr2UJUB"> John the Baptist was born a priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61649" data-verses="Luke 1:5">Luke 1:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61650" data-verses="Luke 1:13">13</span>). In the life-study of Genesis we saw that the birthright included three items: the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, should have received all three items of the birthright. However, due to his defilement, he lost the birthright. As a result, the double portion of the land went to Joseph, the priesthood, to Levi, and the kingship, to Judah. The main function of the priesthood is to bring the people to God, and the main function of the kingship is to bring God to the people. According to <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> the Bible, the priests brought others to God so that they might obtain God’s blessing. This is the priestly service. The kings were those who represented God and brought God to others. Thus, the kingship is the ministry that brings God to others so that they may gain Him. Through this traffic of coming and going, man and God, God and man, have real fellowship, true communication. Eventually, man and God become one. This is the ministry of the priesthood and the kingship.</p>
<p data-content-id="PsdTGyvkVznrKHx5GNFcVDPA9z8UBN6Jki2lR4GRPnasll_URh5etnXSwSlIIFZmK"> The first ministry in the Old Testament was the priesthood. Following the priesthood there was the kingship. All the books prior to 1 Samuel were on the priesthood. But beginning with 1 Samuel the second section of the Old Testament is on the kingship. In the book of 1 Samuel, Samuel represents the priesthood and David represents the kingship. Samuel, the priest, introduced David, the king. The priesthood introduces the kingship. It is the same in the church life today. If we are genuine priests, then we shall also become kings, for the priesthood always introduces the kingship. First we are priests bringing others into the presence of God. Then we become kings bringing God to them.</p>
<p data-content-id="-ZHK3T1CDyWPzitDGxi-v7C0NfTXyeVW08cjyfHtVx1oVgCPdC7wSFuzbiDLeLgcG"> Every true evangelist is a king. If you are not a king, you are not qualified to preach the gospel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61651" data-verses="Matthew 28:18-19">28:18 and 19</span> the Lord Jesus, the King of the kingdom, said, “All authority has been given unto me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations.” Here the Lord told the disciples to go with His authority. Those who go with this authority are kings in the kingdom of heaven. Without doubt He shares this authority with us. Therefore, we must go and disciple the nations, that is, preach the gospel to subdue the rebellious ones. As we go to preach the gospel, we must be kings.</p>
<p data-content-id="pq7HUDkjfwdOKycLKi0OdLiXG1YKmTqI4CJrpHVLc4_RGrWPdspXg4wm2numC_IeB"> Many Christians do not know God’s secret in His economy. When you are burdened to preach the gospel, you must first carry out the function of the priesthood. In order to preach the gospel you must first go to God as a priest and bring others to Him. Through the priesthood you will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="95" id="95">[95]</span> authorized and anointed, and then you will come out of God’s presence to be a king. The proper preaching of the gospel is the issuing of a kingly edict. It is the utterance of a kingly command. Consider Peter’s preaching on the day of Pentecost. Although he was a young Galilean fisherman, he nonetheless was a king. Every proper evangelist must be a king.</p>
<p data-content-id="vZ4c2FmvRhFYy9KXWfewGeEWRqnhpGivAsvf60EPiaORrMA-PvfbxqIsqyp_yVRSc"> We have seen that the priest introduces the king. The first occurrence of this was Samuel’s introduction of King David. In Matthew <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61652" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> we see another Samuel, John the Baptist, who was born a priest of the tribe of Levi. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61653" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3</span> testifies to the consistency of the Bible, for here we see one from the priestly tribe, the tribe of Levi, recommending One from the kingly tribe, the tribe of Judah. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61654" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3</span> John appeared as Samuel and Jesus appeared as David. There in the wilderness John was bringing people to God. Hence, he was a genuine priest. As he was bringing others to God, the King came, and John introduced Him. This King brought God to man. John brought others to God, and Jesus brought God to them.</p>
<p data-content-id="WWGHooZ2WvfHwkZEtdUYcl50lkmzdOzoCt58J59Q4MzZapG0HpWdhZ-zZkqTUkubc"> As sinners we came to God through John’s ministry. By repentance we came into God’s presence. That was the ministry of the priesthood, the ministry of John the Baptist. We all have come into the presence of God through John. It was John who brought us back to God. Then the new King David, Jesus Christ, brought God to us. Through John’s ministry of repentance and Jesus’ ministry of imparting life, we have all been made priests and kings. Today we are the continuation both of the priest, John the Baptist, and of the King, Jesus Christ. If you are a proper Christian, then you are firstly today’s John and secondly today’s Jesus. Young people, as you go to the campuses, you must be real priests. You need to say, “Lord, have mercy on these people. O Lord, remember all these young people. I bring them to You.” This is the priesthood, the ministry of John the Baptist. After you bring others to God, immediately, in a sense, you will become Christ bringing God to them so that they may gain God. This is today’s priesthood and kingship. <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> </p>

Forsaking the Outward<br/>Position of the Priest</h2><p data-content-id="uhrNT43xO_qwGlqNZpptA1mVH2ZuwgINmCaNJZiID-2svPbLWpCwg9eHFIuy4yQvW"> Although John the Baptist was born a priest, he forsook the outward position of the priest. By the outward position of his birth he was not a real priest, but a priest in figure, a priest in shadow. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61655" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">3:1</span> John came preaching in the wilderness as the true priest. John the Baptist’s preaching was the initiation of God’s New Testament economy. He did his preaching not in the holy temple within the holy city, where the religious and cultured people worshipped God according to their scriptural ordinances, but in the wilderness, in a “wild” way, not keeping any old regulations. This indicates that the old way of the worship of God according to the Old Testament was repudiated and that a new way was about to be brought in. The wilderness here indicates that the new way of God’s New Testament economy is contrary to religion and culture. It also indicates that nothing old was left and that something new was about to be built up.</p>
<p data-content-id="fleo7fcOpJvNrupbaAzldRIaU4g_109ySLIOr03uj0FOd-46ncgem8mYMh50SmrxS"> The dispensation of law was terminated by the coming of John the Baptist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61656" data-verses="Matthew 11:13">11:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61657" data-verses="Luke 16:16">Luke 16:16</span>). Following the baptism of John, the preaching of the gospel of peace began (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61658" data-verses="Acts 10:36-37">Acts 10:36-37</span>). The preaching of John was the beginning of the gospel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61659" data-verses="Mark 1:1-5">Mark 1:1-5</span>). Hence, the dispensation of grace began with John.</p>
<p data-content-id="I4LvZeA_P9SNvkT0wtxtqrvMOcy-joEe3nm1uxTCEmY8YFFYDNpWDh0N7PwE6T6OX"> Neither John, the new priest, nor Jesus, the new King, was in the old way. According to the old way, the priests stayed in the holy temple in the holy city, wore the priestly garments, ate the priestly food, and observed the priestly rituals. But with the coming of John the Baptist, all that was terminated. That was not the reality; it was a shadow. Now with John the Baptist, the genuine priest, reality came. As the real priest, John came to bring the people back to God. That was his ministry.</p>

Living in a Way<br/>Contrary to Religion and Culture</h2><p data-content-id="XjNhnxq8pOBRIQJgfNj4HKb6fOhWvooVWpyDh1eEHtno6bC8_SGyD6n6kKA8O2GNB"> John fulfilled his ministry by living in a way that was <span class="pg" data-page-id="97" id="97">[97]</span> absolutely contrary to religion and culture and outside both of them. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61660" data-verses="Matthew 3:4">Verse 4</span> says, “Now John himself had his garment of camel’s hair and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.” According to the regulations of the law, John, who was born a priest, should have worn the priestly garment, which was made mainly of fine linen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61661" data-verses="Exodus 28:4">Exo. 28:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61662" data-verses="Exodus 28:40-41">40-41</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61663" data-verses="Leviticus 6:10">Lev. 6:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61664" data-verses="Ezekiel 44:17-18">Ezek. 44:17-18</span>); and he should have eaten the priestly food, which was composed mainly of fine flour and the meat of the sacrifices offered to God by His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61665" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1-3">Lev. 2:1-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61666" data-verses="Leviticus 6:6-18">6:6-18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61667" data-verses="Leviticus 6:25-26">25-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61668" data-verses="Leviticus 7:31-34">7:31-34</span>). However, John did altogether otherwise. He wore a garment of camel’s hair and a leather girdle, and he ate locusts and wild honey. All these things are uncivilized, uncultured, and not according to the religious regulations. For a priestly person to wear camel’s hair was an especially drastic blow to the religious mind, for the camel was considered unclean under the Levitical regulations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61669" data-verses="Leviticus 11:4">Lev. 11:4</span>). In addition, John did not live in a civilized place, but in the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61670" data-verses="Luke 3:2">Luke 3:2</span>). All this indicates that he had altogether abandoned the Old Testament dispensation, which had fallen into a kind of religion mixed with human culture. His intention was to introduce God’s New Testament economy, which is constituted solely of Christ and the Spirit of Life.</p>
<p data-content-id="k8a9Mehyf9H71QPewDInv3A3DoU69jLZd9yw23ONbZ7XFqXXrLNjP1qqvKoJw6HIh"> We have seen that during John’s time being a priest was a matter of religion, of wearing priestly robes, eating priestly food, and dwelling in a priestly building. When anyone conducted himself as a priest, everyone thought of him as a religious person, a person in religion. But here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61671" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3</span> we see a real priest. Instead of staying in the priestly building, he went out to the wilderness, to a wild place where there was neither religion nor culture. There in the wilderness he lived in a “wild” way, eating locusts and wild honey. His honey was not the cultured honey processed and sold in stores today. It was wild honey. John was a real priest living in such a “wild” way. However, if you try to copy him, you will be false. <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="JRY8MaLJKtf6efzbzG58lZzhfKEVg09yHQu46f5uWlaIY-J16MAf81zwk8d8J-hvN"> John was truly outside religion and culture. He not only ate wild things, but he also wore camel’s hair. Notice that the Bible does not say that he wore camel’s fur, which would have been somewhat orderly, but camel’s hair, which certainly must have been messy. Furthermore, his leather girdle was probably not very refined. John was truly “wild.” Nevertheless this real priest was the recommender of the King.</p>
<p data-content-id="zeI6BsewlXT9QG5Y864_M1-ULSdtKevtEil80zoGzPhHgqih6rw1YfLAvzeK55gIY"> From the time of John the Baptist until today, a great many people have been brought back to God through the ministry of John. Whenever we tell others to repent, we should remember John the Baptist.</p>
<p data-content-id="abSJWp_OwRzajN9ql34uZfcG6myF2_ct6UGsDGXLuJJ-nMTFTDNm0IxFal6L5FIAr"> The ministry of John the Baptist was outside both religion and culture. When John was born, in Jerusalem there were two main things—Hebrew religion and Greco-Roman culture. John, however, did not stay in Jerusalem where his parents undoubtedly lived. He left Jerusalem and went out to the wilderness where there was neither religion nor culture, but where everything was natural. John ministered there in the wilderness bringing others to God and introducing the King, the One who represents God, to them. This was a strong indication that, during John’s time, the age was changed from the old dispensation to the new dispensation, from the dispensation of shadows and figures to the dispensation of reality. Those priests who wore the priestly robes, ate the priestly food, and stayed in the priestly building burning the incense and carrying out the priestly functions never brought anyone to God. But this “wild,” unreligious, uncultured John brought hundreds to Him. And he also introduced the King to them. This King was the One who brought God to repentant people.</p>
<p data-content-id="bxL4Xdo_wuMUnW9-yOhGcR3tiZMT5Z5QqCEsbK7COLzrP4JRhUioM-j2smfPMA4Nf"> When this King was introduced to people and they were truly brought back to God, the kingdom was present immediately. The King with the people is the kingdom. The kingdom was there because both the King and the people were there. The New Testament begins with the genuine priesthood introducing the genuine kingship. The real <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> priest introduced the real King. This introduction ushers in the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="qIPXFTTqQB63s-xSEjzWM3M5CaCrQRlETbglenJKAt55NkZWNqM-G2-4TYyM6p0p7"> John’s message was, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61672" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">v. 2</span>). People had to repent because the kingdom was coming and because the King was there. We also need to repent that the King may gain us and that we may be His people. After we repent, the King gains us, and we gain Him. Through the King’s gaining us and our gaining Him, we and the King become the kingdom. The kingdom immediately follows the King. If you receive the King and if He takes you as His people, the kingdom is immediately present. Why has the kingdom not yet come? Because you have not received the King, and the King has not yet gained you. Because you are still far away from Him, the King has not been able to gain you. Thus, the kingdom is not yet here. Rather, it is off somewhere waiting for your repentance. If you repent, the King will gain you, you will gain the King, and the kingdom will be here.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7g0rDrezCXC5s6MFVJBCZkU4ZiitKXphqKl7HV7td-Bm1Ca7BQcE0ftTX5VYe6b"> Many Christians who are preaching the gospel today do not know the divine principles in God’s economy. If we would be real evangelists, real preachers of the gospel, we must firstly be John the Baptist. This means that we must be priests, not formal priests, priests in shadow, but genuine priests, priests in reality. After we become such priests, we must also be Jesus Christ. This means that we must be the King who brings God to others. When we go to God praying for others, we are priests bringing them to God. But when we come out of God’s presence and go to the people, we are kings bringing God to them. If we do this, they will repent to the King, the King will gain them, and the kingdom will be present.</p>
<p data-content-id="8XQplTzgFw0d9u0jTMRBvwrnw4e1erLKEAGGMtft9sE8pal-KhVU1cBScTAbr_uVi"> The proper church life today is the kingdom. We all have repented, the King has gained us, and we have received Him. Now we are one with the King, and the kingdom is here with us. Hallelujah, the kingdom is here right now! All this depends upon the recommender.</p>
<p data-content-id="0b4FGv9be2FPEifP5IOzb_yXvkgm4Jvxpwry4Tqquizz_t8SLS7hnCkKKnf5q6lHb"> My burden in this message is to emphasize the matter of the recommender. Are you today’s recommender of <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> Christ? If you are, then you must be clear whether or not you are still in religion and culture. We must all be in the wilderness, in an environment that is “wild,” not in an environment that is religious or cultured. The proper environment is outside religion and culture, but it is full of the presence of God.</p>
<p data-content-id="7gOUzACjtGFQwhTPxMOjxRPP_yZpCXkSeLBKMv-G9vbSz9FwafEz5B7ukzfuDDj_q"> When John was there in the wilderness, he was a great magnet drawing large numbers to himself. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61673" data-verses="Matthew 3:5">verse 5</span> says, “Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the district of the Jordan went out to him.” Because of his drawing power, many came to John the Baptist. I hope the young people who go to the campuses will stand there as magnets. If you are such a magnet, others will flock to you. First you will be the priests appointed by God to bring others into His presence. Then you will be able to introduce the heavenly King to them. At that time, you will not only introduce the King to others; you will actually be the King. Thus, you will give a command to others, and many will turn to Christ. In this way Christ will gain the people, and they will gain Him. Then, immediately, the kingdom will appear on the campuses. This is the proper way to carry out the preaching of the gospel.</p>

This indicates that the introduction of God’s New Testament economy by John was not accidental, but planned and foretold by God through Isaiah the prophet. This implies that God intended His New Testament economy to begin in an absolutely new way.</p>

<p data-content-id="xT_UZXnNTr4EKhCRQA-M3kA_0KEcIPkkzx1gjA5pn5v100-KzMBYBIM75WRWfJSbp"> If you trace the history of the past few centuries, you will see that every prevailing revival took place in some kind <span class="pg" data-page-id="101" id="101">[101]</span> of “wilderness.” When John Wesley and George Whitefield were raised up as evangelists two centuries ago, they mainly did their preaching on the street corners. According to his biography, George Whitefield often preached on the foothills in the wilderness. However, at that time, the Church of England had regulations forbidding the expounding of the Holy Word outside the “sanctuary.” According to these regulations, anyone who preached or taught from the Bible had to do so in the “sanctuary.” Nevertheless, God raised up George Whitefield and John Wesley to conduct their preaching outside the “sanctuary.” The principle must be the same today. But this does not mean that we should copy John the Baptist in an outward way. It means that we should not take either the religious way or the cultural way. Rather, we must take the way that is full of the presence of God. We should not be in the holy city or in the holy temple, but in a place outside religion and culture, yet in a place full of the presence of God. I hope the young people will bring this matter to the Lord and pray, “Lord, make us today’s John the Baptist. Lord, take us into the wilderness and show us how to be genuine priests to bring others to You and how to introduce You to them as their King.”</p>
<p data-content-id="rrHHs6EB2hifkbOEsDvdjua31ehIeANh58k6aj_wsbQZxSyrmyshzF2TGMpzE32_a"> The Gospel of Matthew is absolutely different from the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John is a book of life, whereas the Gospel of Matthew is a book of the kingdom. In John Jesus is life, but in Matthew He is the King. According to the book of Matthew, the Jesus we are to receive is the King. As we consider the Gospel of Matthew, we must be thoroughly and deeply impressed that we are now in the kingdom. Everything written in this book is related to the kingdom. Therefore, we must look into this book from the angle of the kingdom, viewing every chapter and even every verse from the perspective of the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="dWQGQdEDRC5zuJZX8AMIf0Fr4HlgC5d74WTtePoRmZt-8k_JsT4Mkew34IjKVg9Nt"> The repentance called for in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61676" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> is for the kingdom. You must repent because you are not in the kingdom, because you are not under God’s authority. You must repent because you have not yet submitted to the authority of Christ or come under His kingship. Although you may not <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> feel that you are sinful, as long as you are not in the kingdom, you are a rebellious one. As long as you have nothing to do with the kingship of Christ, you are in rebellion and must repent. Repent of not being in the kingdom! The genuine Christians of today are saved, yet many of them still are not in the kingdom. Thus, even these Christians must repent. As long as you are not under the kingship of Christ, you must repent. If you are not actually in the kingdom of the heavens, not under the heavenly ruling, you must repent. It does not matter how spiritual, holy, or good you are. The only thing that matters is whether or not you are under the heavenly ruling. If you are not, it means that you are not in the kingdom and that you must repent. If you are not in the kingdom, you are in rebellion. You consider yourself scriptural, fundamental, and holy, but in actuality you are rebellious. Even your spirituality is a form of rebellion against the kingship of Christ. You care for your spirituality, not for the kingship of Christ. This indicates that you are in rebellion, that you are not in the kingdom. Repent of your rebellion! Repent of not being in the kingdom and of not being under the kingship and authority of Christ! This is the basic thought of the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
<p data-content-id="QRe98RapaaaKaU9rvUrwol3vgR29XFHwo0MNs9lb0EHIgRGLmx9NJZbe_kkxe-sUH"> Do not think that Matthew is only for unbelievers, outsiders, or Gentiles. Many of us have never heard the Gospel of Matthew. I do not know what kind of gospel you have heard, but I do know that you need to hear the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of the kingdom that requires you to repent of not being under the kingship of Christ. We all must repent to the Lord and say, “Lord, forgive me. Even today I am still in rebellion. I am not under Your Lordship, Your authority, Your heavenly ruling. Lord, I confess that I have been ruled only by myself. Lord, grant me a true repentance for my rebellion, for my not being under Your authority.” We all need to repent. Praise the Lord that John the Baptist and this ministry of the priesthood are still with us! On the one hand, this priesthood brings us to God; on the other hand, it recommends the heavenly King who brings God to us. When <span class="pg" data-page-id="103" id="103">[103]</span> we receive this King, He gains us, and the kingdom is here. This is the Gospel of Matthew.</p>

<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GuQFFYuQsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> In both the Old Testament and the New Testament there are two basic ministries that constitute the kingdom of God: the priesthood and the kingship. In the Bible there is also a third type of ministry, the ministry of the prophet. However, the prophetic ministry is not a basic ministry; rather, it is a supplement to the priesthood and the kingship. When either the priesthood or the kingship is weak, the prophets come in to strengthen it. According to the Old Testament, the priesthood was with the tribe of Levi. Eventually, the Old Testament priesthood consummated in John the Baptist, a descendant of this tribe. In like manner, Jesus was the consummation of the Old Testament kingship, which was with the tribe of Judah. Jesus came as a descendant of Judah to be the consummation of the kingship. On the one hand, John the Baptist and Jesus Christ terminated the Old Testament priesthood and kingship; on the other hand, they germinated the New Testament priesthood and kingship. In other words, they terminated the Old Testament dispensation and began the New Testament dispensation.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrroaH75Z5GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> When the priesthood brings people to God and the kingship brings God to the people, there is the heavenly reign, the heavenly rule. This heavenly reign is the kingdom, which today is the proper church life. Today’s church life is the kingdom with the priesthood and the kingship. This church life will continue until the millennium. In the millennial kingdom there will still be the priesthood and the kingship. On the one hand, we, the overcomers, shall be priests and, on the other hand, we shall be kings. Thus, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="106" id="106">[106]</span> the millennial kingdom, the priesthood and the kingship will be even stronger than they are today. They will maintain God’s kingdom on earth so that the King may gain the people and that the people may gain the King. After the millennium there will be no further need of the priesthood. In eternity there will be only the kingship because in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem everyone will be in the presence of God. At that time God will be with man. Thus, there will no longer be the need for the priesthood to bring the people to God. In eternity God’s presence will eliminate the priesthood. Nevertheless, the kingship will remain so that those in the New Jerusalem may reign over the nations surrounding the city. This is a summary of the Bible in the light of the priesthood and the kingship.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovkaDx2xQRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> In the previous message we considered the recommender, John the Baptist. In this message we shall consider John’s message of recommendation.</p>

<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbYwuKEaZwZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> John’s message of recommendation is short, but it is crucial and all-inclusive. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61677" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">Matthew 3:2</span> says, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” The first significant word in this verse is the word “repent.” John began his ministry with this word. To repent is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose. In Greek the word translated repent means to have a change of mind. To repent is to have a change in our thinking, our philosophy, our logic. The life of fallen man is absolutely according to his thinking. Everything he is and does is according to his mind. When you were a fallen one, you were directed by your mind. Your mentality, logic, and philosophy governed your way of life. Before we were saved, we all were under the direction of our fallen mentality. We were far away from God, and our life was in direct opposition to His will. Under the influence of our fallen mentality, we went farther and farther astray from God. But one day we heard <span class="pg" data-page-id="107" id="107">[107]</span> the preaching of the gospel telling us to repent, to have a turn in our thinking, philosophy, and logic.</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiGIBK1SZM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> This was just my experience when I was saved. I was like a young horse running in my own direction. Actually I was not taking my direction, but the Devil’s direction, for the Devil was directing me through my fallen mentality, driving me far away from God. But one day I heard the call to repent—to have a change in my philosophy, to have a change in my logic and thought. Praise the Lord, I underwent a great change! I was moving in one direction, but when I heard the call to repent, I made an about-face. I believe we all have made this kind of turn, which is called conversion. When we were converted, we turned our back upon our past and turned our face to God. This is what it means to repent, to experience a change of our mind.</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0ZGDRvWM_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> Every ism is a philosophy that directs one’s life. Nearly every political party has an ism, and that ism is virtually a god. But we do not have an ism—we have the Lord. We have God. Formerly, we were under the direction of a certain ism, but now we are under the direction of God. Our mind has been radically changed. We used to be heading in a certain direction, but now we are heading in the opposite direction. We have had a turn in our thought, in our concept.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEBuXpu6irHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> The second crucial word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61678" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">verse 2</span> is kingdom. In the preaching of John the Baptist, repentance, as the opening of God’s New Testament economy, was to have a turn for the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that God’s New Testament economy is focused on His kingdom. For this we should repent, change our mind, have a turn in our pursuit of life. The goal of our pursuit has been toward other things; now our pursuit must turn toward God and His kingdom, which is specifically and purposely called in Matthew the kingdom of the heavens (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61679" data-verses="Mark 1:15">Mark 1:15</span>). The kingdom of the heavens, according to the context of the entire Gospel of Matthew, is different from the Messianic kingdom. The Messianic kingdom will be the restored kingdom of David (the rebuilt tabernacle of David—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61680" data-verses="Acts 15:16">Acts 15:16</span>), made up of the children of Israel, earthly and physical in nature; whereas <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> the kingdom of the heavens is constituted of regenerated believers and is heavenly and spiritual.</p>
<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMiuIrspqCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> In his message, John the Baptist told people to repent for the kingdom. He did not say to repent that we might go to heaven or even to obtain salvation. He said that we must repent for the kingdom. The kingdom denotes a kind of reign, rule. Before we were saved, we were not under any rule. If there had been no police force, government, or law courts to tell us what to do, we would have done whatever we liked. However, when we heard the preaching of the gospel, we turned from a condition of no rule to a condition full of rule. Thus, we are now in the kingdom. Before we were saved, we did not have a king. But after we turned to the Lord, He became our King. Now we are all under the rule of this King. With the King there is the kingship, and this kingship is the kingdom. Today we are in the kingdom of this King.</p>
<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz-HYcIKxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> The third crucial word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61681" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">verse 2</span> is heavens. John said to repent for the kingdom of the heavens. The term “the heavens,” a Hebrew idiom, does not refer to anything plural in nature; rather, it refers to the highest heaven, which according to the Bible is the third heaven, the heaven above the heaven. This third heaven is called the heavens. The kingdom of the heavens does not denote a kingdom in the air, but a kingdom above the air, a kingdom in the heaven above the heaven, where God’s throne is. In this kingdom there is the ruling, the reigning, of God Himself. Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God in the third heaven where He exercises His authority over everything created by Him. This kingdom of the heavens must come down to earth. This heavenly reign must descend to earth to be the authority over the earth.</p>

<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxChW2KcKa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> According to John’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61682" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">verse 2</span>, “The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” This clearly indicates that before the coming of John the Baptist, the kingdom of the heavens was not there. Even after his appearance, during his preaching, the kingdom of the heavens was still not there; it had only drawn near. At the time the Lord started His ministry <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> and even at the time He sent His disciples to preach, the kingdom of the heavens had still not come (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61683" data-verses="Matthew 4:17">4:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61684" data-verses="Matthew 10:7">10:7</span>). Hence, in the first parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61685" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61686" data-verses="Matthew 13:3-9">vv. 3-9</span>), the parable of the seed, which indicates the Lord’s preaching, the Lord did not say, “The kingdom of the heavens is like....” Not until the second parable, the parable of the tares (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61687" data-verses="Matthew 13:24">v. 24</span>), which indicates the establishment of the church at the day of Pentecost, did the Lord say this. The fact that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61688" data-verses="Matthew 16:18-19">Matthew 16:18 and 19</span> use the terms the “church” and the “kingdom of the heavens” interchangeably proves that the kingdom of the heavens came when the church was established.</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkU9DE-xmiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> When John the Baptist came, the kingdom of the heavens had only drawn near. It was approaching, arriving, but it had not yet come. This proves that in the Old Testament there was no kingdom of the heavens. Even at the time of Moses and David the kingdom of the heavens was not there. John said that the kingdom of the heavens was on its way; he did not say that it had arrived. When the Lord Jesus began His ministry, He also said, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61689" data-verses="Matthew 4:17">4:17</span>). This indicates that even when the Lord Jesus began His ministry, the kingdom of the heavens had still not arrived. In his message, John the Baptist told the people to repent for the kingdom of the heavens, which, at that time, was on the way. The kingdom of the heavens arrived in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. This means that it arrived at the very time the church came into existence. Today anyone who has a change in his philosophy and comes back to God will immediately be in the kingdom of the heavens. Hallelujah, we are in the kingdom of the heavens! We have a King and we are under His rule.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCYYYPZCmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> Many times the ruling of the King within us makes it unnecessary for us to be ruled by the policemen or by the law court. This inward King can put the attorneys out of a job. However, those who have not repented and come back to God are not under the King. Instead, they constantly violate the law. For this reason, a great many are summoned to the law court. But we, the kingdom people, are under the King of the kingdom of the heavens. This King has come into our <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> being. At this very moment He is dwelling in our spirit. When He speaks to us, He mainly says one word—“no.” According to my experience, His favorite word is “no.” We have a ruling “no” within us. Thank the Lord for this little word, for it saves us from a great deal of trouble. The speaking of the inward “no” is the ruling of the King within. Perhaps today you have heard the King’s “no” a number of times. If the kingdom people do not care for this “no,” they will become backsliders. Because we are in the kingdom of the heavens, the King rules us mostly by speaking the word “no.”</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_8bbHRumhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> Now let us consider how John the Baptist was able to bring others into the kingdom. John’s ministry was to bring others to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61690" data-verses="Luke 1:16-17">Luke 1:16-17</span>). John the Baptist, a genuine priest, was “filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61691" data-verses="Luke 1:15">Luke 1:15</span>). There is no doubt that as he grew from infancy to adulthood, to the age of thirty, he was continually immersed in the Holy Spirit. Because he was flooded and saturated with the Holy Spirit, he could be bold. It is a serious matter to stand against the current of the age. To do this requires a great deal of boldness. How could John the Baptist be so bold as to stand against the Judaistic religion and the Greco-Roman culture? He was bold because for thirty years he was being immersed in the Holy Spirit. He was a person thoroughly soaked with the Spirit. Therefore, when he came out to minister, he came out in the Spirit and with power. Yes, he wore camel’s hair as a sign of his repudiation of the old dispensation. But that was merely an outward sign. There was also reality within him, and that reality was the Spirit and the power. The reality in John was not just the presence of God, but also the Spirit of God.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57agWE0bOTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> John was immersed, saturated, and soaked with the Holy Spirit. Spontaneously this caused him to be a great magnet. He could be a magnet because he himself had been fully charged. Year after year and day after day, he was charged with the Spirit. Therefore, in his ministry, he was a powerful magnet. With John there was the Spirit and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="111" id="111">[111]</span> attracting power. Therefore, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61692" data-verses="Luke 1:16">Luke 1:16</span> says, he turned many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. (The Lord here is the equivalent of Jehovah.) The fact that John turned many of the Israelites to the Lord indicates that the nation of Israel had turned away from God. If they had not turned away from Him, they would not have needed John the Baptist to turn them back. Even those priests who served God in the temple by lighting the lamps and burning the incense had turned from God and were far away from Him. Elsewhere in the New Testament we are told that many priests turned to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61693" data-verses="Acts 6:7">Acts 6:7</span>). Thus, even the priests, the ones who served God, needed a turn to God. Therefore, John the Baptist was used to turn many to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faBICuh4qZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g">2.

They were proud of their superior sanctity of life, devotion to God, and knowledge of the Scriptures. Actually, they were degraded into pretentious conduct and hypocrisy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61696" data-verses="Matthew 23:2-33">Matt. 23:2-33</span>). The Sadducees were another sect in Judaism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61697" data-verses="Acts 5:17">Acts 5:17</span>). They did not believe in the resurrection, nor in angels, nor in spirits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61698" data-verses="Matthew 22:23">Matt. 22:23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61699" data-verses="Acts 23:8">Acts 23:8</span>). Both the Pharisees and the Sadducees were denounced by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus as a brood of vipers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61700" data-verses="Matthew 3:7">3:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61701" data-verses="Matthew 12:34">12:34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61702" data-verses="Matthew 23:33">23:33</span>). The Pharisees were supposed to be the orthodox ones, and the Sadducees were the ancient modernists.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn_dwbTx5z3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61703" data-verses="Matthew 3:8-9">verses 8 and 9</span> John said, “Produce then fruit worthy of repentance. And do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.” Due to the impenitence of the Jews, both this word and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61704" data-verses="Matthew 3:10">verse 10</span> have been fulfilled. God has cut them off and raised up the believing Gentiles to be children unto Abraham in faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61705" data-verses="Romans 11:15">Rom. 11:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61706" data-verses="Romans 11:19-20">19-20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61707" data-verses="Romans 11:22">22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61708" data-verses="Galatians 3:7">Gal. 3:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61709" data-verses="Galatians 3:28-29">28-29</span>). John’s word in this verse clearly indicates that the kingdom of the heavens preached by him is not constituted of the children of Abraham by birth, but of the children of Abraham by faith. Thus, it is a heavenly kingdom, not the earthly kingdom of the Messiah.</p>
<p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wI68ev-vlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> The Pharisees and Sadducees were the leaders of the children of Israel. When they came to John the Baptist, with a rebuking tone he called them a brood of vipers. Vipers are poisonous snakes. John spoke this word to the Jews, to the chosen race. The children of Israel were not heathen swine. They considered the Gentiles as swine and themselves as the holy people. But when the leaders of this holy people came to John, he did not say, “Welcome. How good it is of you to come to my ministry. What an honor it is to me for you, the leaders of the children of Israel, to pay me a visit.” John did not speak like the pastors in today’s Christianity. He neither thanked the Pharisees and Sadducees for their visitation, nor did he address them as leaders; instead, he called them a brood of vipers. Can you believe that the children of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, the called one, could have become so evil?</p>
<div id="displayv"> </div> </div><div class="section" data-section="3">
<p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLchheVDDfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> John also told them not to presume to say that they had Abraham for their father, for God was able of the stones to raise up children to Abraham. John seemed to be saying, “Don’t presume anything. Don’t presume that you are the children of Israel with Abraham as your father. God is able to raise up children out of these stones.” John’s word was a strong indication and actually a prophecy of the fact that the age had changed. Because the age had changed, it was no longer a matter of the natural birth, but of the second birth, the spiritual birth. Although you might have been born a lifeless stone, God is able to make you His living child. Hallelujah, this is just what He has done to us! We need to recall our condition before we were saved. As far as life was concerned, we were lifeless stones. But as far as sin was <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> concerned, we were filled with sin and active in sin. Praise the Lord that on the day of our repentance we believed in the Lord Jesus, and God made us His living children.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0i06MkjGM-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> Through John’s word here we see that God was prepared to forsake this brood of vipers, His chosen people of old, and to pursue another people. He was ready to forsake the children of Israel and to turn to the stones, which mainly were the Gentiles. Although the Gentiles were lifeless stones, they were destined to become the living children of God. This proves that God is truly able to make every lifeless stone a child of God.</p>

If you are a good tree producing good fruit, you will be all right. If not, you will be cut down and cast into the fire.” As we shall see, the fire spoken of in this verse is the fire in the lake of fire.</p>

But the One who comes after me is mightier than I. He will baptize you with the Spirit and fire. Whether He will baptize you with the Spirit or with fire depends on whether or not you repent. If you repent, He will put you into the Spirit. But if you continue to be a brood of vipers, He will certainly baptize you in the lake of fire.

<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMgsOJFizAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> According to the context, fire here is not the fire in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61712" data-verses="Acts 2:3">Acts 2:3</span>, which is related to the Holy Spirit, but the same fire as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61713" data-verses="Matthew 3:10">verses 10</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61714" data-verses="Matthew 3:12">12</span>, the fire in the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61715" data-verses="Revelation 20:15">Rev. 20:15</span>), where the unbelievers will suffer eternal perdition. The word <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> of John spoken here to the Pharisees and Sadducees means that if the Pharisees and Sadducees would truly repent and believe in the Lord, the Lord would baptize them in the Holy Spirit that they might have eternal life; otherwise, the Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire for eternal punishment. John’s baptism was only for repentance, to usher people to faith in the Lord. The Lord’s baptism is either for eternal life in the Holy Spirit or for eternal perdition in fire. The Lord’s baptism in the Holy Spirit began the kingdom of the heavens, bringing His believers into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire will terminate the kingdom of the heavens, putting the unbelievers into the lake of fire. Hence, the Lord’s baptism in the Holy Spirit, based upon His redemption, is the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire, based upon His judgment, is its ending. Thus, in this verse there are three kinds of baptisms: the baptism in water, the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and the baptism in fire. The baptism in water by John introduced people to the kingdom of the heavens. The baptism in the Holy Spirit by the Lord Jesus began and established the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost and will carry it on to its consummation at the end of this age. The baptism in fire by the Lord, according to the judgment at the great white throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61716" data-verses="Revelation 20:11-15">Rev. 20:11-15</span>), will conclude the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqHghFJ5_5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> Some Christians, thinking that the fire in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61717" data-verses="Matthew 3:11">verse 11</span> refers to the tongues of fire on the day of Pentecost, say that the Lord will baptize believers with both the Holy Spirit and with fire. But we must take care of the context of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61718" data-verses="Matthew 3:11">verse 11</span>. Notice that the word fire is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61719" data-verses="Matthew 3:10-11">verses 10, 11, and 12</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61720" data-verses="Matthew 3:10">verse 10</span> the trees that do not produce good fruit are cut down and cast into the fire. Certainly this fire is the lake of fire. The fire in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61721" data-verses="Matthew 3:11">verse 11</span> must also denote the lake of fire, for it is a further explanation of the fire spoken of in the preceding verse. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61722" data-verses="Matthew 3:12">verse 12</span>, the Lord will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire. The wheat that is gathered into the Lord’s barn is those who are put into the Spirit. However, the chaff is burned with fire. Certainly this fire is <span class="pg" data-page-id="115" id="115">[115]</span> also the lake of fire. Therefore, the fire that is spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61723" data-verses="Matthew 3:10-12">verses 10 through 12</span> refers in every case to the same fire, the fire of the lake of fire. John seemed to be saying to the Jewish leaders, “You Pharisees and Sadducees may be able to deceive me, but you cannot deceive Him. If you are truly repentant, He will put you into the Spirit. But if you remain in your evil, He will put you into fire.” This is the correct understanding of these verses.</p>

The Lord will baptize them in the Holy Spirit and gather them into His barn in heaven by rapture. Those typified by the chaff, like the tares in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61725" data-verses="Matthew 13:24-30">13:24-30</span>, are without life. The Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire. Chaff here refers to the unrepentant Jews, whereas the tares in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61726" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> refer to the nominal Christians. The eternal destiny of both will be the same—perdition in the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61727" data-verses="Matthew 13:40-42">13:40-42</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5AigGoIIU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> Jesus the King exercises two kinds of baptism: the baptism in the Spirit and the baptism in fire. The baptism in the Spirit began the kingdom of the heavens, and the baptism in fire will end it. The beginning of the kingdom of the heavens was on the day of Pentecost. On that day Jesus the King baptized the believers into the Holy Spirit. By that baptism in the Spirit, the kingdom of the heavens began. The kingdom of the heavens will end with the judgment at the great white throne. At that time the unbelievers will be judged and cast into the lake of fire. That will be the baptism in fire. This fire baptism will terminate the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85wwzS2Yl3Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> The baptism in water practiced by John was preliminary to the kingdom of the heavens. It was a preparation for the coming of the kingdom of the heavens. Many nominal Christians have been baptized in water. But whether they participate in the baptism in the Spirit or suffer the baptism in fire depends on whether or not they repent. If they truly <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> repent, the Lord Jesus will put them into the Spirit. If not, the Lord Jesus as the Judge on the great white throne will cast them into the lake of fire. Therefore, in the Bible there are three kinds of baptisms: the water baptism, the Spirit baptism, and the fire baptism. The water baptism of John was a preparation for the kingdom to come, the Spirit baptism was the beginning of the kingdom, and the fire baptism will be the termination of the kingdom. We should not continue to be a brood of vipers. Neither should we be the chaff in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61728" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> nor the tares in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61729" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. Rather, we must become wheat, the living children of God. In order to become the children of God, you must be baptized through water into the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61730" data-verses="John 3:5">John 3:5</span> says that you must be born of water and of the Spirit. Firstly, we are baptized through water; then we are baptized in the Spirit. In this way we are regenerated. Therefore, we have the two kinds of positive baptism, the baptism in water and the baptism in the Spirit. But we want nothing to do with the baptism in fire.</p>

To Baptize People in Water</h2><p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EFU39UlkCzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> The first aspect of John’s way of recommendation was to baptize people in water. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61731" data-verses="Matthew 3:5-6">Verses 5 and 6</span> reveal that many were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. To baptize people is to immerse them, to bury them in water, signifying death. John the Baptist did this to indicate that anyone who repents is good for nothing but burial. This also signifies the termination of the old person, that a new beginning may be realized in resurrection, to be brought in by Christ as the life-giver. Hence, following John’s ministry, Christ came. John’s baptism not only terminated those who repented, but also ushered them to Christ for life. Baptism in the Bible implies death and resurrection. To be baptized into the water is to be put into death and buried. To <span class="pg" data-page-id="117" id="117">[117]</span> be raised up from the water means to be resurrected from death.</p>
<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhjljpPQw69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> It was in the Jordan River that twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel were buried and from it that another twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel were resurrected and brought up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61732" data-verses="Joshua 4:1-18">Josh. 4:1-18</span>). Hence, to baptize people in the Jordan River implied the burial of their old being and the resurrection of the new. Just as crossing the Jordan River ushered the children of Israel into the good land, so to be baptized brings people into Christ, the reality of the good land.</p>
<p data-content-id="Xrfm_0_wHtlK1HVoKjia5xMO_XMNx9Cw0kdxF7iwt4aGYrrICB0YkaHGfAxzlMrpi"> Whenever anyone repented in the presence of John the Baptist, John put him into the water. According to the New Testament, to immerse someone in water firstly meant to bury him, and secondly it meant to raise him up. Thus, on the negative side, baptism signifies death and burial; on the positive side it signifies resurrection. In his message of recommendation, John indicated that God would raise up living children out of dead stones. By baptizing the repentant ones, John indicated that they and all their past had to be terminated and buried. Burial, however, was not the end, because burial always brings in resurrection. Thus, on the one hand, burial is termination, but on the other hand, it is also germination. Those whom John terminated in baptism were to be resurrected, not in him, but in the One who was to come after him. John’s baptism was an indicator that One was coming to raise up the dead.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuaoI9Tslji_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> Baptism means that our natural being and all of our past must be terminated. Our being and our past are only good for burial. Therefore, as John, the genuine priest, was bringing others to God and introducing the King to them, he terminated and buried everyone who came to him in repentance, indicating thereby that those who were buried by him would be raised up by the resurrected One. This is the way of recommendation, the true way to bring the repentant ones to the King who would raise them up.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVDUm7j8tTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> In the New Testament there are two ministries: the ministry of John and the ministry of the Lord Jesus. John’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> ministry is to bring others to God by terminating and burying them. These terminated and buried ones need the resurrection that only Christ can afford. Hence, Christ came after John to minister life to the dead and buried ones. This is the reason we need to be reborn, to be baptized in water and in the Spirit. To be baptized in water is to have our natural life and our past terminated. To be baptized in the Spirit is to have a new start by being germinated with the divine life. This germination is only possible through Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OUg3PNvm0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> Anyone who is brought to God must be terminated in the presence of God. In a sense, it is wonderful to be brought into the presence of God. But in another sense it means that you must be terminated. If you are not terminated, you will be killed. Hence, to be brought into the presence of God is both wonderful and serious, for it means that we shall either be terminated or killed. The two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, came into the presence of God, but they were killed by fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61733" data-verses="Leviticus 10:1-2">Lev. 10:1-2</span>). If we are willing to be terminated in the presence of God, it means that we are ready to be germinated, to be resurrected, to have a new beginning. This termination is the genuine way of recommendation. It is the way of preparation to bring us into the presence of the King so that the King may be brought to us to give us a new start in resurrection. In Matthew <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61734" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> we have both a strong termination and a prevailing germination. Through this termination and germination, the King gains a people, and the people receive the King.</p>

To prepare the way of the Lord and to make His paths straight is to change people’s minds, to turn their minds toward the Lord and make their hearts right, to cause <span class="pg" data-page-id="119" id="119">[119]</span> every part and avenue of their heart to be straightened by the Lord through repentance for the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61736" data-verses="Luke 1:16-17">Luke 1:16-17</span>). John the Baptist prepared the way and straightened the paths. This indicates that the way was rough, full of hills and valleys. In some places it was very low, and in others it was very high. But John came and paved the way, leveling the hills, filling the gaps, and making the way smooth and flat. John also straightened the paths, which were full of curves. The fact that John paved the way and straightened the paths means that His ministry dealt with the mind and the heart.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPJcRzjPIGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> Consider your past before you were saved. Did you not have a rough way within you? Certainly the way in your mind was filled with many hills and valleys. Before I was saved, my mind was filled with ups and downs. Nothing was flat. Moreover, in the lanes of your thought, emotion, will, and desire, there were many curves. One day you said your wife was an angel; the next day you said she was a devil. This indicates that your emotion was full of curves. Before you repented, all the paths within you were curved; nothing was straight.</p>

<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYOWFHtEx6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> When John the Baptist came, he commanded the people to repent. Genuine repentance prepares the way and straightens the paths. Before I repented, my mentality was rough. But, through the Lord’s mercy, on the day of my repentance, my whole inward being became smooth. From the time of my repentance, every avenue, lane, and path in my being has been made straight. This is to prepare us to receive the Lord, to prepare the way for the Lord, and to make His paths straight. The way to prepare others to receive the Lord is to help them to repent. John the Baptist seemed to be saying, “You children of Israel are far away from the Lord. Your mind is a rough way, and your emotion, will, desire, and intention are curved paths. You need to repent and straighten out every avenue within your being so that the Lord may come in.” When many heard John’s word, they repented, and their way was paved and their paths were straightened. Therefore, the King was able to come in. This is true repentance. Genuine <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> repentance prepares the way for the Lord as the King to enter in. I can testify that along this paved way and in these straightened paths, I continually enjoy the Lord. My way is paved, the Lord Jesus is walking within me, and along my straightened paths I always have the Lord Jesus with me. This is the way to prepare ourselves to receive Christ the King.</p>

This verse does not say that Jesus came from Bethlehem to Jerusalem to be sanctified. It says He came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized. We need to consider the significance of the phrase “from Galilee to the Jordan.” It is not easy to see why Jesus came not from Bethlehem but from Galilee and not to Jerusalem but to the Jordan. We also need to see why He came to John, who was a “wild” person, not to the high priest, who would have been a cultured and religious person. Moreover, we need to know why He came to be baptized, not to be sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuapKtTh3Ti_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R">1. Coming from Galilee</h2><p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPIeBzmOoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> In the New Testament, Galilee, a despised region, signifies rejection. Jesus did not come from Bethlehem because at that time Bethlehem was a place of honor and welcome. If you came out of Bethlehem, everyone would honor you and give you a warm welcome. But if you came from Galilee, everyone would despise you and reject you. Jesus came from such a despised and rejected place. This place was not rejected by <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> God, but it was rejected by religion and culture. All those who come to the Lord’s recovery do not come from Bethlehem; rather, they come from Galilee. Do not try to come from a place of honor and warm welcome, but come from a place that is despised and rejected by religion and culture. Even if the president of a nation took the way of the church, he would also have to be one coming from Galilee to the Jordan. Throughout my years of watching and observing, I have seen that those of a high rank who turned to the way of the church were despised and rejected by today’s religion and culture. I am quite certain that if you are still honored and welcomed by today’s religion and culture, you are not on the way from Galilee to the Jordan. The way from Galilee to the Jordan is the correct way for the church. The way of today’s church life is not from Bethlehem to Jerusalem; it is from Galilee to the Jordan.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYPUVHoFR6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> The way of the church is a narrow way. Even if there were no opposition to the Lord’s recovery but rather a high appraisal from every Christian organization, the number of those who would turn to the way of the church would still be about the same as it is today, simply because the way of the church is a narrow way. When some consider the church, they may say, “This is the kingdom of the heavens. Certainly this way must be very high.” Although this way is high, it is not high according to your concept. Instead, it is a highway from Galilee to the Jordan.</p>

Coming to Jordan</h2><p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsUd6r0dthgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> As we have pointed out, Jordan was a place of burial and resurrection. Thus, Jordan signifies termination and germination. The children of Israel traveled through the wilderness for about forty years, and eventually they were all buried in the Jordan River. Hence, the Jordan terminated them, ended their history of wandering in the wilderness, and terminated the age of wandering. But the Jordan also gave them a new beginning, for it germinated them and ushered them into a new age. It was the Jordan that brought the children of Israel out of the wilderness and into the good land, which is Christ. This is the significance of the Jordan. <span class="pg" data-page-id="123" id="123">[123]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFd4JKSGQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> In the church life our way today is the way from Galilee to the Jordan, the way from rejection to termination and resurrection. We all need to say to those who despise and reject us, “Farewell. I shall not seek to be welcomed by you. I am going to the place where I can be terminated and germinated.” In the church life there is no honor; instead, there is termination. Day by day we are terminated. In the church we have a mutual termination. We terminate one another every day, even every hour. But it is a good thing to be terminated. Termination is not the end; it is the beginning, because termination always leads to germination. Therefore, we can testify that every termination becomes a germination.</p>
<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgjzta_z2SNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> Sometimes the sisters say, “Brother Lee, the church life is wonderful, but it is often difficult for us sisters. We know that the brothers are the head and that we sisters must submit to them. The brothers are good, but they are too strong. We just cannot take it. Many times they have nearly killed us.” Whenever I hear this, I say, “Isn’t that good? How good it is to be terminated. Isn’t it good for the sisters to be killed by the brothers?”</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I7Xo6375x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> A few years ago I was invited to a certain church. The brothers there told me that the sisters were so emotional and opinionated that they found it very difficult to have fellowship with them. They simply did not know how to handle the situation. Several days later some of the very sisters in question invited me to lunch. Their purpose in doing so was to have an opportunity to express their opinion. They told me their patience was exhausted because the brothers were so strong. They wanted me to give them the way to go on. Several days earlier I had been pressed by the brothers, but now I was being pressed by the sisters. I saw what a serious and terrible termination that was for both the brothers and the sisters. Both the brothers and the sisters were being terminated. But that mutual termination is very positive. Do you not love to be terminated? If you have never been terminated in the church life, get yourself prepared. I can assure you that in the church life we all shall be terminated, because we are on the way from Galilee to the Jordan. <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4IBKyaBv8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> When new ones come into the church life, they may say, “Hallelujah! I have seen the church life! How wonderful!” Whenever I hear this, I say within, “Yes, it is wonderful, but wait awhile. Sooner or later, this wonderful church life will terminate you.” In the church life I have been terminated dozens of times. I have experienced at least ten major terminations. I was terminated in Chefoo, Shanghai, Taipei, Manila, Los Angeles, and Anaheim. The marvelous church life is surely a terminating life. The wonderful church life terminates us all. Be prepared to be terminated. Those who have been in the church life for just a short time are probably still on their church honeymoon. The honeymoon is fine. But as every married couple knows, the honeymoon eventually turns into termination. Nearly every husband has terminated his wife, and every wife has terminated her husband. But this termination is very positive because it brings in germination. Hallelujah, termination issues in resurrection!</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZUjedy_iy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> The church life truly is wonderful, but not wonderful according to our concept. The wonderful church life sooner or later will terminate us all. It will both terminate you and germinate you. I assure you that whatever you are, whatever you have, and whatever you can do will all be terminated. It may take a history of ten years in the church to accomplish this. Those who have been in the church for ten years can testify that every part of their being has been terminated. The longer we stay in the church, the more we are terminated. At first, the experience of termination is bitter. But later it becomes sweet. For me today it is sweet to be terminated. After a number of years of being terminated in the church life, you will be happy to be terminated. At first when you are terminated in the church life, you feel ashamed. Gradually, however, it becomes a sweet experience for you. We are on the way from Galilee to the Jordan, from the place of rejection to the place of termination.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS63q8fW-asIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> It is in this place of termination that we meet the King. Here, in the church life, is where we meet Him. From the time I came into the church life, I have been brought to the Lord again and again. Day after day, the church life brings <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> me to Christ, and it brings Christ the King to me. Eventually, the kingdom is here. This is the reason the church life is the kingdom.</p>

<p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2wbK7E-QUEzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> I was taught by the Brethren that the kingdom had been suspended until a future time. I was also taught that the church today was not the kingdom. But in my experience I gradually realized that every time I was terminated I was brought to the King and the King was brought to me. In my experience this was the reality of the kingdom. It was through experience that I first came to know that the church life is the kingdom. My experience told me that the teaching I received from the Brethren regarding the kingdom was not accurate. According to my experience, I knew I was in the kingdom. Every time I was terminated, I met my King, and the kingdom was present. This is not a matter of doctrine; it is a matter of experience. Later, through further study of the New Testament, I received light on the matter of the kingdom, and my experience was confirmed. Now I can boldly say that according to the New Testament the kingdom is here today. Because they have not been terminated, some Christian teachers say that the kingdom has been suspended until some future time. They have not been brought to the King, and the King has not been brought to them. Thus, in their daily experience they do not have the kingdom. However, after you have been terminated on the way from Galilee to the Jordan, both the King and the kingdom will be present.</p>

Baptized by John</h2><p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19I_43CHgOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> The Lord Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. As a man, the Lord Jesus came to be baptized by John the Baptist according to God’s New Testament way. Of the four Gospels only John’s does not give a record of the Lord being baptized, because he testifies that the Lord is God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61739" data-verses="Matthew 3:13">Verse 13</span> does not say that Jesus came to John to be sanctified; it says that He came to be baptized. Although every Christian likes to be sanctified, no one likes to be baptized in the sense of being terminated and buried. To be baptized is to be terminated. If I told you that the church <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> will not sanctify you, but rather terminate you, you would turn away from the church and say, “I don’t want to stay here. I want to be sanctified. I want the church to make me more holy.” But the church will not firstly make you more holy; it will terminate you again and again. The church is not firstly a sanctifying church, but a baptizing church. Consider the case of the Lord Jesus. He was the true Shepherd. A shepherd always takes the lead. As the Shepherd-King, the Lord Jesus took the lead to walk from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized. He did not come to the Jordan to be enthroned, but to be put to death, to be buried.</p>

But Jesus answering said to him, Permit it now, for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he permitted Him.” John did not understand very well, He wondered how Jesus could be baptized by him, and he thought that he should have been baptized by Jesus. This indicates that John was still somewhat in his natural life. Although he had been soaked in the Holy Spirit for more than thirty years, some natural element still remained. His word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61741" data-verses="Matthew 3:14">verse 14</span> was uttered according to his natural concept. Thus, in answering him the Lord seemed to say, “You must permit Me to be baptized. Don’t frustrate Me by your natural concept. Do not think that because I am mightier than you I don’t need to be baptized by you. Permit Me to be baptized so that we may fulfill all righteousness.”</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk-DOZeLa1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> Righteousness is to be right by living, walking, and doing things in the way God has ordained. In the Old Testament, to keep the law that God had given was righteousness. Now God had sent John the Baptist to ordain baptism. To be baptized is also to fulfill righteousness before God, that is, to fulfill the requirement of God. The Lord Jesus came to John, not as God, but as a typical man, a real Israelite. Hence, He must be baptized to keep this dispensational practice of God; otherwise, He would not be right with God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="127" id="127">[127]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoMzwK4-1sw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> Righteousness is a matter of being right with God. Suppose God opens a door in the ceiling of a room and says that this is the proper way to enter the room. Anyone who does not enter the room through that door is not right with God. Perhaps you would say, “I don’t agree with entering the room through that door. According to my concept, this door is not right. The front door or the side door is the right door.” Your way may be right in your eyes, but not in God’s eyes. Righteousness is not a matter of your opinion; it is a matter of God’s ordination.</p>
<p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCIvNpnE74qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> At the time of John the Baptist, God ordained baptism as the way. Anyone who wanted to enter the kingdom of the heavens had to pass through the gateway of John’s baptism. Not even Jesus Christ could be an exception. Even He had to pass through this gateway. Otherwise, He would have lacked the righteousness of passing through this doorway. After the Lord answered him in such a way, John understood and baptized Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rVGVsQiwrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> To be baptized is to be righteous in the eyes of God. The termination and germination of our being is righteousness before God. One who has been baptized, who has been terminated and germinated, is right with God. God’s economy is to terminate our natural man and germinate us with a new life. If we would be right with God, we must be terminated in our natural life and germinated with His divine life. Termination and germination is the highest righteousness. The Lord Jesus, as the King of the heavenly kingdom, took the lead to be terminated. In this way He fulfilled righteousness in the eyes of God. Thus, He was the right person to establish the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePF3NgVQQGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> The Lord was baptized not only to fulfill righteousness according to God’s ordination, but also to allow Himself to be put into death and resurrection that He might minister, not in a natural way, but in the way of resurrection. By being baptized He lived and ministered in resurrection even before His actual death and resurrection three and a half years later. According to our understanding, the Lord Jesus was put to death on the cross and resurrected on the third <span class="pg" data-page-id="128" id="128">[128]</span> day. But in the eyes of God and according to the Lord’s realization, He was put to death three and a half years before His crucifixion. Before He began His ministry, He was already put to death and resurrected. Thus, He did not minister in a natural way. His ministry was absolutely in His resurrection life. Thus, He entered into the gateway of righteousness and walked along the pathway of righteousness. Whatever He did on this pathway was righteous.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvT3dgr4vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> When the Lord Jesus comes back, many will say to Him, “Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61742" data-verses="Matthew 7:22">7:22</span>). The Lord will say to them, “I never knew you; depart from Me, workers of lawlessness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61743" data-verses="Matthew 7:23">7:23</span>). The Lord will seem to say, “You are a lawless person. I never approved of you nor agreed with what you did, because you did not do things in resurrection. All the good things you did were done in your natural way and in your natural life. You are not righteous; you are lawless.” Through baptism the Lord Jesus entered into the gateway of righteousness, and then He walked continually along the pathway of righteousness. Therefore, He was the just One, the righteous One (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61744" data-verses="Acts 3:14">Acts 3:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61745" data-verses="Acts 7:52">7:52</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61746" data-verses="Acts 22:14">22:14</span>).</p>

<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUsV2DSr80trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> Because the Lord Jesus was baptized, fulfilling God’s righteousness, the heavens were opened to Him, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and the Father spoke concerning Him. His being baptized to fulfill God’s righteousness pleased God. Thus, His baptism opened the heavens, brought down the Holy Spirit, and opened the mouth of the Father. The way we can have an open heaven, the descending Spirit, and the speaking of the Father is to be terminated. Many of us can testify that whenever we have been terminated, the heavens have been opened. On the contrary, whenever we were welcomed and honored, the heavens were closed. Whenever we are terminated in the church life, the heavens are opened. Moreover, every termination brings down the Holy Spirit and opens the mouth of our heavenly Father. At that time the Father will say, “My beloved.” I can testify that my sweetest times of hearing God’s speaking have been times of termination. Perhaps I was terminated to the point of tears, but my termination opened the mouth of the Father, who spoke a sweet word to me. He only said, “My beloved child.” This simple word is sufficient. It is full of mercy and grace. What a comfort and a strength it is for Him to say, “My beloved child”! In the church life we have many experiences like this. However, seldom are such things experienced outside the church. In the church life, when we are terminated, the heavens are opened, the Spirit comes, and the Father speaks. We have an open heaven, the anointing Spirit, and the speaking Father.</p>

That was for His birth. Now, for His ministry, the Spirit of God descended upon Him.

<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEAsHpr6CrHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> The Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61753" data-verses="Matthew 1:18">1:18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61754" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">20</span>). He was born of the Holy Spirit and constituted with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was His constituent. Nevertheless, He still needed the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. When He was in the womb of the virgin Mary, He was constituted with the Holy Spirit. This means that He was a constitution of the Holy Spirit. That was something inward. Outwardly, He still needed the Holy Spirit to come down upon Him.</p>

Are these two Spirits? Was not the Spirit of God in Jesus? Certainly He was. Then why did the Spirit still descend upon Him? Was the Spirit within Him different from the Spirit who came down upon Him? Is the Spirit who descended upon Him another Spirit in addition to the Spirit who was already within Him? If you say that these two were one Spirit, I would ask how these two Spirits could be one. The same Spirit who already indwelt the Lord Jesus came down upon Him. Did Jesus have the Spirit or not? Yes, He did. Why then did the Spirit still descend upon Him? I am here with you. Since I am here, how could I still come to you? Although it is not possible for me to be here and yet still be coming, it is not impossible with the divine Person. The Lord is wonderful. At the same time, He can be both here and also coming. Is Christ in you or is He in the heavens? He is both in us and in the heavens. Thus, the Lord is both here and coming.</p>

After His anointing, the Lord was tested. In God’s administration the sequence is always selection, anointing, and testing. There is an illustration of this in married life. Prior to getting married, you certainly made a selection. Among the many you could have married, you selected a certain one. After the selection came the appointment, and after the appointment came the test. Nearly every married couple has failed the marriage test. Although we were successful in the appointment, we were not successful in the test.</p>
<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsUdqryP9hgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> After the heavenly King was anointed and appointed. He was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness to be tested. He did not go to the wilderness on His own; He was led there by the very Holy Spirit who had descended upon Him. In married life God will also lead us into the test. A number of young brothers and sisters have complained to God, saying, “Lord, before I was married, I prayed a great deal. Eventually You told me that it was Your will that I marry this one, that this was the one whom You had prepared for me. Lord, You know I was not interested at first, but in Your sovereignty You arranged for us to come together. But look at the situation today. Look at the one You have given me. Is this Your mistake or mine?” Neither the Lord nor you made a mistake. This is the Lord’s test. <span class="pg" data-page-id="134" id="134">[134]</span> </p>

We know that all things work together for our good (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61757" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Rom. 8:28</span>), including even a seemingly mistaken marriage. Who knows what is the right marriage? I have many years’ experience in married life. Forty-five years ago, I could tell others definitely, clearly, and emphatically what was the right marriage. But if you ask this question today, I would say, “I cannot know this until we enter eternity. After so many years’ experience in married life, I truly don’t know what is the right marriage.” But I have learned that every marriage under God’s sovereignty is right. Therefore, you all have the right marriage. Brothers, your wife is the right one for you. Sisters, your husband is the right one for you. Whether you believe this or not, you cannot escape from your situation. After the young people and the middle-aged ones have been married for a number of years, they may conclude that they have made a mistake and that if they could do it again they would do it differently. I can assure you that even if you could do it over many times, you would still come to feel that you had made a mistake. Almost all those who are about to be married think they have made the right choice, but after some years there may be times that they feel that they were mistaken. The reason for this is that God puts us to the test in married life.</p>

When we first came into the church life, we experienced a church life honeymoon. We were enjoying the glorious church life, and everything was wonderful. However, sooner or later we shall be put to the test. Every brother who is put into the eldership is tested, and the test usually comes from the other elders. Perhaps at the beginning in your locality you were the only elder. You were looking for some others to help you, and later two were added. After several months, all three of you were tested by one another. The Lord allows this. In God’s economy, after we have been appointed to something, we shall always be tested.

<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0i14MkgFs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> The first test was in the matter of human living, in the matter of making a living. Our relatives and in-laws, especially those of the older generation, are always concerned about how we shall make our living. They may say, “It is all right to love the Lord, but do not love Him in a foolish way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="136" id="136">[136]</span> You must consider your need to make a good living.” When in 1933 I was burdened by the Lord and led of Him to leave my job, my in-laws said, “You have a good job. You are making excellent money to take care of your family and to help others. You can speak on Sunday and hold meetings at night during the week. Why must you quit your job? Many are looking eagerly for such a job, but have no opportunity to get it. But you are leaving. We wonder how you will be able to make a living. We don’t know how you will take care of your wife and children.” I did not listen to their advice, and they could not discourage me from leaving my job to serve the Lord full time. A number of times my in-laws even sent their little daughter to sneak into our kitchen to see if we had food to eat. They were worried that we might be starving. The matter of our living touches us deeply, and even the Lord Jesus was tested regarding it.</p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GvSFFc-gsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> The Lord was led to fast for forty days and forty nights. After these forty days and forty nights, He was physically hungry, and the tempter came to Him and said, “If You are the Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61764" data-verses="Matthew 4:3">v. 3</span>). To this proposal the Lord replied, “Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61765" data-verses="Matthew 4:4">v. 4</span>). Many Christians think that because the Lord was fasting during this time He did not eat anything. However, this word reveals that while the Lord Jesus was fasting, He was eating. Physically He was fasting, but spiritually He was eating.</p>

<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrqqaH_r55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> Here we see an important principle. In the Lord’s ministry and economy, if we do not know how to lower our physical demands and take care of the spiritual demand, we are not qualified for His ministry. In order to be qualified in the Lord’s ministry, we must be tested. We must lay down our physical requirements. A good living, good food, good clothing, and proper housing are all secondary. Eating spiritual food is primary. Immediately after His baptism, the Lord Jesus was led into a situation where He could declare to the whole universe that He was not for the physical need, but that He would take care of the spiritual need only. For <span class="pg" data-page-id="137" id="137">[137]</span> forty days and forty nights, He forsook all physical food, forgetting the physical requirements. However, He took care of the spiritual need. Although He did not eat to nourish His physical body, He ate a great deal for the nourishment of His spirit. Satan was absolutely wrong in thinking that the Lord Jesus was not eating during those days in the wilderness. While He was fasting from physical food, He was partaking of spiritual food. This is the test in the matter of our living.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovlYDxzjgRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> Many wives have not been able to withstand this test. Every wife is very concerned about her security. The wives desire to have good food, clothing, and housing. In other words, they desire a good living. This has posed a problem to many brothers. Although these brothers had a heart to take the way of the church, their wives were not willing to follow them because there was no guarantee of a good living. Many of us can testify that, when we first began to take the way of the church, our wives said, “What about our future? What about our living? What about our food, clothing, and housing?” This is a test we must face if we would take the way of the church and go the way of God’s economy.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMhuOJEiTAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> The first test we must pass is the test regarding our living. We must care for the spiritual food more than for the physical food. Whether we live or die is secondary. We only care that our spirit is fed, that our spirit feasts on the Word of God, on God Himself.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqGihFI5f5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> Some pastors, missionaries, and Bible teachers saw the way of the church and had a thorough talk with me about it. However, realizing that this way is narrow, they were concerned about what would happen to their living if they went this way. The wives of many of these dear ones simply did not agree that their husbands should take this narrow way. They knew their standard of living would be lowered if their husbands went the way of the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-lVEzwwKgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> Forty-five years ago in China, this way was truly narrow, and we were daily on the test concerning our living. Time after time just one dollar kept some of us from having nothing to eat. In order to take this narrow way, we had to live by <span class="pg" data-page-id="138" id="138">[138]</span> faith in God. Although it was very difficult, we lived by faith for many years. I can testify that we feasted on God and His Word during those testing days when our standard of living was greatly lowered. Our experience was the same as that of the Lord Jesus in the wilderness. He neither chose to go to the wilderness nor did He go there by His own preference. He was led there by the Holy Spirit. Likewise, we were led by God into the wilderness of the church life. Fifty years ago, the church was truly in the wilderness. Nearly every day we were tested concerning what we would eat that night. But that was the time we enjoyed feasting on the Word of God. On the one hand, we did not have very much physical food to eat, but on the other hand, we did feast on the rich Word.</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5BggGpJoU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> The principle is the same today in the church life. In taking the way of the church, the first test we shall encounter is that of lowering our standard of living. This is the test in the realm of our physical living. Everyone who takes the way of the church will be tested in this matter of his daily living. We shall be tested to show to the whole universe that our concern is not for physical food, but for spiritual food. During those days in the wilderness, Jesus was not concerned for His physical food, but for His spiritual food. He was fasting physically, yet He was eating the Word of God. In the wilderness He did not live by bread alone; He lived on the Word of God.</p>

At the time of Christ’s baptism, the Father opened the heavens and declared, “This is My beloved Son” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61766" data-verses="Matthew 3:17">3:17</span>), A voice from heaven declared that a little man from Nazareth was God the Father’s beloved Son. Immediately after this declaration was made, the Holy Spirit led this man into the wilderness to be tested to see whether He would care for His physical life or for His spiritual life. Then, based upon the declaration of God the Father, the tempter came to tempt this man <span class="pg" data-page-id="139" id="139">[139]</span> by saying, “If You are the Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61767" data-verses="Matthew 4:3">v. 3</span>). Satan seemed to be saying, “We heard the declaration made forty days ago by God the Father that You are the beloved Son. Now if You are truly the Son of God, do something to prove it. Simply say, ‘Stones, I want you to become loaves of bread.’ If You are the Son of God, You must prove it to Yourself and to me and to everyone in the whole universe by doing something which no one else can do.”</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM6Wl8kIGElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> The newly anointed King fasted in His humanity, standing on the ground of a man. However, He was also the Son of God, as God the Father had declared at His baptism. For Him to accomplish His ministry for the kingdom of the heavens, He had to defeat God’s enemy, the Devil, Satan. This He must do as a man. Hence, He stood as a man to confront the enemy of God. The Devil, knowing this, tempted Him to leave the standing of man and assume His position as the Son of God. Forty days before, God the Father declared from the heavens that He was the beloved Son of the Father. The subtle tempter took that declaration of God the Father as the ground to tempt Him. If He assumed His position as the Son of God before the enemy, He would have lost the standing to defeat him.</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfOx3ITqZbftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> To make the stones become loaves of bread would certainly be a miracle. This was proposed by the Devil as a temptation. Many times the thought of having a miracle performed in certain situations is a temptation from the Devil. The Devil’s temptation of the first man, Adam, concerned the matter of eating (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61768" data-verses="Genesis 3:1-6">Gen. 3:1-6</span>). Now his temptation of the second man, Christ, also concerned the matter of eating. Eating is always a trap used by the Devil to snare man.</p>

If I were only the Son of God, I could never be here, and I could never be tempted by you. But because I am a man, I am being tempted. Satan, I know that you are not afraid of the Son of God, but you are afraid of man. The first man, the man whom God created to defeat you and to fulfill His purpose, was defeated by you. Thus, God sent Me as the second man to defeat you. Now you are tempting Me to leave My position as a man to assume My position as the Son of God. But I tell you, Satan, I am standing here as a man.”</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuapK9TrlDi_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> Although the demons shouted, “Son of God,” the evil spirits do not confess that Jesus came as a man. They will admit that He is the Son of God, but they will not recognize that He is a man. The reason the evil spirits do not want anyone to believe that Christ is the Son of God is that anyone who does so will be saved. But they do not dare recognize Jesus as a man; for if they did, they would be defeated. In dealing with the demons, Jesus is the Son of man. In saving us sinners, He is the Son of God. When we believe in Him as the Son of God, we are saved. But if the demons recognize Him as the Son of man, they will be defeated. Therefore, the Lord Jesus took a strong standing as a man to defeat Satan. In this first test Satan was defeated because Jesus took the position of a man.</p>

This word indicates that the Lord Jesus took the word of God in the Scriptures as His bread <span class="pg" data-page-id="141" id="141">[141]</span> and lived on it.

Defeated in this, he turned his second temptation to religion, tempting the new King to demonstrate that He is the Son of God from the wing of the temple. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61777" data-verses="Matthew 4:6">verse 6</span> the Devil said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, He shall give charge to His angels concerning You, and on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.” There was no need for the Lord Jesus to do this. It was simply a temptation to show that as the Son of God He was able to do things in a miraculous way. Any thought of doing things miraculously in religion is a temptation of the Devil.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYPUFHqHR6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> The second test is a matter of religion. The most exciting thing in religion is miracles. According to the human concept, any religion that does not have miracles is powerless; the most powerful religion is a religion of miracles. Therefore, Satan brought the new King to the wing of the temple and tempted Him to leap down from it by saying that the angels would protect Him. Do not think that you have never had the thought of doing this kind of thing. In my early days I often thought of doing things to show people that I was a supernatural person and that I had supernatural powers. <span class="pg" data-page-id="142" id="142">[142]</span> Have you not had this kind of concept in your Christian life? Sometimes we are tested when there is a need to do something, and at other times we are tested when there is no need. In this instance, there was no need for Jesus to leap down from the wing of the temple.</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuPdOljrDkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> Sometimes there does seem to be a need for a miracle. Once my youngest brother-in-law became seriously ill. At that time I was tempted to make a show of myself by praying for his healing. I thought, “Now is the time for me to prove to my in-laws and relatives that I am a wonderful person. I shall pray just one prayer, and my brother-in-law will be healed. Doesn’t the Bible say that Jesus heals, that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that we must pray for others? If I do this miracle for my brother-in-law, my mother-in-law will be convinced that I am a supernatural person. In her eyes I am too religious, daily talking about God, Christ, and faith. Imagine what would happen if I went to my brother-in-law and said, ‘Lord Jesus, heal him,’ and he immediately rose up! Not only would he be healed, but I would be manifested. What a wonderful person I would be in the eyes of my mother-in-law!” Was that the Lord’s anointing, the Lord’s leading and guidance, or was it a temptation? Surely it was a temptation. Have you not had such a temptation in the past?</p>
<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsUdqrxdNhgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> Many young Christians have peculiar concepts regarding the performing of miracles. Some may say, “Since I am one following the Lord and I am in the Lord’s presence as my Emmanuel, I must do something to show others that God is with me.” I know of one dear brother who had such a thought. Convinced that the Lord was with him, he asked the Lord to give him two hundred thousand dollars within a certain number of days. He said, “Lord, You must show the people that You are one with me. You must show them that whatever I ask in Your name, You give me. Lord, I am asking You for two hundred thousand dollars. Within a certain number of days, You must give it to me.” This brother stopped eating and sleeping and began to pray for this amount of money. What kind of prayer was that? It was leaping from the wing of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="143" id="143">[143]</span> temple to make a show of himself. In principle we have all done this many times. Every Christian has been tempted in this way.</p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFd4ZKXHwD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> If the Devil does not tempt us in the matter of our living, he will tempt us in the matter of religion. You may desire to be a great one in religion, to be recognized as a powerful person. Everyone else must walk down from the wing of the temple, but you, a supernatural person, one who is more powerful than others, can leap down. By doing this you become great in Christianity. All the religious “big shots” are those who have yielded to this temptation. If you have become famous in Christianity, if you have succeeded in becoming recognized as a supernatural person, then you have already yielded to this temptation. You have already been defeated by the enemy. However, if you desire to defeat the enemy in this test, you must not leap from the temple. Rather, you must walk down from it as slowly as possible. Let others think that you are weak and incompetent. But you must tell yourself, “I am not walking in power. I am walking in life. I do not care for power—I care for life.” It is easy to say this, but it is difficult to do it. When the opportunity presents itself, although you may not leap from the wing of the temple, you will run down, at least showing that you are a good runner, able to run faster than others. Nevertheless, if we would defeat the enemy, we must be a nobody. Never do anything to prove that you are somebody or something. Let others think that you are nothing. Actually, I am nothing, and my Christ is everything. If you take the standing of being a nobody, you will kill the enemy. You will slay the tempter.</p>

To quote the Scriptures concerning something in one aspect requires us to take care of the other aspect as well, in order to be safeguarded from the deception of the tempter.

Thus, in the second temptation, the tempter himself quoted them. He seemed to be saying, “Jesus, You quoted the Bible. I know the Bible also. Let me quote a verse to You.” But the Lord Jesus said, “Again it is written.” The word “again” is very strong. Do not think that you can quote the Bible and that the enemy cannot. Satan knows more of the Bible than you do. Therefore, the best safeguard is to have a word again as either a balance or a confirmation. Then, in the second temptation, the enemy will also be defeated.</p>

The temptations of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="145" id="145">[145]</span> subtle one always come in this way: firstly, in human living; secondly, in religion; and thirdly, in worldly glory. In any temptation, all three of these items will be present. The third temptation is a matter of worldly glory, promotion, ambition, position, and a promising future. All this is the glory of the world.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19I_o3FHAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61781" data-verses="Luke 4:6">Luke 4:6</span> says that the kingdoms of the world and their glory were delivered unto the Devil; hence, to whomever he wills he gives them. Before his fall, Satan as the archangel was appointed by God to be the ruler of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61782" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:13-14">Ezek. 28:13-14</span>). Thus, he is called the ruler of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61783" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>), holding all the kingdoms of this world and their glory in his hand. He presented all these to the newly anointed King as a temptation in order to secure worship. The heavenly King overcame this temptation, but the coming Antichrist will not (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61784" data-verses="Revelation 13:2">Rev. 13:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61785" data-verses="Revelation 13:4">4</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HD129WLlvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp"> This temptation involves the matter of ambition and promotion. Even among the saints, there is the desire to be a leader. This is the desire for worldly glory. Your eagerness to be a leader is your ambition. This is the glory of the world. Whenever you are tempted in this manner, you must realize that behind this temptation is the tempter seeking to gain your worship. Satan told the Lord Jesus that if He would worship him, he would give Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. Behind every ambition there is a hidden idol. If you are ambitious to have a position, a promotion, or a name, there is an idol behind that ambition. If you do not worship any idol, you will never fulfill your ambition. In order to have any part of the glory of the world, you must worship some idol. Without worshipping idols it is impossible to have a position. Whenever you are seeking a certain position, deep within you know that you are worshipping an idol. For this reason, the Apostle said that covetousness is idolatry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61786" data-verses="Colossians 3:5">Col. 3:5</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCl4itpQQ2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> Suppose some brothers who came into the church life four years later than you become leaders and you feel that you have been passed by. If you complain about this, asking why they have been made leaders and you have not, this is <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> a proof that you are seeking worldly glory. Perhaps among a group of ten sisters three are appointed to take the lead in a particular service. If the other seven have no feeling about this, they have gained the victory. But if they question why those three were appointed, this indicates that they are seeking vain glory, the glory of this age. In this matter, we all are weak. If this desire for ambition and position can wedge even into the church life, then how much we need to be on guard in other things!</p>

For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.” Satan in Greek means adversary. He is not only God’s enemy outside God’s kingdom, but also the adversary within God’s kingdom, rebelling against God. The new King rebuked the Devil’s presentation and defeated him by standing on the ground of man to worship and serve God only. To worship or to serve anything other than God for gain is always the Devil’s temptation to secure worship. The Lord seemed to be saying to Satan, “Satan, as a man, I, Jesus, worship God and serve Him only. You are God’s enemy, and I will never worship you. I don’t care for the glory of the world or for the kingdoms of the world. Satan, get away from Me!”</p>
<p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCIvdpgEb4qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> If we consider our experience, we shall see that all temptations are included in these three aspects: the temptation in the matter of our living, the temptation of religious miracles, and the temptation in the realm of worldly glory. All day long we are tempted in the aspects of our living, religion, and worldly position. But the Lord Jesus overcame every aspect of the enemy’s temptation. He could say, “My living is secondary. I don’t care for religious power. And worldly glory has nothing to do with Me. I know only God’s word and God Himself. I care only to serve God.” Therefore, as the One who passed the test, the Lord Jesus was qualified to be the King of the kingdom of the heavens. <span class="pg" data-page-id="147" id="147">[147]</span> </p>

This indicates that he will have no place in the new King’s kingdom of the heavens. After the Lord Jesus defeated Satan, angels came and ministered to the tempted King as a suffering man (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61789" data-verses="Luke 22:43">Luke 22:43</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvT3Ngt6vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> Not only the King but also all the kingdom people must overcome the matters of their daily living, religious power, and worldly glory. If we cannot overcome these three temptations, we are outside the kingdom. If we would be the kingdom people, these three things must be under our feet. If we kill these three temptations, saying, “I don’t care for my living, for religious power, or for worldly position,” Satan will not be able to do anything to us.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LWELnH9_aKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> We should not be concerned about our daily living. Consider the example of the Apostle Paul. Paul said, “I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61790" data-verses="Philippians 4:12">Phil. 4:12</span>). Paul seemed to be saying, “It does not matter to me whether I have poverty or abundance. I can live in either scarcity or plenty. The matter of my daily living does not worry me.”</p>

If He had not been weak, who could have arrested Him and put Him on the cross? When He was arrested, tried, and crucified, He made no display of His power. He refused to exhibit any religious power. Instead, He was weak to the uttermost. Paul said that Christ “was crucified out of weakness”; he also said, “We are weak in Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61791" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:4">2 Cor. 13:4</span>). Many devilish people challenged Paul, saying, “If you are the true apostle of Christ, you must do something to prove it.” But when Paul was in prison, the Lord did not do anything miraculous for him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="148" id="148">[148]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIp6NE8J85SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> Paul’s situation was the same as that of John the Baptist, who also had been imprisoned. After a certain period of imprisonment, John sent his disciples to challenge the Lord, saying, “Are You the coming One, or should we expect someone else?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61792" data-verses="Matthew 11:3">11:3</span>). John seemed to be saying, “If You are the coming One, why don’t You do something for me? Don’t You know that I, Your forerunner and recommender, am in prison? Are you not powerful? Are You not Christ the almighty? If so, do something for me.” In His answer, the Lord said, “Blessed is he who shall not be stumbled in Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61793" data-verses="Matthew 11:6">11:6</span>). The Lord seemed to be saying, “Yes, I can do anything, but I don’t want to do anything for you. Although you are My recommender, My forerunner, I don’t care to do anything for you. I would rather that you would be beheaded. John, will you be stumbled by Me?” Brother Nee’s experience is an up-to-date illustration of this. He was in prison from 1952 until he died in 1972. During those twenty years, the Lord did not do anything for him in a miraculous way.</p>

In this message we shall consider the beginning of the ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61795" data-verses="Matthew 4:12-25">4:12-25</span>). After the Lord was anointed, He was tested to prove that He was qualified, and then He began to minister.</p>

<p data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HD1G9UZVvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61796" data-verses="Matthew 4:12">Verse 12</span> says, “Now having heard that John was delivered up, He withdrew into Galilee.” Although John the Baptist ministered in the wilderness, not in the holy temple in the holy city, he was still in Judea, not far from the so-called “holy” things. Due to the people’s rejection of John, the Lord Jesus withdrew into Galilee to begin His ministry, far away from the holy temple and holy city. This occurred sovereignly to fulfill the prophecy of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61797" data-verses="Isaiah 9:1-2">Isaiah 9:1 and 2</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCl4StkCQ2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> According to the human concept, Jesus should have begun to minister from the holy temple in the holy city, Jerusalem. But the report came to Him that His forerunner, John the Baptist, had been imprisoned. This was an indication to this new King that Jerusalem had become a place of rejection; therefore, He should not begin His kingly ministry there.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk-DuZVYq1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> In His economy God intended to have a thorough change, a change from the old economy to the new. The old economy had resulted in an outward religion, an outward temple, an outward city, and an outward system of worship. Everything in the old economy was systematized in an outward way. In God’s new economy, He gave all that up and had a <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> new beginning. The environment under God’s sovereignty matched this change in God’s economy. Because Jerusalem had rejected the recommender of the new King, the Lord Jesus knew that He should not begin His ministry there. There was no welcome for Him in Jerusalem.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZUj-dy9iy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> Although the new King was the Son of God, and although He had been anointed with the Spirit of God, we are not told here that He prayed concerning where He should go to minister. We are not told that He had the deep sense that He was being led to the north, away from Jerusalem. Rather, the Lord considered the environment and received from it the clear indication where He should go. Do not think that we can be so spiritual that we need no indications from our environment. Even the King of the heavenly kingdom, the Son of God anointed with the Holy Spirit, moved according to the environmental indicators. The Lord’s concept was neither natural nor religious, Furthermore, it was not according to past history. According to history, as the anointed King, He should have gone to the capital, Jerusalem, for Jerusalem is the proper place for the King. However, because His forerunner, His recommender, had been cast into prison, He went to Galilee. According to the human expectation, it was ridiculous for the newly anointed King to leave the capital and go to a despised region to begin His kingly ministry. He did not even go south to Hebron, the place where David was enthroned, nor to Beersheba, the place where Abraham lived. He went to Galilee.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS63K8fU-asIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> By considering the Lord’s move after the imprisonment of John the Baptist, we must learn not to try to be supernaturally spiritual. Jesus was not spiritual in that way. We must also learn not to go according to past history or to human understanding. According to history and the human concept, the King of the Jews should be in Jerusalem sitting on the throne. However, Jesus did not move purely according to the spiritual leading, nor did He move according to past history or the natural concept. Rather, He moved according to the environment which corresponded to God’s economy. By so doing, He spontaneously fulfilled the prophecy of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61798" data-verses="Isaiah 9:1-2">Isaiah 9:1 and 2</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="151" id="151">[151]</span>. Although the Lord moved apparently according to the environment instead of following the Spirit, His move was a fulfillment of the prophecy in the Scriptures.</p>
<p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2wbKbE9Q0EzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> In moving with the Lord we must avoid two extremes. The first extreme is the supernatural extreme. Some claim that there is no need to consider their environment because they have the Spirit. The other extreme is to pay too much attention to history and to the natural inclination and natural understanding. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61799" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">Matthew 4</span> the new King did not move merely according to the so-called spiritual leading nor according to history or the natural inclination. Rather, He moved along with God’s economy according to the indicators in the environment. He went to Galilee, to the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, to shine as a great light upon those sitting in darkness and in the region and shadow of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61800" data-verses="Matthew 4:15-16">4:15-16</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="KJEWVtLfOnw9Yxg9_3P5DLvt_p_AanTep0fB8fNd2CrXG7zPGzDylZTVqAClKS52d"> Nothing that happened either to John the Baptist or to the Lord Jesus was accidental. When John came out to minister at the age of thirty, he was very bold. It was not very long before he was imprisoned. You may find it difficult to believe that John the Baptist could be imprisoned. There seemed to be no reason for this. Once again, his imprisonment was due to the environment. John was imprisoned by Herod the king, not by the Jewish leaders. However, both the religious power and the political power, the Jewish religion and the Roman government, collaborated for the accomplishment of God’s purpose. It was sovereign according to God’s economy that John the Baptist was imprisoned at that time. The reason for this is that there comes a time when every recommending ministry must cease. If John the Baptist had not been imprisoned, it would have been difficult for him to stop his ministry. Because John was the recommender, his ministry should not have continued. In John <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61801" data-verses="John 3:1">chapter three</span> we see that the disciples of John the Baptist were in competition with the ministry of the new King (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61802" data-verses="John 3:26">v. 26</span>). The ministry of the recommender was competing with that of the King. Therefore, the ministry of the recommender had to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> stopped, and the best way to stop it was to put John himself into prison and even to let him be beheaded.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19I_Y3BGAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> You may say that God could not be so cruel as to allow this. But God sometimes allows things like this. No doubt, God brought you forth, prepared you, constituted you, qualified you, and then used you very much. But after He has used you, He may say, “Go to prison and wait there to be executed.” Are you able to take this? You may say, “This is altogether unfair. God shouldn’t allow this.” But in the past God has allowed this very thing many times, and I believe He will allow it again. If He allows this to happen to you, you should simply say, “Amen.” Do not send some of your disciples to challenge Christ, saying, “Are You the Christ, the almighty Lord whom I serve? If You are, why don’t You do something to rescue me from prison?” The King would say, “I shall not save you from this. You must die. You must be terminated. Let the new King be on the throne.” John the Baptist and his ministry were terminated because the new King was there. When the new King is here, there should not be any competition.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HD1G9SKlvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp">B. Starting from Galilee</h2><p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCl4SttRQ2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> The new King began His ministry in Galilee, even at the Sea of Galilee, not in the holy city or in the holy temple. His forerunner ministered by the riverside, in the wilderness, but He began His ministry by the Sea of Galilee. Galilee was a place of mixed population with both Jews and Gentiles. Hence, it was called “Galilee of the nations” (Gentiles) and was despised by orthodox Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61803" data-verses="John 7:41">John 7:41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61804" data-verses="John 7:52">52</span>). The newly appointed King began His kingly ministry for the kingdom of the heavens in such a despised place, far from the capital of the country, dignified Jerusalem, with its sacred temple, the center of the orthodox religion. This implied that the ministry of the newly anointed King was for a heavenly kingdom, different from the earthly kingdom of David (the Messianic kingdom). John the Baptist ministered by the riverside because he was prepared to bury everyone who came to him in repentance. The new King ministered around the <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> Sea of Galilee. In the Bible the Jordan River signifies burial and resurrection, termination and germination. But the Sea of Galilee signifies the world corrupted by Satan. Thus, Jordan was a place of burial, and the Sea of Galilee was the corrupted world.</p>

<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk-DuZdL61byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> In this portion of the Word there are four disciples who were called by Jesus: Peter, Andrew, James, and John. Do you know where and when these four were saved? The answer to this question is in John <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61805" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span>. As John the Baptist was ministering, Andrew was brought to the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61806" data-verses="John 1:35-37">John 1:35-37</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61807" data-verses="John 1:40">40</span>). Andrew then found Peter, his brother, and led him to the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61808" data-verses="John 1:40-42">John 1:40-42</span>). When the Lord met Peter, He changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61809" data-verses="John 1:42">John 1:42</span>). Therefore, in John <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61810" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span> both Peter and Andrew met the Lord Jesus. I believe they were saved at that time at the riverside of Jordan. The same thing happened to James and John. Of the two disciples of John the Baptist mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61811" data-verses="John 1:35">John 1:35</span>, one was the Apostle John. This John also brought his brother James to the Lord. Therefore, the four disciples mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61812" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">Matthew 4</span> had been terminated, germinated, and saved by the riverside of Jordan in John <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61813" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span>. However, they probably did not clearly understand what had happened to them.</p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoMzQK79Vsw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> I believe all this took place before the Lord’s temptation, while John was still ministering by the Jordan. After that, they returned to Galilee to continue their work of fishing. Probably they forgot what had happened to them by the riverside. They simply returned to their old occupation around the sea. But the Lord Jesus did not forget them. After His temptation, He began His ministry and came after them. It was the same with many of us. The first time we came to the Lord, He did many things to us, but we had no realization of their significance. Perhaps your riverside was in Canada or China. After meeting the Lord by the riverside, you came to a Sea of Galilee to make a living, to do your job of fishing, forgetting what the Lord had done to you by the riverside. Many of us simply forgot what the Lord had done to us in the past by the riverside of Jordan and did our best to make money <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> working around our Sea of Galilee, in the evil, devilish, Satan-corrupted world. But one day, much to our surprise, the One who had saved us by the riverside came to our Sea of Galilee as the newly appointed King purposely to find us.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCIvtpkHb4qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ">C. As a Great Light Shining in Darkness</h2><p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rVG1sQgwrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> When the Lord came to us by our Sea of Galilee, there was something different about Him. In John <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61814" data-verses="John 1:1">chapter one</span>, Christ’s recommender declared, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” When John declared that Christ was the Lamb of God, two of his disciples, Andrew and the Apostle John, followed the Lord Jesus. Eventually, as we have seen, both Andrew’s brother, Peter, and John’s brother, James, were also brought to the Lord and saved. Although it was wonderful to be saved, they later forgot their experience. Many of us did the same thing. Perhaps you said, “What happened there by the riverside of the Jordan? That was silly! We were put into the water and we met a Nazarene who was called the Lamb of God. But now we need to make a living. Let’s go back to our job. We have plenty of fishing and mending of nets to do.” Nevertheless, the King has His goal, and He needs you, just as He needed Peter, Andrew, James, and John. Thus, suddenly, the Lamb of God appeared at the very place where these four men were working to make a living. But this time He did not come as the Lamb—He came as a great light.</p>
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePF3tgVSQGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61815" data-verses="Matthew 4:16">Verse 16</span> says, “The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death, to them light sprang up.” John the Baptist was a burning and shining lamp (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61816" data-verses="John 5:35">John 5:35</span>). But this new King was the light. In fact, He was not only the light, but a great light. Peter, Andrew, James, and John did not realize that they were in darkness as they were working there by the Sea of Galilee to make a living. They were in the shadow of death. This is a picture of today’s situation. Many Christians met the Lord Jesus at some riverside and were saved. But later they did not care for that experience; rather, they cared for making a living. Therefore, they went to the Sea of Galilee to earn a living. Without knowing it, by going to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="155" id="155">[155]</span> Sea of Galilee to earn a living, they entered into darkness and into the shadow of death. All those striving to earn a living in the large cities like Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago are in darkness and in the region and shadow of death. Praise the Lord, the new King did not remain in Jerusalem! He came to the Sea of Galilee, and He is still coming to the Sea of Galilee today, walking about the seashore seeking to catch us. This time He comes not as a little Lamb, but as a great light. As Peter and Andrew were casting their nets into the sea, this great light shined upon them. As He stood there shining upon them, He might have said, “Peter and Andrew, what are you doing here? Don’t you remember that I met you by the riverside of Jordan? Peter, don’t you recall how I changed your name?” That day by the Sea of Galilee a great light was shining upon them.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvT39gq4PuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> Our experience was the same as theirs. We were saved at the riverside of Jordan. But we later forgot what had happened to us and went to the Sea of Galilee to make a living. As we were working there for our living, the One whom we had met as the Lamb of God by the riverside of Jordan came as a great light to shine upon us. As He was shining upon us, He inquired, “What are you doing there?” I can testify that this happened to me one day. As I was working by the Sea of Galilee earning a good living, suddenly a light shined upon me, and the Lord said, “What are you doing here? Don’t you remember what happened to you by the riverside? You may not remember it, but I do.” Then the call came, “Follow Me,” and I followed Him. I believe that, in principle, a great many of us have had this kind of experience. You were saved at the riverside by the Lamb of God, but you were called by the Sea of Galilee by the shining of a great light. Although it may be easy to forget about what happened by the riverside, you cannot forget the time the great light shined upon you by the Sea of Galilee.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LWE7nA_faKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> Although the record is very simple, the actual history is not that simple. It was not a simple matter for the Lord to call you. Firstly, He had to meet you by some riverside. Later, He had to come to you by some seashore. One day as <span class="pg" data-page-id="156" id="156">[156]</span> you were working, the room where you were sitting was enlightened, a great light shined upon you, and the Lord asked you, “What are you doing here day after day?” When this happened to certain brothers, they threw down their pen and said, “What am I doing here?” Then the Lord asked, “Don’t you remember what I did to you by the riverside? Now you must follow Me.” Do not read the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61817" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">Matthew 4</span> merely in an objective way. We must read this chapter and even the whole Bible in a subjective way, applying it to ourselves. Praise the Lord that so many of us have had the experiences at two places—by the riverside and by the seashore!</p>
<p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY6jfC9ZclV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> The new King’s ministry for the kingdom of the heavens began not with earthly power, but with heavenly light, which was the King Himself as the light of life, shining in the shadow of death. When the Lord began His ministry as light, He made no display of power and authority. He walked upon the seashore as a common person. But as He came to those four disciples by the Sea of Galilee, He shined upon them like a great light, shining in the darkness and in the region of the shadow of death. At that juncture, Peter, Andrew, James, and John were enlightened and attracted. We have pointed out that John the Baptist was a great magnet. But the Lord Jesus is the greatest magnet of all. As He shined upon those four disciples, they were attracted and captured. They immediately forsook their jobs and followed this little Nazarene.</p>

However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61820" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">Matthew 4</span>, there was the great light that attracted the first four disciples. This attraction came not from what the Lord Jesus did; it came from what He was. He was a great light, a great magnet, with the power to attract people and to capture them. In this way He attracted and captured the first four disciples. No one who follows the Lord because of what He does can be trustworthy or faithful. The trustworthy ones are those who are caught by what the Lord is. Peter, Andrew, James, and John were attracted and captured at <span class="pg" data-page-id="157" id="157">[157]</span> the seashore, not by seeing what the Lord did, but by realizing what the Lord was. Because they had been attracted and captured, they became faithful followers of the Lord Jesus unto the end.

The new King’s ministry began by the seashore and consisted of catching men who were not so religious, who lived around the sea instead of in the holy place, and making them fishers of men for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

However, after a number of years of reading the Word and considering my experience, I began to understand. Andrew, one of the two disciples of John the Baptist, had brought Peter to the Lord, in the place where John preached, prior to this (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61824" data-verses="John 1:35-36">John 1:35-36</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61825" data-verses="John 1:40-42">40-42</span>).

We should not follow the practice of either fundamental Christianity, which has very little healing, or Pentecostal Christianity, which places too much emphasis upon it, even having false healings that are mere <span class="pg" data-page-id="160" id="160">[160]</span> performances.

This was the beginning of the founding of the kingdom of the heavens. It was absolutely different from the way of the world. The Lord did not start a political movement or form a political party. He did not carry on any kind of movement. In evangelism we must not follow the way of politics or the way of religion. We must follow the way of the Lord Jesus to shine upon others and to attract them by what we are. Then we must travel, teach, preach, and heal. This will attract a crowd.</p>

The kingdom of the heavens does not correspond to any natural or religious concept. As we shall see, it refers to something very specific. To understand the kingdom of the heavens, we all must be unloaded of the traditional concepts we received from our background in Christianity. None of the teachings regarding the kingdom of the heavens received in our background was according to the pure Word. We have studied this matter of the kingdom of the heavens again and again for more than fifty years. The first book I published on this subject was put out in 1936. In all the years since then, we have been on this subject. Thus, we have the full assurance that what we have seen in the Bible concerning the kingdom of the heavens is accurate. Nevertheless, it is somewhat different from the traditional concepts concerning the kingdom. Therefore, we must spend considerable time on these chapters to see this matter very clearly.</p>

Every nation has a constitution. <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> Certainly the Gospel of Matthew, the book on the kingdom of the heavens, also must have a constitution. In these three chapters, the words spoken by the new King as the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, we see a revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens. The nature is singular, but the principles are plural. The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is composed of seven sections: the nature of the kingdom people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61849" data-verses="Matthew 5:1-12">5:1-12</span>); the influence of the kingdom people upon the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61850" data-verses="Matthew 5:13-16">5:13-16</span>); the law of the kingdom people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61851" data-verses="Matthew 5:17-48">5:17-48</span>); the righteous deeds of the kingdom people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61852" data-verses="Matthew 6:1-18">6:1-18</span>); the dealing of the kingdom people with riches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61853" data-verses="Matthew 6:19-34">6:19-34</span>); the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61854" data-verses="Matthew 7:1-12">7:1-12</span>); and the ground of the kingdom people’s living and work (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61855" data-verses="Matthew 7:13-29">7:13-29</span>). The first section, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61856" data-verses="Matthew 5:3-12">5:3-12</span>, depicts the nature of the kingdom of the heavens under nine blessings. It unfolds the kind of people who live in the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom people must also exert an influence upon the world. The nature of the kingdom people, the very nature of the kingdom, exercises an influence upon the world. The kingdom people also have a law. This law is not the old law, the law of Moses, the ten commandments; it is the new law of the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom people are those who perform righteous deeds and who have the proper attitude concerning material riches. Because the kingdom people are still on earth in human society, the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens reveals principles by which they deal with others. Finally, in the last section of this constitution we see the ground, the base, of the daily life and work of the kingdom people. All these aspects of the kingdom people are covered in the seven sections of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

This indicates that we need to go higher with Him for the realization of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GvSlFc8gsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> It is very meaningful that the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens was decreed upon a mountain. The sea signifies the Satan-corrupted world. When we were caught by the Lord, we were in the Satan-corrupted world endeavoring to make a living. But after the Lord caught us, He led us up to a high mountain signifying the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that the kingdom of the heavens was not established on the seashore, but on the mountain. In the Bible a mountain sometimes signifies the kingdom. For example, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61858" data-verses="Daniel 2:34-35">Daniel 2:34-35</span>, the stone cut without hands broke the image into pieces and became a great mountain that filled the whole earth. This mountain signifies the millennial kingdom. Hence, in the Bible a mountain signifies the kingdom, especially the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6Xrqq6H8rZ5GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> Furthermore, being brought up to the mountain signifies that if we would listen to the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, we must not stay on a low plain, but climb up a high mountain. We must be on a high level to hear this constitution. On the seashore, the Lord simply said, “Follow me.” But for the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, He brought them to the top of a mountain. Following the Lord may be rather easy, but listening to the constitution for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens requires that we climb up to the top of a high mountain.</p>

Eventually, not only the believing Jews became His disciples, but also the discipled nations (Gentiles, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61860" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">28:19</span>). Later the disciples were called Christians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61861" data-verses="Acts 11:26">Acts 11:26</span>). Hence, the word the new King spoke on the mountain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61862" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61863" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61864" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span> concerning the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens was spoken to the believers of the New Testament, not to the Jews of the Old Testament.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqGiBFL4_5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61865" data-verses="Matthew 5:1-2">verses 1 and 2</span> we see that the Lord taught the disciples, not the crowds. The crowds that gathered around Him were the outer circle, but His disciples were the inner circle. Although you may be on the mountain, you must also be in the inner circle, for the constitution is not for those in the outer circle; it is for those in the inner circle.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-lVkzzwqgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> Throughout history, there has been a great debate concerning to whom this decree was given, to the Jews, the Gentiles, or the believers. According to our study, we have come to see that it was given neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles but to the New Testament believers. There is no doubt that the disciples were the Jewish believers at the time the decree of the constitution was given. However, when they were there on the mountain listening to the decree of the kingdom’s constitution, they were the representatives not of the Jewish people, but of the New Testament believers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61866" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">28:19</span> the Lord told His disciples to go and disciple the nations, that is, the Gentiles. This means that the nations would be converted into disciples. Therefore, both the Jewish and Gentile believers were disciples. The audience on the mountain, composed mainly of Jews, represented all the disciples.</p>

Probably not many Christians have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61867" data-verses="Matthew 5:1-12">5:1-12</span> reveals the nature of the kingdom people. All Christians should be kingdom people. However, the situation today is not normal. Many believers are not on the high level of the kingdom people. The kingdom people are the overcomers. In God’s economy, every believer should be an overcomer. To be an overcomer is not to be something special; it is to be normal. Thus, every believer should be a part of the kingdom people. <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> </p>

They are poor in spirit, mourning for the present situation, meek in suffering opposition, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful toward others, pure in heart, making peace with all men, suffering persecution for righteousness, and suffering being reproached and evil spoken of. Every aspect begins with the word, “Blessed.” For instance, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61868" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">verse 3</span> says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.” The English word “blessed” does not adequately translate the Greek word here, for the Greek word conveys the meanings of both blessed and happy. A number of versions use the word happy instead of blessed. However, we should not use the word happy in a loose way. The blessedness and the happiness here is not a light thing; it is something that is rather weighty. When you hear the words, “Happy are the poor in spirit,” you should not shout or jump up and down. To be happy in these verses is something deep.</p>

The translation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61871" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">verse 3</span> in the Chinese version is very poor. It says, “Blessed are the humble in heart.” Although the scholars who worked on the Chinese version generally did a very good job, they did not see the difference between the heart and the spirit. Another verse in this chapter, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61872" data-verses="Matthew 5:8">verse 8</span>, speaks about being pure in heart. Hence, the Chinese translation speaks of the humble in heart and the pure in heart. Before we came into the church, many of us did not see the difference between the heart and the spirit. The kingdom of the heavens is firstly related to our spirit.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EEWX9VnECzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> The spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61873" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">verse 3</span> refers not to the Spirit of God, but to our human spirit, the deepest part of our being, the organ for us to contact God and realize spiritual things. To be poor <span class="pg" data-page-id="166" id="166">[166]</span> in spirit does not mean to have a poor spirit. Our spirit should never be poor. To have a poor spirit would be pitiful. But if we are poor in our spirit, we are blessed. To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble, but also to be emptied in our spirit, in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation, but unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens. We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being so that we may realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens. This implies that the kingdom of the heavens is a spiritual matter, not a material one.</p>
<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhinDpOSQ69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> We need to empty our spirit of all the old things that have filled it. Those who are the most filled in their spirit are the Moslems. There is absolutely no empty space in their spirit. For this reason, it is very difficult to talk with them about the gospel. The Devil has utterly filled their spirit. Because their spirit is so filled, it is difficult for any Moslem to believe in the Lord Jesus. The Jews also are filled in their spirit. Their spirit is fully loaded with the things of their religion. The Greeks are filled in their spirit with their philosophy. I once worked with a Greek who boasted about the Greek language and philosophy. Although the mind and spirit of the Greeks are loaded, according to my experience with them, it is rather easy for the Greeks to be unloaded. They are not nearly as stubborn as the Moslems. Today a great many Christians are also loaded in their spirit. If you talk to those in the denominations, you will find that their spirit is loaded. Nearly every kind of Christian today is filled in his spirit with something other than God.</p>

The best drink was being offered, but their vessel was already filled. Thus, they were not thirsty. When our spirit is filled, we have no capacity in our vessel for even the best drink. Therefore, when the Lord spoke to the disciples on the mountain, the opening word of His decree was <span class="pg" data-page-id="167" id="167">[167]</span> that we must be poor in spirit, that our spirit must be emptied of everything.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuapKdTqkji_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> Many years ago I visited some Brethren assemblies in this country. As I looked at the people, my heart was aching and my spirit was broken. What deadness there was! Everyone was dry. In the first place I was invited, I gave a word telling them that they did not need the teachings. I told them that they had enough teachings and that what they needed was life and the spirit. My word offended them. They did not hear my word about life and the spirit; they only heard what I had said about doctrine. Immediately after the message, the leader came to me and, rebuking me to my face, said, “Brother Lee, your teaching is certainly wrong. You have just told us that we don’t need doctrine. Certainly we need doctrine! Isn’t the Bible a book of doctrine?” I did not say a word, but I thought, “Poor people, if you like doctrine, go to doctrine and die there.” Later I was invited to speak to another Brethren assembly. Both the situation and the reaction were the same. There was such a reaction because those in these Brethren assemblies were not poor in spirit. Rather, their spirit was filled with all their so-called Brethren doctrines. All these doctrines were like dead wood that was only good for deadening them.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVCWG7l9tTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> We all need to heed the Lord’s word about being poor in our spirit and say, “Lord, unload me. Empty my spirit.

Many Christians are anxious to go to heaven, but hardly any desire to be in the kingdom of the heavens. It is a mistake to be anxious about heaven.

<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKixNwrTZy7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> The kingdom of the heavens is a specific term used by Matthew, indicating that the kingdom of the heavens differs from the kingdom of God, the term used in the other three Gospels. The kingdom of God refers to God’s reign in <span class="pg" data-page-id="168" id="168">[168]</span> a general way, from eternity past to eternity future. It comprises eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world, the paradise of Adam, the chosen patriarchs, the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the coming millennial kingdom with its heavenly rule (the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens), and the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem without end for eternity. The kingdom of the heavens is a special section within the kingdom of God, composed only of the church today and the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom. Hence, the kingdom of the heavens, a section of the kingdom of God, is also called the kingdom of God in the New Testament, especially in the other three Gospels. While the kingdom of God already existed with the nation of Israel in a general way in the Old Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61876" data-verses="Matthew 21:43">21:43</span>), the kingdom of the heavens had still not come in a specific way, but only drew near when John the Baptist came (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61877" data-verses="Matthew 3:1-2">3:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61878" data-verses="Matthew 11:11-12">11:11-12</span>).</p>

The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward contents of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed by the new King on the mountain in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61879" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61880" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61881" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span>. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed by the King on the seashore in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61882" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power, as unveiled by the King on the Mount of Olives in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61883" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapters twenty-four</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61884" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span>. Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61885" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>), which is within the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, known as Christendom. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom, which is called the kingdom of the Father in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61886" data-verses="Matthew 13:43">13:43</span>. The earthly part of the millennial kingdom will be the <span class="pg" data-page-id="169" id="169">[169]</span> Messianic kingdom, which is called the kingdom of the Son of Man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61887" data-verses="Matthew 13:41">13:41</span> and which will be the restored tabernacle of David, the kingdom of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61888" data-verses="Acts 15:16">Acts 15:16</span>). In the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom, which will be the kingdom of the heavens manifested in power, the overcoming believers will reign with Christ a thousand years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61889" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">Rev. 20:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61890" data-verses="Revelation 20:6">6</span>).

If you would understand Matthew, you must differentiate the kingdom of the heavens from the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is simply the divine ruling. It is God’s ruling from eternity past to eternity future. Thus, the kingdom of God refers to the divine government, the rule of God. Between eternity past and eternity future we have the paradise of Adam, the patriarchs, the nation of Israel, the church, and the millennium. The millennium is divided into the upper part and the lower part. The upper part is called the kingdom of the Father, and the lower part is called the kingdom of the Son of Man and the kingdom of the Messiah, which is the restored kingdom of David. Everything from the paradise of Adam to the New Jerusalem is included in the kingdom of God which extends from eternity to eternity.</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuPdulkrjkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> The kingdom of the heavens is a part of the kingdom of God, just as California is a part of the United States. Because the kingdom of the heavens is part of the kingdom of God, it is sometimes called the kingdom of God. For example, California, part of the United States, is sometimes called the United States. When someone from abroad comes to California, he may say that he has come to the United States. Although California may be called the United States, the United States <span class="pg" data-page-id="170" id="170">[170]</span> cannot be called California. Likewise, although the kingdom of the heavens may be called the kingdom of God, the kingdom of God cannot be called the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsUdKr2dthgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61892" data-verses="Matthew 21:43">Matthew 21:43</span> indicates that the kingdom of God would be taken away from Israel. For the kingdom of God to be taken away from Israel indicates that it already was with Israel. If it had not been with Israel, how could it have been taken away? Although the kingdom of God was there already, John the Baptist said, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61893" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">3:2</span>). On the one hand, the kingdom of God was there; on the other hand, the kingdom of the heavens was not yet there. Even when the Lord spoke to the Jews in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61894" data-verses="Matthew 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> regarding the kingdom of God being taken away from Israel, the kingdom of the heavens had still only drawn near. It was not until the day of Pentecost that the kingdom of the heavens came. Therefore, in the first parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61895" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, the parable of the sower, the Lord Jesus did not say, “The kingdom of the heavens is likened to a sower,” because He was already the sower before the day of Pentecost. Pentecost was the fulfillment of the second parable, the parable of the tares. Thus, in introducing that parable the Lord Jesus said, “The kingdom of the heavens was likened to....” By all this we see that the kingdom of God was already present before the kingdom of the heavens came.</p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFd45KQGQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> The kingdom of the heavens is composed of two sections. The first section is the church, and the second section is the upper part of the millennium. All genuine Christians are in the church today. But only the overcoming Christians will be in the upper part, the heavenly part, of the millennium. What we have in the church today is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, not the manifestation. The manifestation of the kingdom will not take place until the millennium. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be seen in the upper part of the millennium.</p>

(Notice that the Lord did not say, “For theirs is the kingdom of God.”) When we become poor in our spirit, we are ready to receive the heavenly King. When <span class="pg" data-page-id="171" id="171">[171]</span> He comes in, He brings the kingdom of the heavens with Him. Immediately after receiving the heavenly King, we are in the church, where the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is. If we are overcomers, at His coming back the Lord will bring us into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. To have the kingdom of the heavens is firstly to participate in the proper, normal church life and secondly to inherit the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the upper part of the millennium. This is the meaning of the words, “For theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.” Those Christians who backslide will lose the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in this age and will miss the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age. What a blessing it is to be poor in spirit! If we are poor in spirit, ours is the kingdom of the heavens. Hallelujah for the first blessing and for the kingdom of the heavens! How good it is to be poor in our spirit!</p>

Thus, the first aspect of the kingdom of the heavens covered in this chapter is related to our human spirit.</p>
<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMjtYrr6KCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> There are some very poor translations of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61898" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">verse 3</span>, such as, “Happy are the humble minded,” and “Blessed are the humble in heart.” Most Christians do not understand what the Lord Jesus was talking about when He spoke of being poor in spirit. Furthermore, they do not know that the kingdom of the heavens is altogether a matter in our spirit. If we do not know our spirit, we are through with the kingdom of the heavens because the kingdom of the heavens is related to our spirit.</p>

Those Galileans were filled with the traditional concepts of religion. Even the immoral Samaritan woman in John <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61899" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span> had a number of religious concepts. Her conversation with the Lord Jesus exposed this fact. If even such a woman of low class was filled with religious concepts, certainly the Galilean fishermen were filled also. Three times a year they went up to Jerusalem for the feasts and stayed each time for at least a week. This one fact shows you that the Galilean fishermen were not empty <span class="pg" data-page-id="174" id="174">[174]</span> vessels. During the time the Lord Jesus was on earth, all the people, whether they were Jews or Romans or Greeks, were filled up. The Jews were filled with their traditional religious concepts, with their scriptural knowledge, and with the teachings of the law. They knew all about the holy city, the holy temple, and the sacred system of priestly service. They knew about the altar, the sacrifices, the festivals, the ordinances, and the regulations, all of which they considered outward blessings. There is no need to mention the Greeks and the Romans, for even the Jews that stood in front of the Lord Jesus were filled with their traditional concepts.</p>

With the coming of the new King, God began a new economy. God’s new dispensation is involved with a wonderful Person. Speaking figuratively, this new economy is simply this Person. Do not consider the kingdom of the heavens as something apart from Christ. No, it is Christ Himself. Without the King, we could not have the kingdom. We cannot have the kingdom of the heavens without Christ. When the Pharisees asked the Lord Jesus when the kingdom of God would come, He replied, “Behold, the kingdom of God is among you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61900" data-verses="Luke 17:21">Luke 17:21</span>). The Lord’s word to the Pharisees indicated that He Himself was the kingdom. Where Jesus is, there the kingdom is also. The kingdom is simply the Person of the King. Therefore, when we have the King, we also have the kingdom.</p>

No doubt these four were attracted to him. Eventually, they met the Lord Jesus and were saved there by the riverside of the Jordan. The Lord Jesus was baptized in the Jordan, as were these four disciples, and He was anointed there. Following the anointing of the Lord Jesus, there was a period of forty days when He was tested. Those forty days were also a test to these four newly saved disciples. The Lord Jesus passed the test, but the disciples failed it, forgetting their experience of <span class="pg" data-page-id="175" id="175">[175]</span> salvation by the riverside of Jordan and returning to the Sea of Galilee to make a living. Two carried on the work of fishing, and two the work of mending the nets. The fact that they returned to the Sea of Galilee to fish and to mend the nets proves that they had been defeated. Although they had been saved, they returned to their old situation. Hence, they were failures.</p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoMywK7_Vsw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> The new King was led into the wilderness where He gained the victory over the enemy. After winning the battle against Satan, the new King came to the Sea of Galilee, much to the surprise of Peter, Andrew, James, and John. There by the Sea of Galilee the Lord Jesus contacted them the second time. As we saw in message twelve, the first time these four disciples were brought to the Lord, they saw Him as the Lamb of God. But the second time, the Lord paid them a gracious visitation as the great light. The Bible is very economical in its description of the calling of these four disciples. Peter and Andrew were fishing, and James and John were mending their nets. Suddenly, the One whom they had met more than forty days before appeared as a great light shining upon them. They realized that this was the Lamb of God, and they were attracted to Him. However, this time the Lamb of God was the great light shining upon them. After shining upon them, the new King said, “Follow Me,” and these four disciples followed Him. Eventually, these four influenced others to follow the Lord Jesus, and crowds were drawn to Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCIuNpkFb4qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> When the Lord Jesus went up to the top of the mountain, His disciples came to Him to be the inner circle, the direct audience, for the decree of the new King. The first thing He said was, “Blessed are the poor in spirit.” This word was the continuation of the Lord’s preaching in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61901" data-verses="Matthew 4:17">4:17</span>, where He had said, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” In His preaching the Lord dealt with the mind, the thoughts. He seemed to be saying, “You must repent. You must have a change in your thinking, in your mentality. Your mind needs to be turned.” Undoubtedly Peter, Andrew, James, and John all had a genuine turn in their <span class="pg" data-page-id="176" id="176">[176]</span> understanding. By the time they were in the inner circle to be the direct audience for the decree of the new King, there was no problem concerning their mind. Their thinking had already undergone a change.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rVHVsTgQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> Turning our mind provides a gateway for us to enter into the kingdom and for the kingdom to enter into us. The mind is neither the receiver nor the inner chamber; it is the gateway. The receiver, the inner chamber, is our spirit. Thus, our mind is the gateway, and our spirit is the inner chamber. We must put the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61902" data-verses="Matthew 4:17">4:17</span>, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,” with His word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61903" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">5:3</span>, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.” The mind that has turned is the gateway through which the kingdom of the heavens comes into us. When the kingdom comes in, it is implanted in our spirit. It enters through the gateway of our mind and it arrives at our spirit. It is our spirit, not our mind, that receives the kingdom and retains it. Therefore, our spirit is the receiver and container of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePF2NgWSwGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> In their preaching, those evangelists who know the secret of the gospel firstly deal with people’s mind. Then they proceed to deal with their spirit. The preaching of the gospel must deal with people’s mind, with their way of thinking. This is to cause them to repent, to have a turn in their thinking and way of life. As soon as someone has repented, the proper preacher of the gospel will ask him to pray and to call on the name of the Lord. This is not the dealing with the mind, but the dealing with the spirit. After a person exercises his spirit to pray and to call on the name of the Lord, the Lord will immediately come into his spirit, passing through the gateway of the mind and arriving at his spirit.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvT2dgp5vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> The very Lord Jesus, who has entered our spirit through our mind, is the king. The kingdom is with Him. When the King enters someone’s spirit, this means that the kingdom also enters into his spirit. From that time onward, both the King and the kingdom remain in his spirit. In the teaching of today’s degraded Christianity, very few point out that the Christ who enters into our spirit is the very King with <span class="pg" data-page-id="177" id="177">[177]</span> the kingdom. When He comes into your spirit, the kingdom arrives with Him. Now in our spirit not only do we have the Savior; we also have the King with the kingdom.</p>

However, now we must also see that whenever we say that the Lord Jesus is with our spirit, it means that the kingdom is with our spirit. This Lord Jesus is not only the Savior and the life, but also the King with the kingdom. Today we may declare, “In my spirit I have the Savior, the life, the King, and the kingdom!” When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus as the Savior, the life, and the King with the kingdom, He entered our spirit and was implanted there. Therefore, in our spirit we now have the Savior, the life, and the King with the kingdom. We received such a One into us by being repentant in our mind and poor in spirit.</p>
<p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY6i_C-Z8lV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> When I was walking in my fallen condition far away from God, I was filled with philosophy and religion. Not only was I walking in the wrong direction, but I was also filled with worthless concepts and thoughts. When I heard the preaching of the gospel, I had a turn in my mind; my mind was changed. Nevertheless, I was still full of many philosophical and religious concepts. Thus, I not only needed to have a turn in my mind, but also to become poor in spirit. To be poor in our spirit is to empty our spirit. It is to open up from the depths of our being and to be unloaded of all other things so that the Lord Jesus may be able to enter our spirit. When He came into me, He came as the King with the kingdom. Therefore, if you are poor in spirit, yours is the kingdom of the heavens. Although you may have made an about-face in your life and you may now be standing face to face with the Lord, what about your spirit? Is your spirit open to Him, or is it filled with other things? Are you still filled with philosophical and religious concepts? The Greeks may be filled with the philosophy of Plato, the Chinese with the teachings of Confucius, and the Jews with the teachings of Moses. For the King with the kingdom to come into you, <span class="pg" data-page-id="178" id="178">[178]</span> you must be poor in your spirit. This means that you must open up from the depths of your being and cast out all the concepts, opinions, and thoughts that have been filling you. When you have emptied your spirit, the King with the kingdom will come into you. Then yours is the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

It is not future tense, but present tense. This verse does not say, “Theirs will be the kingdom of the heavens”; it says, “Theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.” When you open from the depths of your being, that is, from your spirit, and unload yourself and empty your spirit, the King as the life-giving Spirit will enter in through the gateway of your repentant mind and come into your spirit to be your King with the kingdom. From then on, the kingdom is within you, and the kingdom of the heavens is yours. This is salvation according to the New Testament.</p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzmkttLfcsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> However, today’s degraded Christianity has missed this. When you received the Lord Jesus, did you realize that a kind of ruling had come into you? This ruling is the reigning of the kingdom. We have not only the Savior and the life, but also the King. This King exercises His authority from within our spirit. Even if you were just saved today, you already have this kingdom within you. Although I was saved more than fifty years ago, I do not have anything more than someone who has just been saved. The One within us is our Savior, our life, and our King with the kingdom. How rich and how high He is! Because we have received Him into our spirit, ours is the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom is ours, and the kingdom is in our spirit.</p>

The word, “is” in this verse proves that the kingdom of the heavens is ours right now. How blessed <span class="pg" data-page-id="179" id="179">[179]</span> we are! How blessed it is to be poor in spirit! If we are poor in spirit, ours is the kingdom of the heavens. If you take this word into you, you will never be the same.

However, if we pray for a certain period of time, with a spirit filled with the King and the kingdom, we shall begin to mourn over the negative situation of today. The entire situation of the world is negative in relation to God’s economy. Satan, sin, self, darkness, and worldliness predominate among all people on earth. God’s glory is insulted, Christ is rejected, the Holy Spirit is frustrated, the church is desolated, self is corrupted, and the whole world is evil. Hence, God wants us to mourn over such a situation. Because the kingdom is in us, we are subdued, controlled, and ruled by the indwelling King. If, while we are under this rule, we look at the environment and the situation of today’s world, we shall sigh and mourn.</p>
<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbYxtaEZZQZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> This mourning, however, is a blessing, for the Lord said that those who mourn “shall be comforted.” If we mourn according to God and His economy, we shall be comforted by being rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens. We shall see God’s heavenly ruling over all the negative situation. Many times I have had the experience of mourning and being comforted. Do not be disappointed. We must mourn, yet we are filled with hope. The King is coming, the enemy will be defeated, and the earth will be regained by Christ. Sooner or later, we shall be comforted. Is it not a comfort to see so many in the Lord’s recovery seeking the Lord and His kingdom? What a comfort this is to me! If you have never <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> experienced mourning in your spirit, then you cannot realize how sweet and comforting it is to see so many who care only for the Lord’s kingdom.

Following this, we have a word about the meek. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61908" data-verses="Matthew 5:5">Verse 5</span> says, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.” Some translators have said that the Greek word rendered “earth” should be “land.” But whether we translate this as earth or land, it refers to the coming subdued world.

Many Christians do not understand what it means to be meek. It does not mean simply to be gentle, humble, and submissive. To be meek means not to resist the world’s opposition, but to suffer it willingly. To be meek means not to fight or to resist. If we are meek, willing to suffer the world’s opposition in this age, we shall inherit the earth in the coming age, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61916" data-verses="Hebrews 2:5-8">Hebrews 2:5-8</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61917" data-verses="Luke 19:17">Luke 19:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61918" data-verses="Luke 19:19">19</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMjtYrvpKCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> Today, those who fight are those who gain the land. If you do not fight, you will not receive any territory. This is the reason there are so many wars. Nations wage war with one another to gain more territory for themselves. The human way is to obtain the land by fighting for it, but the way of the kingdom of the heavens is to gain it by being meek. There is no need to fight, but there is the need to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="181" id="181">[181]</span> meek. Some of the young people have been shouting slogans about taking the earth. The way to take the earth is not by slogans, shouting, or fighting. The way is through meekness. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Are you a fighting one or a meek one? If you would inherit the earth, you must be meek. When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will regain the earth. However, when He was arrested, tried, and crucified at Golgotha, He was meek. As He was nailed to the cross, He did not resist. In every way He was meek, meek to the very end. Eventually, the earth will be gained not by the fighting ones, but by the meek ones. Several weeks ago an opposer told one of our brothers, “We are going to stop you!” Time will tell who will be stopped. The fighting ones will be stopped, but the meek ones will not be stopped. Rather, they will inherit the earth. Satan is always fighting, but the Lord Jesus never fights. Instead, He is meek. In this we see that the economy of God is opposite to the economy of man. If you want to gain the earth, you should be meek. If you have not received any territory, this may indicate that you are not yet meek enough. Young people, you must be meek on the campuses. I realize that this is a heavenly language. But the Lord Jesus did not say, “Blessed are those who fight, for they shall gain the earth. The fighters shall take the earth!” Do not say, “Let’s take the earth by fighting for it.” No, you must say instead, “Let’s take the earth by being meek.” You may think that meekness is related to material things. However, if you consider the matter carefully, you will see that meekness is not related to outward material things. Rather, it is related to something inward, to what we are in our very being.</p>

On the one hand, the kingdom of the heavens is ours; on the other hand, we shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens. If we are poor in our spirit, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is ours today. But we still need to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Remember the two aspects of the kingdom of the heavens: the reality in the church today and the manifestation in the upper part of the millennium in the future. If we are truly poor in our spirit, seeking after Christ, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is ours. Then at the time of the millennium we shall enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. However, in order to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens we need the surpassing righteousness, the righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees. We need to hunger and thirst for this righteousness, to seek after such righteousness, that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61927" data-verses="Matthew 5:6">vv. 6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61928" data-verses="Matthew 5:10">10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61929" data-verses="Matthew 5:20">20</span>).

<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCZbIPbAmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> Righteousness is to be right not only with God, but also with man. The righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees was rather low because it was the righteousness according to the law. Our righteousness must not be according to the old law, but according to the new law. As we shall see, the new law is much higher than the old. The old law says, “You shall not murder.” But the new law says, “Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61930" data-verses="Matthew 5:22">v. 22</span>). By this one example we see that our righteousness must be on a higher <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> level than the righteousness of the Pharisees. We must take care not only of not murdering, but even of not being angry with our brother. This righteousness is on the highest plane.</p>

I’ll just have to quit,” But the more I have grown, the more I have come to realize that I can make it because I have a life within me that can do it. The King with His kingdom within me can make it. However, this King needs our cooperation. We cooperate by being hungry and thirsty. We cooperate by saying, “O Lord Jesus, I hunger and thirst after You. Lord, I want to be filled with You.” If you hunger and thirst in this way, you will be satisfied.</p>

If we are diligent to seek the surpassing righteousness, we shall eventually become merciful toward others. In our seeking we shall find that our natural man is weak and that we are prone to failure. If you do not realize the pitiful condition of your natural man, you will never have mercy on others. Instead of showing mercy to them, you will condemn them when they fail or fall. The reason you condemn them is that you do not know yourself. If you know yourself, whenever someone fails, you will say, “Lord, have mercy on me and on my brother. We all are weak vessels and cannot fulfill Your requirements. Lord, even though my brother has offended me, I would still be merciful toward him.” If you have never failed, you will never be merciful. If you are always successful in your pursuit of holiness and perfection, you will have no sympathy toward others when they fail. You will always condemn them. But if you know how weak you are and how many mistakes you have made, you will be merciful to others.</p>

Because you judge others unmercifully, Christ will judge you unmercifully. But if you have mercy on your brother, the Lord will have mercy on you at His judgment seat. Thus, the kingdom people are strict in dealing with themselves, but very merciful in dealing with others. Once again, this is not an outward matter, but a matter related to our inward being.</p>

But toward God we must be pure in heart, seeking nothing besides Him. The reward for being pure in heart is to see God. God is our <span class="pg" data-page-id="185" id="185">[185]</span> reward.

The kind of people we are depends upon our nature. Every aspect of these nine blessings deals mainly with our inward being, not with outward material things. Along with our inward being, these verses also deal somewhat with the outward expression. Take the example of righteousness. If you read these verses carefully, you will see that righteousness here is not merely a matter of outward behavior. Rather, it is the outflow of our inner being, the expression of what we are within. Thus, the first section of the constitution (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61960" data-verses="Matthew 5:1-12">5:1-12</span>) deals with the inward being of the kingdom people.</p>

These <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> words reveal what kind of people the kingdom people should be. They should always be poor in spirit, mournful over the present situation, meek in facing opposition, righteous toward themselves, merciful toward others, pure toward God, peaceful toward all men, persecuted for righteousness, and reproached for the sake of Christ. The totality of these nine words is the nature of the kingdom people.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85wwyR2Yn2Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw">POOR IN SPIRIT AND MOURNING</h2><p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy5ouK19nw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> The sequence of these verses is very significant. Firstly we must be poor in spirit, and then we can mourn. If we are not poor in our spirit, we do not have the capacity for the King to come in to establish His kingdom within our being. If we do not have the heavenly kingdom established within us, we cannot realize how negative and pitiful the whole world is. However, when the Lord Jesus is able to set up His kingdom within us and when the full capacity of our whole being, even the depths of our being, our spirit, is available to Him, we shall realize that the earth is dark, corrupt, and filled with sin. Spontaneously we shall mourn for this sad situation. For this reason, the Lord Jesus did not speak first of mourning and then of being poor in spirit. He put the matter of being poor in our spirit first. Only when we are poor in spirit can we mourn.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM6Xl8nKmElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d">MOURNING AND MEEKNESS</h2><p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfOx2ITpb7ftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> If we are poor in spirit and mourn for the pitiful situation of others, spontaneously we shall be meek. Even if your mother-in-law is in a pitiful condition, do not tell her so. Even the condition of your dear wife may not be very positive in the eyes of the Lord. If her heart and her interests are not for the Lord, and she does not care for the Lord’s kingdom, her situation is pitiful. You have the Lord Jesus with the heavenly kingdom in your spirit, but what about your wife? You may be in the highest heaven, but she may be in the lowest hell. Furthermore, consider your children. You may love the Lord to the uttermost, but they may not love Him at all. Therefore, you must mourn for your mother-in-law, your <span class="pg" data-page-id="191" id="191">[191]</span> wife, and your children. You must also mourn for your relatives, your colleagues, and your neighbors. Where is one who is truly for the Lord? Look at the deplorable condition of the world today, including that of Christianity. The merchants care only for money, the students care only for their education, and the working people care only for promotions and positions. When we are poor in spirit, we shall surely mourn for the whole situation. We shall mourn for our environment and for the people around us.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EEX39WmkCzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> Because we mourn for others, we would never fight against them. Instead of fighting them, spontaneously we shall be meek toward them. If you are not yet meek with your wife, it reveals that you have not been possessed by the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that other things are still occupying you. If you have been fully occupied within by the heavenly kingdom, you will mourn for your wife and be meek with her. You will be meek toward every pitiful person. If you are a student, you will be meek toward your teachers and classmates. You will be meek toward others because you have a deep feeling within about their pitiful situation. Because you have been praying for them in the way of mourning, whenever you contact them, you will be meek.</p>

The New Testament tells us that we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against the Devil, against the enemy of God. We must fight against the Devil, God’s enemy, day and night. However, we are not to fight against people, not even against those who oppose us. Toward all men, including the adversaries and opposers, we must be meek. Although we fight Satan and the principalities in the air, we do not fight people. Instead, we love them all. Young people, do not go to the campuses to fight with the students. Never say, “We shall defeat the students and take the earth!” Do not go to the campuses to fight—go there to be meek. We need to be so meek that, even if a persecutor hits us on the right cheek, we would turn to him the left cheek. To be meek means not <span class="pg" data-page-id="192" id="192">[192]</span> to resist or to fight back. However, as we turn our left cheek to the persecutor, we should pray, “Lord, bind the powers of darkness!” While we are being meek toward other people, we must fight against the powers of darkness. The enemy is not the people; it is Satan and his angels, the evil powers in the air.</p>

We ourselves must be right with everyone. We must be right with our parents, our husband or wife, our children, our in-laws, our relatives, and our neighbors. The people of the heavenly kingdom are righteous in this way. Do not think that, if we are mournful and meek, we can afford to be loose. No, we must hunger and thirst for the highest righteousness.</p>

It is wrong for any Christian to place demands on others. If you are truly strict with yourself, then you will know how to be merciful to others. But do not try to be merciful to others without first being righteous with yourself. Every sloppy person is merciful to others because he has already been merciful to himself. If he sleeps late every morning, he will be very merciful to others who sleep late. This kind of mercy is not mercy at all; it is absolutely wrong. No one who is sloppy knows how to be merciful to others. Only a strict person, a righteous person, knows how to be merciful. If you would be merciful to others according to the fifth blessing, you must first be righteous toward yourself according to the fourth blessing.</p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAQj0cV3MzKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> We must be righteous and strict with ourselves, never making excuses for ourselves. But when others offend us, thereby exposing their shortage, we must be merciful toward <span class="pg" data-page-id="193" id="193">[193]</span> them. All those who are self-righteous condemn others and never let them go. The word spoken by the Lord on the mount is completely different from this. To ourselves, we must be righteous and strict, serious and sober. But toward others we must be merciful. In Himself God is righteous. However, if He were righteous to the uttermost in dealing with us, we would all be killed. Although God is righteous in relation to Himself, He is full of mercy in dealing with us. As fallen sinners, we surely need God’s mercy. We also must learn to be righteous with ourselves, and merciful toward others. This matter of being righteous toward ourselves and merciful toward others is not firstly a matter of outward behavior; it is firstly a matter of our inward attitude, of our inward being.</p>

Suppose everyone is supposed to be home by a certain time. To come home later than that time is not righteous. Likewise, it is not right to inconvenience others. However, when some young people come home, they like to throw their shoes anywhere they please. I knew of one co-worker, a preacher and teacher of the Bible, who used to throw his socks without any concern for where they landed around the room. One time this brother and I were guests in a certain home. The hostess, quite concerned, spoke to me about this brother’s sloppiness. What a shame that was to me! Some of the brothers living in the brothers’ houses may act the same way.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYPVFHrFx6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> Other brothers may be unhappy about being required to wash dishes; therefore, they may not clean them thoroughly. This is not righteous. It is never righteous to take advantage of others, to invade their rights. Not doing an adequate job in washing dishes is taking advantage of others. If you are such a one, you are not a righteous person. If you are a leader in the brothers’ house, you must be strict with yourself about the time, about excessive talking, about noise, about washing dishes, and about many other things. Do not say this is too much. It may seem too much to you, but it is <span class="pg" data-page-id="194" id="194">[194]</span> not too much to Christ who lives within you. In everything you do, you must be strict with yourself.</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuPcOllqDkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> However, as one taking the lead in the brothers’ house or in any aspect of the church life, you must also be merciful. Sometimes a leader may warn a sloppy one about his dishwashing, saying, “This is your first warning about the way you wash the dishes. After two more warnings, you will have to move out.” Remember the word of the Lord Jesus about how many times you must forgive your brother (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61961" data-verses="Matthew 18:21-22">18:21-22</span>). Even if a certain brother does not clean the dishes thoroughly after you have spoken to him a number of times, you must still be merciful to him. Do not drive away even such a sloppy and pitiful brother. Instead, be merciful to him. This does not mean that you go to the opposite extreme and say, “I have learned that I must be merciful toward this brother. Therefore, from now on, I will never talk to him about the way he does the dishes. Let him do the dishes any way he wants. We’ll just have to tolerate it in order to keep him.” This attitude is not right either. You need to take care of such a sloppy brother day after day. Let him have a turn at washing the dishes. But each time he does so, you must be patient and merciful toward him.</p>
<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsUcqr3cNhgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> It is easy for us to be either strict or sloppy. But we must learn to be strict on the one hand and merciful on the other. If we give others a strict dealing, we must immediately be merciful toward them. This is an important lesson for elders to learn. The kingdom people are both righteous and merciful. When you are righteous, you must be absolutely righteous; and when you are merciful, you must be very merciful. Although righteousness and mercy are two opposite poles, they must meet in your experience. Your righteousness must come together with your mercy.</p>

This also corresponds to our experience. If you are <span class="pg" data-page-id="195" id="195">[195]</span> not righteous with yourself and merciful to others, you will find it difficult to be pure in heart toward God. In order to be pure in heart toward God, you must be strict in dealing with yourself and merciful in dealing with others. As far as logic is concerned, there seems to be no reason for this. But our practical experience proves that it is so. If you are not right with yourself and merciful with others, you will never be pure with God. I believe that at least some of those among us in the churches have the experience of what I am speaking about here. Throughout the years, we have learned the lesson of being strict with ourselves and of not making excuses for ourselves. But we have also learned to be merciful to others, especially to those who are weaker. As a result, our heart is pure in seeking God. When we are righteous with ourselves and merciful with others, we see God. But when we are loose with ourselves and condemn others, our eyes are absolutely blind, and we cannot see God. If you excuse yourself, yet make demands of others, your heart is not pure. A pure heart toward God comes only from strict dealings with yourself and merciful dealings with others.</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I7W4604Zx2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> Even in the churches, a number of saints always excuse themselves and place demands on others. For example, they may excuse their sleeping late in the morning by saying that last night they received a long distance call. But if they hear that a certain brother did not come to morning watch, they would say, “Why didn’t he come? As a leader in the brothers’ house, he should rise up early in the morning.” The eyes of such a person are blind, indicating that his heart is not pure. We must be strict toward ourselves and merciful toward others. If others are loose, idle, or sloppy, we may have to warn them in a proper way. Nevertheless, we must still be merciful toward them. No matter how strict we may need to be at times in dealing with others, mercy must still be shown to them. If we are strict with ourselves and merciful to others, we shall have a pure heart, a heart single toward God. The reward of having a pure heart is seeing <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> God. I can assure you that if you will practice being strict with yourself and merciful with others, you will see God.</p>

Those who are strict with themselves, merciful to others, and pure toward God are peacemakers. They do not like to offend, hurt, or damage anyone. Rather, they like to make peace with everyone. To be a peacemaker does not mean to be political. To be political is falsehood and hypocrisy. We must be righteously square, not politically round. Remember, the New Jerusalem is square, not round. We Christians must be like this. Although we are righteously square, we are still merciful toward others. This enables us to be pure toward God and to see Him. If we are such a person, spontaneously we shall be peacemakers. Instead of fighting with others and hurting them, we shall always maintain peace with those with whom we are involved. This is what it means to be a peacemaker.</p>

That is politics. Our peace must issue out of our nature. We have a nature that makes us strict with ourselves, merciful with others, and pure with God. Because we have this nature, we spontaneously keep the peace with others. This is not political peacemaking; it is the spontaneous issue of our nature. This will cause others to say, “These are truly the sons of God.”</p>

The eighth blessing concerns the persecution for righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61964" data-verses="Matthew 5:10">v. 10</span>), and the ninth, the persecution for Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61965" data-verses="Matthew 5:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). Why would others persecute us for righteousness and for Christ? Simply because we are poor in spirit, concerned for the negative situation of today’s world and mourning about it, meek toward attackers and opposers, righteous with ourselves, merciful toward others, pure with God, and making peace with all. Therefore, the evil society will not agree with us. Because we desire to be righteous, they will persecute us for the sake of righteousness. Because we want to be truthfully and honestly right, they will persecute us.</p>

Suffering for the sake of righteousness is a condition for participation in the kingdom of the heavens. If we do not remain in righteousness, we are outside the kingdom. But if we stay in righteousness, we are in the kingdom because the kingdom is absolutely a matter of righteousness. In the kingdom there is nothing wrong, unjust, or dark; everything is righteous and light. This is the nature of the kingdom. When we are poor in spirit, the kingdom of the heavens comes into us. But when we stay in righteousness, the kingdom of the heavens remains in us. In both cases, ours is the kingdom of the heavens. If we would receive the kingdom of the heavens, we must be poor in our spirit, and if we would have the kingdom of the heavens remain in us, we must stay in righteousness. But if you would stay in righteousness, be prepared to confront persecution. You will be persecuted for the sake of righteousness.</p>

If we have Christ, we have the kingdom of the heavens. But if we do not have Him, we do not have the kingdom of the heavens. Thus, the real blessing is Christ with His kingdom. In order to share this blessing, we need to be poor in spirit, mournful over the negative situation, meek in facing opposition, righteous with ourselves, merciful to others, pure in heart toward God, making peace with all, suffering persecution for righteousness, and suffering reproach for Christ. This is the nature of the kingdom people. Eventually, the kingdom people are the very reality of the kingdom. This is the kingdom, which is the church life today. The church today is the reality of the kingdom.</p>

The kingdom people are salt to the corrupted earth and light to the darkened world.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85wwyRGYgk42_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw">III. CONCERNING THE INFLUENCE<br/>OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE UPON THE WORLD</h2><p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy5oeKzvXw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> After revealing the nature of the kingdom people, this decree goes on to cover their influence. The sequence here is significant. If the kingdom people did not have the nature described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61967" data-verses="Matthew 5:3-12">5:3-12</span>, they could not have any influence on the world. The influence of the kingdom people comes out of their nature, out of what they are. If we, the kingdom people, the church people, are poor in our spirit, the kingdom of the heavens will have room within the depths of our being. Then we shall mourn, be meek, hunger and thirst for righteousness, be merciful, be pure in heart, be peacemakers, suffer persecution, and be reproached for Christ. If we are such people, we shall certainly exercise a great influence upon the worldly people around us. We shall spontaneously influence the corrupted earth and the darkened world.</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM6XV8uYmElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> Because the influence of the proper church life is lacking, the whole world is corrupt and in darkness. If you travel throughout the world, studying and observing the <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> situation in various countries, you will see that two of the worst places are France and Sweden, countries without the influence of the proper church life. Moreover, due to the predominance of Catholicism, in Central America and South America there is nothing but darkness. Wherever Catholicism prevails, there is darkness and corruption. Today, as a preparation for the Lord’s coming back, there is the urgent need for all these dark and corrupted countries to be brought under the influence of the proper church life.</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfOx24ThJrftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61968" data-verses="Matthew 5:13">verse 13</span> the Lord said, “You are the salt of the earth,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61969" data-verses="Matthew 5:14">verse 14</span> He said, “You are the light of the world.” According to the Greek text, the pronoun here is plural. The “you” in these two verses does not refer to an individual, but to a corporate people. Most readers apply these verses to individuals. Those who have the nine blessings spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61970" data-verses="Matthew 5:3-12">verses 3 through 12</span> are a corporate people, not individuals. Therefore, the Lord’s word about salt and light does not concern individuals. Individually, none of us can be proper salt or proper light. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61971" data-verses="Matthew 5:14">verse 14</span> the Lord likens us to a city, not to individual stones. This clearly reveals that the Lord’s word here is not intended for individuals, but for a corporate people built together on a high level. The Lord did not say, “You are the lights of the world.” He said, “You are the light of the world.” The plural “you” is just one light.</p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzmkNtLdcsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> Do not consider the influence of the kingdom people upon the world an individual matter. If you try to be individually spiritual, you will not succeed. Even if you attain some individual spirituality, it will be a cancer. All individualistic spirituality is a cancer that absorbs into itself the nourishment intended for the whole Body. Cancer is not caused by germs; it is caused by cells in the body that separate from the body and care only for themselves. If you attempt to be individualistically spiritual, you will become a cancer. We all need to hear this word of warning.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFBAlm27HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> During the past twenty-five years, I have come to see that spirituality is not an individualistic matter; it is absolutely a corporate matter. Take the example of physical health. The health of our body is not a matter of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="201" id="201">[201]</span> individual members; it is a corporate matter. We do not say that our ears are healthy, but that our body is healthy. If your ears are not healthy, then your body must not be healthy either. Thus, health is a matter of the whole body.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYFuOp0S2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> When I was young, I took the Lord’s word in these verses about salt and light in an individualistic way, thinking that I personally was to be the salt and the light. But now I see that being salt is a corporate matter. We need to be impressed with the fact it is as a corporate entity that the kingdom people are salt and light. If we separate ourselves from the church life, we can no longer be salt or light.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUsUWDQq80trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> Both the salt and the light refer to the corporate people of the kingdom. Today the church people are the kingdom people. Concerning discipline and exercise, we are the kingdom people. But concerning life and grace, we are the church people. In these verses it is a matter of exercise and discipline; hence it concerns the kingdom people. The kingdom people as a whole, as a corporate body, are salt and light.</p>
<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbYxt6EaYwZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61972" data-verses="Matthew 5:13">verse 13</span> the Lord speaks of the earth, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61973" data-verses="Matthew 5:14">verse 14</span> He speaks of the world. There is a difference between the earth and the world; the terms are not synonymous. What was created by God is the earth, and what came in through the corruption of Satan is the world. To the God-created earth, the kingdom people are salt. But to the Satan-corrupted world, they are light. We are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.</p>

<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEAtnpu7irHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> When we say that we are salt, it means that we exercise our influence over the earth created by God to keep it in its original condition. The earth, which was created by God, has become fallen. In a sense, it has become rotten and corrupted. Salt kills the germs and eliminates this rottenness. Any medical doctor can tell you that salt kills germs, eliminates rottenness, and preserves things in their original condition. By nature, salt is an element that kills the germs <span class="pg" data-page-id="202" id="202">[202]</span> of corruption and eliminates them. Thus, through its killing and preserving function, salt brings the earth back to its original condition or keeps it in its original condition. Hence, the function of salt is to preserve what God has created. The entire earth is becoming more and more rotten. Therefore, we must exercise our influence over this corrupted earth. To the corrupted earth, the people of the kingdom of the heavens are the element that keeps the earth from being fully corrupted.</p>

The Possibility of Becoming Tasteless</h2><p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz_EocIJxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61974" data-verses="Matthew 5:13">verse 13</span> the Lord said, “But if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything but to be cast out and trampled under foot by men.” For the kingdom people to become tasteless means that they have lost their salting function. They have become the same as the earthly people, with nothing to distinguish them from unbelievers. To become tasteless is to lose the distinction between us and the worldly people. It is to become the same as the worldly ones. Being the same as the worldly people is the opposite of the nature revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61975" data-verses="Matthew 5:3-12">verses 3 through 12</span>. It means that we are no longer poor in spirit, mourning for the negative situation, meek, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful, pure in seeking God, making peace, willing to be persecuted for the sake of righteousness, and willing to be reproached for Christ. It means that we live, walk, and behave like the worldly people. If such is our case, we become tasteless, and the salt has lost its function.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxCgVGKfL68vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> Lot’s wife is an illustration of this (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61976" data-verses="Genesis 19:26">Gen. 19:26</span>). She became a pillar of salt, which indicates salt that has lost its function. When salt becomes a pillar, it cannot function, mainly because it has lost its taste. The fact that Lot’s wife became a pillar of salt is a strong warning to us not to lose the distinction between us and the world. We should never lose our taste, but maintain the salting function of killing germs, of eliminating rottenness, and of keeping things in their original condition or of bringing them back to their God-created condition. <span class="pg" data-page-id="203" id="203">[203]</span> </p>

In our neighborhoods we must exercise our function of killing germs. But if we become the same as the worldly people, we lose our function and our taste. Because we have lost our taste, we no longer have the salting ability and we cannot fulfill our salting function. If we have the nature of the kingdom people revealed in the nine blessings, we shall be truly salty. We shall be salt to our relatives and in-laws. If we are poor in spirit, mourning, meek, righteous, merciful, and pure in seeking God, we shall have a salting function. There will be no need to rebuke others or to point out their mistakes and wrongdoings. They will be salted simply by our presence. Sometimes certain evil ones will stay away from us because we are so salty. This is what it means to kill the germs of this rotten earth.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCZboPaAGmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> The Lord’s intention is to bring this earth back to its original condition.

This work will be done by the kingdom people.</p>

To be cast out is to be put away from the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61978" data-verses="Luke 14:35">Luke 14:35</span>).

In nature they are the healing salt, and in behavior they are the shining light. <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn-eAbTw5z3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> As the shining light, the kingdom people are like a city situated upon a mountain. Such a city cannot be hidden. This is ultimately consummated in the holy city of the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61980" data-verses="Revelation 21:10-11">Rev. 21:10-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61981" data-verses="Revelation 21:23-24">23-24</span>). For many years I was troubled by the Lord’s illustration of a city situated upon a mountain. Until I came into the church life, I could not understand how light could be illustrated by a builded city. After I was in the practical building of the church, I saw that only by being built together can the kingdom people be a city situated on a mountain. This city becomes a shining light. In Anaheim the saints are grouping together in their neighborhoods. If this practice becomes prevailing and the saints in these groups are built together, every group will be part of the shining city situated on a mountaintop.</p>
<p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wJ5Mev9vlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> In these three chapters the Lord Jesus did not use the term “church.” However, the term “kingdom,” used many times in these chapters, actually refers to the church. The kingdom mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61982" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61983" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">6</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61984" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">7</span> is that aspect of the church concerned with discipline and exercise. The church is the aspect of grace and life for the kingdom, and the kingdom is the aspect of discipline and exercise for the church. Therefore, the Lord’s word in these chapters regarding the kingdom actually refers to the exercise and discipline in the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLdiReVADfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> As we have seen, many Christians understand these chapters in an individualistic way. Most have not seen that this constitution is not for individuals, but for a corporate people. We know that this decree is for a corporate people, because the light is not an individual person, but a builded city. This indicates that the kingdom people need the building. If the saints in the church in your locality are not built up, but are scattered, divided, and separated, there is no city there. And as long as there is no city, there is no light, because the light is the city; the light is not an individual believer. The light is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it. It is impossible to find such a thing in today’s Christianity. But every local church in the Lord’s recovery must be a builded city. <span class="pg" data-page-id="205" id="205">[205]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0i158kiHs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> In the book of Revelation the churches are golden lampstands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61985" data-verses="Revelation 1:20">Rev. 1:20</span>). The principle of the city and the lampstand is the same: neither is individual. Both are corporate. The lampstand, like the city, is not an individual believer, but the church. If you are outside the church, you are not a part of the lampstand. In order to be part of the lampstand, you must be built into the local church. The local church, which is the lampstand, is likened by the Lord to a builded city set on the top of a mountain. If we are built up in our locality, we shall be on the mountaintop. But if we are scattered, separated, and divided, we shall be in a low valley. In every locality there must be just one lampstand, one city situated on a mountain. For this, we must keep the unity and remain one entity, a corporate Body. Then we shall be able to shine. But if we are divided, we are finished with the shining. There is no shining in Christianity today because it is so divided. There are many divisions in Christianity. In the Lord’s recovery, however, we must come back to the unique unity, which is the corporate Body. When we have truly been built together, we shall be the city on a mountaintop shining upon those around us.</p>

In the first aspect, the light is likened to a city shining upon the outsiders. In the second aspect, the light is likened to a lamp on a lampstand shining to those who are in the house. We have seen that the city is the builded church, but what is the house? You may think that the house here also refers to the church. However, there is no need to interpret the house in this manner. According to the context, the main point is that the shining of the light has two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect. The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders, whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house. As the city, the light shines upon people, <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> but as the lamp in the house, the light shines into people. This indicates that our influence over others should not be just outward, but also inward.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovlZzxyjARSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> In order to shine upon others outwardly, we need to be built up. But to shine upon others inwardly, we need to be without any covering. As the light on the mountain, the light cannot be hidden; and as the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMhv-JFjzAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61987" data-verses="Matthew 5:15">verse 15</span> the Lord speaks about placing the lamp under the bushel. A lighted lamp placed under the bushel cannot shine out its light. The kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by the bushel, an item pertaining to eating, a matter which causes anxiety (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61988" data-verses="Matthew 6:25">6:25</span>). We should never be covered by the bushel; rather, we must be on the lampstand.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqGjRFJ4_5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> The Lord wisely spoke about not being covered by a bushel. In ancient times a bushel, as a measure for grain, was something related to eating and therefore related to the matter of making a living. Thus, hiding the lamp under the bushel indicates anxiety concerning our living. If we Christians are anxious about our living and concerned about how much money we are making, this anxiety will become a bushel covering our light.</p>

<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-lU0zxwqgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> The kingdom people firstly exercise an influence upon people outwardly, from the outside. However, we still need to influence them from within. When the church as a whole lives together as a city on the mountaintop, those surrounding it will be under the shining of such a builded church. But this is merely the shining from the outside. The church also needs to exert another kind of influence, the influence of the inner shining that gets into people. Thus, the city on the mount signifies the shining from outside, and the lamp in the house signifies the shining from inside. Our shining must not be only outside the people, but also inside them. In order to shine upon others outwardly, we must be builded as a city on the mountaintop. But in order to shine upon them inwardly, we need to come out from under our covering. This indicates that the kingdom people live without anxiety and the care for <span class="pg" data-page-id="207" id="207">[207]</span> their existence. They care only for Christ and the church. Day after day they are the happy people, the praising people, the hallelujah people. When our neighbors, relatives, and classmates contact us, they can sense that we have no anxiety. We are not worried about our living, about what we shall eat or what we shall put on. Day after day, morning and night, the kingdom people care only for Christ and the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5BhQGoJIU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> We know from experience that our lack of anxiety touches others. If every time someone contacts you, you are happy and enjoying the Lord, he will be deeply touched. Filled with anxiety and occupied with all kinds of worries, the worldly people talk about the fear of losing their job or the difficulties they are having with their boss. But the kingdom people, the hallelujah people, those not covered by the bushel, care only to talk about Christ and the church. By being such a people, we touch the hearts of others and shine upon them from within. This shining penetrates them.</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85wwyRGYl0Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> The outward shining of the kingdom people is general, and all of society can see it. Society can see a group of people who are built up, situated upon the top of a mountain, and shining. The inward shining, on the contrary, is particular. One of your cousins may be touched by your lack of anxiety and your shining face. Whenever he contacts you, he never hears you talking about how to make a living. Instead, he always hears you praising the Lord and telling how wonderful the church life is. This will be a light penetrating into his being and shining within him. Through the shining of this light, he will be convinced. This is not the general shining from outside; it is the particular shining from within. If we are the proper kingdom people, we shall have this twofold shining. We shall be a city on a mountaintop shining out upon all those surrounding us, and among them we shall be the hallelujah people, those with no anxiety or care about this life, shining into them. This inward shining penetrates the inward being of others and convinces them.</p>

Glorifying the Father in the Heavens</h2><p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM6XV8iKGElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> Eventually, both aspects of our shining will give glory to <span class="pg" data-page-id="208" id="208">[208]</span> the Father. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61989" data-verses="Matthew 5:16">Verse 16</span> says, “Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father Who is in the heavens.” The title Father proves that the disciples, who were the new King’s audience, were regenerated children of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61990" data-verses="John 1:12">John 1:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61991" data-verses="Galatians 4:6">Gal. 4:6</span>). The good works here are the behavior of the kingdom people through which men may see God and be brought to Him. Our shining will glorify the Father because it expresses what God is. To glorify God the Father is to give Him the glory. Glory is God expressed. When the kingdom people express God in their behavior and good works, men see God and give the glory to God. God hidden is God Himself. But when God is expressed, that is the glory of God. If as the kingdom people we have such a shining light, God will be expressed in this shining, and all those around us will see the glory, God expressed. When others see God in our shining, that is a glory to God.</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfOx24Tsbbftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> We, the kingdom people, are the light of the world. As light we are like a city on a mountaintop and like a lamp shining in a house. From without and within, we shine to express God, to let God have the glory in the eyes of others. May we exercise such an influence upon those around us.</p>

<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OVjXPM920rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> The teaching and preaching concerning the kingdom of the heavens began with repentance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61992" data-verses="Matthew 3:2">3:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61993" data-verses="Matthew 4:17">4:17</span>). Repentance means a change of mind. Hence, the kingdom begins with our mind. From our mind, it proceeds to our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61994" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">5:3</span>). We need to repent in our mind and to be poor in our spirit. Following this, we must be pure in heart in order to see God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61995" data-verses="Matthew 5:8">5:8</span>). The mind, the spirit, and the heart are the three major aspects of our inner being. If we put <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61996" data-verses="Matthew 4:17">4:17</span> together with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61997" data-verses="Matthew 5:3-12">5:3-12</span>, we see a number of items related to the kingdom of the heavens. The first three, as we have seen, are the mind, the spirit, and the heart. Next we need to have a normal, proper, uplifted emotion. This is seen in the matter of mourning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61998" data-verses="Matthew 5:4">5:4</span>), which comes from our adjusted emotion. We also need to be meek, which requires a strong, normal, proper will. The hunger and thirst for righteousness spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61999" data-verses="Matthew 5:6">5:6</span> is a matter of a pure and proper desire. We must desire this righteousness for the kingdom. Being merciful to others involves our attitude (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62000" data-verses="Matthew 5:7">5:7</span>). Our attitude toward others must be one of mercy. If we have a proper emotion, will, desire, and attitude, we shall be able to make peace with others. Thus, our whole being—our mind, spirit, heart, emotion, will, desire, and attitude—needs to be exercised for the kingdom life. When we have all these virtues, we are qualified to be persecuted. If you do not have these, you will not be able to withstand persecution. Eventually, those who are qualified by having all these virtues will be not only <span class="pg" data-page-id="210" id="210">[210]</span> persecuted for righteousness, but reproached for Christ. This is the nature of the kingdom people.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKiwNwvD5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> Each of the nine blessings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62001" data-verses="Matthew 5:3-12">5:3-12</span> has a reward. For example, if you are poor in spirit, the kingdom of the heavens is yours. This is a reward. If you mourn, you will be comforted, and if you are meek, you will inherit the earth. Thus, comfort and the earth are also rewards. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62002" data-verses="Matthew 5:12">verse 12</span>, the reward is great for those who are persecuted and reproached for the sake of Christ. It is difficult to give a name to this reward. If we are reproached, persecuted, evil-spoken of, for the sake of Christ, our reward in the heavens is great, so great that it is beyond our understanding. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62003" data-verses="Hebrews 13:13">Hebrews 13:13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62004" data-verses="1Peter 4:14">1 Peter 4:14</span> both speak of being reproached for the sake of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62005" data-verses="Hebrews 13:13">Hebrews 13:13</span> says, “Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62006" data-verses="1Peter 4:14">First Peter 4:14</span> says, “If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed.” This matter of reproach is also spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62007" data-verses="Romans 15:3">Romans 15:3</span>. There is a great reward awaiting those who are reproached for the sake of Christ. We need to be the kingdom people with the nature revealed in these verses. Then we shall be able to bear the reproach for Christ.</p>

CONCERNING THE LAW OF<br/>THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPIfxzvcIGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> In this message we come to the third section of the King’s word on the mountain, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62008" data-verses="Matthew 5:17-48">5:17-48</span>, which concerns the law of the people of the kingdom of the heavens. The constitution of the heavenly kingdom must certainly cover the matter of law. Prior to the time of the Lord Jesus, the children of Israel had the law of Moses. They also had the prophets. Prophecy is always a help to the law. When the people are weak in fulfilling the law, there is the need for the prophets to come in to strengthen them to keep the law. Thus, the fulfillment of the law needs the strengthening through the prophets. Therefore, in the Old Testament there were the law and the prophets. This is the reason the Lord spoke of the law and the prophets in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62009" data-verses="Matthew 5:17">verse 17</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="211" id="211">[211]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYPVlHgXh6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo">A. Not to Abolish the Law or the Prophets,<br/>but to Fulfill Them</h2><p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVCXG7m8NTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62010" data-verses="Matthew 5:17">Verse 17</span> says, “Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.” To fulfill the law here means three things: that Christ has kept the law on the positive side; that through His substitutionary death on the cross Christ has fulfilled the requirement of the law on the negative side; and that Christ complements the old law by His new law in this section, as continually expressed by the word, “But I say to you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62011" data-verses="Matthew 5:22">vv. 22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62012" data-verses="Matthew 5:28">28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62013" data-verses="Matthew 5:32">32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62014" data-verses="Matthew 5:34">34</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62015" data-verses="Matthew 5:39">39</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62016" data-verses="Matthew 5:44">44</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OVjXPIvG0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> Concerning the law, there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law. The commandments of the law are fulfilled and complemented by the Lord’s coming, whereas the principle of the law is replaced by the principle of faith according to God’s New Testament economy.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKiwNwoR5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> Before Christ came, there was the law with the strengthening through the prophets. Why then was there still the need for the law of the kingdom of the heavens? The reason is that the demands of the old law were not high enough. The requirements of the old law were not complete. Take the example of murder. The old law commanded us not to murder (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62017" data-verses="Exodus 20:13">Exo. 20:13</span>), but it did not say a word about anger. If you killed someone, you would be condemned by the law of Moses. But no matter how angry you were with someone, as long as you did not murder, you would not be condemned by Moses’ law. Here we see the shortage, the incompleteness, of the old law. However the requirement of the law of the kingdom of the heavens is much higher than that of the law of Moses. According to the law of the kingdom of the heavens, we are forbidden to be angry with our brothers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62018" data-verses="Matthew 5:21-22">verses 21 and 22</span> the Lord said, “You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.” Hence, the law of the kingdom of the heavens is higher than the law of the old dispensation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAQjUcW3szKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> Another illustration of this is the law concerning adultery. The old law forbade the committing of adultery, but the new law forbids looking at a woman to lust after her (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62019" data-verses="Matthew 5:27-28">vv. 27-28</span>). Thus, the basic principle of the law of the kingdom of the heavens is that it is higher than the old law. We do not annul the old law; we complement it to make it higher. For this reason, the Lord Jesus said that He did not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPIfxzmPoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> Many Christians do not adequately understand the meaning of the word “fulfill” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62020" data-verses="Matthew 5:17">verse 17</span>. Through many years of study, observation, and experience, we have come to see that the word “fulfill” in this verse means three things.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYPVlHoER6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo">1. Keeping the Law on the Positive Side</h2><p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuPculmqjkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> Firstly, it means that Christ came to keep the law on the positive side. When He lived on earth, He kept every aspect of the old law. No one else has ever kept the ten commandments; the Lord Jesus kept them completely. He kept the law of the old dispensation in a very positive way.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsUcKr0cthgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg">2. Fulfilling the Requirement of the Law<br/>on the Negative Side through the<br/>Substitutionary Death on the Cross</h2><p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFd55KSFQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> Because Christ kept the law, He became the perfect One. His perfection qualified Him to die on the cross for us. This is the keeping of the law in a negative sense. This is the second way Christ has fulfilled the law. All of us have broken, transgressed, the law. But our transgressions have been dealt with through the Lord’s substitutionary death. On the cross He was our substitute, dying for us to fulfill the law’s requirement on the negative side.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgjzsq_z1SNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja">3. Complementing the Old Law with the New</h2><p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I7WY606Zx2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> To fulfill the law also means that Christ complements the old law by His new law. This is expressed by the word, “But I say to you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62021" data-verses="Matthew 5:22">vv. 22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62022" data-verses="Matthew 5:28">28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62023" data-verses="Matthew 5:32">32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62024" data-verses="Matthew 5:34">34</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62025" data-verses="Matthew 5:39">39</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62026" data-verses="Matthew 5:44">44</span>). Christ’s keeping of the law qualified Him to fulfill the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross. Christ’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="213" id="213">[213]</span> fulfilling the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law, to fill the law to the full. The old law, the lower law, with its keeping-demand and punishing-requirement, is over. The kingdom people, as the children of the Father, only need now to fulfill the new law, the higher law, by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father.</p>
<div id="displayv"> </div> </body></html></div><div class="section" data-section="2">
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4IA6yZAP8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> Christ’s substitutionary death brought in the resurrection life. When this resurrection life comes into us, it is able to do the wonderful job of completing the law. It enables us to fulfill the higher law. By the resurrection life within us, we are able to be kept not only from murdering others, but even from being angry with them or hating them. This resurrection life is much higher than the natural life, for it is actually the divine life, the eternal life, the life on the highest plane. This highest life within us can fulfill the requirements of the highest law.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZUiudx9Cy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> In the New Testament, Matthew, the book of the kingdom, comes first with the requirements. Then John, the book of life, comes with the life to fulfill these requirements. By our natural life, we are not able to fulfill the requirements given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62027" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5</span>. But in the Gospel of John we have the highest life that enables us to meet the highest requirements. All Christians love John, but not many love Matthew. I doubt if I have ever heard a Christian say that he loves Matthew. Some of you may say that the Gospel of Matthew is too troublesome and that John is very simple. It says that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God, and that the Word became flesh, full of grace and reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62028" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62029" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). The Gospel of John has many golden verses, such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62030" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>. In this Gospel there are very few requirements and demands, but there is the rich life supply. However, in the New Testament, Matthew comes first, not John. We cannot afford to bypass Matthew. Nevertheless, many Christians have been instructed to do this. Thirty-five years ago I was taught that new believers should not read Matthew. I myself charged new believers not to read <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> Matthew first. I said that if they read Matthew <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62031" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">chapter one</span> first, they would be frustrated in their reading of the Bible and think that it was too difficult to read. Hence, I told the new believers to begin their reading with the fourth book, the Gospel of John. Then I would tell them to read Romans or some other book, but not Matthew. But we need to come back to Matthew. Matthew needs John, and John is for Matthew. Matthew gives us the highest requirements of the kingdom, requirements that can be fulfilled only by the divine life revealed in John. In order to fulfill the requirements of the kingdom of the heavens unfolded in Matthew, we must receive the supply of life found in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS62a8cUeasIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> Jesus, the new King, did not come to abolish the law of Moses. Rather, He came to uplift the standard of the old law. Now that the requirement has been so greatly uplifted, it is no longer the old law, but the new law of the kingdom of the heavens. Christ uplifted the standard of the old law in two ways: by complementing the old law and by changing it. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62032" data-verses="Matthew 5:17-30">verses 17 through 30</span> we see the complementing of the old law.

<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19I-I3CGgOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> Christ fulfilled the law in three ways. He Himself kept the law. However, because we did not keep it, He died on the cross for our transgressions of the law. His substitutionary death brought in the resurrection life, which has been imparted into our being. By His resurrection life we are able to fulfill the requirements of the new, higher law. By these three steps Christ has more than fulfilled the old law. He kept it, He died for us, and His death brought into us the resurrection life to strengthen us for fulfilling the requirements of the new law. Today we are not trying to keep the lower law; rather, we are keeping the uplifted, higher law through the highest life that is in us. Now we are able to keep the highest law.</p>

The kingdom people not only fulfill the law, but complement the law. Actually, they do not annul any commandments of the law, not even one of the least. Whether we shall be great or small in the kingdom of the heavens depends upon whether or not we keep even the least of the commandments of the law. In this verse Christ stressed the fact that if we do not keep all of the least of the commandments of the law, but annul them and teach others to annul them, we shall become the least in the kingdom of the heavens. In other words, Christ seemed to be saying, “If you would be great in the kingdom of the heavens, you must have the highest standard of morality. If your standard of morality does not reach the standard of the new law, you will be the least in the kingdom of the heavens.” The morality of no other people is as high as that of the kingdom people. Never think that we care only for life and not for <span class="pg" data-page-id="216" id="216">[216]</span> morality. Life must have its expression, and the highest life has the highest expression. Morality is simply the expression of life. Thus, if you have the highest life, you will certainly have the highest morality as the expression of this life. We need to pray, “Lord, grant me the highest expression of life. Grant me to have the highest level of morality. Lord, we are not only moral people, but kingdom people.”</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk-C-ZeIa1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> Because the standard of the kingdom is higher than the standard of morality, we must do more than keep the standard of the old law. According to the standard of morality, we should not commit murder or adultery. If we abstain from murder and adultery, we are moral people. But such a standard is much lower than that of the kingdom. According to the standard of the kingdom of the heavens, we should not be angry with our brother or look at a woman to lust after her. This is not the standard of morality; it is the standard of the kingdom, which is much higher than that of morality. The standard of morality says, “Eye for eye, tooth for a tooth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62044" data-verses="Exodus 21:24">Exo. 21:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62045" data-verses="Leviticus 24:20">Lev. 24:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62046" data-verses="Deuteronomy 19:21">Deut. 19:21</span>). But the standard of the kingdom tells us to love our enemies, to pray for those who persecute us, and not to resist one who is evil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62047" data-verses="Matthew 5:44">vv. 44</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62048" data-verses="Matthew 5:39">39</span>). If someone strikes us on our right cheek, we should turn to him the other also (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62049" data-verses="Matthew 5:39">v. 39</span>). How much higher is this standard than the standard of morality!</p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoMyAK5_Vsw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> The crucial point that Christ is stressing in these verses is that the kingdom people must have the highest standard of morality. If we see this matter, then we are able to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62050" data-verses="Matthew 5:17-48">5:17-48</span>.

It refers to the subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness is not obtained merely by fulfilling the old law, but by completing the old law through the fulfillment of the new law of the kingdom of the heavens, the law given by the new King here in this section of the Word. This righteousness of the kingdom people, according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ. This righteousness, which is likened to the wedding garment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62056" data-verses="Matthew 22:11-12">22:11-12</span>), qualifies us to participate in the wedding of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62057" data-verses="Revelation 19:7-8">Rev. 19:7-8</span>) and inherit the kingdom of the heavens in its manifestation, that is, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in the future.</p>

Hence, the demand of the new law of the kingdom is deeper than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. The word “brother” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62073" data-verses="Matthew 5:22">verse 22</span> proves that the King’s word here is spoken to believers.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYFuepxSWD97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> The most difficult thing for us to do is to control our anger. Some were supposed to be very gentle, but their anger was like a wild horse when they lost their temper. When our anger is released, no one can bridle us or control us. For a number of years I could not get through this chapter because of the problem of my anger.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUsUGDVqc0trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> It is also very difficult for us not to contemn or condemn others. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62074" data-verses="Matthew 5:22">verse 22</span> the Lord speaks about saying to our brother, “Raca,” or “Moreh.” The word Raca is an expression of contempt meaning stupid, good-for-nothing. Moreh, that is, fool, is a Hebrew expression of condemnation indicating a rebel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62075" data-verses="Numbers 20:10">Num. 20:10</span>). This expression is more serious than the expression of contempt, Raca. How difficult it is neither to condemn a brother nor to hold him in contempt! Perhaps you cannot go for even a week without condemning or contemning someone. It seems that nearly every day we either contemn or condemn. Husbands and wives contemn and condemn one another. I do not believe there is one exception. Every wife has contemned and condemned her husband, <span class="pg" data-page-id="219" id="219">[219]</span> and every husband has done the same to his wife. This is a real problem. When you read this, can you still say that you are the overcomers, the kingdom people? Do not be disappointed. Rather, be encouraged. Remember, we have an overcoming life. Do you not have the King within you? We are the kingdom people, and we have the King within us. This King is the kingly, overcoming life. Do not look at yourself. If you do, you will be fully discouraged. Forget yourself and look at the kingly life within you. It is this life that makes us the kingdom people. Forget your natural life and follow this kingly life.</p>

The first is the judgment at the gate of the city, which is the district judgment. The second is the judgment by the Sanhedrin, which is the higher judgment. The Sanhedrin is a council composed of the chief priests, the elders, the lawyers, and the scribes. It is the highest court of the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62077" data-verses="Luke 22:66">Luke 22:66</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62078" data-verses="Acts 4:5-6">Acts 4:5-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62079" data-verses="Acts 4:15">15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62080" data-verses="Acts 5:27">5:27</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62081" data-verses="Acts 5:34">34</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62082" data-verses="Acts 5:41">41</span>). The third is the judgment by God through the Gehenna of fire, which is the highest judgment. These three kinds of judgment were mentioned by the new King, using figures of the Jewish background, because all His audience was Jewish. However, concerning the kingdom people, the believers of the New Testament, all these judgments refer to the judgment of the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62083" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62084" data-verses="Romans 14:10">Romans 14:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62085" data-verses="Romans 14:12">12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62086" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:4-5">1 Corinthians 4:4-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62087" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:13-15">3:13-15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62088" data-verses="Matthew 16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62089" data-verses="Revelation 22:12">Revelation 22:12</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62090" data-verses="Hebrews 10:27">Hebrews 10:27</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62091" data-verses="Hebrews 10:30">30</span>.

The altar spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62111" data-verses="Matthew 5:23">verse 23</span> was a piece of furniture (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62112" data-verses="Exodus 27:1-8">Exo. 27:1-8</span>) in the outer court of the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62113" data-verses="1Kings 8:64">1 Kings 8:64</span>), on which all sacrifices and gifts were offered (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62114" data-verses="Leviticus 1:9">Lev. 1:9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62115" data-verses="Leviticus 1:12">12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62116" data-verses="Leviticus 1:17">17</span>). The King, in decreeing the new law of the kingdom, referred here to the gift and the altar of the old dispensation because, during the transitory period of His ministry on earth, the ritual law of the old dispensation had not yet ceased. In the four Gospels, before His death and resurrection, in things regarding circumstances, the Lord treated His disciples as Jews according to the old law; whereas in things concerning spirit and life, He considered them as believers who constitute the church according to the New Testament economy.</p>

The matter of being delivered to the judge, to the officer, and thrown into prison will transpire at the judgment seat of Christ when He comes back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62121" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:10">2 Cor. 5:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62122" data-verses="Romans 14:10">Rom. 14:10</span>). The judge will be the Lord, the officer will be the angel, and the prison will be the place of discipline. To come out from there, that is, to come out from prison, is to be forgiven in the coming age, the millennium.</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkV-jE7yGiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> The Roman quadrans spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62123" data-verses="Matthew 5:26">verse 26</span> is a small brass coin equal to a quarter of an assarion, which is equal to one cent. The meaning here is that even with the smallest thing we need to make a thorough clearance. This shows the strictness of the new law.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCZb4PdAmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> We need to be reconciled to our opponent before we die, before he dies, or before the Lord comes back. If we do not take care of any matter now, we shall have to deal with it in the coming age. Do not wait for the next age, for the dealing then will be more troublesome. Take care of every problem now, before you die or before your opponent dies. While both of you are still living, you still have the opportunity to be reconciled to him. Furthermore, if you wait, the Lord may <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> come back before you are reconciled. On the one hand, the Lord’s coming back will be marvelous. On the other hand, it will be rather serious, for it will close the opportunity to deal with the problems in this age and compel us to deal with them in the next age. Therefore, it is much better to solve every problem before the coming age. This means that we must take care of every problem before we die, before the other party dies, or before the Lord comes back.</p>

The seriousness of this sin is indicated by the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62128" data-verses="Matthew 5:29-30">verses 29 and 30</span> about plucking out our eye and casting it from us and cutting off our hand and casting it from us. In both of these verses the Lord said, “It is better for you that one of your members perish and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.” This, however, should not be observed literally; it can only be carried out spiritually, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62129" data-verses="Romans 8:13">Romans 8:13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62130" data-verses="Colossians 3:5">Colossians 3:5</span>. I know the cases of some who applied this word in a literal way. One of these cases was a gambler who literally cut off his hand after reading this portion of the Word. Eventually he discovered <span class="pg" data-page-id="223" id="223">[223]</span> that, although his hand had been cut off, there was still within him an inner hand desiring to gamble. He learned that cutting off his physical hand did not work, for the problem was with the inner hand. Although this word is not to be taken literally, it reveals the seriousness of such a sin.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0i15skkFs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> According to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62131" data-verses="Matthew 5:29-30">verses 29 and 30</span>, it is possible for saved persons to be cast into Gehenna. This means that even the saved ones may be hurt by the second death. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62132" data-verses="Revelation 2:11">Revelation 2:11</span> the Lord Jesus said, “He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death.” As we have pointed out, Gehenna is a symbol of the lake of fire, which is the second death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62133" data-verses="Revelation 20:15">Rev. 20:15</span>). The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62134" data-verses="Revelation 2:11">Revelation 2:11</span> indicates that it is possible for believers to be hurt by the second death. The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62135" data-verses="Revelation 2:11">Revelation 2:11</span> corresponds to His word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62136" data-verses="Matthew 5:29-30">Matthew 5:29 and 30</span>. As a saved one, if you are not serious in dealing with this kind of sin, you will some day be hurt by the second death. As the Lord Jesus says here, you will be cast into Gehenna. This does not mean that you will perish; it means that you will be disciplined. Furthermore, the Gehenna of fire does not refer to the purgatory of Catholicism. But this word on Gehenna warns you that if you are not serious in dealing with this sin today, when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will exercise His judgment over you. (For a further word on the matter of being hurt by the second death, see Life-Study of Revelation, message eleven, pp. 136-138).</p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GvTlFY-gsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> As we have seen, the three kinds of judgment spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62137" data-verses="Matthew 5:22">verse 22</span> all refer to the judgment of Christ at His judgment seat. This judgment has nothing to do with the unsaved, who will be judged at the great white throne after the millennium (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62138" data-verses="Revelation 15:1">Rev. 15</span>). No unsaved person will be qualified to stand before the judgment seat of Christ at His coming back. All those who appear before this judgment seat will be saved ones. The believers will be judged there, not for the matter of salvation or perdition, but for reward or punishment.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6Xrqr6H7r55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> The word spoken by the Lord concerning judgment and being cast into the Gehenna of fire is a serious word. Such a <span class="pg" data-page-id="224" id="224">[224]</span> word should make us sober and cause us not to be loose in dealing with this kind of sin. Never consider this sin as an insignificant matter. The situation today regarding fornication is deplorable. We must never be loose about this. The Lord’s own word shows us how serious it is. We must be sober and deal with this in a very serious manner. However, we do not deal with our members in a literal way. Rather, we must mortify our sinful members by the cross of Christ. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62139" data-verses="Romans 8:13">Romans 8:13</span> reveals, by the Spirit we must “put to death the practices of the body,” and, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62140" data-verses="Colossians 3:5">Colossians 3:5</span> says, we must mortify our “members which are on the earth.” This is the proper way to deal with our sinful members.</p>

<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4IDKyeS_8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> In this message I am burdened to give a further word on the law. There has been much debate among Christian teachers over this matter of the law. These debates have been mainly due to the shortage of light from the Bible regarding the law. According to the Old Testament economy, God’s dealings with His people were based upon the law. This was the principle of the law. But in the New Testament economy, God deals with His people today, not according to the law, but according to faith. Thus, the law was the principle of God’s dealing with His people in the Old Testament, but faith is the principle of His dealing with us in the New Testament. According to the Old Testament economy, it was necessary to keep the law in order to be acceptable to God. But today being acceptable to God is a matter of faith.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZUhed1vCy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> The principle of the law has been abolished, but the commandments of the law have not been abolished. Just because the principle of the law has been abolished, never think that the commandments of the law have also been abolished and that there is no need to honor our parents or to refrain from stealing. No, instead of being abolished, the commandments of the law have been uplifted. Although our contact with God is not based upon the principle of the law, we must still observe the uplifted commandments of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS61q8ZGOasIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ">NO NEED TO KEEP THE SABBATH</h2><p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2wbI7E0C0EzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> At this point the Seventh Day Adventists might say, <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> “Yes, we must keep all the commandments of the law. One of these commandments is to keep the Sabbath. Based upon what you have said about not abolishing the commandments of the law, we tell you that you must keep the Sabbath.” Although the commandments of God have not been abolished, one of these commandments, the law about keeping the Sabbath, is not related to morality. Rather, it is a ritual law. A ritual is a form, a shadow, that we need no longer observe today. For example, we do not need to offer animal sacrifices, do we? Likewise, we no longer need to keep the Sabbath. In the Old Testament, the age of shadows, there was the need for the sacrifices, the feasts, and the keeping of the Sabbath. But today is an age of reality. Our sacrifice is not a lamb or a goat; it is Christ, the reality of all the Old Testament sacrifices. In like manner, our rest is not a particular day; it also is Christ. Because Christ, the reality, is here, all the shadows are over. Because the commandment to keep the Sabbath is a ritual commandment, not a moral commandment, we are not obligated to keep it today. This commandment is not related to morality, but to the shadow, the form, which is now over.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="KJEWVtLfOnw9Yxg9_3P5DJPt37vAanTep0fB8fNd2CrXG7zPGzDylZTVqAClKS52d">THE PRINCIPLE OF THE LAW</h2><p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMjuYrsoqCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> We need to be impressed concerning the principle of the law. God’s dealing with His people always depends upon a principle. For example, God’s dealings with Abraham were based upon God’s promise. God did not give Abraham the commandments of the law; He gave him only the promise. Thus, God dealt with him according to His promise. The promise given by God to Abraham became the principle according to which God dealt with him. Later, God gave the law to the children of Israel through Moses. The law given on Mount Sinai thus became the principle according to which God dealt with the children of Israel. In this way the law became the principle for God’s dealings with His people in the Old Testament. Now in the New Testament God deals with the believers according to faith, no longer according to the law. This is fully developed in the books of Romans and Galatians. <span class="pg" data-page-id="227" id="227">[227]</span> If you read these books, you will see that God deals with the believers in Christ not according to the law, but according to faith. In Old Testament times God accepted people according to the law. If anyone wanted to be accepted by God, he had to meet the standard of the law. But today God accepts us, not according to the law, but according to whether or not we believe in Christ. Thus, God’s acceptance of us today is based on faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz_HIcILxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB">THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LAW<br/>NOT ABOLISHED, BUT UPLIFTED</h2><p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxCgWmKcLa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> The fact that God no longer deals with us, the believers, according to the principle of the law does not mean that the commandments of the old law have been abolished. For instance, the first two commandments of the old law were concerned with not having other gods and with not making images. To say that the principle of the law has been abolished does not mean that these commandments have been abolished. Rather, according to the New Testament, these commandments are emphasized, strengthened, and uplifted. In the Old Testament we were told not to make a physical image, but in the New Testament we are told that even our covetousness is a form of idolatry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62142" data-verses="Colossians 3:5">Col. 3:5</span>). Greediness is an idol. By this we see the uplifting of the commandment regarding idolatry. Yes, the principle of the law has been abolished, but not the commandments of the law. The commandment about honoring our parents has never been abolished. In the New Testament this commandment is also repeated, strengthened, and uplifted. We must honor our parents much more today than the children of Israel did in the past.</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkV9TE-wmiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> We have seen that the Lord Jesus also uplifted the commandments regarding murder and adultery. Because the Old Testament commandments regarding murder and adultery were not adequate, the Lord complemented them. The old commandment concerning murder did not cover the matters of hatred or anger. Thus, the Lord complemented the old law concerning murder by saying that anyone who was <span class="pg" data-page-id="228" id="228">[228]</span> angry with his brother would be liable to judgment. He also complemented the commandment concerning adultery by saying that anyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her in his heart. By these examples we see that the moral laws have never been abolished; rather, they have been uplifted. All of the ten commandments have been repeated and uplifted in the New Testament except the fourth commandment, the commandment to keep the Sabbath. This commandment is over because it is not related to morality. Instead, it is a ritual commandment.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCZYIPZBmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5">A HIGHER STANDARD OF MORALITY</h2><p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_9bLHRtmhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> Now we come to my real burden in this message. Yes, in the New Testament salvation is based upon the principle of faith; it has nothing to do with the law. We all have been saved through faith, not through the keeping of the law. But after we are saved, we must live a life that has a standard of morality higher than that of the old law. Never think that we are free to be loose, sloppy, or even immoral just because we are not saved through the keeping of the law. Do not think that, just because God does not deal with us according to the principle of the law, but according to the principle of faith, we should not care for the commandments of the law. Anyone who thinks this has been drugged by the teachings found in part of today’s Christianity. We must be sober. Again I say, after we have been saved, we need to live a life with a standard far higher than that of the old law. Our standard must be higher than that of the requirements of the law. The law requires that we should not murder anyone. But we should not even be angry with others. Even if we say to our brother, “Raca,” an expression of contempt, or, “Moreh,” a word of condemnation indicating a rebel, we shall be in danger of the judgment. Although we may not kill our brother, if we even call him a fool or a rebel, we shall find ourselves in serious trouble.</p>

Murder refers to our temper, and adultery, to our lust. Our temper and our lust constantly damage and trouble us. If we were stone, we would not be bothered by these two things. No matter how much you irritate, insult, or offend a stone, it will never react, because it does not have any temper. Furthermore, a stone has no lust. Thus, it can never be tempted by lust. But daily we are either troubled by our temper or tempted by our lust. How easy it is for us to be irritated and offended! Some of us may be offended at least ten times a day. You may be offended by your husband or wife, by your children, by your neighbors, or by your in-laws. You may even be offended by your shoes, the stove, or the tea kettle. I know some sisters who have been offended by their kitchens. It seems that their anger could never be exhausted. Others are troubled with lust. For this reason, I pointed out in one of the life-study messages on Genesis that you should never be alone with a member of the opposite sex for any length of time. If you are, you will be tempted by your ferocious lusts.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5npna4-Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> In order to live up to a moral standard higher than that of the old law, you must overcome your temper and your lusts. You may say that this is not easy to do. Right, it is not easy. This is why you need Christ. This is why you need another life. How we need to stay with Christ! We must contact Him not only day by day, but even hour by hour. Because of the temper and lust within us, we need to remain in constant fellowship with Him. You must recognize that you are neither wood nor stone. If you were wood or stone, you would not be concerned about the matter of anger and lust. But because you are a living being, you have these two things within you. Do you not have both temper and lust within? At any time we may be stumbled by our temper or tempted by our lust. Be on the alert! Be watchful and pray regarding these two “demons,” our temper and our lust. After we have been saved according to the principle of faith, we need to live a higher life, a life with the highest standard. This life with the highest standard is a life that overcomes our temper and our lust. <span class="pg" data-page-id="230" id="230">[230]</span> </p>

These teachings neither warn the Christians nor tell them the truth. So many are not warned that they will be caused much trouble by being angry and contemning or condemning others or by giving in to their lusts. By showing even a little contempt for our brother we shall be liable to the judgment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62144" data-verses="Matthew 5:22">5:22</span>). This does not mean that we shall perish. No, a saved person will never perish, and no one who is lost will be qualified to appear before the judgment seat of Christ. Only those who have been saved according to the principle of faith will be qualified to be there. But do not think that it is impossible for you to have a problem at the judgment seat of Christ. You may tell the Lord, “I never robbed a bank or murdered anyone. The only thing I did was to lose my temper.” But the mere act of losing your temper may bring you into judgment.</p>
<p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLdhxeVCDfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62145" data-verses="Matthew 5:22">5:22</span> the judgment of the believers at the judgment seat of Christ is described by three kinds of judgment according to the background of the Jewish people: the judgment at the gate of the city, the judgment before the Sanhedrin, and the judgment of the Gehenna of fire. These three levels of judgment all refer to the one judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. We Christians, saved according to the principle of faith, will not be judged at the white throne spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62146" data-verses="Revelation 20:1">Revelation 20</span>. Rather, we shall be judged at the judgment seat of Christ a thousand years before the judgment at the white throne. The judgment at the great white throne will be for unbelievers concerning their eternal perdition. But the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ will be for believers concerning whether they will be rewarded or punished.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0i16ckjHM-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> Although many of you were in Christianity for years, you probably never heard such a sobering message. Did you ever hear a sermon telling you that, although you are saved by faith through grace, you must still live a life that is of a higher moral standard than that required by the old law? Were you ever told that you must live a life that never loses its temper or <span class="pg" data-page-id="231" id="231">[231]</span> that does not look at a woman to lust? The higher law, the law of the kingdom of the heavens, not only touches the outward acts, but also the inward motives. How high is the standard of this law! The Lord’s warning concerning the standard of this law is serious. It even speaks of being put into the Gehenna of fire. I say again, this does not mean that the believers will perish. Pitiful Christianity merely tells people that they will go to either heaven or hell. But the Bible says clearly that after we have been saved according to the principle of faith, we must fulfill all the requirements of the new law. The law is no longer the principle according to which we are saved, but it is a standard of morality that we are required to keep. The principle of the law has been abolished, but the morality required by the commandments of the law remains and has been uplifted. Do not think that there is no need to take care of morality because we are not under the law for salvation. This is absolutely a wrong concept. The crucial point of the Lord’s decree concerning the law is that we do not need to keep the law in order to be saved, but that we must have a standard of morality much higher than the standard of the old law after we have been saved by faith.</p>

It is good to say that we cannot make it, because then it is necessary for Christ to come into us. The very One who fully kept the law and who died in our stead has come into us in resurrection to be our life. The Lord’s warning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62147" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5</span> must force us to stay with Christ. We must have a daily life full of fear and trembling. We need to say, “I must stay close to the resurrected Christ. I must be one with Him. I must trust Him and rely on Him. Because the standard of morality of the kingdom of the heavens is too high for me to fulfill, I must remain with the Lord. If I even lose my temper with my brother, I may be burned in the fire. How serious this is!”</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovlaTxzigRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> When some Christian teachers hear this, they may say, “It is heresy to teach that saved ones will be burned in the fire.” Read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62148" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5</span> again. This chapter is not a word spoken to <span class="pg" data-page-id="232" id="232">[232]</span> unbelievers; it is a word given to the disciples, the saved ones, the sons of God. If they do not bridle their anger, they will be cast into the Gehenna of fire. Some may say, “This is the Gehenna of fire, not the lake of fire.” Do not argue about what fire it is, for even a small fire can cause us much suffering. Sunday after Sunday, so many Christians are being filled with sugar-coated teachings. They have never heard a sobering word from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62149" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5</span>. We thank the Lord for His mercy and grace and for the faith He has given us through which we have been saved. How wonderful it is to be saved by faith! But as those who are saved, we must listen to a serious word of warning! Even losing our temper with our brother may cause us to be burned in the Gehenna of fire.</p>

How awful it would be to pass through such a burning! Moreover, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62154" data-verses="Revelation 2:11">Revelation 2:11</span> the Lord said, “He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death.” This word implies that the defeated Christians will be hurt by the second death, the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62155" data-verses="Revelation 20:15">Rev. 20:15</span>). To be hurt by the second death is to be touched by the lake of fire. Certainly none of us wants to be touched by this fire.</p>

According to Calvinism, once we are saved, we are saved forever, and there can be no further problem. In a sense, <span class="pg" data-page-id="233" id="233">[233]</span> Calvinism is correct, for once we are saved, we are saved for eternity. However, we should not say that there can be no problems. There is the possibility of being burned in the fire. According to Arminianism, some may be saved in the morning and lose their salvation that night. Their salvation goes up and down like an elevator. Neither Calvinism nor Arminianism is according to the pure word of the Bible. The Bible reveals that we are saved for eternity, but that after we are saved, we need to overcome every sinful thing. If not, we shall be disciplined, punished. If you do not repent and confess your sin, but stay in adultery, in the next age you will be put into the fire and burned, not for eternal perdition, but as a dispensational punishment.</p>

Every country is filled with immorality. Concerning this matter, so many have been drugged by “garlic” and have lost their sense concerning this sin. May this word sober us! We must stay away from today’s trend. Nothing insults God more than fornication, which damages the man created by God in His image. We all must flee our temper and our lust. Flee your temper! Flee your lust! It is not an insignificant thing to lose our temper or to give in to our lust. Indulging in these things may cause us to be burned. Thus, we need to heed this sober word, a word that will force us to stay close to Christ. We need to pray, “Lord, I have temper and lust within me. But, Lord, I thank You that I have You in my spirit. Lord, I don’t want to stay with my physical lust or my psychological temper. I want to stay in my spirit with You, dear Lord Jesus.” Here is our salvation, our rescue, our holiness. Day and night we must stay with the Lord Jesus in our spirit, looking to Him, contacting Him, and trusting in Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy5r-K39nw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> Temper, a problem to every Christian, is like a gopher: it is hidden, subtle, and prevailing. We all must be on guard concerning it. Lust is also a great problem. I am sorry to say that even among saints there have been a number of cases <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> of fornication. What a shame! Nothing is more shameful than fornication or adultery among the saints. This damages the people created by God, the church life, and the testimony of the church. Again and again the Apostle Paul warned us that no fornicator would share in God’s kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62156" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:9-10">1 Cor. 6:9-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62157" data-verses="Galatians 5:19-21">Gal. 5:19-21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62158" data-verses="Ephesians 5:5">Eph. 5:5</span>). Those believers who commit adultery or fornication are through with the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom people must have the highest standard of righteousness. Do not lose your temper or look at a woman to lust after her. Be careful! You need to consider these matters seriously and deal with the motive at the very root. This word is not a threat; it is a warning that forces us to stay close to Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM6U18lKmElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> Thank the Lord that we have both the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of John. We need to trust in the life revealed in the Gospel of John. Hallelujah, we have such a life! This life is the resurrection life, the overcoming life. Christ has already overcome and now in resurrection He is living in us. This is the life by which we fulfill the highest requirements of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

Rather, we are walking according to the spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62159" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Romans 8:4</span> says that when we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill all the righteous requirements of the law. We are not trying to keep the law, for the more we try to keep it, the more we break it. This is fully revealed and recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62160" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span>. Today we are neither under the law nor obliged to keep the law. We are free from the law, and now we are walking according to the spirit. Within the spirit, there is the King, Christ, who is our resurrection life. As we walk according to the spirit, we fulfill even the requirements of the highest law.</p>
<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhilzpPTw69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> I believe that now we are clear about the law. We can tell others that the principle of the law is over, but that the commandments of the law remain and have been uplifted. Although we are not able to meet the standard of these <span class="pg" data-page-id="235" id="235">[235]</span> higher requirements, we have the resurrection life in our spirit. Therefore, we need not keep the law in the sense of striving in ourselves, but we must walk according to the spirit. When we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill all the requirements of the law and have the highest standard of morality. This is the testimony of Jesus, the testimony of the church. This is the proper church life, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62162" data-verses="Matthew 5:21-30">verses 21 through 30</span> the Lord covered two laws that were complemented, the law regarding murder and the law regarding adultery. But the four laws in this section, the laws regarding divorce, swearing, resisting evil, and loving our enemies, have all been changed. What the King decreed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62163" data-verses="Matthew 5:21-30">verses 21 through 30</span> as the new law of the kingdom complements the law of the old dispensation, whereas what the King proclaimed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62164" data-verses="Matthew 5:31-48">verses 31 through 48</span> as the new law of the kingdom changes the law of the old dispensation.</p>

<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvT1NggqPuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> Let us firstly consider the changing of the law regarding divorce. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62165" data-verses="Matthew 5:31">Verse 31</span> says, “And it was said: Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a divorce.” According to the old law, a man could divorce his wife simply by giving her a writing of divorcement. The law of the old dispensation concerning divorce was ordained because of the people’s hardness of heart; it was not according to God’s design in the beginning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62166" data-verses="Matthew 19:7-8">19:7-8</span>). The King’s new decree recovers marriage back to the beginning designed by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62167" data-verses="Matthew 19:4-6">19:4-6</span>).</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LWGLnLtPaKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP">2. The New Law—Not to Divorce<br/>Except in a Case of Fornication</h2><p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFd6ZKSHQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62168" data-verses="Matthew 5:32">Verse 32</span> says, “But I say to you that every one who puts away his wife, except in a case of fornication, makes her <span class="pg" data-page-id="238" id="238">[238]</span> commit adultery, and whoever marries one that has been put away commits adultery.” The marriage tie can be broken only by death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62169" data-verses="Romans 7:3">Rom. 7:3</span>) or fornication. Hence, to have a divorce for any other reason is to commit adultery.</p>
<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgjzvK_z3SNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> According to the word of the Lord Jesus, the only cause for divorce is fornication. Only two things can break the marriage tie: either the death of one of the parties or fornication, adultery. If either party commits adultery, the marriage tie is broken. This is the principle. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that there must be no divorce except in the case of fornication. But you should not take advantage of this as an excuse to remarry simply because an act of fornication has been committed. This also is a matter of motive. If possible, the offending one should be forgiven. However, it is different if the guilty party refuses to repent and lives in that kind of sin or marries someone else. In such a case as this, the marriage tie is broken, and the other party is free.</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I7V46365x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> In His original design for marriage, God ordained one wife for one husband. But due to the weakness and hardness of heart of the children of Israel, when the law was given, Moses gave a man permission to divorce his wife with a writing of divorce. But now, with the coming of the kingdom of the heavens, this law regarding divorce is changed, and the matter of marriage is recovered to God’s intention at the beginning. At the beginning God did not create two or three Eves for Adam so he could have one or more divorces. No, there was only one husband and one wife. Hence, the Lord Jesus as the King of the heavenly kingdom brings the matter of marriage back to the beginning.</p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4IDayaAv8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> Here I would say a word to the young people. In this country there are a great number of divorces every year. Some have even been married several times. How deplorable! No child of God should ever have a divorce. This is serious. To divorce and remarry means to commit adultery. In the previous message we saw how serious adultery is. For this reason, I would speak a warning word to the young people who are not yet married: do not leap into marriage in a light way. You must pray to the Lord and wait on Him for <span class="pg" data-page-id="239" id="239">[239]</span> His clear leading. Never be directed by your lusts or desires. If you do this, you will regret it later, for the lusts and desires will not last. Before you are married, both your eyes should be open to consider the matter carefully. But after you are married, your eyes must be closed. There is a proverb which says that love blinds you, but that marriage opens your eyes. We, however, need to change this proverb. Our eyes should be opened before marriage and closed after marriage. Young people, before you get married, ask the Lord to give you eyes to see every aspect of the situation. But after you are married, you must close your eyes and be blind. Be a blind wife or a blind husband, always considering your husband or wife so dear. If you do this, there will be no divorce.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZUhOdy8iy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> I am surprised whenever I hear of a brother and sister who get married after knowing each other for just a short time. Do not get married in a hasty way or in a quick way. No hasty marriage is of the Lord’s leading. If there is any matter that requires prayer, it is marriage. And if there is anything for which you need to present yourself to the Lord, it is your marriage. Present yourself and the other party to the Lord, offering yourself on the altar as a burnt offering to the Lord for your coming marriage. After you present yourself to the Lord, seek His leading and wait on Him for a period of time. I would encourage you to wait for at least another month. Do not be in a hurry. As an old man with much experience, I advise you to take your time in this matter. Even if you get married a year later, it will not make much difference. If marrying a certain one is of the Lord, the Lord will keep that one for you. You do not need to be in a rush. Furthermore, do not make your own choice, your own selection. Be content with the Lord’s will and with the Lord’s timing. This will save you from the possibility of divorce.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS6168fV-asIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> Again, I say, once you are married, you must be blind. Blessed are the blind husbands and wives. The wife who tries to be clear-sighted concerning her husband will suffer, but the one who does not try to be clear-sighted will enjoy life. To her, the sky is blue, the sun is shining, and the air is <span class="pg" data-page-id="240" id="240">[240]</span> fresh. She does not seek to find all her husband’s faults. She can simply praise the Lord for her husband.</p>

The New Law—Not to Swear at All</h2><p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCl6ituQw2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62171" data-verses="Matthew 5:34-36">verses 34 through 36</span> we see the Lord’s new law regarding swearing: it is not to swear at all. The new law of the kingdom forbids the kingdom people to swear in any manner, by the heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem, or by their head, because the heaven, the earth, Jerusalem, and their head are not under their control, but under God’s. We should not swear by either the heaven or the earth, for they are not ours. Likewise, we should not swear by Jerusalem because, as the city of the great King, it is not our territory. We should not even swear by our head because we “cannot make one hair white or black.” All these things—heaven, earth, Jerusalem, and even the hairs of our head—are not under our control. We are nobody and we control nothing.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk-BeZeKa1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62172" data-verses="Matthew 5:37">verse 37</span> the Lord says, “But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatever is more than this is of the evil one.” The kingdom people’s word needs to be simple and true: “Yes, yes; No, no,” not convincing others with many words. Our words should be brief and clear. Those who are honest do not talk very much. But beware of talkative people: they may be liars. Liars are very talkative, always giving many reasons and excuses for things. But an honest person is usually brief. Furthermore, we must realize that much talk in the presence of God does not make the Lord happy. When we go to the Lord, we must go to Him in honesty, saying things to Him in a brief way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="241" id="241">[241]</span> </p>

Here we come to a crucial point: in our talking the evil one may be present. When we speak more words than are necessary, those words are not of us, but of the Devil, the evil one. This indicates that in our talking the evil one is with us. This is especially true in married life. Although we may not talk that much with others, it is easy for there to be excess talk between a husband and wife. If you want to avoid a poor marriage, let there be no loose talk between you and your husband or wife. Be on the alert! While you are talking, the evil one may be with you. This is not my word; it is the word of the Lord. The Lord’s word in this verse is a strong indication the evil one is seeking the opportunity to express himself through our excessive talking. Do not say too much. Simply say as much as is needed. Do not go any further. If you go further than is necessary, the evil one will be expressed. If you follow this advice, you will be a very happy husband or wife. However, if you talk too much, you will have difficulty. This will open the shaft of the bottomless pit and allow the demons to come out. We should learn to speak only what is necessary. Never try to convince others by many words. Such convincing words are not reliable; rather, they are falsehoods that come from the evil one.</p>

In this verse the Lord said that when <span class="pg" data-page-id="242" id="242">[242]</span> someone strikes our right cheek, we should turn to him the other also. To do this indicates that there is no resistance. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62176" data-verses="Matthew 5:40">Verse 40</span> says, “And to him who would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak also.” If someone claims your tunic, a shirt-like undergarment, give him your cloak also.

Perhaps you can afford to give him ten jackets. The issue here is not whether your financial status allows you to give him your jacket; it is whether your temper allows you to do it. If someone demands your shirt, your anger may be aroused. Thus, it is not a matter of a shirt or a jacket, but of your temper. It is the same in principle with being struck on the right cheek or compelled to walk a mile.</p>
<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIp4NE4L85SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> To resist by claiming an eye for an eye means that you are releasing your temper. Here the Lord is saying that we cannot satisfy our temper. Instead of releasing the “gopher” of our temper, we must kill it. Do not deal with the one making a claim upon you; deal with your temper. The problem is not your opponent; it is your temper. The Lord allows someone to claim your tunic as a test to expose where you are, to prove that the “gopher” of your temper is still lurking within you. We are a spiritual people, even the kingdom people, but our temper is still hidden within us and needs to be exposed. Those who make claims of you expose this little “gopher.” If someone demands your tunic, you may say, “I don’t owe you anything! Why do you come to me?” Do not blame the one making a claim—the Lord has sent him—but kill the “gopher” of your temper. Instead of displaying anger, say to him, “Since you want my undershirt, I will give you my jacket also.” This proves that your temper has been killed. All the kingdom <span class="pg" data-page-id="243" id="243">[243]</span> people should be able to say, “No matter how many unjust claims you place on me, my anger is not stirred up. I still love you and I am willing to share with you all I have. If you want my shirt, I shall gladly give you my jacket also.” The attitude of the kingdom people should always be like this.</p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzmn9tJdcsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> I say again, the issue here is not one of money, but of our temper. All the matters mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62178" data-verses="Matthew 5:39-41">verses 39 through 41</span> touch our temper. Millionaires can afford to give thousands of dollars away. But they often display their temper with a taxi driver over a mere twenty-five cents. The money does not mean anything; it is a matter of the temper. We, the kingdom people, must be above our temper.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFBDVm07HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62179" data-verses="Matthew 5:42">verse 42</span> the Lord says, “To him who asks of you, give; and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.” To give and not turn away from the borrower proves that the kingdom people do not care for material riches and are not possessed by them. However, the real issue is not material wealth. Giving to those who ask or who want to borrow touches our being. The Lord is not saying that we should lack discernment and behave in a foolish way regarding material possessions. He is telling us that we must be above both material things and our temper. We should never be stirred in our temper by this kind of thing nor touched by the material things. This is the overcoming attitude of the kingdom people. This does not mean that we are overly generous or careless in managing money. Although you may be very careful in the way you spend money, you will be above material possessions and above your temper when such a time comes as described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62180" data-verses="Matthew 5:42">verse 42</span>. No claim will stir up your anger. The old law did not touch people’s anger or their heart. But the new law, the changed law, touches both our temper and our heart.</p>

The reason you love your neighbors is that they are good according to your feeling. Although your neighbors correspond to your feeling, an enemy does not. Instead, he stirs up your temper. Hence, the matter of loving our enemies is a test. If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62183" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62184" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62185" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span> of Matthew, you will see that this heavenly constitution does not allow even an inch to our natural being. Rather, it kills every germ in us. You hate your enemy because he does not agree with your natural choice, and you love your good neighbor because he does suit your natural choice. If the Lord arranged for you to have only good neighbors, you would behave like an angel and say, “Lord, thank You for giving me such lovely neighbors.” But the Lord would never arrange for you to have only nice neighbors. At least some of them will be troublesome, and the Lord will use them to expose what is within you. He may ask you if you love these difficult neighbors. Perhaps you would say that you find it very difficult. The reason it is difficult is that they are against your being and your natural feeling. This is a test to prove whether you live by yourself or by Christ. Sometimes Christ may love your enemies more than your neighbors, and you must follow Him. However, this is not merely an outward act.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEAuXps7irHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> All these laws touch our being and put us on the cross. The one commandment regarding divorce is enough to crucify all the husbands and wives. Furthermore, the word about saying yes and no also nails us to the cross. The same is true about not resisting the one who is evil and especially <span class="pg" data-page-id="245" id="245">[245]</span> about not hating our enemies.

As sons of our Father, we should deal with the evil and the unjust as with the good and the just (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62187" data-verses="Matthew 5:45">v. 45</span>), love not only those who love us but those who do not love us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62188" data-verses="Matthew 5:46">v. 46</span>), and greet not only brothers but also others (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62189" data-verses="Matthew 5:47">v. 47</span>).</p>

They are the Father’s children, having the Father’s divine life and divine nature. Hence, they can be perfect as the Father. The demand of the new law of the kingdom is much higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. This higher demand can be met only by the Father’s divine life, not by their natural life. The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand. The Gospels firstly <span class="pg" data-page-id="246" id="246">[246]</span> present the highest demand of the kingdom of the heavens in the Gospel of Matthew and lastly afford us the highest supply of the divine life of the heavenly Father in the Gospel of John so that we may live the life of the kingdom of the heavens. The demand of the new law of the kingdom in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62194" data-verses="Matthew 5:1-7">Matthew 5 through 7</span> is actually the regenerated kingdom people’s expression from within their new life—the divine life. This demand, by opening up the inner being of the regenerated people, is to show them that they are able to attain to such a high degree.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57bgWEyaOTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> All the requirements of these changed laws reveal how much the divine life within us can do for us. These laws are not merely a requirement; they are a revelation, showing us that the divine life can even make us perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect. We have this perfecting life within us. We have a life with such a divine nature that it can make us as perfect as our heavenly Father.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faAICun5qZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> We have seen that according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62195" data-verses="Matthew 5:45">verse 45</span> the Father makes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and that He sends rain on the just and the unjust. First the Father makes His sun to rise on the evil, then on the good. If you were the Father, would you make your sun to rise first on the evil or on the good? Certainly you would first make it rise on the good. This verse also says that the Father sends His rain on the just and on the unjust. Notice that the order in this part of the verse is changed. This indicates that in the eyes of the heavenly Father there is no difference in sending the sunshine first on the evil and then on the good and sending the rain first on the just and then on the unjust.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5np3a995o1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> Let us apply this to the matter of dealing with our children. Even in dealing with your own children, you have your choice. This indicates how natural you are. Suppose you have three children. One of your three children may be lovable, one may be naughty, and one may be neutral. Day after day these three children expose you, revealing how much you dislike the naughty one and blame him. Although you do not like him, the heavenly Father loves him more than the lovable one. He has sent him to expose your natural taste. <span class="pg" data-page-id="247" id="247">[247]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn-dwbVw5z3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> We also have our natural taste in the church life. We like the brothers who are gentle and the sisters who are nice. We want all the brothers and sisters to be like this. But this is just a dream, for there will always be some who bother us. Consider the problem of the shortage among the elders. Many brothers are nice and gentle, but they are not capable of being elders. However, the capable ones may be rather sharp. God uses this to expose your natural choice.</p>

The Lord’s word was intended to touch our being, our natural choice, and to expose what we are and where we are. When we have been exposed and subdued, we shall give the full opportunity to the divine life to live in us. This will make us perfect even as our heavenly Father is perfect. We cannot imitate the Father. When I was young, I was taught by those in Christianity that our heavenly Father loves those who are bad and that we should love our enemies just as our Father does. Although this sounds good, it actually is like trying to teach a monkey to behave like a person. You may teach a monkey to behave like a kind gentleman. The monkeys, however, will fail to do this because they are not the sons of that man. We are the sons of our heavenly Father. Thus, the Father’s life and nature are within us. All the outward enemies, compellers, and opponents expose what we are. Because they expose our natural being, we learn not to trust ourselves any longer, but to look to our Father and to realize that we have His life and nature within us. Through this exposure we come to see that we must stay close to Him and live by His life and nature. In this way we shall be perfect as <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> our heavenly Father. This is the kingdom life, the kingdom living.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0i16MkkHs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> Misunderstanding these verses, many Christians have taken them as instructions concerning their outward behavior. This is the reason so many have been disappointed and have said, “This is too much for us. We are far away from it, and we are unable to fulfill it.” This is not a common word given by the Lord Jesus; it is the constitution of the heavenly kingdom. Because we are His kingdom people, we can certainly fulfill these requirements. We have the kingdom life within us, and we can fulfill these laws, not in ourselves, but by the Father’s life and nature. Therefore, we must thank Him for sending so many contrary things into our environment in order to touch our being and to expose what we are so that we may be fully subdued, turn to Him, stay near to Him, trust in Him, and live by Him. Then we shall be the genuine kingdom people with the kingdom life for a proper kingdom living. This is God’s kingdom on earth today, and this is the proper church life.</p>

<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUvV2DU4s0trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> For centuries, Christians have not had a clear understanding of the law. On the one hand, in Romans and Galatians we are told that the law is over. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62197" data-verses="Romans 10:4">Romans 10:4</span> says, “Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one who believes.” Based upon this, many Christians think that they can forget the law. On the other hand, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62198" data-verses="Matthew 5:17">Matthew 5:17</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.” This word has troubled a great many Christians. We praise the Lord that He has given us the clear light on this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbYysaEdLQZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi">THREE ASPECTS OF THE LAW</h2><p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiEKRKzApM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> In order to understand this matter of the law, we must know the three aspects of the law: the principle of the law, the commandments of the law, and the rituals of the law. If you do not differentiate between these three things, you will never have a proper understanding of the law. As we have seen, the principle of the law is over. Today, in the dispensation of grace, God does not deal with us according to the principle of the law; rather, He deals with us according to the principle of faith. Whether or not we shall be justified, saved, and accepted by God depends on the principle of faith, not the principle of the law. As long as we have faith in Christ, we are justified by God, accepted by Him, and saved. This is what it means for the principle of the law to be abolished in Christ under the dispensation of grace. <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0bETRmEM_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> Although the principle of the law has been abolished, the commandments of the law have not been annulled. Instead, the standard of these commandments has been uplifted. Thus, the commandments, related to the moral standards, have not been abolished; they will remain for eternity. Even for eternity we should not worship an idol, murder, steal, or lie. In His heavenly kingdom the King has uplifted the standard of the law in two ways: by complementing the lower laws and by changing the lower laws into higher laws. In this way the morality in the commandments of the law has been uplifted to a higher standard.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEDsHpmoyrHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> The kingly Savior Himself kept all the commandments of the law when He was on earth. Then He went to the cross to die for us. Through His substitutionary death, He fulfilled the law on the negative side. Furthermore, through His substitutionary death, He released His resurrection life into us, and we now have this resurrection life in our spirit. Because we are able to live by this resurrection life, we have the strength, ability, and capacity to have the highest standard of morality. As we walk according to the spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62199" data-verses="Romans 8:4">Rom. 8:4</span>), we fulfill the righteous requirements of the law, fulfilling even more than the law requires. Therefore, we do not abolish the law; rather, we fulfill it in the highest way.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5krna48Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> The third aspect of the law is the rituals of the law. For example, offering sacrifices and keeping the Sabbath are outward rituals of the law. These rituals were also terminated because they were part of the old dispensation of shadows, figures, and types, all of which have been fulfilled by Christ as the reality. We are no longer obligated to observe the rituals of the law. Therefore, the principle of the law and the rituals of the law have been terminated, but the commandments of the law, which require a high moral standard, have not been terminated. Rather, these commandments have been uplifted. By means of Christ as the resurrection life in our spirit, we can fulfill the standard of morality required by the higher law of the kingdom of the heavens. This word should make us clear concerning the law according to its three <span class="pg" data-page-id="251" id="251">[251]</span> aspects: the principle of the law, the commandments of the law, and the rituals of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn9fgbQxZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx">LIVING BY THE FATHER’S LIFE AND NATURE</h2><p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wK4ses_PlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62200" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5</span> the Lord Jesus said, “You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62201" data-verses="Matthew 5:48">v. 48</span>). This word concludes this section of the constitution, a section which is exceedingly high. After reading all these requirements, we all would say that we cannot possibly fulfill them. Then we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62202" data-verses="Matthew 5:48">verse 48</span> which tells us that we must be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect. This verse is an indicator that we have the Father’s life and nature within us. We have been born of Him and we are His children. Because we are His children possessing His life and nature, there is no need for us to imitate Him or copy Him. As long as we grow in His life, we shall be the same as He is. Thus, all the requirements of the law of the kingdom of the heavens reveal how much this divine life and nature can do for us. Our only need is to be exposed so that we may give up all hope in ourselves, When we are exposed, we shall realize that our natural life is hopeless. Then we shall renounce our natural life, turn to the life of our Father, and stay with the divine nature. Spontaneously, this life will grow in us and fulfill the requirements of this highest law. Our need today is to turn to our spirit and walk in our spirit. Whenever we do this, we live by our Father’s life and nature; then spontaneously we fulfill the righteous requirements of the law. It is crucial that we understand this matter, for it is altogether different from our natural concept.</p>
<p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLejxeWCjfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> From my experience I can testify that today I am not under the principle of the law. Hallelujah, I am under the principle of faith, and I have the life of my heavenly Father within me! This life is nothing other than the Father’s dear Son. I am now living by this life in my spirit and walking according to the spirit. By this life in my spirit I spontaneously fulfill the highest requirements of the law of the kingdom of the heavens. This is not my boast; it is my humble testimony to give glory to the Lord. This does not mean <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> that I am able to do anything. It means that He is able, for He is in me as my life. He is able to do the same in you and for you. In order for this to be your experience, you need to have a vision of the hopelessness of your natural life. After your natural life has been thoroughly dug out and exposed, you will realize that it is a hopeless case, that you should have no trust in it, and that you must turn to the Father’s divine life and nature within you. Turn to the Father’s life, stay with the Father’s life, and live by the Father’s life. You can easily turn to the Father’s life because at this very moment it is in your spirit. Simply walk according to your spirit, and all the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled in you.</p>

We can do nothing. As far as the law is concerned, our case is impossible. Therefore, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh, so that “the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62205" data-verses="Romans 8:4">v. 4</span>). Because it was impossible, due to the weakness of our flesh, for the law to be fulfilled, God sent His Son to keep the law on the positive side, and to die for our weakness on the negative side. His purpose in doing so was that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us. The “us” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62206" data-verses="Romans 8:4">verse 4</span> refers to those who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. God sent His Son to keep the law and to die for us that we may walk in the spirit to fulfill the righteous requirement of the law. <span class="pg" data-page-id="253" id="253">[253]</span> </p>

This indicates that the Holy Spirit of God has come into our spirit. This took place at the time of our regeneration. The Spirit of God came into our spirit to regenerate us. From that time onward, the Holy Spirit has been witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62208" data-verses="Romans 8:14">verse 14</span> says, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.”</p>

Thus, we are not God’s creatures trying to copy and imitate Him; we are the Father’s children living the Father’s life. How did we become the children of God? It was by the coming of the Spirit of God into our spirit to regenerate us and to make our spirit the very habitation of God Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62210" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Eph. 2:22</span>, Gk.). Here, in our spirit, we have become God’s children having God’s life and nature. If we walk according to this regenerated spirit, we are the children of God living by God’s life. When we live and walk in the spirit, spontaneously we shall be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-mVUzwxKgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> Consider a brother who has four children. The more these little ones grow, the more they live like their father. These children are not four monkeys trying to imitate a human being. No, they are children of their father who are growing into the image of their father. The more they grow, the more they live their father’s life. Likewise, we are not monkeys—we are children of God. Although some of us may <span class="pg" data-page-id="254" id="254">[254]</span> be rather babyish or childish, we are growing nonetheless. These young ones may be naughty, but they are growing. Wait for a certain number of years, and you will see that all these naughty little ones will be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect. I am so happy that all the saints in the churches are not monkeys, but dear children. Let these children be naughty for a while. Eventually they will grow. We are not trying to imitate God. Rather we are the Father’s children growing in the Father’s life. This is the reason the Lord Jesus said that we should be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5CgwGpIoU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> Now we can understand why in Matthew <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62211" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapter five</span> the Lord refers to us as the children of God or the sons of God. He was not giving a word to unbelievers, to those who were merely God’s creatures; He was giving a word to the sons of God. God is no longer merely our Creator; He is also our heavenly Father. Because He is our Father, we have His life and nature. Eventually, through our growth in life, we shall be the same as He is. Wait for another period of time, and you will see that many of us will have become perfect as the Father is perfect.</p>

Since the life-giving Spirit had not yet entered into them, how can we say that those disciples were regenerated? Remember, there is no time element with God. Instead, there is the principle. When the Lord Jesus was speaking with the disciples on the mountain, giving them the decree of the constitution of the kingdom, He spoke according to the principle, not according to the time element. God has no time element; He does things once for all. In our mind there is such a thing as before and after, but not in God’s mind. Yes, one day Christ accomplished the work of redemption on the cross, and one day the life-giving Spirit was formed. But in God’s eyes it is difficult to determine when these things took place, for in God’s economy they are eternal. Both the cross and life-giving Spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="255" id="255">[255]</span> are eternal. Because those disciples on the mountain had believed in the Lord Jesus and had decided to follow Him, in principle they had been regenerated, and the Lord regarded them as regenerated people.</p>

The Principle—<br/>Not to Do Your Righteousness before Men</h2>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5kr3axu5o1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62213" data-verses="Matthew 5:17-48">5:17-48</span> we saw the complementing and the changing of the law. In these verses, all the new laws of the kingdom of the heavens dig out and expose our temper, lust, and natural being. Thus, in these verses it is not a matter of dealing with our outward behavior, but with our anger, our lust, and our natural being all hidden deeply within us.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn9fwbYjpz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62214" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">Matthew 6:1</span> says, “But take heed not to do your righteousness before men to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you surely have no reward with your Father Who is in the heavens.” Righteousness here denotes righteous deeds, such as giving alms, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62215" data-verses="Matthew 6:2-4">verses 2 through 4</span>; praying, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62216" data-verses="Matthew 6:5-15">verses 5 through 15</span>; and fasting, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62217" data-verses="Matthew 6:16-18">verses 16 through 18</span>. No doubt these verses speak about the righteous deeds of the kingdom people. Actually, however, they expose the self and the flesh. We have something within us that is worse than anger and lust. Everybody knows how ugly lust is, but even many Christians do not know how ugly the self and the flesh are. Of course, the words “self” and “flesh” are not <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> used in these verses. Nevertheless, both the self and the flesh are exposed here. In these eighteen verses the Lord uses three illustrations—the giving of alms, praying, and fasting—to reveal how we are filled with the self and the flesh.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19L_o3BHAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> Man’s flesh, seeking to glorify itself, always wants to do good deeds before men to be praised by them. But the kingdom people, who live in an emptied and humbled spirit and walk in a pure and single heart under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, are not allowed to do anything in the flesh for the praise of men, but must do all things in the spirit for the pleasing of their heavenly Father.</p>
<p data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HA129SLlvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp"> To the kingdom people, God is not only their God, but also their Father. They are not only created by God, but also regenerated by the Father. They have not only the created natural human life, but also the uncreated spiritual divine life. Hence, the new law of the kingdom, decreed by the King on the mountain, is given to them with the intention that they should keep it not by their fallen human life, but by the Father’s eternal divine life, not to gain man’s glory, but to receive the Father’s reward.</p>
<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCm4ittQQ2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> Regarding each of the three illustrations, the Lord uses the word “secret” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62218" data-verses="Matthew 6:4">vv. 4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62219" data-verses="Matthew 6:6">6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62220" data-verses="Matthew 6:18">18</span>). We must do our righteous deeds in secret, for our Father is in secret. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62221" data-verses="Matthew 6:4">verse 4</span> the Lord says that our Father sees in secret. The kingdom people as children of the heavenly Father must live in the presence of the Father and care for the Father’s presence. Whatever they do in secret for the Father’s kingdom, the Father sees in secret. The heavenly Father’s seeing in secret must be an incentive to doing their righteous deeds in secret. In this verse the Lord also said that the Father will repay us. This may transpire in this age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62222" data-verses="2Corinthians 9:10-11">2 Cor. 9:10-11</span>) or in the coming age as a reward (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62223" data-verses="Luke 14:14">Luke 14:14</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk9DeZdK61byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> The effect of doing our righteous deeds in secret is that the self and the flesh are killed. If people in society today are not allowed to make a show of their good deeds, they will not do them. As long as people have an opportunity to make a public display of their righteous deeds, they are glad <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> to perform them. This is the deplorable practice of today’s degraded Christianity, especially in the matter of fund raising, which provides an excellent opportunity for the donors to make a display. The greater the public show, the more money people are willing to give. Certainly such making of a show is of the flesh. Giving alms to the poor in order to show how generous you are is not a matter of anger, lust, or the natural being; it is a matter of the self, the flesh. Making a show in such a way is simply boasting for yourself. Thus, for us as kingdom people, a basic principle concerning righteous deeds is never to make a show of ourselves. As much as possible, hide yourself, keep yourself covered, and do things in secret. We should be so hidden that, as the Lord Jesus says, our left hand does not know what our right hand is doing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62224" data-verses="Matthew 6:3">v. 3</span>). This means that we should not let others know what we are doing. For example, if you fast for three days, do not disfigure your face or show a sad countenance. Rather, give the impression to others that you are not fasting so that your fasting may be in secret. Do not fast in the presence of men, but in the secret presence of your heavenly Father. To do this is to slay the self and the flesh.</p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoPzgK7-Vsw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> We encourage the saints to function in the church meetings. However, there is the danger of functioning in order to make a show of ourselves. There is the danger of doing things in the presence of man. If you consider your own experience, you will realize that perhaps nine times out of ten your functioning has been before men. This is to glorify the self and the flesh. But the constitution of the heavenly kingdom does not yield an inch to our anger, lust, or natural being; neither does it yield any ground to our self and flesh. By the Lord’s mercy and grace, we must do as much as possible in a hidden way. Always try to do those things that are pleasing to God and righteous with man in a secret way. Try not to let others know of them. Simply do your righteous deeds in the presence of God.</p>
<p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCLvdpkEb4qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> Our Father sees in secret. As you are praying alone in your room, no one else can see you, but your heavenly Father sees. Do not pray on the street corner or in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> synagogues to be seen by men. Pray in secret to be seen by your Father who sees in secret. Then you will also receive an answer from Him in secret. I am concerned that many of us have experiences only in the open and that we do not have any experiences in secret. Not only does the Father see our experiences; everyone else sees them as well. This indicates that we are not rejecting the self or repudiating the flesh. We must always do things in such a way as to constantly reject the self and repudiate the flesh. If possible, do everything in secret, not giving any opportunity to your self or yielding any ground to your flesh.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rWGFsThQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> Although the Lord speaks about the matter of reward (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62225" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">vv. 1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62226" data-verses="Matthew 6:5">5</span>), the important thing here is not the reward, but the growth in life. The saints who grow openly do not grow in a healthy way. We all need some secret growth in life, some secret experiences of Christ. We need to pray to the Lord, worship the Lord, contact the Lord, and fellowship with the Lord in a secret way. Perhaps not even the one closest to us will know or understand what we are doing. We need these secret experiences of the Lord because such experiences kill our self and our flesh. Although anger and lust are ugly, the thing that most frustrates us from growing in life is the self. The self is most visible in the fact that it enjoys doing things in a public way, in the presence of man. The self likes to do righteous deeds before man. We all must admit that, without exception, we have such a self. Those who always want to do things in such a way as to make a public show are full of self, full of the flesh. The self loves to be glorified, and the flesh loves to be gazed upon. Probably you have never heard a message on these verses that dealt with the self and the flesh. Whenever we come to this portion of the Word, we must realize that it exposes our self and our flesh.</p>
<div id="displayv"> </div> </body></html></div><div class="section" data-section="2">
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePG3dgWTwGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> To repeat, the crucial matter here is not the reward, but the growth in life. Those saints who know only to make a show of the self and a display of the flesh will not grow in life. The genuine growth in life is to cut off the self. Those whose self has been cut off and whose flesh has been dealt with may sometimes speak concerning their deeds. <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> However, I am quite cautious in saying even this. It is not healthy to expose our righteous deeds. Rather, we should pray much, yet not let others know how much we pray. This is healthy. If you pray every day without telling others or letting them know about it, it means that you are healthy and that you are growing. However, suppose you always tell others how much you pray. If you do this, you will not only lose your reward, but you will not grow in life or be healthy. We all must admit that we have the subtle self, the subtle flesh, within us. We all have such a weak point. When we pray alone in our room, we often wish that others could hear us. Likewise, we do our righteous deeds with the intention that others could see them. Such desires and intentions are not healthy; they indicate that we are not growing in life. Making a public display before men will never help us grow in life. If you want to grow and be healthy in the spiritual life, you must slay the self in the doing of righteous deeds. No matter what kind of righteous deeds we do—giving material things to the saints, praying, fasting, doing something to please God—we must try our best to do them in secret. If your righteous deeds are in secret, you may be assured that you are growing in life and are healthy. But any time you exhibit yourself in your righteous deeds, you are not healthy. Such an exhibition greatly frustrates your growth in life.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvQ3Ngp6vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> The universe indicates that God is hidden, that God is secret. Although He has done a great many things, people are not aware that He has done them. We may have seen the things done by God, but none of us has ever seen Him, for He is always hidden, always secret. God’s life is of such a secret and hidden nature. If we love others by our own life, this life will seek to make a display of itself before men. But if we love others by the love of God, this love will always remain hidden. Our human life loves to make a display, a public show, but God’s life is always hidden. A hypocrite is one who has an outward manifestation without having anything within. Everything he has is merely an outward show; there is no reality inwardly. This is absolutely contrary to <span class="pg" data-page-id="262" id="262">[262]</span> God’s nature and to His hidden life. Although God has so much within Him, only a little is manifested. If we live by this divine life, we may pray much, but others will not know how much we have prayed. We may give a great deal to help others, but no one will know how much we give. We may fast often, but this also will not be known by others. We may have a great deal within us, but very little will be manifested. This is the nature of the kingdom people in the doing of their righteous deeds.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LVELnD9_aKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> This is vastly different from the nature of the worldly people. When the worldly ones donate a hundred dollars, they advertise it, making it appear that they have given a much greater amount. But when we Christians give a hundred dollars, it is better that we only let others know that we have given a dime. We do more than what is visible to others. We can never practice this kind of giving in our natural life. It is possible only in the divine life, the life that does not enjoy making a show. This is the crucial point in this portion of the Word.</p>
<p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY5jvC9YclV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> If we are serious about being the kingdom people, we must learn to live by the hidden life of our Father. We must not live by our natural life, which is always making a display of itself. If we live by our Father’s hidden life, we shall do many things without making any public show of them. Rather, all that we do will be in secret, hidden from the eyes of others. The biographies of many saints reveal that they did certain things in secret, things that often were not made known until after they had died. This is the right way. I have known a number of dear saints who have done things for the Lord, for the church, and for the saints in secret. They never desired to make a display or to let others know that those things were done by them. These deeds are done according to our Father’s nature and according to His secret and hidden life.</p>

Truly I say to you, They have their reward.” Surely the heaven-ruled spirit of the kingdom people restricts them from such fleshly boasting.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYGv-p3TWD97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> When I was in a certain denomination, the offering plate was passed during every Sunday morning service. At that time, copper coins or silver dollars were used instead of paper currency. Some people used to place their donations in the offering plate in such a way as to draw attention to themselves. That was a display of the self. Of course, they did not say anything. Rather, they dropped the coins in the plate in a noisy way. By doing this, they were sounding a trumpet before them. When the time came for public notice regarding contributions to be posted in the lobby, the one who gave the most was listed first, and the one who gave the least was listed last. If the one who had given the most had been listed last, he probably would not have given as much in the future.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUvVmDTrc0trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> For this reason, we in the churches do not keep records of the giving of the saints. The cash is put in the offering box, and there is no opportunity for the self or the flesh to be glorified. The use of checks, however, poses somewhat of a problem. In our practice of the church life in China many years ago, we did not use checks very often. But the use of checks is not a legal matter. Everything depends on our motive and our attitude. I am not saying that the saints should not use checks. The principle is that we do not give with the intention of making a show or receiving glory from man. Instead, we do everything in secret in the presence of our heavenly Father. In this matter, you know what your motive and attitude are.</p>

The Lord repeated His prayer in Gethsemane (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62233" data-verses="Matthew 26:44">26:44</span>), the Apostle Paul prayed the same prayer three times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62234" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:8">2 Cor. 12:8</span>), and the great multitude in heaven praised God with hallelujahs repeatedly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62235" data-verses="Revelation 19:1-6">Rev. 19:1-6</span>).

The Pattern of Prayer</h2><p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn9fwbSzZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62238" data-verses="Matthew 6:9-13">verses 9 through 13</span> we find the pattern of prayer. However, it is not the pattern for all prayers. The prayer presented here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62239" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">Matthew 6</span> is absolutely different from the prayer taught in John. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62240" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">Matthew 6</span> we are not told to pray in the Lord’s name, but in John <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62241" data-verses="John 14:1">chapters fourteen through seventeen</span> the Lord Jesus tells us repeatedly to pray in His name. The reason for this difference is that the prayer here in Matthew is not related to life; it is related to the kingdom. In this short pattern of prayer the kingdom is mentioned at least twice. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62242" data-verses="Matthew 6:10">Verse 10</span> says, “Let Your kingdom come,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62243" data-verses="Matthew 6:13">verse 13</span> says, “For Yours is the kingdom.” The prayer in John, on the contrary, is related to life. Praying in the Lord’s name is not a matter of the kingdom, but a matter of life. To pray in the Lord’s name means that we are one with the Lord. In praying to the Father, we are one with the Lord. Hence, we are praying in His name. To pray in the Lord’s name is actually to pray in the Person of the Lord. We are praying with Him in one name and in one life. Therefore, we are one with Him in life, praying to God the Father. But as we have seen, the prayer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62244" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">Matthew 6</span> is absolutely different, for it is a prayer of the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wK48ep_vlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> If you would have some prayer in life, you must go to John. You must abide in the Lord and be one with Him. You must remain in your spirit and pray in oneness with Him. This is what it means to pray in His name. But the prayer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62245" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">Matthew 6</span> concerns the kingdom. In other words, it is a fighting <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> prayer, a prayer of warfare against God’s enemy for God’s kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLejheTCDfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62246" data-verses="Matthew 6:9">Verse 9</span> begins with the words, “Pray, then, like this.” The words “like this” do not mean to recite. In the Acts and the Epistles there is no example of such reciting. However, in certain Christian denominations today this prayer is recited during every Sunday morning service. I recited this prayer very often as a youth in a denomination. This is not to say that those who recite this prayer are not sincere in doing so. No doubt there have been a good number who were very sincere in their repeating of this prayer.</p>

This is being fulfilled in this age, and it will be fulfilled in the coming kingdom age, when the name of God will be excellent in all the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62247" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psa. 8:1</span>), the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62248" data-verses="Revelation 11:15">Rev. 11:15</span>), and the will of God will be accomplished.</p>

Unbelievers may ask, “What is God? Who is God?” People speak about Jesus Christ in the same way that they speak about Plato or Hitler. They make the name of the Lord Jesus common. But we know that the day will come, in the millennium, when the name of God will be sanctified. But, prior to that time, our Father’s name is wholly sanctified in the church life today. We do not call upon the Father or speak the name of the Lord in a common way. Rather, when we say “Father” or “Lord,” we sanctify these holy names. Thus, we need to pray, “O Father, let Your name be sanctified.”</p>

Thus, the will of God could not be done on earth as in heaven. Hence, God created man with the intention of recovering the earth for Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62254" data-verses="Genesis 1:26-28">Gen. 1:26-28</span>). After the fall of man, Christ came to bring the heavenly rule to earth so that the earth might be recovered for God’s right, that the will of God might be done on earth as in heaven. This is the purpose of the new King establishing the kingdom of the heavens with His followers. The kingdom people must pray for this until the earth is fully recovered for God’s will in the coming kingdom age.</p>

The patterned prayer firstly cares for God’s name, God’s kingdom, and God’s will; then secondly, for our need. This reveals that in this fighting prayer the Lord will still take care of our needs. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62256" data-verses="Matthew 6:11">verse 11</span> we are to ask “today” for our “daily bread.” The King does not want His people to worry about tomorrow (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62257" data-verses="Matthew 6:34">v. 34</span>); He only wants them to pray for their needs today. The term “daily bread” indicates living by faith.

They should ask the Father not to bring them into trial, but to deliver them from the evil one, Satan, the Devil. Remember, the King was led into temptation. The word “trial” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62261" data-verses="Matthew 6:13">verse 13</span> actually means temptation. Sometimes the Father brings us into a situation where we are tried and tempted. Thus, as we pray to the Father, we must recognize our weakness and say, “Father, I am very weak. Do not bring me into trial.” This implies that you admit that you are weak. If you do not recognize your weakness, you will probably not pray in this manner. Rather, you may feel that you are strong. That will be the very time the Father will bring you into trial to show you that you are not strong at all. Thus, it is better for our prayer to indicate to the Father that we know our weakness. We should say, “Father, I fully realize that I am weak. Please do not bring me into trial. There is no need for You to do that, Father, for I recognize my weakness.” Never say to yourself, “Whatever happens, I am confident I can stand.” If that is your attitude, be prepared to be led into the wilderness to confront temptation. Instead of having such an attitude, pray that the Father would not bring you into trial, but that He would deliver you from the evil one. <span class="pg" data-page-id="269" id="269">[269]</span> </p>

Truly I say to you, They have their reward.” To fast is not to refrain from eating; it is being unable to eat because of being desperately burdened to pray for certain things. It is also an expression of self-humbling in seeking mercy of God. To give alms is to give what we have the right to possess, whereas to fast is to give up what we have the right to enjoy.</p>

Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?” In this verse the Lord tells us not to be anxious about our life. The Greek word translated “life” here is soul, in which is the desire, the appetite, for food and clothing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62282" data-verses="Isaiah 29:8">Isa. 29:8</span>). Our life is more than food, and our body is more than clothing. Both <span class="pg" data-page-id="273" id="273">[273]</span> our life and our body came into existence by God, not by our anxiety. Since God has created us with a life and a body, surely He will care for their needs. The kingdom people do not need to be anxious about these things.</p>

Apparently, in this section of the constitution, the Lord is speaking about the dealing of the kingdom people with material riches. Actually, He is dealing with the matter of anxiety. The Lord is wise. After touching our temper, lust, natural being, self, and flesh, He goes on to touch our anxiety. In these verses the word “anxious” is used six times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62285" data-verses="Matthew 6:25">vv. 25</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62286" data-verses="Matthew 6:27">27</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62287" data-verses="Matthew 6:28">28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62288" data-verses="Matthew 6:31">31</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62289" data-verses="Matthew 6:34">34</span>). It may also seem that the Lord is touching our heart, for where our treasure is, there our heart is also. However, our heart is related not only to riches, but to many other things.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVBWW7l8tTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is composed with the Father’s life and nature. Although these chapters do not actually use the words “life” and “nature,” from the context we can see that apart from the Father’s divine life and nature, these chapters are in vain. No one would be able to fulfill the requirements of the kingdom of the heavens without having the Father’s life and nature. Every constitution is based upon a certain kind of life. Suppose you intend to make a constitution for dogs. Undoubtedly such a constitution would be based upon the dog life. It would be unreasonable for this constitution to decree that, every morning, dogs should observe morning watch by flying in the air. Because dogs cannot fly, they could not fulfill such a requirement. But if the constitution told the dogs to keep morning watch by barking, there would be no problem. In like manner, the constitution given by the Lord Jesus on the mount was for the sons of God, and it was based upon the life and nature of the Father. Two verses in <span class="pg" data-page-id="274" id="274">[274]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62290" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapter five</span> indicate this fact. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62291" data-verses="Matthew 5:9">Verse 9</span> says, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62292" data-verses="Matthew 5:48">verse 48</span> says, “You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</p>
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OWiHPLvm0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> Many Christians do not understand this section of the Word because they have not seen that it is based upon the divine life and divine nature. Even many unbelievers have quoted verses from these chapters in their writings, thinking that these chapters are words spoken to all human beings. No, just as the dog life cannot fly, so the human life cannot fulfill the requirements of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. This is a constitution based upon the divine life and the divine nature.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKhxdwrQZy7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> There is no anxiety in the divine life and the divine nature. Anxiety is not of the divine life, but of the human life, just as barking is of the dog life, not of the bird life. Our human life is a life of anxiety, whereas God’s life is a life of enjoyment, rest, comfort, and satisfaction. To God, anxiety is a strange term. With Him, there is no such thing as anxiety. Do you think that God has ever been anxious? Has He ever been afflicted with anxiety? Although God has many desires, He has no anxiety. Our human life, on the contrary, is virtually composed of anxiety; it is constituted with it. Take anxiety away from a human being and the result will be death. A dead man has no anxiety. A figure in a wax museum or a statue in front of a Catholic cathedral has no anxiety, but as long as you are a living person, you cannot escape from anxiety.</p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UATiEcV2MzKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> If we consider the style of the Lord’s speaking in the New Testament, we shall see that it is absolutely different from the speaking of the Apostles. The Apostles, especially Paul, wrote many spiritual books. Although Paul spoke of many divine, spiritual, and heavenly things, his style is nonetheless human. It is the same with the writings of Peter and John. No matter how much the New Testament writers spoke of spiritual and divine things, their style remained human. But the style of the Lord’s speaking in the New Testament is unique. It is utterly impossible to describe it. <span class="pg" data-page-id="275" id="275">[275]</span> If you read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62293" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62294" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62295" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62296" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62297" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">24</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62298" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">25</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62299" data-verses="John 14:1-17">John 14 through 17</span>, you will see that the style of the Lord’s speaking is extraordinary. It is not human or common; it is profound, yet brief, simple, and to the point. This is the divine speaking with the divine style. When I was young, I read a statement written by a certain great French philosopher who said that if the four Gospels were falsehoods, then the person who wrote them was qualified to be Christ. I agree with this word.</p>

<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPLehzlPIGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> In His speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62300" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">chapter six</span> of Matthew, the Lord apparently is dealing with the matter of riches. In reality, however, He is touching the matter of anxiety, the basic problem of our human living. As we have seen, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62301" data-verses="Matthew 6:1-18">6:1-18</span> He apparently dealt with the righteous deeds of the kingdom people, but actually He was touching the self and the flesh. I came to know this not by reading books, but from my experience in the church life. Through my experience I have learned that making a display of righteous deeds is certainly of the self and of the flesh. If we remain on the cross, we would never make such a display. In the same principle, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62302" data-verses="Matthew 6:19-34">6:19-34</span> seemingly touches our wealth, our riches; actually, the Lord’s intention here is to touch anxiety, the source of the problem of our daily living. The whole world is involved with anxiety. Anxiety is the gear that makes the world move. It is the incentive for all human culture. If there were no anxiety regarding our living, no one would do anything. Rather, everyone would be idle. Thus, by touching our anxiety, the Lord touches the gear of human life.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYMU1HrEx6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> When the young people hear this word, they may say, “Hallelujah! Because the Lord Jesus has touched anxiety, the gear of human life, we don’t need to study or work hard. If we are hungry, we can simply eat some leftovers.” This concept is wrong. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62303" data-verses="Matthew 6:26">6:26</span> the Lord Jesus says, “Look at the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father nourishes them.” If the Lord Jesus were here, I would ask Him, “Lord, You liken us to birds. The birds neither sow nor harvest; they just fly in the air and do nothing. Lord, does this mean <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> that we should not do anything? The birds feed on human labor. Lord Jesus, do You mean that we should take advantage of others? Should we forget about working and simply be birds in the air, enjoying life and taking advantage of the labor of others?” I would also ask the Lord, “Lord, You also liken us to lilies. Lilies don’t do anything, but are clothed in more glory than Solomon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62304" data-verses="Matthew 6:28-30">vv. 28-30</span>). Are You saying that we should not do anything, that we should simply enjoy the air, the sunshine, the soil, and the water?” This is the concept held by many young people who quote these words of the Lord Jesus. They say, “Let’s be birds in the air and lilies in the valley.” There is a difficulty in understanding the Lord’s word here. Again I say, if the Lord were here, I would ask Him, “Do You mean that we should just be like birds soaring in the air, taking advantage of the labor of others? They sow and grow the crops, and we simply come to enjoy them. Is this legal? Is it fair? It seems that all birds are thieves. I have only a small yard, but the birds come and take advantage of what I am growing in my yard. Are You saying that we should do the same thing?” I ask these questions because I know the psychology of the young people. After spending so many years in school, they may be tired of studying. As they go from junior high to high school, from high school to college, and from undergraduate school to graduate school, the work becomes more difficult. Instead of studying so hard, many of the young people would rather be like birds flying in the air. If the young people are honest, they will admit that they have such a concept.</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuMd-llpDkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> Let us now consider the Lord’s intention in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62305" data-verses="Matthew 6:19-34">verses 19 through 34</span>. Does the Lord intend that the young people finish school, or drop out and be like birds in the air? It is wrong to have anxiety, for anxiety does not belong to the divine life. There is no anxiety in the life of God. However, the Lord does not mean that we should not do our duty. When the Lord brought the children of Israel into the good land, they all had to work on the land. That was their duty. Whether or not the good land produced a rich harvest depended on a number of things: the weather, the sunshine, <span class="pg" data-page-id="277" id="277">[277]</span> the proper amount of rain, and the right temperature. None of these things was under the control of the children of Israel. Their responsibility was just to labor on the land. They labored not only for themselves, but also for the birds. If they did not do the work of farming, it would have been difficult for the birds to live. To do their duty was right and necessary, but to have anxiety was wrong. Likewise, we must do our duty today, but do it without being anxious about our living. The reason you are so reluctant to give to others is your anxiety. Because of anxiety, you love the material things. If you had no anxiety, you would not care for the material things. Rather, you would let others have them. It is anxiety that causes us trouble.</p>
<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsXdar3fNhgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> In God’s economy we all must labor. We are not like the children of Israel, for we cannot literally work on the good land. Instead, the young people today must study and acquire a good education. Studying is equal to tilling the ground, and graduating from college is equal to reaping a harvest. Young people, studying is your duty, and you must do it. In ancient times, the children of Israel had to labor by tilling the ground, sowing the seed, watering, and harvesting. This was their duty. But whether or not they received the harvest depended upon God. Their responsibility was to labor without having any anxiety. If they were anxious, that would have been an offense to God. There was no need for them to be anxious. They simply had to do whatever God asked them to do. For example, according to Deuteronomy, God required them to set aside one tenth for Himself, another tenth for the Levites, and still another tenth for a different purpose. They were not permitted to keep all the produce for their enjoyment. They were not to have any anxiety. If they had no anxiety, they could be generous, willing to give to others and put their material things into the hand of the Lord.</p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFe4pKQHQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> We need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62306" data-verses="Matthew 6:19-34">6:19-34</span> in such a light. Under God’s sovereignty, the children of Israel had to labor on the land. Under God’s sovereignty, the young people today must study and finish school. If we are to have the proper church <span class="pg" data-page-id="278" id="278">[278]</span> life, all our young people must finish college. Failing to finish college is like sowing without having a harvest. The requirement for making a living today is much different from what it was hundreds of years ago. Today the young people must till the ground, sow the seed, and water the crop by studying diligently and graduating from high school and college. But they must not do this because of anxiety. We must differentiate anxiety from duty. Your duty is to finish your work of farming, that is, to graduate from high school and college. Otherwise, it will be difficult to live. To live on this earth for God, you must finish your education. But as you are studying and completing your education, you must be different from the worldly people. The worldly ones study for the sake of their anxiety; you should not study for anxiety, but to fulfill your duty. If you do not see this point, this portion of the Word will simply be a legal matter to you.</p>
<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgjwt6_x3SNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> Boaz, a forefather of David, is an example of one who did his duty without anxiety. Boaz was a rich farmer; he was very productive. However, this man was not productive for the sake of anxiety, but for the sake of fulfilling his duty. When the time came, the Lord told him to give a certain amount away, and he did it. Certainly Boaz treasured the things in heaven. Through the overcoming of anxiety, he laid up treasures in heaven.</p>

<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I4XI6165x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> After a number of years, many of our young people will have college degrees. I believe that under the Lord’s sovereign blessing, many riches will come in. At that time you will need to remember that you have gone to school not for anxiety, but to do your duty. Therefore, the riches that you bring in should not be used for your anxiety, but for your duty. Your duty is to give, to lay up treasures in heaven. Do not aspire to be a millionaire. Do not endeavor to have a savings account of a million dollars. Rather, learn to give and lay up treasures in heaven. Transfer your treasures from the earth to the heavens. In this way you will not be a millionaire on earth, but a millionaire in the heavens. Your duty is to earn your degree and then to make riches. But do not seek <span class="pg" data-page-id="279" id="279">[279]</span> to become a millionaire. Instead, be a good giver according to the life and nature of your heavenly Father. This is the meaning of this portion of the Word.</p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4LBqyYAv8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> My burden in this message is to dig out this basic point. We all have our duty to do. As we are fulfilling our duty, we should not do anything for the sake of our anxiety, because we have a divine life that knows no anxiety. And we have an almighty and all-inclusive heavenly Father who takes care of us in every way. Today’s world is filled with anxiety, but the kingdom people should not be anxious about anything. We are not able to add one cubit to our stature by our anxiety (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62307" data-verses="Matthew 6:27">v. 27</span>). Concerning morality, we have the life and nature of our Father within us to enable us to fulfill the highest moral requirements. Concerning our living, we have the heavenly Father Himself to take care of us. However, this does not mean that there is no need for us to do our duty. Although we must fulfill our duty, we should have no anxiety. Like the children of Israel who had enough to live on and who gave certain portions away for various purposes, we also should have a harvest and be willing to give a certain amount away for various purposes. Eventually, all we give will be laid up in the heavenly bank, and all our riches will be there.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZXj-dw8iy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> This also is related to our daily growth in life. Both sloppiness and anxiety will delay your growth in life. No one who is idle, who does not fulfill his duty, will ever grow in life. Everyone who grows in life is diligent and industrious. Of course, this diligence and industriousness will yield a reward, and some material riches will come to you. All these riches must be used, not for your anxiety, but for your giving. Anxiety must go. Do not allow anxiety to occupy your daily living. Because the life of the Father within you knows no anxiety, you should not have any anxiety. Any surplus you have should not be used for the sake of your anxiety. Use it to build up savings in the heavenly bank. I assure you that if you do this, you will grow in life. The only kind of person who grows in life is one who is diligent, yet who does not use his surplus for his anxiety. You need to study <span class="pg" data-page-id="280" id="280">[280]</span> diligently, make good grades, and acquire the highest degree. However, the riches that come to you should not be used for your anxiety. We labor and fulfill our duty, but we have no anxiety. This is the proper way to grow in the Father’s life.</p>

Actually, His intention here is to encourage us to forget ourselves and to take care of others. In the two previous chapters, the Lord has dug out our temper, our lusts, our inner being, the self, the flesh, and our anxiety. Now He brings us to the point where we must learn to take care of others. When you judge others, you must judge them according to how you want them to judge you. To consider the matter in this way is to take care of others.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVBWG7vutTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> The heavenly ruling over the kingdom people requires that they take care of others. Although a number of negative points were touched in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62315" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62316" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, the matter of taking care of others is not covered until <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62317" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">chapter seven</span>. In whatever we do, we must think about others. We have a real lack in this area, because in our natural life we do not consider others. From beginning to end, we only consider ourselves. Our thinking and our consideration are wrapped up with ourselves. Therefore, we are always centered around ourselves and never consider others. I would ask you to recall the way you lived in the past. Was it your practice to consider others? If we consider others when we <span class="pg" data-page-id="284" id="284">[284]</span> are about to criticize or judge them, we shall neither criticize nor judge. The reason we judge others and criticize them is that we do not care for them. If we cared for others, we would sympathize with them.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OWiXPA920rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9">A. Not Judging Lest You Be Judged<br/>with What You Judge</h2><p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvQ3tgp4vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62318" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">7:1</span> the Lord said, “Do not judge, lest you be judged.” The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others. The Lord’s word about not judging lest we be judged does not seem to be a word about taking care of others. However, when we probe into this word, we see that it actually means to take care of others. When you are about to judge others, instead you must take care of them.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LVErnD__aKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> Let us seek to find out the secret of this word about not judging. How can we tell that the real meaning here is to take care of others? Are you afraid of being judged? If you are, then you should realize that others are also afraid of being judged. Do you feel bad about being judged by others? If you do, then you should know that others also feel bad about being judged by you. No one likes to be judged. If you do not like to be judged, then what about others? You need to take care of them. If you do not like to be judged by others, why do you judge other people? If you are afraid of being judged, then you must consider others, who also are afraid of being judged. Always take care of others.</p>

If they judge others with righteousness, they will be judged by the Lord with righteousness. If they judge others with mercy, they will be judged by the Lord with mercy. Mercy boasts against judgment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62320" data-verses="James 2:13">James 2:13</span>, Gk.). Do not judge others so much, for you will be judged in the same degree that you judge others. If you take care of others, you will not be judged by them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="285" id="285">[285]</span> </p>

The principle here is the same as with judgment. Apparently, in these verses the Lord does not charge us to take care of others; actually, however, these verses mean that we must take care of others. Are you afraid of being measured by others? If so, then you must take care of others, for they also are afraid of being measured by you. If you take care of others, you will not judge them, criticize them, or measure them.</p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzlldtLccsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> In the past I knew a certain group of Christians who talked a great deal about spirituality. In a sense, their talk was genuine. However, this group had one weak point: it was the practice of measuring others. It seemed that everyone in this group had a little scale in his pocket. Whenever they invited you to tea, they measured you with their invisible scale. Later they would come together to talk about you. Some would ask, “Have you found out where he is?” This means, “Have you measured him?” I also learned that this group did not care at all for the feelings of others; they cared only for their practice of measuring others. Their measuring was actually their criticizing and their judging. I would take this opportunity to encourage you not to measure others. Do not try to determine how spiritual others are, how much growth they have, or what is their condition in life. If you refrain from measuring others, you will be kept from criticizing them and judging them. This is based on the principle of taking care of others.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFCB1m26HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> Those in the group to which I just referred had a difficult time helping others. The reason they could not help others was that the others were under their measurement, judgment, and criticism. In helping others, we must be blind. If you want to help others in the church life, you need to be blind. If you would be a good husband or wife, be blind in taking care of your spouse. Do not measure, judge, or criticize. Do not have any measurement of others. This is a way of showing mercy toward them. If you show mercy toward others, you will receive mercy. But if you measure others without mercy, then you will also be measured without <span class="pg" data-page-id="286" id="286">[286]</span> mercy. With what measurement you mete, it will be measured to you.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYGvep0T2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> Mercy does not do any measuring. This means that mercy imposes no requirements. Anything that requires a measurement is not mercy. Mercy does not know mathematics; it does not know how to add or subtract. Mercy is absolutely blind. Why do you treat me so well when I am so pitiful? It is because you are merciful toward me.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUvVGDQr80trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> Sometimes, by the Lord’s mercy, I have been merciful toward others. Afterwards some of my children, whose eyes were so clear about the situation, said to me, “Daddy, don’t you know how poor this person is? Why were you so good to him?” I was good to him because I was blind. My children, however, were very clear-sighted. But those who are so clear-sighted cannot be merciful. If you would be merciful, you must be like Isaac, who blessed Jacob in a blind way. Likewise, we, the kingdom people, must be blind in dealing with others. If so, we shall be merciful to them and always take care of them. Whenever my children asked me why I was kind to those who did not deserve kindness, I answered, “You don’t know what I am doing. Your eyes are too big and clear. Why did I treat him that way? It was because I was considerate of him.” This is the principle of the kingdom people in dealing with others. For us to deal with others, we must consider them, sympathize with them, and be merciful toward them. The kingdom people must take care of others in their dealings with them.</p>
<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbYysqEabwZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> If you read these verses again and again, you will see that the basic principle hidden here is that we must forget ourselves and take care of others. Do you know why you criticize others and judge them? It is because you think of yourself too much. You neglect the feelings of others and do not care for them. You care only for your feeling. Hence, you judge and criticize others. Therefore, if we would be kept from judging others, we must take care of them. This requires that we forget ourselves and consider others. If we center around ourselves and ignore the feelings of others, <span class="pg" data-page-id="287" id="287">[287]</span> we shall criticize them. But if we take care of others, we shall not judge them.</p>

The splinter in our brother’s eye must remind us that we have a log in our own eye.</p>

In pointing out a brother’s fault, we must realize that we have a greater fault. Our brother’s fault is likened to a splinter, and ours is likened to a log. Thus, once again, the Lord’s intention is that we take care of others. Whenever you try to point out someone else’s fault, you may care for the fault, but not for the person. When you make someone else’s fault to be as large as a log, it shows you care only for his fault, not for him. If you care for the brother, you will not care only for his fault. Rather, you would say, “His fault is merely a splinter when compared to mine, which is a huge log. Therefore, I am happy to overlook his fault.”</p>

Not Giving the Holy Things to the Dogs<br/>nor Casting Pearls before the Hogs</h2><p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCaa4PaBGmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62327" data-verses="Matthew 7:6">Verse 6</span> says, “Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you.” “That which is holy” must refer to the objective truth that belongs to God, and “your pearls” must refer to the subjective experiences which are ours. Dogs do not have hoofs nor do they chew the cud, and hogs divide the hoofs, but do not chew the cud. Thus, both are unclean (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62328" data-verses="Leviticus 11:4">Lev. 11:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62329" data-verses="Leviticus 11:7">7</span>). According to what is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62330" data-verses="2Peter 2:12">2 Peter 2:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62331" data-verses="2Peter 2:19-22">19-22</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62332" data-verses="Philippians 3:2">Philippians 3:2</span>, the dogs and the hogs here refer to people who are religious, but not clean.</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_-Z7HStGhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62333" data-verses="Matthew 7:6">Matthew 7:6</span> is also related to the matter of taking care of others. Many times when you have seen a certain truth, doctrine, or light, you tell others about it with no regard to whether they are “dogs,” “lambs,” or “wolves.” You care only for your feeling of excitement. You may say, “Oh, I have seen the light concerning the church life! The church is glorious and wonderful!” In your excitement, you may share this with the wrong person. This is giving what is holy to the dogs. When you are about to give something holy to others, you must consider those you are speaking to. You should not give the holy things to dogs, nor cast your pearls before hogs. When you talk to others about the holy things, or the truths, and the pearls, or the experiences, you must observe the basic principle of taking care of others. You must determine whether or not people can receive what you intend to share. You must also perceive how much they can receive. In other words, when you talk to others about spiritual things, do not speak according to your feelings or desires; rather, speak to them according to their capacity to receive what you have to say.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57Yi2E0ZOTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> Many times the young people have gone out to tell others about the church or about certain spiritual things they <span class="pg" data-page-id="289" id="289">[289]</span> have experienced. They cared only for their feeling, not for the feelings of the others. Unfortunately, a number of times the others were dogs or hogs, unable to receive anything that was said. Instead, they turned upon the ones sharing, trampled upon the pearls, and tried to bite the brothers. Thus, when we have seen the light concerning certain truths or have experienced certain precious things of the Lord and desire to share them with others, we must take care of those with whom we are sharing. We must ask ourselves, “Can these people receive my testimony? Can they take what I intend to share with them?” If you take care of others, you will not share everything with everybody, and there are some to whom you will not give your testimony. This is the principle of the kingdom people in dealing with others.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faDKiuh6qZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> Often, we talk to others according to our feelings without taking care of their feelings. Perhaps on a certain day you may be very zealous regarding the church life and the Lord’s recovery. But in your zeal you may offend some “dogs.” At other times, because of some fresh experience of Christ, you may say, “Oh, Christ is wonderful! Christ is the brass, the iron, and the weapons to defeat the enemy.” You are so excited about your experience that you tell everyone about it. But some may turn to attack you, saying, “What! We never heard that Christ is weapons. Where did you learn this? And how can you say that Christ is brass and iron? This is blasphemy!” However, if you take care of others, you may not say a word about your fresh experience of Christ. Rather, you will be wise in dealing with them, considering what the “dogs” can take or what the “hogs” can understand. But if you are excited and care only for yourself and not for others, you will get into trouble or even cause trouble. In the past some of our young people have gone to other meetings, and, caring only for their zeal, they spoke out unwisely. They were on fire, but because they did not care for others, they only caused trouble.</p>

What is the significance of this? As we have pointed out, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62343" data-verses="Matthew 7:1-12">7:1-12</span> is concerned with the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others. We have seen that the kingdom people must mainly observe the principle of taking care of others. In judging others or in speaking about holy things, we must take care of others. Let us now consider how <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62344" data-verses="Matthew 7:7-11">verses 7 through 11</span> fit in with this matter.</p>

For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.” It takes experience to understand these verses. By reading these verses again and again in the light of our experience, we can realize that they mean that we must look to the heavenly Father as we are dealing with others. We must ask Him, seek Him, and knock for Him. Many times we have failed to do this. But these verses indicate that at the very time we are contacting people and dealing with them, we must look to the Lord and say, “Lord, tell me how to contact these people. Lord, show me how to deal with them.” Sometimes simply asking will not be adequate. We must seek and even knock. This indicates that contacting people is a serious matter. Never think that it is an insignificant thing. We, the kingdom people, must approach it seriously, never doing it in a light or loose way or merely according to our feeling. Rather, we must do <span class="pg" data-page-id="291" id="291">[291]</span> so by taking care of others. We must ask for a way, seek after a way, and even knock at the heavenly door for a way. Thus, we must ask, seek, and knock; then we shall have the proper way to contact people.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0i24skiGs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> In Matthew, the proper way to contact people is according to the principle of the kingdom. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62346" data-verses="Matthew 7:11">verse 11</span>, after using the examples of a son asking for a loaf and a fish in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62347" data-verses="Matthew 7:9-10">verses 9 and 10</span>, the Lord says, “If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father Who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him?” Because Matthew is a book on the kingdom, no doubt the “good things” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62348" data-verses="Matthew 7:11">verse 11</span> are the things of the kingdom. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62349" data-verses="Luke 11:13">Luke 11:13</span>, the sister verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62350" data-verses="Matthew 7:11">Matthew 7:11</span>, says, “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62351" data-verses="Luke 11:13">Luke 11:13</span> the “good things” are changed to “the Holy Spirit.” If we put these two verses together, we see that the best way for the kingdom people to contact others is according to the kingdom and according to the Holy Spirit. Both the kingdom and the Holy Spirit are the way to contact others. The wisdom we need in properly contacting others is of the kingdom and of the Spirit. As we deal with others, we must ask, seek, and knock. Eventually, we shall receive the guidance to deal with people according to the kingdom and according to the Spirit. Thus, the controlling principle for our contact with others is the kingdom and the Spirit. If our contact with others is based upon this principle, we shall not make mistakes.</p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GsSlFe9gsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> If we consider the past, we shall have to admit that we have made mistakes in contacting people. Some of those contacts were not profitable to anyone. But now we are being trained by the kingdom. We are not loose believers, but serious and strict kingdom people. Our contact with others is according to the principle of the kingdom and the principle of the Holy Spirit. We receive the guidance we need in contacting others by asking, seeking, and knocking. If we ask, we shall receive; if we seek, we shall find; and if we knock, the door will be opened. <span class="pg" data-page-id="292" id="292">[292]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6Xrpq6H-qZ5GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> According to our human thought, we first take the way and then arrive at the door. But the divine concept in the Bible is exactly the opposite. First we pass through the door, and then we walk along the way. The Lord said, “Knock and it shall be opened to you.” This means that the door will be opened to us and then we shall be on the way. If we ask, seek, and knock, the door will be opened to us, and the way will be set before us. Then we shall know how to contact others. In order to contact people, we need an open door and a straight way as our guidance. We can have this open door and straight way only by asking, seeking, and knocking. How much we all need to find a proper and profitable way to contact others, whether unbelievers, saints, or the churches.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovmYjxyiARSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> We all must learn to take care of others and to pray, “Lord, show me the way.” First you need to ask. If the way does not open up, then you must seek. If the way still does not open up, then you must knock. To knock means to come close to the One whom you are seeking. When you ask, there may still be a distance, but when you knock, there is no distance. Rather, you are directly in front of the One you are seeking. Thus, you need to spend time to seek the Lord. In contacting others, we need the asking, the seeking, and the knocking. Then the door will be opened, a straight way will be given to contact people, our contact will be profitable, and we shall be saved from making mistakes.

<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMiuuJFgzAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> Before we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62355" data-verses="Matthew 7:12">verse 12</span>, we need to add a further word about asking, seeking, and knocking. To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and to knock is to reach the door in the closest way. The matter of asking and receiving in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62356" data-verses="Matthew 7:8">verse 8</span> is good for the kingdom people’s prayer concerning their keeping of the new law of the kingdom. They ask for it and they will receive it. The matter of seeking and finding is good for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62357" data-verses="Matthew 6:33">6:33</span>. The kingdom people seek the Father’s kingdom and His righteousness and will find them. The matter of knocking and having the <span class="pg" data-page-id="293" id="293">[293]</span> door opened is good for <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62358" data-verses="Matthew 7:14">7:14</span>. The narrow gate will open to the kingdom people by their knocking.</p>

This promise affirms that the kingdom people are under the care and supply of the Father who is in the heavens. Thus, they are well able to fulfill the new law of the kingdom and live in its reality that they may enter into its manifestation.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-mVkz2xKgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62360" data-verses="Matthew 7:9-10">verses 9 and 10</span>, the loaf and fish which are requested indicate the need of the one asking. When we ask, seek, and knock, we always have a need. Our heavenly Father knows our need and will give us what we need. No human father would give his children a stone for a loaf or a serpent for a fish, but would always give them good gifts. How much more will our heavenly Father give us things which He considers good. Even in our seeking for a way to contact others, He will give us the best way, the way that we need.</p>

CONCERNING THE GROUND<br/>OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE’S LIVING AND WORK</h2><p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgjwsa_1liNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> Before we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62363" data-verses="Matthew 7:13-29">7:13-29</span>, let us review what has already been covered in this constitution. We must be deeply impressed with the fact that the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is based upon the divine life and nature of the kingdom people. We need to keep in mind that the constitution of any people is always according to the life and nature of that people. No one can fulfill the requirements of this constitution unless he has been regenerated and possesses the life and nature of the heavenly Father. Those unbelieving philosophers and teachers who have quoted certain verses from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62364" data-verses="Matthew 5:1-7">Matthew 5 through 7</span> have not understood the words they were quoting. This constitution is not given to unbelievers. Because it is based upon the spiritual, heavenly, and divine life and nature of the kingdom people, only the kingdom people can live according to it. Moreover, not even the kingdom people can fulfill the requirements of this constitution if they do not live according to the divine nature and the divine life within them. This constitution is not given according to the natural life or to the human nature of the kingdom people. To repeat, it is formed according to the divine life and divine nature. <span class="pg" data-page-id="296" id="296">[296]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I4Wo6-o5x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> This constitution firstly reveals the nature of the kingdom people, as unfolded in the nine blessings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62365" data-verses="Matthew 5:3-12">5:3-12</span>. Those items of the constitution that describe what the kingdom people should do and how they should act all correspond to the nature of the kingdom people. Whatever the kingdom people do is an expression of their nature. Their actions, behavior, speech, and outward deeds are the expression of their divine life and nature. What is within them is manifested in their outward behavior. The first section of the constitution, the section concerning the nature of the kingdom people, is therefore very basic. The second section covers the influence of the kingdom people upon the world, and the third deals with the law of the kingdom of the heavens. As we have seen, all the complemented and changed laws expose our anger and lust. Beginning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62366" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">chapter six</span>, the constitution of the heavenly kingdom proceeds to deal with the way the kingdom people perform their righteous deeds. This portion of the constitution digs out the self and the flesh. Following this, the next section tells us that the kingdom people should live on earth without any anxiety. We are not here for anxiety, but for the fulfillment of our duty under the care of our heavenly Father. He will feed us, clothe us, and supply all our needs. Nevertheless, we must fulfill our responsibility for the accomplishment of God’s purpose, yet without anxiety. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62367" data-verses="Matthew 7:1-12">7:1-12</span> the constitution reveals the attitude we should have toward others, how we should deal with them, and how we should take care of them. By the time we reach <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62368" data-verses="Matthew 7:12">7:12</span>, nearly every aspect of our living and behavior has been covered. It seems that the constitution is now complete, perfect, and all-inclusive.</p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4LAKySS_8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> However, one thing remains to be covered: the fact that the kingdom people are on earth doing the will of God our Father. Hence, in the last section there is no dealing with anger, lust, the natural being, the self, the flesh, anxiety, or our attitude toward others. Instead, in this section we read of entering the narrow gate and walking the constricted way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62369" data-verses="Matthew 7:13-14">7:13-14</span>). We also see that we must build a house and do the will of the heavenly Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62370" data-verses="Matthew 7:24-27">vv. 24-27</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62371" data-verses="Matthew 7:21">21</span>). Therefore, <span class="pg" data-page-id="297" id="297">[297]</span> the conclusion of the constitution of the heavenly kingdom ushers us through the narrow gate and to the constricted way; thus we may do the will of the heavenly Father and we may build a house.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EHXn9WnkCzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> As we consider the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens as a whole, we see that it fully reveals what the kingdom people are, what they should be, and what they should do. It also reveals where they are and where they are going. It reveals that on the constricted way, we must do the will of the heavenly Father and we must build a house according to the word of the heavenly King. In the last section of the constitution there is no anger, lust, self, flesh, anxiety, nor any word about our attitude toward others. Instead, there are four crucial words: gate, way, will, and house. Here we have the narrow gate, the constricted way, the will of the heavenly Father, and the house built upon the rock, which is the wise word of the heavenly King. If we are not the people described in the nine blessings and if we are not those fulfilling the complemented and changed laws, we cannot enter through the narrow gate, walk on the constricted way, do the will of the heavenly Father, or build a house on the rock. Thus, this last section is the consummation of the constitution.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhhmzpNSw69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF">A. Entering the Narrow Gate<br/>and Taking the Constricted Way</h2><p data-content-id="Xrfm_0_wHtlK1HVoKjia7ycO6XsNx9Cw0kdxF7iwt4aGYrrICB0YkaHGfAxzlMrpi"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62372" data-verses="Matthew 7:13-14">Verses 13 and 14</span> say, “Enter in through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it.” Who can enter through the narrow gate spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62373" data-verses="Matthew 7:13">verse 13</span>? Only the kingdom people with the nature described in the nine blessings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62374" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapter five</span>. Those who enter the narrow gate must be poor in spirit, mourning, meek, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, making peace with all men, willing to be persecuted for the sake of righteousness, and willing to be reproached for Christ. Only those with such a nature can enter through <span class="pg" data-page-id="298" id="298">[298]</span> the narrow gate. Furthermore, those who enter through this narrow gate must be under the higher laws of the kingdom, the complemented and changed laws, and they should not have any anxiety concerning their living. Rather, they must have the confidence that their heavenly Father is taking care of them. Moreover, they should not be lazy or idle, but diligent and industrious. These are the people who enter through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuaqLtTplDi_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> This way is constricted, limited, on every side. The gate is narrow and the way is constricted because the new law of the kingdom is stricter and the demand of the kingdom is higher than that of the old covenant. It deals not only with outward conduct, but also with inward motive. The old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with its glory are all excluded. Only that which corresponds to God’s will can enter in. The kingdom people need firstly to enter such a narrow gate and then to walk on such a constricted way. It is not walking the way first and then entering the gate. To enter the gate is simply to begin walking on the way, a way which is lifelong.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVBX27m9NTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> We all are happy to be in the Lord’s recovery and appreciate the recovery very much. But let me ask you this question: As one in the Lord’s recovery, are you walking on the constricted way? We all must be able to say that we are not taking the way of Christianity, but the way of constriction. We are constricted on every side. Those in Christianity can use rock music or other worldly methods in their services, but we cannot, because our way is constricted. All young people desire to be free, that is, to put off all restriction. When the young people graduate from high school, they are like caged birds wanting to be free. However, many are so free that they have no constriction, no restriction. We in the Lord’s recovery, on the contrary, are taking a constricted way. We must even have some restriction in the practice of pray-reading. In our pray-reading we should not be like worldly people at a ball game who have no restrictions. We in the Lord’s recovery must walk in our spirit. Living in spirit and walking in spirit restrict us. Even <span class="pg" data-page-id="299" id="299">[299]</span> when we are loving, rejoicing, and happy, we must be under restriction. We must not be like those who throw off all restraint in their excitement. Rather, we must be excited within the limit of the spirit. This must even be true in the meetings. Although we may fully release our spirit, we should be restricted as far as physical activity is concerned. In everything, we need to take the constricted way, not the broad way.</p>
<div id="displayv"> </div> </body></html></div><div class="section" data-section="2">
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OWjnPIuG0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> We must take the constricted way in our fellowship with the brothers. Do you intend to praise a brother? You must praise him in a constricted way. Are you about to rebuke a brother? You must rebuke him in a constricted way. Are you having fellowship with some brothers? This is excellent, but you must fellowship with them in a constricted way. Sometimes when you are having fellowship, you forget all limitation. You go on hour after hour without taking care of the need for food or rest. Furthermore, in your fellowship you talk about everything from the archangel Michael, to Martin Luther, to all the brothers and sisters in the church. You fellowship about everyone without any restriction. Praise the Lord that we are truly free. Nevertheless, we still have the limitations, restrictions, and constrictions.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKhw9woQ5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> Consider the example of the Lord Jesus in John <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62375" data-verses="John 7:1">chapter seven</span>. When His brothers proposed that He go into Judea and make Himself known to the public, the Lord said, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62376" data-verses="John 7:6">John 7:6</span>). The Lord’s word indicates that He was limited, that He was walking a constricted way. As the kingdom people, we also must walk on a constricted way. Our way is full of limitations, restrictions, and constrictions. But do not consider any limitation a frustration. Rather, the limitations will speed us on our way. If we refuse to be constricted, our progress will be slowed down. However, if we are willing to be limited and constricted, our speed will increase. After having passed through all the preceding six sections of the constitution, in the last section we are ushered through the narrow gate, and we are on the constricted way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> </p>

The Wide Gate and the Broad Way<br/>Leading to Destruction and Many Entering It</h2><p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPLfBzmMoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62377" data-verses="Matthew 7:13">verse 13</span> the Lord said, “For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.” Destruction here does not refer to the perdition of the person, but to the destruction of his deeds and works (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62378" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:15">1 Cor. 3:15</span>). There is no doubt that today’s Christianity leads people to destruction. Time will prove that this is true. By the Lord’s mercy, I will never take the way of Christianity, because deep in me I have the conviction that it is a broad way leading to destruction. But the narrow gate and the constricted way lead to life. If you take the way of Christianity, the broad way, your spirit will become deadened immediately. Eventually, everything you do will be destroyed, for that broad way leads to destruction. This is not my opinion; it is the word of the Apostle Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62379" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYMVVHoHR6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62380" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span> Paul says that he has laid the foundation, which is Christ, and that others are building upon it. Paul then says, “Let each one take heed how he builds upon it,” for we may build upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, or with wood, hay, and stubble. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62381" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:13-15">verses 13 through 15</span> Paul says, “The fire itself will test each one’s work, of what sort it is. If anyone’s work which he has built upon it shall remain, he shall receive a reward. If anyone’s work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, yet so as through fire.” In these verses Paul seems to be saying, “Take heed how you are building. If you build with gold, silver, and precious stones, you will be rewarded.” This is the work on the constricted way which leads to a living reward in life. However, Paul also seems to be saying, “If your work is of wood, hay, and stubble, it will be burned by fire, and you will not receive a reward.” In other words, such a work will result in destruction. You may claim to be a Christian worker, but what kind of material are you building with? From these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62382" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span> we see that not only those who build theaters and gambling casinos will <span class="pg" data-page-id="301" id="301">[301]</span> be led to destruction, but also those who build Christian cathedrals and chapels. The fire will try the nature of your work. If your work is of wood, hay, and stubble, it is certainly on the broad way leading to destruction.</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuMcellrDkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> Because we are not on the broad way, but on the constricted way, there are many things that we cannot do. I would rather have an ounce of gold than many pounds of wood. I do not want to have a huge pile of wood, hay, and stubble, for that will only result in a larger fire. I would rather have a small amount of gold, silver, and precious stones. Although we want to see the increase in all the churches, we do not want the increase on the broad way. Rather, we want the increase on the constricted way, the increase of gold, silver, and precious stones. If we have this kind of increase, the Lord will have a testimony on the constricted way.</p>

This means that on the constricted way we must be alert for any kind of falsehood. The Lord said regarding the false prophets, “By their fruits you shall know them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62387" data-verses="Matthew 7:16">v. 16</span>). We know a prophet not by his talk, preaching, or work, but by his fruit. All Christians today are accustomed to being influenced by people’s talk. An <span class="pg" data-page-id="302" id="302">[302]</span> eloquent speaker with enticing words is able to seduce many. Do not listen to eloquent speech or to enticing words.

Because the doors are wide open, some self-appointed prophets may try to come in, claiming that they know certain things and can do certain works. Let them say whatever they will, for we shall look to the Lord to prove them by their fruit. We need to apply this principle to every such case. Do not listen to eloquent speech, but consider the fruit. Every good tree produces goodly fruit, but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit. Every tree that does not produce goodly fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62388" data-verses="Matthew 7:17-19">7:17-19</span>).</p>

To enter into the kingdom of the heavens we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father. To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62390" data-verses="Romans 10:13">Rom. 10:13</span>), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father.

You are My brothers, My companions, and My partners. You and I are walking the same way and doing the same will. You are living with Me according to the will of My Father.” In this last section of the constitution, it is no longer a negative matter of dealing with our temper, lust, self, flesh, and anxiety. It is absolutely a positive matter of doing the will of the Father who is in heaven. The kingdom people are not for anything other than doing the will of the Father. We are not here merely to overcome our temper, our lusts, our self, and our flesh, and to be kind and sympathetic to others. We are here for the accomplishment of the will of the heavenly Father. In order to do the will of the Father, we need to walk in the constricted way. In the teachings of the worldly philosophers, there is neither the divine life and divine nature nor the divine way. But here the ultimate issue of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is the will of the heavenly Father. This means that we have a heavenly Father and that we are the Father’s sons. However, in the last section of the constitution it is not only a matter of life, but also a matter of the will of the Father. Our Father has a will to accomplish, but we can accomplish it only by His life. We need to live in the life of the heavenly Father and also by that life. This kind of living is for the doing of the Father’s will.</p>

However, it is clearly revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62394" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>. The Father’s will is to build the church upon the Son as the rock. This is fully developed in the Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation. The New Testament reveals that God’s divine, eternal will is to build up the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="304" id="304">[304]</span> </p>

In this verse Paul says, “For that which I do, I allow not.” The Lord never approved those who prophesied, cast out demons, and did many works of power in His name, but not according to the will of the heavenly Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62401" data-verses="Matthew 7:21">v. 21</span>). The Lord did not deny that they did those things, but He considered those things as lawlessness because they were not done according to the will of the heavenly Father. They were not done in the line of the divine will. The Lord seemed to be saying, “You prophesied in My name, you cast out demons in My name, and you did many works of power in My name, but I never allowed you to do them. I never approved you because you did all those things in a lawless way. You did them in yourself, in your own desire, and according to your own intention, not according to the will of My Father.” Thus, those who do such things, even in the Lord’s name, will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but will depart from the Lord; that is, they will be rejected from the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age. <span class="pg" data-page-id="305" id="305">[305]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rWHVsRhQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> We see from the Lord’s word here that certain works may be done in the Lord’s name, and yet not be done according to the will of God. Are you doing this kind of work, or are you doing God’s will? We have talked a great deal about going to the campuses, but are we going there to do a certain work, or to do the will of our heavenly Father? Young brothers and sisters, how would you answer this question? Are you going to the campuses to do the will of the heavenly Father? We must have the assurance in whatever we do, that we are doing the will of the heavenly Father. Otherwise, the Lord Jesus will say to us, “Workers of lawlessness.” Even prophesying in the Lord’s name, but not according to the will of the Father, is a type of lawlessness. Moreover, casting out demons in the Lord’s name and doing works of power in the name of the Lord, but not according to the will of God, are also considered in the eyes of the heavenly King as lawlessness.</p>
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePG2NgUTwGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> The runners in any race must run in the proper lanes. Although you may run faster than others, your running will not be recognized if you run outside the lines of your lane. Rather, that type of running will be considered lawlessness. You must run the race between the lines, that is, you must run in a constricted way. Today the work of many Christian workers is not restricted by the heavenly lines. In their own eyes, they have done a great deal in the Lord’s name and for the Lord. In the eyes of the Lord, however, their work is a kind of transgression, a violation of the heavenly lines. Hence, their work is lawlessness. The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62402" data-verses="Matthew 7:21-23">7:21-23</span> is a strong word of warning to us all that we should not care only for prophesying, for casting out demons, or for works of power. We must take care of the heavenly lines. If you transgress the lines as a runner in the heavenly race, you will be disqualified. There are constricting lines in the Lord’s recovery, and we must be constricted in our running. If we run between the lines, not outside of them, we shall be approved by the Lord.</p>

Now we are running on this constricted way. We should not care for prophesying, for casting out demons, or for works of power. Instead, we should care only for doing the will of our heavenly Father. You may wonder how we can know the Father’s will. We can know it by the Father’s life and nature within us. The Father’s nature will always tell us “yes” or “no.” If you are running according to the divine nature and within the constricted lines, the divine nature will indicate, “Yes, you are right; go on.” But if you are not running according to the divine nature or if you step outside the lines, the divine nature will say, “Don’t go this way.” There is no need for anyone to tell you what to do, for the regulating, constricting, divine nature is within you. This nature tells you where you are. Because a runner in a race can see the lines, he needs no one to tell him whether or not he is inside the boundaries. Likewise, we have the constricting lines within us, the lines of the divine life and the divine nature, and we can tell where we are. According to the divine nature within us, we cannot use rock music in our meetings. Although you may try various worldly methods, the divine nature would disagree with them all and indicate that you are transgressing the lines. All those who are the kingdom people, all those who have been regenerated by the Father, have His life and nature within them. The Father’s life and nature indicate whether or not we are in the constricted way. Let us all run the race according to the Father’s nature.</p>

All these will test the living and work of the kingdom people. Although the rain may descend, the rivers may come, and the winds may blow, the house built upon the rock will not fall because it is built according to the constricted way, the way of doing the will of the Father. The house built on the rock which does not fall is like the building work of gold, silver, and precious stones, which can stand the testing fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62405" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12-13">1 Cor. 3:12-13</span>).</p>

This is to enter the wide gate and walk on the broad way that leads to destruction. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62407" data-verses="Matthew 7:27">Verse 27</span> says, “And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat against that house; and it fell, and the fall of it was great.” The house built on the sand which falls is like the building work of wood, hay, and stubble, which will be burned by the testing fire. However, the builder himself will be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62408" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:12-15">1 Cor. 3:12-15</span>).

<p data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HA029WZVvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp"> In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens there are four verses that tell us how we can enter into the kingdom of the heavens. The first is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62410" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>, which says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.” The second says, “Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62411" data-verses="Matthew 5:10">5:10</span>). Both of these verses refer to the present. If we would be in the reality of the kingdom today, we need to be poor in our spirit and to be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. The reality of the kingdom today depends mainly upon righteousness. We are ushered into the reality of the kingdom by being poor in spirit. After we have had a change in our mind, we turn to the Lord and become empty in our spirit. In this way the Lord enters our spirit with His heavenly kingdom. From that moment, we begin to live in the reality of the kingdom. By being righteous, we are kept in this reality. However, if we are unrighteous, we are outside the reality of the kingdom. As long as we maintain righteousness, we are preserved in the reality of the kingdom. Examine your daily life. If you are loose, too free, and careless about righteousness, you are immediately separated from the reality of the kingdom. If we would be in the reality of the kingdom today, we must be poor in our spirit, and we must keep ourselves in righteousness, willing even to suffer for the sake of righteousness.</p>
<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCm5itqCQ2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> The other two verses that tell us how to enter the kingdom both refer to entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the future. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62412" data-verses="Matthew 5:20">Matthew 5:20</span> says, <span class="pg" data-page-id="310" id="310">[310]</span> “For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.” This refers to participating in the manifestation of the kingdom. If we would enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, we need the surpassing righteousness. Hence, righteousness not only keeps us in the reality of the kingdom, but also brings us into the manifestation of the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk9CeZbYq1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> The last verse is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62413" data-verses="Matthew 7:21">7:21</span>, which says, “Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father Who is in the heavens.” This verse reveals that in order to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we must do the will of the Father. Therefore, it is righteousness and the doing of the Father’s will that will usher us into the manifestation of the kingdom. Righteousness refers mainly to our living, and doing the will of the Father refers mainly to our work. Both our living and our work must be according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. If our living is according to this constitution, it will be righteous. And if our work is according to the constitution, it will be the doing of the will of God. This kind of living and work qualifies us to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom. Therefore, by being poor in our spirit, we are ushered into the reality of the kingdom, and through righteousness we are kept in this reality. By the surpassing righteousness and the doing the will of the Father, we shall enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

The order of Matthew’s record, proving that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, is according to doctrine. In his Gospel, Matthew put certain instances together to present a doctrine. The order of Luke’s record, revealing that Jesus is the proper man to be man’s Savior, is according to morality. The order of John’s record, testifying that Christ is the Son of God and even God Himself, is also somewhat according to history. Therefore, in the four Gospels there are three kinds of sequences: historical, doctrinal, and moral. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62422" data-verses="Matthew 8:1-17">Matthew 8:1-17</span> three miracles—the cleansing of the leper, the healing of the paralyzed Gentile servant boy, and the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law—and the healing of many are grouped together to present a meaningful doctrine, that is, they have a dispensational significance. Let us first consider the healing of the leper (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62423" data-verses="Matthew 8:1-4">vv. 1-4</span>).</p>

The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper. According to the scriptural examples, leprosy comes from rebellion and disobedience. Miriam became leprous because of her rebellion against Moses, God’s deputy authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62431" data-verses="Numbers 12:1-10">Num. 12:1-10</span>). Naaman’s leprosy was cleansed because of his obedience (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62432" data-verses="2Kings 5:1">2 Kings 5:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62433" data-verses="2Kings 5:9-14">9-14</span>). All fallen human beings became leprous in the eyes of God because of their rebellion. Leprosy is the expression of rebellion. Rebellion is inward, and leprosy is the outward manifestation. Now the kingly Savior comes to save men from their rebellion and cleanse them from their leprosy that they may become His kingdom people.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCabYPZCmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> Leprosy is a filthy disease. In the Old Testament a leper had to be excluded from the camp of the children of Israel until he was cleansed. This indicates that anyone among the people of God who is rebellious and thereby becomes leprous will be cut off from the fellowship of God’s people until he is healed. The leper here represents the Jews. The Jews have become rebellious against God. Thus, in God’s eyes they are lepers. Nevertheless, the heavenly King came first to them, not to judge them, but to heal them. As the Lord indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62434" data-verses="Matthew 9:12">9:12</span>, He came as a Physician to heal the sick. He came first to reach the Jews to heal them and to bring them salvation.</p>

But the centurion’s servant was not healed by the King’s direct touch. Rather, he was healed by the King’s word. The Gentile centurion believed in this word, and his servant was healed. The Jews are always saved through the King’s direct touch, but we Gentiles are saved, not by His direct touch, but by the sending out of His saving word. We believe in this word and we are healed. None of us Gentiles has had a direct touch from the Lord. We have been saved through believing the enlivening, regenerating word of the gospel. Hence, the centurion’s servant represents all the Gentile believers. The Lord did not commend the faith of the leper, because faith was not the outstanding characteristic there. The significant thing was the King’s touch. But with the healing of the centurion’s servant, faith is very outstanding. Hence, the Lord praised the centurion’s faith.

At that time, during the great tribulation, in the eyes of God the Jews will be in a fever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62466" data-verses="Matthew 8:14">v. 14</span>), hot in things other than God. The kingly Savior, after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, will come back to this remnant of Jews that they might be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62467" data-verses="Romans 11:25-26">Rom. 11:25-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62468" data-verses="Zechariah 12:10">Zech. 12:10</span>).

However, it will not come back to the scattered Jews, but to the Jews in the house of Israel. At that time the Jews will be sick of a fever. This is even true of the Jews today. So many of them are fervent in science, in finance, in education, and in all manner of worldly pursuits. But in the eyes of God all this is a fever. The temperature of the Jews today is very high in their fervency for politics, industry, agriculture, and warfare. They are represented by the feverish mother-in-law of Peter. But in their heat and fervency they neither trust in God nor care for morality. Just as the Lord healed Peter’s mother-in-law, so will He come back again at the end of this age to heal the Jews who will be fervent, burning, and sick of a fever. He will not heal them through their faith, but through His direct touch. At the Lord’s second coming, the Jews will be directly touched by His arrival and be saved.</p>

The King of the kingdom did not even have a resting place, as the foxes and birds do. This proves that the kingdom which He was establishing was not material in the earthly nature, but spiritual in the heavenly nature. The Lord seemed to be saying to the scribe, “Do you intend to follow Me? You have underestimated the price. You, a scribe, a learned one with a high rank in society, must realize that I am nothing and that I have nothing. I have even less than the birds and the foxes, for I have nowhere to lay My head.” I believe that the scribe was disappointed and that he did not follow Him. The principle of following <span class="pg" data-page-id="319" id="319">[319]</span> the Lord is the same today. We must consider the price. In following this King, there is no material enjoyment.</p>

The Lord said, “Follow Me and leave the dead to bury their own dead.” How wonderful the Lord Jesus is! He purposely disappointed the first and deliberately encouraged the second. The Lord was very wise in dealing with people. If I had been the Lord Jesus, I would have been excited to hear that a scribe wanted to follow me, and I would have encouraged him to do so. The Lord, however, was cool toward him and did not encourage him at all. Rather, He seemed to say, “Will you follow Me? You have a nice bed, a comfortable place to lay your head. But if you come to follow Me, you will not have a place to lay your head. I have even less than the birds and the foxes do.” Thus, He discouraged this person of high rank. But to the disciple who had been warned by this case not to follow the Lord in a light or loose way, the Lord gave a word of encouragement. The Lord’s word encouraged him to forget about all the preparations he was making, to leave the dead to bury the dead, and to follow Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="320" id="320">[320]</span> </p>

First, as we follow Him, we should not expect to have any material enjoyment. Second, in order to follow Him, we must ignore the requirements of the dead. The Lord told the disciple to “leave the dead to bury their own dead.” The first dead refers to the people who are spiritually dead, as mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62483" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62484" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5">5</span>; the second refers to the physically dead father of the disciple. Eventually, the spiritually dead will fulfill the duty of burying the physically dead. Through experience we have learned that we should not go back to fulfill the duty for the dead. Let the dead perform these duties on behalf of the dead. We are the living ones and we must go on to follow the King. But do not expect any material enjoyment, for you may have no nest, no roost, no place to lay your head. If you do not expect any material enjoyment and if you will leave the dead duties to the dead, you can go on to follow Him.</p>

THE AUTHORITY OF THE KING</h2><p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzlkNtMP8sSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62485" data-verses="Matthew 8:23">8:23—9:8</span> we see the authority of the King. The sequence of Matthew is wonderful. After the King spoke in a way to indicate that He had nothing, not even a home or a place to rest, and after not allowing His followers to perform the dead duties, the record of Matthew reveals the authority of this King. Although He had nothing, He had authority. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62486" data-verses="Matthew 8:23">8:23—9:8</span> this authority is of three aspects: the authority over the winds and the sea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62487" data-verses="Matthew 8:23-27">8:23-27</span>); the authority over the demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62488" data-verses="Matthew 8:28-34">8:28-34</span>); and the authority to forgive sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62489" data-verses="Matthew 9:1-8">9:1-8</span>).</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFCAlmwp3NHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ">A. Over the Winds and the Sea</h2><p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYGuOp9A2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> The Lord’s authority was manifested over the winds and the sea. This is not an ordinary authority; rather, it must be counted as an extraordinary authority. The Lord and His disciples were in a boat, and “a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62490" data-verses="Matthew 8:24">v. 24</span>). When the disciples, fearing that they would perish, roused the Lord from sleep (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62491" data-verses="Matthew 8:25">v. 25</span>), He said, “Why are you fearful, you of little faith?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62492" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">v. 26</span>). Faith comes from the word of the Lord and depends upon that word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62493" data-verses="Romans 10:17">Rom. 10:17</span>). The Lord gave them the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62494" data-verses="Matthew 8:18">verse 18</span> “to depart to the other side.” If they had believed that word, they would not have needed to pray as they did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62495" data-verses="Matthew 8:25">verse 25</span>. Their realization of the Lord’s word was not a full realization; thus, they were those of little faith. <span class="pg" data-page-id="322" id="322">[322]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUvUWDY4s0trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62496" data-verses="Matthew 8:26">Verse 26</span> says, “Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.” As the Lord and the disciples were sailing across the sea, on their way to cast out the demons, something in the air and under the sea began to cause them difficulty. In the air there were the fallen angels, and in the water there were the demons. Thus the Lord’s command was not actually spoken to the winds or to the sea, but to the fallen angels in the air and to the demons underneath the water. A rebuke is not given to things without life, but to things with personality. The King rebuked the winds and the sea because in the wind are the fallen angels of Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62497" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>), and in the sea are the demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62498" data-verses="Matthew 8:32">Matt. 8:32</span>). The fallen angels in the air and the demons in the water collaborated to frustrate the King from going to the other side of the sea, because they knew He would cast out the demons there (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62499" data-verses="Matthew 8:28-32">vv. 28-32</span>). As soon as the King commanded the fallen angels and evil demons to stop, they immediately obeyed, and there was a great calm. The calm being great was in contrast to the measure of their faith, which was little (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62500" data-verses="Matthew 8:26">v. 26</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPLfhzmOoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62501" data-verses="Matthew 8:27">Verse 27</span> says, “And the men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey Him?” Actually, it was not the winds and the sea, but the fallen angels above the winds and the demons under the sea that obey the King’s authority. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62502" data-verses="Matthew 8:23-27">verses 23 through 27</span> we see a manifestation of the King’s supernatural authority. He had no hole, no roost, no place to lay His head; however, He had supernatural authority over the natural environment. He is fully qualified to be the heavenly King of the heavenly kingdom. Apart from Him, there has never been on earth a King with such extraordinary authority.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYMV1HoFR6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo">B. Over the Demons</h2><p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuMc-lmrjkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> When the Lord Jesus had come to the country of the Gadarenes, He was met by two who were possessed by demons. When the two possessed by demons met the Lord Jesus, the demons cried out, saying, “What have we to do <span class="pg" data-page-id="323" id="323">[323]</span> with You, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62503" data-verses="Matthew 8:29">v. 29</span>). The King called Himself the Son of Man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62504" data-verses="Matthew 20:1">v. 20</span>), but the demons called Him the Son of God, tempting Him to deviate from His standing as the Son of Man. The demons asked Him if He had come to torment them before the time. The words “before the time” imply that God has appointed a time for the demons to be tormented and that the demons knew that time. It will be after the millennium and for eternity. (See note on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62505" data-verses="Revelation 20:13">Revelation 20:13</span> in Recovery Version of Revelation.)</p>
<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsXcar0dthgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> The demons, not wanting to be tormented before the time, entreated the Lord Jesus, saying, “If You cast us out, send us into the herd of hogs” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62506" data-verses="Matthew 8:31">v. 31</span>). The fact that the demons entreated Him indicates that they were under the power and authority of the King. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62507" data-verses="Matthew 8:32">Verse 32</span> says, “And He said to them, Go! And they came out and went into the hogs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the precipice into the sea and died in the waters.” The word “Go!” was the King’s authoritative order, and the demons obeyed it. The King answered the demons’ entreaty to enter into the hogs because hogs are unclean in the eyes of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62508" data-verses="Leviticus 11:7">Lev. 11:7</span>). Unable to tolerate being possessed by the demons, the hogs rushed into the sea. The demons agreed to this, because the water is their lodging place (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62509" data-verses="Matthew 12:43-44">12:43-44</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFe5pKSGQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> The Lord’s intention in permitting the demons to go into the hogs was not to damage the occupation of those who fed them. Because hogs are dirty in the eyes of God, the Lord Jesus destroyed their unclean occupation with the expectation that those employed in it might be saved and turn to Him. The hogs, unclean and condemned by God, should not have been present.</p>
<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgjws6_z2SNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> When the report concerning the hogs came to those who owned them, the owners were offended. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62510" data-verses="Matthew 8:34">Verse 34</span> says, “And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw Him, they entreated Him that He might depart from their districts.” They begged the Lord Jesus to leave, and He did depart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62511" data-verses="Matthew 9:1">9:1</span>). The city people, having lost their hogs, rejected the King. They wanted their unclean <span class="pg" data-page-id="324" id="324">[324]</span> hogs, but not the King of the heavenly kingdom. They were probably Gentiles. (Gadara was on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, opposite to Galilee of the Gentiles—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62512" data-verses="Matthew 4:15">4:15</span>.) They rejected the heavenly King because of their unclean way of making a living.</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I4WI6375x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> The King’s coming to this district set everything in order. Not only were the demons cast out of the two men, but the hogs were drowned. Hence, the whole region was cleared, and the demons returned to their dwelling place. This was an exhibition of the Lord’s authority.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4LAqyaBv8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc">C. To Forgive Sins</h2><p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZXi-dy_iy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62513" data-verses="Matthew 9:1-8">9:1-8</span> we see the King’s authority to forgive sins. After the Lord had come to His own city, Capernaum, where He now dwelt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62514" data-verses="Matthew 4:13">4:13</span>), a paralytic was brought to Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62515" data-verses="Matthew 9:2">Verse 2</span> says, “And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Have courage, child, your sins are forgiven.” The men who had brought the paralytic to the Lord Jesus had uncovered the roof where the Lord was and had broken it up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62516" data-verses="Mark 2:4">Mark 2:4</span>). By this the Lord saw their faith. The mention of sins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62517" data-verses="Matthew 9:2">verse 2</span> indicates that the paralytic was sick because of his sins.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS52K8fW-asIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62518" data-verses="Matthew 9:3">Verse 3</span> says, “And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.” The scribes, assuming that they knew the Scriptures, thought that only God had authority to forgive sins, and that Jesus, who in their eyes was only a man, blasphemed God when He said, “Your sins are forgiven.” This indicates that they did not realize that the Lord was God. By uttering such a word, they rejected the King of the heavenly kingdom. This was the first rejection by the leaders of the Jewish religion. According to the scribes, the Lord Jesus was assuming to be God and was blaspheming Him. But the Lord Jesus, of course, did not blaspheme at all, for He is God. As God, He not only has authority over the natural environment and over demons; He also has the full authority to forgive people of their sins. <span class="pg" data-page-id="325" id="325">[325]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2wYLbE-QUEzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> The Lord perceived in His spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62519" data-verses="Mark 2:8">Mark 2:8</span>) the reasoning of the scribes. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62520" data-verses="Matthew 9:4-5">Verses 4 and 5</span> say, “And Jesus, knowing their inward reasonings, said, Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts? For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Rise and walk?” The Greek word rendered “inward reasonings” also means cogitations, thoughts, evil surmisings with strong feeling or passion. The scribes did not have to give utterance to their reasonings because the Lord Jesus through the perception of His spirit was able to discern the reasonings within their hearts, and He asked them concerning them. The Lord’s perceiving of the reasonings of the scribes indicates that He is truly God. If He were not God, how could He have known these things? Notice that the Lord did not say, “Which is more difficult?” because to Him nothing is difficult. For Him to say, “Your sins are forgiven,” was easier than to say, “Rise and walk,” because no one knows whether or not one’s sins are forgiven. Hence, it is easy to say this. But everyone can tell if a person rises and walks.</p>
<p data-content-id="KJEWVtLfOnw9Yxg9_3P5AKvt8pfAanTep0fB8fNd2CrXG7zPGzDylZTVqAClKS52d"> The Lord’s salvation not only forgives our sins, but also causes us to rise and walk. It is not to rise and walk first and then be forgiven of our sins; that would be by works. Rather, it is to be forgiven of our sins first and then to rise and walk; this is by grace.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19L-Y3CHgOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62521" data-verses="Matthew 9:6">Verse 6</span> says, “But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—then He says to the paralytic, Rise, pick up your bed and go to your house.” To forgive sins is a matter of authority on earth. Only this kingly Savior, who had been authorized by God and who would die to redeem sinners, had such authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62522" data-verses="Acts 5:31">Acts 5:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62523" data-verses="Acts 10:43">10:43</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62524" data-verses="Acts 13:38">13:38</span>). This authority was for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62525" data-verses="Matthew 16:19">Matt. 16:19</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HA0G9RLFvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp"> The Lord enabled the paralytic not only to walk, but also to pick up his bed and walk. Formerly the bed bore him; now he bears it. This is the power of the Lord’s salvation. This paralytic was brought to the Lord by others, but he went home by himself. This indicates that it is not that <span class="pg" data-page-id="326" id="326">[326]</span> the sinner can go <em>to</em> the Lord, but that the sinner can go <em>from</em> the Lord by the Lord’s salvation.</p>
<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCm5StuRw2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62526" data-verses="Matthew 9:7">Verse 7</span> says, “And he rose and went away to his house.” The paralytic’s rising and going proved that he was healed, and his being healed proved that his sins were forgiven. This was a strong proof that the Lord Jesus had the authority to forgive people’s sins.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk9CuZeLa1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> What these cases reveal to us is not the power of Christ, but the authority of the heavenly King. The authority, of course, is backed by the power. However, authority is higher than power. Some may have power, but without authority. For Jesus, the Lord, to be vindicated as the heavenly King, there is the need for Him to show His followers His authority. This authority is to deal with the negative things, the opposing environment instigated by the evil spirits, the demons and the corrupting sins. Christ as the heavenly King has the full authority to deal with all of these, and all of these are subdued under His authority. This brings in the establishment of His heavenly kingdom on earth.</p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoPyQK4-1sw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> If we put together all the cases recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62527" data-verses="Matthew 8:1">8:1—9:8</span>, we see a clear picture of who this heavenly King is. He is the Savior of the Jews and also of the Gentiles. He will be the Savior of the repentant Jews, and He will also be the One who will restore the entire earth in the millennium. He has authority over the wind, the sea, and the demons. He also has authority to forgive people of their sins, and to cause these people to rise and walk. If we would follow this heavenly King, we must not expect any material enjoyment, and we also need to ignore the dead obligations and duties. This bird’s-eye view of this portion of the Word affords us a vivid portrait of who the heavenly King is.</p>

This verse says, “And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man called Matthew, sitting in the customs office, and says to him, Follow Me. And he rose and followed Him.” Matthew was also called Levi (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62531" data-verses="Mark 2:14">Mark 2:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62532" data-verses="Luke 5:27">Luke 5:27</span>). He was a tax collector who became an apostle by God’s grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62533" data-verses="Matthew 10:2-3">Matt. 10:2-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62534" data-verses="Acts 1:13">Acts 1:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62535" data-verses="Acts 1:26">26</span>). He was the writer of this Gospel.</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_-Y7HZ-WhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> The calling of Matthew is somewhat different from the calling of Peter, Andrew, James, and John. When Peter and Andrew were called, they were casting a net into the sea; and when James and John were called, they were mending their nets. The Lord called them, they left their work, and they followed the Lord Jesus. As the Lord Jesus was passing by the customs office, where the tax collectors were, He saw Matthew and called him, and Matthew followed Him. According to the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62536" data-verses="Matthew 9:9">9:9</span> it seems that this was the first time the Lord met Matthew. There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in <span class="pg" data-page-id="328" id="328">[328]</span> His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCab4PZAmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> To follow the Lord includes believing in Him. No one follows Him unless he believes in Him. To believe in the Lord is to be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62537" data-verses="Acts 16:31">Acts 16:31</span>), and to follow Him is to enter the narrow gate and walk the constricted way to participate in the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62538" data-verses="Matthew 7:13-14">Matt. 7:13-14</span>).</p>

But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62542" data-verses="Luke 5:29">Luke 5:29</span> says clearly that Levi, that is, Matthew, “made a great reception for Him in his house.” Thus, Matthew opened his house and prepared a great feast for the Lord and His disciples.</p>

He was a sinful, despised tax collector who had many sinners as his friends. If he had not been such a low person, why were only tax collectors and sinners and not those of a higher rank feasting in Matthew’s house with the Lord Jesus? Although Matthew was such a low person, he was made not only a disciple, but one of the twelve apostles.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn9eQbQwZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> A tax collector was a despised person. Nearly all tax collectors abused their office by demanding more than they should by false accusation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62544" data-verses="Luke 3:12-13">Luke 3:12-13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62545" data-verses="Luke 19:2">19:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62546" data-verses="Luke 19:8">8</span>). To pay taxes to the Romans was very bitter to the Jews. Those <span class="pg" data-page-id="329" id="329">[329]</span> engaged in collecting them were despised by the people and counted unworthy of any respect (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62547" data-verses="Luke 18:9-10">Luke 18:9-10</span>). Hence, they were classed with sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62548" data-verses="Matthew 9:10-11">Matt. 9:10-11</span>). How we must worship the Lord that even a person of such a low rank as Matthew, under God’s mercy and by His grace, could become an apostle! After being saved, Matthew was so grateful to the Lord that he opened his house and prepared a feast for Him and His disciples. Thus, this section of the Word opens in such a sweet, intimate way.</p>

While the Lord Jesus was enjoying the feast with all the tax collectors and sinners, the Pharisees criticized and condemned Him, and they asked the disciples why their teacher ate with such people. This question indicates that the self-righteous Pharisees did not know the grace of God. They assumed that God deals with man only according to righteousness. By asking this, they were exposed as dissenters to the heavenly King, thus rejecting Him. This is a continuation of the rejection of the heavenly King begun in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62550" data-verses="Matthew 9:3">verse 3</span> by the leaders of the Jewish religion.</p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62551" data-verses="Matthew 9:12">verse 12</span> we see the Lord’s reply to the Pharisees’ question: “Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.” The Lord was telling the Pharisees that these tax collectors and sinners were patients, sick ones, and that to them the Lord was not a <span class="pg" data-page-id="330" id="330">[330]</span> judge, but a physician, a healer. In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the King of the heavenly kingdom ministered as a physician, not as a judge. The judgment of the judge is according to righteousness, whereas the healing of the physician is according to mercy and grace. Those whom He made people of His heavenly kingdom were lepers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62552" data-verses="Matthew 8:2-4">8:2-4</span>), paralytics (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62553" data-verses="Matthew 8:5-13">8:5-13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62554" data-verses="Matthew 9:2-8">9:2-8</span>), the fever-ridden (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62555" data-verses="Matthew 8:14-15">8:14-15</span>), the demon-possessed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62556" data-verses="Matthew 8:16">8:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62557" data-verses="Matthew 8:28-32">28-32</span>), those sick of all kinds of illnesses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62558" data-verses="Matthew 8:16">8:16</span>), the despised tax collectors, and sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62559" data-verses="Matthew 9:9-11">9:9-11</span>). Had He visited these pitiful people as a judge, all would have been condemned and rejected, and none would have been qualified, selected, and called to be the people of His heavenly kingdom. Rather, He came to minister as a physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save them, so that they might be reconstituted to be His new and heavenly citizens, with whom He could establish His heavenly kingdom on this corrupted earth. The Lord’s word here implies that the self-righteous Pharisees did not recognize their need of Him as a physician. They considered themselves strong; hence, blinded by their own self-righteousness, they did not know that they were ill.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6Xrpr6H_r55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> The self-righteous Pharisees criticized the Lord Jesus and condemned all those unclean people. But the Lord seemed to say, “These people are not unclean; they are sick. I have not come as a judge to condemn them, but as a physician, as their dear, lovely, intimate healer.” As the Lord Jesus was speaking these words, He was surely indicating that the Pharisees, who thought they were righteous, were actually just as sick as the others were.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovmZjxzjgRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> The Lord Jesus gave the Pharisees a further word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62560" data-verses="Matthew 9:13">verse 13</span>: “Now go and learn what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice, for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” The self-righteous Pharisees assumed they knew all things concerning God. In order to humble them, the Lord told them to learn more.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMivuJEiTAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> Mercy is a part of grace for man to receive from God. But self-righteous men do not like to receive mercy or grace from God; they prefer to offer sacrifice to God, to give <span class="pg" data-page-id="331" id="331">[331]</span> something to God. This contradicts God’s way in His economy. Just as God desires to show mercy to pitiful sinners, so He wants us also to show mercy to others in love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62561" data-verses="Micah 6:6-8">Micah 6:6-8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62562" data-verses="Mark 12:33">Mark 12:33</span>).</p>

Actually, there is none righteous, not even one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62563" data-verses="Romans 3:10">Rom. 3:10</span>). All the righteous are self-righteous like the Pharisees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62564" data-verses="Luke 18:9">Luke 18:9</span>). The kingly Savior did not come to call them, but to call sinners. The Pharisees were proud of their knowledge of the Scriptures, and they thought that they knew the Bible very well. But here the Lord Jesus told them to go and learn something, to learn the meaning of the word, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice.” The Lord seemed to be telling the Pharisees, “You Pharisees are self-righteous, and you condemn these people without mercy. But God desires mercy. Now is the time for Me to exercise God’s mercy upon these pitiful people by being a physician to them. I am not here as a judge. I am here as a lovely physician taking care of their problems, and now I am healing them.”</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-mUkzwwKgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> Are you righteous? If you say, “No, I am not righteous,” you are blessed. Blessed are those who do not think that they are righteous, but who recognize that they are sinful. The reason for this is that the Lord did not come to call the righteous; He came to call the sinners. The Lord could say to the self-righteous ones, “If you consider yourselves righteous, you are not suitable for My coming, because My coming is for the sinners. Do not consider yourselves to be righteous. Rather, you must realize how sinful you are. If you consider yourselves as sinners, then you are ready for My coming.”</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5ChAGpJoU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> Without the environment portrayed in these verses, the Lord Jesus would not have had the opportunity to reveal Himself as the Physician. The Lord did not simply tell His disciples, “You must know that I have not come as a judge, but as a physician.” This would have been merely a doctrine. As the Lord was feasting with all those sick ones, He revealed Himself as the Physician. Those tax collectors <span class="pg" data-page-id="332" id="332">[332]</span> and sinners were not physically sick; they were spiritually sick. While the Lord Jesus was feasting with them, He was healing them. The Lord was telling the Pharisees, “Pharisees, you are the judges, but I am the Physician. As a Physician, I can heal only the sick ones. If you feel that you are not ill, then I have nothing to do with you, and I cannot heal you. I have come here to call the sinners, the sick ones, not the righteous, the whole ones. On which side do you stand—the side of the righteous or the side of the sinners? If you take the side of the sinners, then I am here to be your Physician.”</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85wwxRWYk342_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> Matthew reveals more than thirty-three aspects of Christ, one of which is Christ as the Physician. He is not only our King, our Savior, and our life; He is also our Physician. If we have this vision, we shall have faith in Him and trust Him whenever we are sick physically, spiritually, or mentally. We need to trust Him as our Physician.</p>
<p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy6oOK28Hw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> The Gospel of Matthew is a book of the kingdom, yet it is also a book full of the riches of the heavenly King. This heavenly King is our Physician with healing authority. His healing is not simply a matter of power; it is a matter of authority. To heal us there is no need for Him to touch us directly. He needs only to speak a word, and His authority will come with His word. Remember the case of the healing of the centurion’s servant. The centurion said to the Lord, “Only speak a word, and my servant boy shall be healed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62565" data-verses="Matthew 8:8">8:8</span>). Furthermore, the centurion could say, “I am also a man under authority, and many others are under me. I simply speak a word, and they obey it, because with my word there is authority. Lord, You don’t need to come to my home. Simply give a word, and Your authority will go with Your word.” The Lord’s word heals us not with power, but with authority. Often Christians think that the Lord heals because He is able to heal. This is a natural concept. The Lord’s healing is not a matter of His ability to heal; His healing is a matter of authority. He simply needs to say, “Illness, go away.” This is authority. With this <span class="pg" data-page-id="333" id="333">[333]</span> same authority He is also fully able to command mental illnesses to flee. Thus, He heals us with authority.</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM5XF8kIGElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> Because the Pharisees were religious and self-righteous, the Lord dealt with them. The Pharisees thought that the tax collectors and sinners were rejected. This was their religious concept. The Lord took advantage of the Pharisees’ expression of their religious concept to reveal Himself as the Physician. He seemed to say, “You Pharisees, you religious people, are wrong. I am not here as a judge condemning the people. I am here as a Physician healing them. And I would heal you also, if you were willing to be healed.” How sweet and intimate is this portion of the Word!</p>

<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhhmDpPSw69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> As a book of doctrine, Matthew presents us another case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62566" data-verses="Matthew 9:14-17">9:14-17</span>: the case of fasting without the Bridegroom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62567" data-verses="Matthew 9:14">Verse 14</span> says, “Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62568" data-verses="Matthew 9:10-13">Verses 10 through 13</span> record the Lord’s dealing with the question of the Pharisees, who were in the old religion. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62569" data-verses="Matthew 9:14-17">verses 14 through 17</span> the Lord deals with the problem of John’s disciples who were in the new religion. John the Baptist dropped the old religion and began his ministry in the wilderness outside of religion. However, after a short time, his disciples formed a new religion to frustrate men from enjoying Christ, just as the Pharisees in the old religion did. John the Baptist’s ministry was to introduce men to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all. However, some of his disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of John’s practices and turned those practices into a religion. To be religious means to do something for God without Christ. To do anything without the presence of Christ, even though it is scriptural and fundamental, is <span class="pg" data-page-id="334" id="334">[334]</span> religious. Both the disciples of John, the new-timers of religion, and the Pharisees, the old-timers of religion, fasted much, yet without Christ. They did not own Christ as the Bridegroom, but made fasting a matter of religion. Meanwhile, they condemned the disciples of Christ who did not fast, but had Christ with them and lived in His presence.</p>
<p data-content-id="Xrfm_0_wHtlK1HVoKjia7ysO4XsNx9Cw0kdxF7iwt4aGYrrICB0YkaHGfAxzlMrpi"> John the Baptist was born a priest, but later he fully abandoned everything religious. Nevertheless, less than three years after he had been put into prison, his disciples formed a new religion. To have a religion is to worship God, to serve God, and to do certain things to please God, yet without Christ. A religion is anything you do for God without the Spirit, without Christ. The Pharisees did a great many things for God, but Christ was not in them. They did many things to serve God, but they did them without the Spirit. Now the disciples of John the Baptist were fasting without Christ, without the Spirit. Nevertheless, this fasting was for God. Hence, they formed another religion. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62570" data-verses="Matthew 9:14">verse 14</span> we have the old religion, the religion of the Pharisees, and the new religion, the religion of the disciples of John.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuaqLdTrlDi_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> How easy it is to have a religion! Do not think that you can be free from religion by simply dropping an old way and picking up another way. No matter whether the way is old or new, it is a religion as long as it does not have Christ and the Spirit in it. Your new way may simply be your new religion. Remember what religion is: it is doing things to please God apart from Christ and the Spirit.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVBXG7k9NTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> The self-righteous Pharisees, the old-timers of religion, were bothered by the fact that Christ made Himself a companion of tax collectors and sinners, who were condemned by them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62571" data-verses="Matthew 9:11">v. 11</span>). They condemned Him for feasting with the sinners. The fasting disciples of John, the new-timers of religion, were troubled by the feasting of Christ and His disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62572" data-verses="Matthew 9:10">v. 10</span>) and condemned them for not fasting. The situation is similar today. On every hand the religionists condemn us. What then should we do? We should stay with the Physician. <span class="pg" data-page-id="335" id="335">[335]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62573" data-verses="Matthew 9:15">verse 15</span> the Lord Jesus said to them, “Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.” Both the Physician and the Bridegroom are pleasant. I appreciate the Lord’s wisdom. In the case concerning the Pharisees, He likened Himself to a Physician. Now in the case with the disciples of John, He likens Himself to a bridegroom at a wedding. The Lord asked if the sons of the bridechamber can mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. It is a joyful time with the Bridegroom. But when the Bridegroom is taken away, they may fast.</p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UATjUcU2szKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> The phrase “sons of the bridechamber” refers to the disciples of the Lord. In the transitory period of the Lord’s ministry on earth, His disciples were sons of the bridechamber. Later they will become the Bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62574" data-verses="John 3:29">John 3:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62575" data-verses="Revelation 19:7">Rev. 19:7</span>). The Bridegroom was taken away from the sons of the bridechamber when the kingly Savior was taken up from the disciples into heaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62576" data-verses="Acts 1:11">Acts 1:11</span>). After that, they fasted (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62577" data-verses="Acts 13:2-3">Acts 13:2-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62578" data-verses="Acts 14:23">14:23</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPLfxzkMoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> In dealing with the self-righteous and dissenting Pharisees of the old religion, the kingly Savior indicated that He was a Physician to heal the sick (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62579" data-verses="Matthew 9:12">v. 12</span>). In dealing with the fasting and dissenting disciples of John who had formed the new religion, He revealed Himself as a Bridegroom to take the Bride. John the Baptist told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom to take the Bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62580" data-verses="John 3:25-29">John 3:25-29</span>). Now Christ, the kingly Savior, reminded some of them of this. The kingly Savior firstly healed His followers, then made them the sons of the bridechamber. Eventually He will make them His Bride. They should appropriate Him not only as their Physician for the recovery of their life, but also as their Bridegroom for a living of enjoyment in His presence. They were at a joyful wedding with Him, not at a <span class="pg" data-page-id="336" id="336">[336]</span> sorrowful funeral without Him. How then could they fast and not feast before Him? This dissenting question indicates that some of John’s disciples had fallen into a new religion and also had rejected the kingly Savior.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYMVlHqHR6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> The question of John’s disciples seemed to be one of doctrine. But the Lord did not answer with a doctrine, but with a Person, the most pleasant Person, the Bridegroom. The religious people always care for their doctrine with their doctrinal reasonings. But Christ cares only for Himself. The living and walk of His followers should be regulated and directed only by His Person and His presence, not by any doctrine.</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuMculjrDkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> It would be ridiculous for someone to fast at a wedding. Moreover, to fast while others are enjoying the wedding feast would be an insult to the bridegroom. Here we see the Lord’s wisdom. He did not argue with them, but He certainly condemned the religious ones. The Lord seemed to be saying, “You religious people have missed the mark. Don’t you realize that I am the Bridegroom and that all My disciples around Me are the sons of the bridechamber? They shouldn’t be fasting. They must feast with Me.” Without these two cases, the Lord Jesus could never have been revealed as the Physician and as the Bridegroom. We should thank the Lord for the Pharisees and for the disciples of John. We should even thank the Lord for all the religions, for without the occasions afforded by religion the Lord could not be revealed in so many different aspects. It is the same today.</p>

He says, “Now no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.” The Greek word translated “unshrunk” is <em>agnaphos</em>, formed with <em>a</em>, which means not, and <em>gnapto,</em> which means to card or comb wool; hence, to dress or full the cloth. Thus, the word means uncarded, unfulled, unfinished, unshrunk, untreated. The unshrunk cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished; whereas the new garment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62583" data-verses="Luke 5:36">Luke 5:36</span> signifies Christ, after being treated in His crucifixion, as a new robe. (The Greek word for “new” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62584" data-verses="Luke 5:36">Luke 5:36</span> is <em>kainos</em>, the same as the word for “fresh” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62585" data-verses="Matthew 9:17">Matthew 9:17</span>.) Christ was firstly the unshrunk cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection He was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and acceptable to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62586" data-verses="Luke 15:22">Luke 15:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62587" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62588" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62589" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">Phil. 3:9</span>). A patch of unshrunk cloth put on an old garment pulls away from the garment by its shrinking strength, thus making the tear worse. To do this means to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth. This is what today’s modernists are attempting. They only imitate <span class="pg" data-page-id="338" id="338">[338]</span> Jesus’ human deeds to improve their behavior; they do not believe in the crucified Jesus as their Redeemer or the resurrected Christ as their new garment to cover them as their righteousness before God.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrpoKH15Z5GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> The old garment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62590" data-verses="Matthew 9:16">verse 16</span> signifies man’s good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices by his old natural life. The Lord Jesus was very wise. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62591" data-verses="Matthew 9:16">verse 16</span> He did not say, “You disciples of John must realize that your garments are torn and full of holes. By fasting you are actually cutting a piece of unshrunk cloth and using it to patch the holes in your garments.” Instead of saying this directly, the Lord Jesus indicated to the disciples of John that they did not have a perfect garment. He indicated that their garments had holes and that by fasting they were trying to patch the holes. No human being could utter such a word as that spoken by the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62592" data-verses="Matthew 9:16">verse 16</span>. His wise word is full of meaning, rebuke, revelation, and instruction. The Lord was saying to the disciples of John, “Why do you ask Me about fasting? Your fasting is a way of patching your torn garment. By your fasting, you show that you realize that you have holes in your garments that need to be mended. Your teacher, John, introduced you all to Me. Now you are utilizing Me to patch your holes. This means that you are cutting a piece from My unshrunk cloth to mend the holes in your garments. But My cloth is full of shrinking power. Don’t put any part of it on your old torn garments. If you do, the hole will become larger.”</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovmaTx4xQRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> The account in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62593" data-verses="Luke 5:36">Luke 5:36</span> is somewhat different from that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62594" data-verses="Matthew 9:16">Matthew 9:16</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62595" data-verses="Luke 5:36">Luke 5:36</span> says, “No man tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old.” Notice that Matthew says “cloth” and that Luke says “garment.” The Lord Jesus likened Himself to a piece of unshrunk cloth. This points to what He was between His incarnation and His crucifixion. During this period of time He was unshrunk cloth, new cloth that had never been fulled or dealt with. Through His death and resurrection this new cloth was dealt with and was made a new garment. The Lord’s intention was to give Himself to us not as a piece of unshrunk cloth, but as a complete, finished garment that we <span class="pg" data-page-id="339" id="339">[339]</span> might put on as our righteousness to be justified before God. After His death and resurrection, He was made the finished garment for us to put on so that we may attend His wedding. Thus, He is not only the Bridegroom, but also our wedding garment that qualifies us to attend His wedding feast.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZXhedy9iy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> Why did the Lord Jesus, after telling us that He is the Bridegroom, go on to speak of the new cloth, the new garment? We must look deeper to discern His meaning. The Lord tells us that the Bridegroom is with us. But look at yourself—do you deserve His presence? Do you think that your real condition in the eyes of God is worthy of the presence of the Bridegroom? We must all answer, “No.” All we have and all we are does not deserve the Lord’s presence. To enjoy the Lord’s presence we need certain qualifications; we need to be in a certain condition, in a certain situation. What we are by birth, what we are naturally, whatever we can do, and whatever we have, do not qualify us to be in the presence of the Bridegroom. The Bridegroom is Christ, and Christ is God Himself. Suppose God appeared to you today. Could you just sit there? He is the holy God, the righteous God, and such a One is the Bridegroom. Recall the story of the prodigal son in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62596" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span>. The prodigal son came home. The father undoubtedly loved him deeply, but the son’s condition was utterly unfit for the presence of the father. Therefore, the father immediately told his servant to take the best robe and to put it on him, thus making him fit for his presence. Our Bridegroom is God Himself. How may we, poor sinners, enjoy the presence of the heavenly King? We must remember the context of these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62597" data-verses="Matthew 9:1">Matthew 9</span>: the Lord Jesus was eating with tax collectors and sinners. We are “tax collectors” and sinners. We are not qualified; we need something to cover us that we may sit in the presence of the Lord. This is why, after the Lord spoke of Himself as the Bridegroom, He told us that we need to be clothed in a new garment. When we put on the new garment, we are worthy of His presence. When the prodigal son was clothed with the best robe, he could immediately stand in the presence <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> of his honored father. The best robe qualified him to enjoy the father’s presence. We as sinners and “tax collectors” need to be clothed in a new garment that we may be worthy of the Bridegroom’s presence.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS51q8fU-asIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> I do not like to present mere teachings and doctrines—I prefer the practice, the experience. Let me check with you: Since Christ became the new garment after His resurrection, how then may we put Him on? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62598" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Galatians 3:27</span> says, “As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” We must put on Christ, and the way to put Him on is to be baptized into Him. Now we must see how we may be baptized into Christ. We have seen that after His resurrection Christ became a new garment, but the Bible also tells us that after His resurrection He was made a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62599" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). If Christ were not the Spirit, how could we be baptized into Him? By being crucified, buried, and resurrected, Christ was made a life-giving <em>pneuma,</em> a life-giving breath, the living air. As the breath, it is so easy for Him to get into us, and as the air, it is so easy for us to get into Him. Christ in resurrection was made a Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the all-inclusive One. In this Spirit is all that Christ is and all He has accomplished. This all-inclusive Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ Himself, and this Christ as the Spirit is the new garment for us to wear. Hence, even the garment is the Spirit. We were baptized into Christ as the Spirit—it is thus that we put on Christ. Christ is the <em>pneuma,</em> the all-inclusive Spirit. When we are baptized into Him, we put Him on. Immediately He as the Spirit becomes our clothing, our covering, and we are qualified. Therefore, the new garment which we must put on is Christ Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>

To baptize people into the name means to baptize them into the Spirit, who is Christ as the all-inclusive <em>pneuma.</em> Christ became incarnated, He lived on earth, He was crucified <span class="pg" data-page-id="341" id="341">[341]</span> and accomplished redemption, and He was resurrected. After everything was finished, He became the all-inclusive <em>pneuma</em> in His resurrection.

When we were baptized into Him, we put Him on. We must put on Christ as the new garment, and this new garment is the all-inclusive Spirit. Christ is no longer the untreated cloth; He is now the finished garment. In this finished garment we have redemption, resurrection power, and all the elements of the divine Person. This new garment is not just a piece of clothing, but the divine <em>pneuma,</em> the all-inclusive Spirit, including Christ’s incarnation, His crucifixion, His redemptive work, His resurrection, and His resurrection power.

Not Putting New Wine into Old Wineskins</h2><p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19L943BGAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62601" data-verses="Matthew 9:17">Verse 17</span> says, “Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.” The Greek word translated “new” in this verse is <em>neos,</em> which means new in time, recent, young. The new wine here signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor, stirring people to excitement. The new wine is Christ’s cheering life. The divine life is likened to wine that has cheering strength. When we receive His life, it works within us all day long to stir us up and to excite us. This new wine strengthens us, energizes us, and makes us very happy. The kingly Savior is not only the Bridegroom to the kingdom people for their enjoyment, but also their new garment to equip and qualify them outwardly for attending the wedding. Furthermore, He is also their new life to excite them inwardly for the enjoyment of Him as their Bridegroom. He, as their heavenly King, is the Bridegroom for the kingdom <span class="pg" data-page-id="342" id="342">[342]</span> people’s enjoyment, and His heavenly kingdom is the wedding feast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62602" data-verses="Matthew 22:2">22:2</span>) that they may enjoy Him.

<p data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HA3m9SKlvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp"> Consider again the example of the prodigal son. After putting on the best robe the prodigal son could still say, “O father, the best robe satisfies you, but it doesn’t satisfy me. I am still hungry and need to be satisfied.” Immediately the father told the servant to kill the fatted calf and said, “Let us eat, and be merry.” Thus, the father’s provision is not just for something outward, but also for something within. Therefore, after the Lord spoke about the new garment, He directly proceeded to speak of the new wine. The new wine is not a provision for the outward need, but for the inward need. We need something to cover us, and we also need something to fill us. We are so poor outwardly, and we are so empty inwardly. We need the robe upon us for the Father’s sake, and we need the new wine within us for our own sakes. We need both the new garment and the new wine. The Lord is the new garment to us, and He is also the new wine. He is our covering and also our content. He not only qualifies us, but He satisfies us as well. Hence, He is our qualification and our satisfaction, the provision for our outward need and the provision for all our inward hunger and thirst.</p>

Old wineskins signify religious practices, such as the fasting held by the Pharisees in the old religion and the disciples of John in the new religion. All religions are old wineskins. New wine put into old wineskins bursts the wineskins by its fermenting power. To put new wine into old wineskins is to put Christ as the exciting life into any kind of religion. This is what the so-called fundamentalists and Pentecostals are practicing today. They attempt to squeeze Christ into their different modes of religious ritual and formality. The kingdom people should never do this. They must put the new wine into fresh wineskins. <span class="pg" data-page-id="343" id="343">[343]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk9BOZdL61byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> The new wine needs a wineskin, a container. Because the new wine is filled with fermenting power, if you put it into an old wineskin, the fermenting power of the new wine will burst the old wineskin. Any religious practice is an old wineskin. In this verse Christ seemed to be saying to the Pharisees and the disciples of John, ”Fasting is an old wineskin. Do not try to put the new wine of My life into the wineskin of your old religious practices. The wine will burst your religious practices. The new wine of My life requires a new wineskin.”</p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoPxwK79Vsw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> Some indeed have received the new wine, but they have attempted to take the new wine back and pour it into an old wineskin. I have been observing this kind of folly for more than forty years. Many people have come to the local church and tasted the new wine. They have said, “This is really wonderful. This is just what ‘my church’ needs.” Then they tried to bring this new wine back to that old wineskin. Do you know what happened? The old wineskins burst, and the new wine was spilled. However, if you put the new wine into a new wineskin, both will be preserved.</p>

This is the leaven mixed with the fine flour (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62604" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">13:33</span>). In other words, it is the new wine put into the old wineskin. I am concerned that this wine is no longer the new wine, for it seems to have no fermenting power. If it did, the old wineskin would burst. If the charismatic movement were the genuine new wine filled with the fermenting power, it would burst that old Catholic wineskin.</p>

The fresh wineskins signify the church life in the local churches as the container of the new wine, which is Christ Himself as the exciting life. The kingdom people are built into the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62606" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">16:18</span>), and the church is expressed through the local churches in which they live (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62607" data-verses="Matthew 18:15-20">18:15-20</span>). They are regenerated persons constituting the Body of Christ to be the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62608" data-verses="Romans 12:5">Rom. 12:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62609" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Eph. 1:22-23</span>). This Body of Christ as His fullness is also called “the Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62610" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">1 Cor. 12:12</span>, Gk.), the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the new wine, the exciting life inwardly, and the corporate Christ is the fresh wineskin, the container to hold the new wine outwardly. With the kingdom people, it is not a matter of fasting or of any other religious practice, but a matter of the church life with Christ as their content. Christ came not to establish an earthly religion of rituals, but a heavenly kingdom of life, not with any dead religious practices, but with Himself, the living Person, as the Physician, the Bridegroom, the unshrunk cloth, and the new wine to His followers as their full enjoyment that they might be the fresh wineskin to contain Him and become the constituents of His kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvQ1dgq4PuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> We see then that the new wineskin is the church life. The church is actually the enlargement of Christ. The individual Christ is our wine within us. When this individual Christ is enlarged into a corporate Christ, that is the church. This corporate Christ is the wineskin, the container, to contain the individual Christ as our wine. Never consider the church a religion; the church is a corporate entity full of Christ, because the church is Christ enlarged.</p>

Christ is everything. He is the Bridegroom, the new garment, the new wine, and also the corporate vessel to contain what we enjoy of Him. The meaning here is very profound. <span class="pg" data-page-id="345" id="345">[345]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY5h_C9ZclV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> We need to see something more concerning Christ as the new wineskin. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62612" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">First Corinthians 12:12</span> says, “For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ.” We read in this verse not only that the members composed together are the one Body, but that this Body is Christ. We have always considered Christ as the Head; we have considered little, if at all, that Christ is also the Body. How, speaking in a practical way, is Christ the Body? He is the Body because the Body is composed of so many members who are filled with Christ. Christ is in you, Christ is in me, and Christ is in every one of us. We all have Christ within. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62613" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:1">1 Corinthians 1</span> Paul said that Christ is not divided. The Christ in you is one with the Christ in me, and the Christ in us is one with the Christ in all other Christians. Therefore, Christ is the Body composed of so many members who are filled with Him. This is the new wineskin, which is the church life to contain Christ as the new wine.</p>
<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIq4dE4I85SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> Without the wineskin, how could we keep the wine? Do not consider that you yourself as an individual are the vessel. No, you are just a part of the vessel. How can a glass contain water if it is cut into pieces? How can the pieces contain the water? It is impossible. Do not consider that you are somebody. You are nobody. You are just a member of the Body, a minute part of the Body. It is true that some amount of blood is in my little finger, but this little finger is just a part of my body. If you sever it from the body, the flow of blood in the finger immediately ceases. Instead of containing the blood, the finger will lose the blood. From the day you leave the church life, you begin to lose Christ; the new wine starts to run out. Nothing but the church life can contain the very Christ we enjoy. Never consider the church as an insignificant matter.</p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzlnttIc8sSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> We must also realize that the wineskin is not only the container of the wine, but also the means for us to drink the wine. Many of us can testify that whenever we come into a church meeting, we discover that it is truly the place where we can drink Christ. It is here that we drink the Lord as <span class="pg" data-page-id="346" id="346">[346]</span> never before. The church life is not merely a container, but a vessel from which we may drink. We need Christ as the new garment, we need Christ as the new wine, and we also need Christ in a corporate way as the new wineskin. We need the church life. We do not care for religion, forms, or rituals. We care only for Christ in you and Christ in me. This is the new wineskin.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFCDFm16nNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> At this point, I would like to say a word to the young people. The young people may say, “As long as we stay with the older ones, we will be in religion. But if we get away from them, we will not be religious.” This concept is wrong. Everything depends on whether or not the church is the enlargement of Christ. It is not a matter of age. Even if all the babes came together, they could still be in religion because they do not have Christ as their content. If the older ones are filled with Christ and saturated with Him, they are the church, no matter how old they may be. Remember that religion is something for God without Christ. But the church is Christ enlarged; it is the enlargement of Christ. And the new wineskin is Christ enlarged into a corporate expression. This is the church. The church is not something for God without Christ and without the Spirit. The church is an entity which is the enlargement of Christ and which is full of Christ. The church is filled with Christ and constituted with Christ. No matter what our age may be, we must be filled with Christ. Then when we come together, we shall be the local expression of the church. This is the wineskin. No matter how much fermenting power there is in the divine life of Christ, it can never burst the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYGtup3QWD97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> Today there are four kinds of Christians. The first are called Christians, but they are not truly Christians. They are the modernists, the so-called modernistic Christians. They only take Christ as the new cloth. They say, “Look how Jesus lived: He was so full of love and self-sacrifice. We must imitate Him and follow Him.” But to do this is just to cut out a piece of new cloth with which to patch an old garment. The modernists are trying to take the unshrunk cloth of the Lord’s human living and use it to patch the <span class="pg" data-page-id="347" id="347">[347]</span> holes in their behavior. But this unshrunk cloth pulls back and makes their holes larger. The modernists do not believe that Christ died for their sins on the cross, they do not believe that Christ is God, and they do not believe in His resurrection. They simply believe that they should imitate the human living of Jesus.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUvX2DToc0trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> The fundamentalists are the second kind of Christians. They believe that Christ is God, that Christ is their Redeemer, that Christ died on the cross for their sins, and that He was resurrected. The fundamentalists receive and accept the resurrected Christ as their righteousness. They take Christ, not as a piece of new cloth, but as the new, finished garment. However, they know little of the inner life, of the inner wine. They put on Christ as the outer garment, but they do not drink Him as the wine within.</p>
<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbYyuaEYZwZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> The third kind of Christian may be called the inner life Christians. They not only put on Christ as their new garment, but they also know Him as their inner life. In fact, they place great emphasis on the inner life. The inner life Christians are an improvement over the previous two groups. However, as good as they are, they lack one thing: they lack the wineskin, the church life.</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiEIRK3SZM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> The fourth are the church people. The church people are not modernists. Moreover, they are neither merely fundamentals nor only the inner life people. They are churching, because they have the new wineskin.</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0bGTRtWM_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> In the last days the Lord is recovering not only the new garment—this He recovered through Martin Luther in the matter of justification by faith. Neither is the Lord only recovering the inner life—this He recovered through ones such as Madame Guyon, William Law, Andrew Murray, and Jessie Penn-Lewis. We thank the Lord for all these items that have been recovered. However, at the end of this age the Lord is recovering the last and ultimate item, the church life. Those who enjoy the church life are the church people. Among the church people the new garment, the new wine, and the new wineskin have all been recovered. We have Christ in a corporate way as our church life. The Lord did not stop with either the new garment or <span class="pg" data-page-id="348" id="348">[348]</span> the new wine. He went on from the Bridegroom to the new cloth, from the new cloth to the new garment, from the new garment to the new wine, and from the new wine to the new wineskin. After the wineskin, the church, there is nothing more. The church is God’s ultimate goal. When we arrive at the church, we are in the ultimate consummation of God’s purpose. Thus, after the wineskin, the Lord mentioned nothing else.</p>

He is also our garment to qualify us and our new wine to stir us up. As I see the faces of the brothers and sisters in the meetings, I can tell that they have been stirred up by the new wine. How we praise the Lord that this new wine is in His enlargement, the new wineskin. Christ is everything to us! We need to know our Lord to such an extent. He is not only our King, our Savior, and our life. He is also our Physician, and this dear Physician is our lovely Bridegroom. And this Bridegroom becomes our garment, our new wine, and eventually the wineskin. We are now in the wineskin, in the church life, enjoying Him to such a high degree. Hallelujah for Christ and the church!</p>

<p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy6ruKxvXw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62614" data-verses="Matthew 9:1">Matthew 9</span> Christ is revealed as the Physician, the Bridegroom, and even as the unshrunk cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin. Following this, a further revelation of Christ is needed. This revelation requires a certain environment that will enable Christ to be revealed in another aspect. Having Christ revealed to us is not a matter of doctrine. In order for Christ to be revealed, there is always the need of a particular environment. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62615" data-verses="Matthew 9:1">chapter nine</span> Christ is revealed in so many sweet, lovely, pleasant aspects. The environment required for the revelation of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62616" data-verses="Matthew 9:1">chapter nine</span> was produced by His ministry. In order for Christ to be revealed to us, there must be a certain environment, and that environment always comes out of Christ’s ministry. Christ began to minister in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62617" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">chapter four</span>. After calling the first four disciples and attracting great crowds, He went up to the mountain where He issued the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. After He descended from the mountain, He continued His ministry. His ministry before giving the constitution on the mountain was good for the constitution, but it was not sufficient for the further revelation of who He is and of what He is. In order for Him to be revealed as the lovely items found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62618" data-verses="Matthew 9:1">chapter nine</span>, there <span class="pg" data-page-id="350" id="350">[350]</span> was the need for the continuation of His ministry. This further ministry created the environment for Him to be revealed not only as the King, but also as the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin. If you do not see this ministry in such a way, if you cannot see the environment created by this ministry for the revelation of Christ, and if you cannot see all the items of what Christ is, you may read the Gospel of Matthew a hundred times without receiving anything from it. It may seem to you to be either a book of stories or doctrines. But you will never receive any life from this book. If you would see light in the Gospel of Matthew, you must first see the heavenly King. After He was anointed and tested, He began His ministry. His ministry is crucial, for it is absolutely necessary for His revelation. Christ would not just tell us that He is the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin. That would be like the teaching given in a seminary. How poor it would be simply to gather a group of people together and merely tell them what Christ is. To repeat, in order to receive the revelation of Christ, there is the need of the environment created by His ministry.</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM5Ul8gYmElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> In the continuation of His ministry the King did many signs. He healed the leper, He healed the servant boy of a Roman centurion, and He healed the mother-in-law of Peter. Following this, He healed a great many other people. This was His ministry. The continuation of the King’s ministry was different from the beginning of His ministry, for in the beginning there were no dispensational signs. Rather, He contacted people, attracted them, and captured them. Because a great crowd followed Him, He was able to deliver the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfOy1ITvJrftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> Although Matthew is a book on the kingdom, it is also a revelation of Christ. One day Christ led His disciples to Caesarea Philippi and asked them, “Who do men say that the Son of Man is?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62619" data-verses="Matthew 16:13">16:13</span>). After they gave some answers, He asked them, “But you, who do you say that I am?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62620" data-verses="Matthew 16:15">v. 15</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="351" id="351">[351]</span>). This indicates that the book of the kingdom reveals who Christ is. What a blessing it is to see the revelations of Christ in this book! The genealogy of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62621" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">chapter one</span> is a revelation of Christ. It reveals that Christ is the Son of David, the Son of Abraham, and the issue of a marriage that unites the two lines of David’s descendants. According to Matthew <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62622" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">chapter one</span>, Jesus is not that simple. He is Jehovah the Savior and Emmanuel, God with us. Christ is the Son of David, the Son of Abraham, the seed of the woman, Jehovah the Savior, and Emmanuel, God with us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62623" data-verses="Matthew 2:1">chapter two</span> He is visited as a king. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62624" data-verses="Matthew 2:1">chapter two</span> reveals that He is the King. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62625" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> this King is recommended and anointed, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62626" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">chapter four</span> He is tested, qualified, and approved. Then, after His testing, this King came into His ministry. By means of His ministry, He attracted crowds. After giving the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, He continued His ministry, doing some signs with a dispensational significance. These miracles signify that He came with salvation firstly to the Jews and then turned from the Jews to the Gentiles. These signs also signify that after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, Christ will bring His salvation back to the Jews. Then will take place the restoration of the whole earth during the time of the millennium. At that time all diseases will be healed. Through this continuation of the King’s ministry, an environment—a feast—was prepared. This feast came out of Christ’s ministry. Through His ministry, the Lord gained a sinner, a tax collector named Matthew, who prepared a great feast for the Lord and His disciples. To this feast Matthew also invited a great many of his friends, who also were sinners and tax collectors. There is a proverb which says that we know what kind of person you are by looking at your friends. Matthew, a tax collector, had friends who were tax collectors and sinners. The feast prepared by Matthew was the right environment for the Lord to reveal Himself as the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new cloth to cover us, the new wine to fill us, and the new wineskin to preserve the wine we have received. Christ in all <span class="pg" data-page-id="352" id="352">[352]</span> these aspects was revealed through the environment brought forth by His ministry.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EHU39f1ECzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> The situation is the same today. Without the ministry, nothing of Christ and nothing concerning the church could be revealed. I cannot simply gather some people together and deliver them a lecture. In that kind of environment I simply have nothing to say. But in the proper environment I can tell you about one item of Christ after another. What a Christ we have! We need to thank the Lord for His ministry and for the environment He creates through His ministry. Even the Pharisees of the old religion and the disciples of John of the new religion were used by the Lord. The old religion gave the Lord Jesus the opportunity to reveal Himself as the Physician, and the new religion gave Him the opportunity to reveal Himself as the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin. We need to say, “Thank you, Pharisees, and thank you, disciples of John. Without you, we could not have such a vision of Christ. We would never know that our heavenly King is the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin.”</p>
<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhhljpFAA69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> When I was young, I read through Matthew <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62627" data-verses="Matthew 8:1">chapters eight</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62628" data-verses="Matthew 9:1">nine</span> without seeing anything. I read about the new cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin, but none of these things made any impression on me. Later, in the proper environment, my eyes were opened to see how sweet and pleasant the Lord Jesus is. Oh, He is our Bridegroom! How pleasant! He is the new cloth, our covering, and the new wine to fill us up. And He is also the new wineskin, the container. I also came to see the four kinds of Christians indicated by these items: the modernists, the fundamentalists, the inner life people, and the church people. I am glad to be among the church people. I enjoy being in the new wineskin. I am covered by the new garment, I am drinking the new wine, and I am in the new wineskin enjoying the presence of the Bridegroom. How wonderful this is! This is our Christ! Today, we do know what the church is. We are churching Christ! In the Lord’s recovery Christ is our Bridegroom, <span class="pg" data-page-id="353" id="353">[353]</span> our new garment, our new wine, and our new wineskin. Therefore we may coin a new phrase: we are “churching Christ.”</p>

SIGNS WITH DISPENSATIONAL<br/>SIGNIFICANCE REPEATED</h2><p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GsQFFc8gsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62629" data-verses="Matthew 9:18-34">9:18-34</span> we have the repetition of signs with dispensational significance. These verses give a brief picture of this age and the coming age. Hence, this record is also with dispensational significance, as that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62630" data-verses="Matthew 8:1-17">8:1-17</span>. The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue represents the Jews, and the woman with the hemorrhage represents the Gentiles. When the daughter died, the woman was healed. After the woman was healed, the daughter was revived. Following this, two blind men and one dumb man were healed. This is a type, showing that when the Jews are cut off, the Gentiles are saved and that after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the Jews will be saved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62631" data-verses="Romans 11:15">Rom. 11:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62632" data-verses="Romans 11:17">17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62633" data-verses="Romans 11:19">19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62634" data-verses="Romans 11:23-26">23-26</span>). Following this, the millennium will begin, and at that time all the blind and the dumb will be healed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62635" data-verses="Isaiah 35:5-6">Isa. 35:5-6</span>).</p>

The Daughter of the Ruler<br/>of the Synagogue Having Died</h2><p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovmaDxwjARSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62636" data-verses="Matthew 9:18">Verse 18</span> says, “As He was speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshipped Him saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.” The ruler here was a ruler of the synagogue (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62637" data-verses="Mark 5:22">Mark 5:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62638" data-verses="Luke 8:41">Luke 8:41</span>) named Jairus, which means “he will enlighten,” or “enlightened,” signifying that the Lord will enlighten the Gentiles, and they will be enlightened (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62639" data-verses="Acts 13:46-48">Acts 13:46-48</span>). According to the record in Mark and Luke, this ruler’s daughter was twelve years of age. This ruler was interested in the heavenly King, but he did not have as much faith as the centurion. The centurion had told the Lord Jesus that He did not need to come to his home. It was sufficient for Him to speak a word. If this ruler of the synagogue had had this kind of faith, his daughter would have been healed. However, he asked the <span class="pg" data-page-id="354" id="354">[354]</span> Lord to come to his home and to lay His hand upon his daughter. His faith could reach this far, no farther. Sympathizing with him, the Lord Jesus arose and followed him.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMisOJHjzAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z">B. The Healing of a Woman with a Hemorrhage</h2><p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqFghFL4_5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> As the Lord was on the way to the ruler’s house, a woman who had been sick of a hemorrhage for twelve years “approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment.” This woman suffered from a bloody flux, a flow or issue of blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62640" data-verses="Leviticus 15:25">Lev. 15:25</span>). The life of the flesh is in the blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62641" data-verses="Leviticus 17:11">Lev. 17:11</span>). Hence, this disease signifies the life that cannot be retained. The woman was sick for twelve years, the age of the daughter of the ruler (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62642" data-verses="Luke 8:42">Luke 8:42</span>). This woman approached the Lord from behind and touched the fringe of His garment, saying within herself, “If only I may touch His garment, I shall be healed.” The woman here and the centurion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62643" data-verses="Matthew 8:5-10">8:5-10</span>, both representing the Gentiles, came to contact the Lord in the same way, with faith. She was healed while the Lord was on the way to the ruler’s house. This signifies that the Gentiles are saved while Christ is on the way to the house of Israel.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-mXEzzwqgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> The Lord’s garment signifies Christ’s righteous deeds, and the fringe signifies the heavenly ruling. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62644" data-verses="Numbers 15:38-40">Numbers 15:38-40</span>, Israelite males had to wear a blue fringe on their garments, a ribbon in the color of blue. This meant that their lives, their walk, were restricted by a heavenly limitation. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He probably dressed in this way. Garments signify virtue in human behavior. In the human virtue of the Lord Jesus there was healing power. Therefore, when the sick woman touched the fringe of His garment, the power of His virtue went to her, and she was healed. Out of Christ’s heavenly-ruled deeds comes the virtue that becomes the healing power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62645" data-verses="Matthew 14:36">Matt. 14:36</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5CigGqJIU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> The healing of the woman with the hemorrhage indicates that the Lord was met and caught by the Gentiles as He was journeying to the Jews. According to history, the Gentiles are sick, and the Jews are growing in order to die. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="355" id="355">[355]</span> other words, the Gentiles are sick, and the Jews are dying. The Jewish girl was twelve years of age, and the woman had been sick for twelve years. For twelve years the woman suffered from the issue of blood, and for twelve years the girl was growing in order to die. This signifies that while the Gentiles are sick of sinful things, the Jews are growing in order to die. After the woman was healed, the Lord Jesus arrived at the home of the Jewish ruler, signifying that when the salvation of the Gentiles is in full, Christ will reach the house of Israel.</p>

This indicates that at the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel by the Lord’s coming and His direct touch (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62648" data-verses="Romans 11:25-26">Rom. 11:25-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62649" data-verses="Zechariah 12:10">Zech. 12:10</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM5Ul8kKGElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> When Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a tumult, He said, “Depart, for the girl has not died, but sleeps. And they ridiculed Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62650" data-verses="Matthew 9:23-24">vv. 23-24</span>). In His ministry, the Lord never cared for any crowd. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62651" data-verses="Matthew 9:25">Verse 25</span> says, “But when the crowd was put out, He entered and took hold of her hand, and the girl was raised up.” By this we see that the Lord Jesus intended to raise the Jews, but that they did not have the faith. This gave an excellent chance to the Gentiles to contact the Lord to receive salvation. After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus will reach the house of Israel, and all the dead Jews will be healed.</p>

In the millennial kingdom, which will be the restored tabernacle of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62656" data-verses="Acts 15:16">Acts 15:16</span>), the Messianic kingdom, the Jews will recognize Christ as the Son of David, and their blindness will be healed.

Before such a revival, so many Christians are blind, unable to see God or the things of God, and dumb, unable to speak a word for God. If those in the denominations today are asked to give a prayer, many are unable to do so and they will reply, “This is not my job, my profession. Ask the pastor to pray.” This indicates that they are possessed by a dumb demon. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62670" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:1">First Corinthians 12</span> reveals that we are not serving dumb idols. Thus, we must be speaking, bubbling. Our eyes are opened to see the things of God, and our mouths are opened to praise Him and to testify of Him. We all must be this kind of person. This healing is a shadow, a miniature, of the coming millennium.</p>

This is a further revelation. He is not only the Physician and the Bridegroom, but also the Shepherd. Without the further continuation of His ministry, this environment would not have been produced. Therefore, we see once again that in order to have Christ revealed to us, we must have the ministry to bring forth a certain environment. The great feast attended by tax collectors and sinners was an excellent opportunity for the Lord to reveal Himself as the Physician. Furthermore, the environment when so many were rejoicing and feasting together gave the Lord the opportunity to reveal Himself as the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin.

His kingdom is established with things of life that can grow and multiply. He is the Lord who owns this crop. We are both the flock and the crop. The flock is made up of living animals and the crop of living vegetation. Under the hand of the Lord Jesus, nothing is lifeless. He does not care for lifeless things, but for things that are living.

<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCm6itoRw2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> We all need to see a vision of the Lord Jesus as the Lord of the harvest. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62682" data-verses="Matthew 9:38">verse 38</span> the Lord told us to beseech the Lord of the harvest that He may thrust out workers into His harvest. Firstly, in His economy, God has a plan to accomplish. Then His economy requires His people to beseech, to pray, for it. In answering their prayer, He will accomplish what they have prayed concerning His plan. Many times when we sense the need for workers, we sound out the call for help. But from now on, whenever you sense the need for workers, you must firstly pray to the Lord of the harvest, saying, “Lord, here is Your harvest. You are the Lord of the harvest. We call on You to thrust out some reapers. Lord, send more reapers into Your harvest.” Praying like this will <span class="pg" data-page-id="360" id="360">[360]</span> make a difference. To pray like this means that we have seen a vision that our Christ, the kingly One, the Shepherd, is the Lord of the harvest. Whenever you pray that the Lord would send reapers into His harvest, you honor Him very much. How different this is from inviting people to help you in your work! When you do that, you do not honor Christ as the Lord of the harvest. Rather, it is a matter of your work, not of His harvest. You become the master of that work, and He is not considered as the Lord of the harvest. Therefore, we need to call on Him and say, “Lord, You are the Lord of the harvest. The work in this field is Yours, and this harvest is Your crop. We call on You for Your crop. Lord, send Your reapers.”</p>

Although this brother’s talk was nice, it was rather natural. It had no vision whatever. Instead of inviting me, this brother should have prayed, “Lord, the church in my locality is the harvest of the heavenly King. Lord of the harvest, I call on You to send reapers.” Is the church in your locality your harvest or His harvest? Since it is the Lord’s harvest, you have no right to invite others to go there to labor. To do this is to infringe upon the Lord’s honor. In doing this you fail to recognize that you are not the Lord. He is the Lord of the harvest. The only thing you can do is to ask Him to thrust out reapers. We need further revelation regarding this aspect of the Lord.</p>

Although the Bible does not tell us this, I believe that they did pray. It is a principle in the Bible that, whenever you pray to the Lord for something, the Lord will send you to accomplish that for which you have prayed. The twelve disciples prayed for the Lord of the harvest to send out reapers, and the Lord answered their prayer by sending them out. Whoever prays will be the one sent. For example, you may pray to the Lord regarding the shortage of elders. (However, do not pray according to your ambition, lest the Lord not answer your prayer.) You may simply pray, “Lord, there is the need of elders.” After a certain period of time, <span class="pg" data-page-id="361" id="361">[361]</span> the Lord may say, “How about you?” This is the principle.

In sending out the twelve apostles, the Lord arranged them in pairs: Simon Peter and Andrew, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean and Judas Iscariot. We need to be impressed with this principle. We all must be paired. None of us, especially the young people, should go anywhere by ourselves. We need another one to match us. Look at your eyes, ears, nostrils, lips, shoulders, arms, hands, legs, and feet: your body is arranged in pairs. Whenever you are burdened by the Lord to go to a certain place, do not go by yourself. Rather, go in pairs. If you do not have another one to match you, you will miss the blessing. In order to receive the blessing, you must be paired.

The heavenly King’s prediction here concerning the persecution of His apostles by Judaism indicated that the kingdom He was establishing through His apostles’ preaching would be rejected by Judaism. This also proves that His kingdom is not earthly but heavenly.</p>

The entire world, whether the Jewish world or the Gentile world, opposes God’s kingdom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62714" data-verses="Matthew 10:17">Verse 17</span> says, <span class="pg" data-page-id="366" id="366">[366]</span> “But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to Sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.” This verse indicates that even the Jewish nation had been fully taken over by God’s enemy. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, this nation belonged to God in name, but not in actuality. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62715" data-verses="Matthew 10:17">verse 17</span> the Lord spoke of persecution coming from the Sanhedrin and the synagogues. The Sanhedrin was the highest council among the children of Israel. The Sanhedrin’s function was to see that the Jews followed the law of the Old Testament. The synagogue was a place where the Word of God was taught to the children of Israel. It is very significant that the Lord exposed the Sanhedrin and the synagogues as being opposed to God’s economy. He said that His apostles, His sent ones, would be delivered up to Sanhedrins and scourged in the synagogues. A synagogue is obviously not a theater, a casino, or an idol temple. In a sense, it was a holy place, a place where the holy Word of God was taught to God’s people. Nevertheless, the Lord said that the apostles of the King of the heavens would be scourged even in the synagogues. By this we see what an evil thing the synagogue had become. Although the Jews went there to learn the Word of God, those in the synagogues persecuted the apostles of the heavenly King. Furthermore, the Sanhedrin, organized with the intention of overseeing the children of Israel in the matter of keeping the Scriptures, was a place that would also oppose the apostles of the heavenly King.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rXGVsTgQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> The situation is the same today. If the ancient Sanhedrin and synagogues opposed the King’s sent ones, then how about the system of today’s religion? If we are truly the ones sent by the heavenly King, we shall be opposed by today’s religious organizations just as the apostles were opposed by Judaism. In ancient times the apostles were persecuted not primarily by the Gentiles, but by the so-called holy people in the Sanhedrin and in the synagogues. In our experience throughout the years, nearly all the persecution, rumors, opposition, and attack have come from the religious organizations, not from the Gentiles. <span class="pg" data-page-id="367" id="367">[367]</span> </p>

If the Lord Jesus had not said this Himself, I certainly would not believe it. Rather, I would say, “Those in the Sanhedrin and in the synagogues may have made some mistakes, but they are certainly God’s people, for daily they talk about the Scriptures and teach people to fear God, to worship God, to honor God, and to glorify God. They’re not that bad. How can you say that they are wolves?” But the Lord Jesus called them wolves. At that time, the wolves spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62717" data-verses="Matthew 10:16">verse 16</span> were those in the Sanhedrins and in the synagogues mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62718" data-verses="Matthew 10:17">verse 17</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvR3dgp5vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> Saul of Tarsus studied at the feet of Gamaliel, a great Bible teacher, “a teacher of the law, honored by all the people” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62719" data-verses="Acts 22:3">Acts 22:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62720" data-verses="Acts 5:34">5:34</span>). Gamaliel was one of the leaders in the Sanhedrin. Was Gamaliel for God? Yes, he was. He feared God and he was for God, but he was in an environment that was absolutely against God’s economy. He was part of a system, the Sanhedrin, that opposed God. It has been the same down through the centuries until today. No matter how much certain ones are for God, they are in a system, an organization, which is against God’s economy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62721" data-verses="Revelation 2:9">Revelation 2:9</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62722" data-verses="Revelation 3:9">3:9</span> the Lord Jesus spoke of “the synagogue of Satan.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62723" data-verses="Matthew 10:1">Matthew 10</span> the Lord indicated that there were wolves in the synagogues, and in Revelation He spoke of the synagogue of Satan. This indicated that the synagogues had become satanic.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LUEbnD-_aKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> The Lord Jesus did not come firstly to the Gentile world. He came to a nation that was supposed to be the holy people of God. This nation had the holy Scriptures, the holy city, the holy temple, the holy priesthood, and the holy sacrifices. He came to this nation with the purpose of establishing the kingdom of the heavens. It seems that there should have been no difficulty whatever. But when <span class="pg" data-page-id="368" id="368">[368]</span> this heavenly King was sending out His apostles for the spread of His ministry, He warned them that He was sending them out as sheep in the midst of wolves. The Lord seemed to be saying, “Those in the Sanhedrin, the ones who care for the holy Scriptures, will persecute you, and those in the synagogue, the ones who teach the Word of God, will scourge you. Be careful! They are not the holy people of God—they are wolves. They are not for God; they are against Him.” Suppose you were among those Jews sent out by the heavenly King and you heard that those in the Sanhedrin and in the synagogues were wolves. Would you not be shocked? Nevertheless, this is exactly what the Lord was saying here. The Lord did not say that the soldiers in the Roman army were wolves, but that those in the Sanhedrin and in the synagogues, those handling the Word of God and teaching it to God’s people, were wolves. Throughout the centuries, the situation has been the same in principle.</p>
<p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY4j_C-Z8lV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62724" data-verses="Matthew 9:36">9:36</span> the Lord likened the people to sheep. Among the children of Israel, there were both sheep and wolves. These wolves were in the Sanhedrin and in the synagogues. They were cultured wolves, civilized wolves, religious wolves. Those wolves knew the Bible rather well. Although they could quote verses and worship God according to the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus did not consider them as sheep, but as wolves. Therefore, at the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62725" data-verses="Matthew 10:1">Matthew 10</span>, there was a complicated situation among the children of Israel, for the sheep and the wolves were mixed together. There was no problem as long as the sheep went along with the wolves. However, the Shepherd came and sent out the undershepherds to collect the sheep. If we read these chapters carefully, we shall see that the gathering of the sheep is the reaping of the harvest. All the sheep, the harvest, were scattered among the wolves and mixed in with the wolves. When the sheep desired to go with the undershepherds sent by the Shepherd, the wolves would rise up and say, “What! You are proselytizing. You are stirring up the sheep!” In this way the wolf nature is exposed, and the wolves attack the undershepherds. Hence, <span class="pg" data-page-id="369" id="369">[369]</span> the Lord said that, as sheep in the midst of wolves, His sent ones must be prudent as serpents and guileless as doves. When the wolves attack, the sent ones must be prudent as serpents to escape. At the same time, they should also be as harmless as doves.</p>

Thus, the Lord indicated that God’s kingdom would be opposed not only by the Jewish religious world but also by the Gentile secular world. Eventually, the apostles were brought before the Roman governors and kings. They were persecuted, and they became a testimony. This reveals that both the religious world and the political world are the same in opposing the kingdom of the heavens, for both are under the usurping hand of God’s enemy. The intention of the heavenly King is to establish His kingdom on earth within the territory of religion and politics. This will certainly arouse opposition and persecution.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFDBFm25HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62727" data-verses="Matthew 10:19-20">verses 19 and 20</span> the Lord said, “But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you shall speak; for it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.” The apostles have not only the authority of the heavenly King (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62728" data-verses="Matthew 10:1">v. 1</span>), but also the Spirit of their heavenly Father. The King’s authority deals with the unclean spirits and diseases; the Father’s Spirit deals with the opposers’ persecution. The Lord was charging His sent ones not to speak from themselves whenever they met persecution. He seemed to be saying, “Don’t be anxious, and don’t talk from yourselves. The Spirit of your Father is with you.” As long as we have the Spirit of the Lord, we have the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord here is the Spirit for speaking. We should learn to face persecution not in ourselves, but learn to turn to our spirit and trust the <span class="pg" data-page-id="370" id="370">[370]</span> indwelling Spirit. We must believe that the Father’s Spirit is with us and that He will deal with the opposers and persecutors. This is not an easy thing to learn. We must face opposition and confront attack, not in ourselves, but by turning to our spirit where the Spirit of God dwells. We must trust in Him, let Him lead us, and let Him do the speaking.</p>

It may include being saved from those who hate, but eventually it means to be saved into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, a reward to the overcoming believers. It is to be saved from dispensational punishment during the millennium. This differs from eternal salvation as revealed in Ephesians. </p>

The heavenly King came to call some out from his usurpation. This certainly aroused Satan’s opposition. Satan instigated the people under his usurpation to fight against the heavenly King’s called ones. Thus, the King’s coming did not bring peace, but a sword. In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there must be a confrontation between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of the world. These two kingdoms cannot co-exist.

Not only do the sent ones have the King’s authority and peace and the Spirit of the Father, but they are also one with the King and are identified with Him.

In the Lord’s recovery we have the authority, the peace, the Spirit, and the identification with our King. We are one with Him. Whoever receives us receives the King, and whoever rejects us rejects the King. This is not an insignificant matter. It is very serious. We all need to have the assurance that we have the authority, the peace, the Spirit, and the identification. All this is for the spreading of the King’s ministry. The King is still spreading His ministry today, and we are His sent ones with the authority, the peace, the Spirit, and the identification.</p>

The record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62785" data-verses="Matthew 10:1">chapter ten</span> indicates that both the King’s ministry and the enlargement of His ministry by the twelve apostles were rejected. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62786" data-verses="Matthew 10:1">chapter ten</span> the Lord told the apostles that they would be persecuted and hated, even by the so-called holy people in the Sanhedrin and in the synagogues. He warned them that they would be persecuted even by their relatives. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62787" data-verses="Matthew 11:1">chapter eleven</span> we see that three ministries are rejected: the ministry of John the Baptist, the ministry of the King, and the ministry of the King’s sent ones, the twelve apostles. John was rejected, the Lord Jesus was rejected, and according to His charge to the twelve apostles, their ministry also was to be rejected. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62788" data-verses="Matthew 11:1">chapter eleven</span> we see how the King deals with this rejection.

Thus, John “sent by his disciples and said to Him, Are You the coming One, or should we expect someone else?” John the Baptist’s word here does not mean that he was in doubt concerning Christ. He questioned Christ in this way in order to provoke Him to deliver him. He knew that Christ was the coming One, and he had strongly recommended <span class="pg" data-page-id="378" id="378">[378]</span> Him to the people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62790" data-verses="John 1:26-36">John 1:26-36</span>). After that, he was put into prison (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62791" data-verses="Matthew 4:12">Matt. 4:12</span>) and waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him. However, although Christ did much to help others, He did nothing for him. For this reason, John was in danger of being stumbled (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62792" data-verses="Matthew 11:6">v. 6</span>). Hence, he sent his disciples to Christ with such a stirring question. There was no doubt in John’s mind that Christ was the Messiah. He did not send his disciples to ask the Lord whether or not He was the Messiah. He was trying to provoke Christ to rescue him from prison. But it is very difficult to stir up the Lord Jesus. The more you try to provoke Him, the colder He becomes to you. You can never stir Him up by provoking Him. If you try to do this, He will become less willing to do something for you.</p>

By this, He gave clear evidence to John that no other could have done such a miracle but the Messiah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62795" data-verses="Isaiah 35:5">Isa. 35:5</span>). In spiritual significance, the blind receiving sight is also first. In the Lord’s salvation, He firstly opens our eyes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62796" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>); then we can receive Him and walk to follow Him. The lame signify those who cannot walk in God’s way. After being saved, they can walk by new life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62797" data-verses="Matthew 9:5-6">9:5-6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62798" data-verses="John 5:8-9">John 5:8-9</span>). The cleansed lepers signify those who have been saved from their rebellion (leprosy) to become the kingdom people. The deaf signify those who cannot hear God. After being saved, they can hear the Lord’s voice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62799" data-verses="John 10:27">John 10:27</span>). The dead signify those who are dead in sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62800" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Eph. 2:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62801" data-verses="Ephesians 2:5">5</span>), unable to contact God. After being regenerated, with their <span class="pg" data-page-id="379" id="379">[379]</span> regenerated spirit they can fellowship with God. The poor signify all the ones without Christ, without God, who have no hope in the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62802" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12">Eph. 2:12</span>). Upon receiving the gospel, they are made rich in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62803" data-verses="2Corinthians 8:9">2 Cor. 8:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62804" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Eph. 3:8</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62805" data-verses="Matthew 11:6">Verse 6</span> says, “And blessed is he who shall not be stumbled in Me.” This word implies that John the Baptist was in danger of being stumbled in the Lord, because the Lord did not act on his behalf according to his way. Here the Lord encouraged him to take the way the Lord had ordained for him that he might be blessed. This blessing has much to do with the participation in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85wwwQ2Yn2Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> In these verses the Lord seemed to be saying to John, “There is no doubt that I am the Messiah. My being the Messiah does not depend on whether or not I do something for you. I have healed the blind, the deaf, and the sick. I have even raised the dead. But I don’t choose to do anything for you. Do not expect anything from Me. I will leave you in prison until you are beheaded. Blessed is the one who is not stumbled in Me.” In the Lord’s recovery we need to learn this lesson. Whenever the Lord does something positive for us, we are excited. But many times the Lord will not do anything for us. The reason He did nothing to rescue John from prison was that if John had been released from prison his ministry would have been in competition with the Lord’s ministry. John’s imprisonment was arranged sovereignly of the Lord to terminate his ministry, which was the ministry of recommendation. After the recommending work had been done, his ministry should be terminated. Therefore, God sovereignly terminated John’s ministry by imprisoning him.</p>

Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62806" data-verses="Matthew 11:7-15">verses 7 through 15</span> the Lord publicly appraised His forerunner. Concealed within the Lord’s reply to John was an indication of John’s weakness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> However, His words to the crowds concerning John testified publicly for John. Remember that the first four disciples were brought in through John’s ministry of recommendation. John had declared, “Behold the Lamb of God,” and John and Andrew followed the Lord Jesus. Eventually they brought James and Peter to the Lord as well. Thus, the first four disciples were brought to Christ through the ministry of John the Baptist.</p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62807" data-verses="Matthew 11:7">verse 7</span> the Lord said, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?” A reed signifies a weak and fragile person (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62808" data-verses="Matthew 12:20">12:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62809" data-verses="1Kings 14:15">1 Kings 14:15</span>). When John the Baptist was testifying for Christ in the wilderness, he was not like a reed, a weak person. However, now in prison he was somewhat like a reed shaken by the wind. The Lord Jesus is wise, kind, and merciful. If we had been the Lord, we would have been offended by John. Because the Lord knew that John was somewhat weakened, He encouraged him. He seemed to be saying, “John, be careful. It seems that you are at least somewhat weakened concerning Me.” This was the meaning of the Lord’s word to John. But when He spoke to the crowds and to the other disciples, He vindicated John, indicating that he was not a weak, timid person, but a strong witness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62810" data-verses="Matthew 11:8">verse 8</span> the Lord asked, “But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.” After testifying boldly for Christ in the wilderness, John the Baptist became weak when he had been imprisoned for a time. Some might think that he would desire to wear soft clothing in the houses of kings. But the Lord testified that he was neither a reed shaken by the wind nor a man dressed in soft clothing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="381" id="381">[381]</span> </p>

Compared to the Old Testament prophets, John was greater; but compared to the New Testament people, he was smaller. John was in a transitory period, greater than those who preceded him, but smaller than those who were to come after him. All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come. The prophets were looking forward to Christ, but John saw Christ. Hence, John was greater than all the prophets. Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him. But the kingdom people do. John could only say, “Here is Christ,” but <span class="pg" data-page-id="382" id="382">[382]</span> the kingdom people can say, “For to me to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62814" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>). Hence, the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he. Whether anyone is greater or lesser depends upon his relationship to Christ. Christ is the deciding factor. The closer anyone is to Christ, the greater he is.</p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UASi0cV3MzKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> The prophets prophesied concerning the coming of Christ, and John recommended the Christ who had come. The prophets said that Christ was coming, and John said that Christ was there. Although John the Baptist was close to Christ, he was not as close to Him as we are, for we have Christ within us. Christ is in us, and we are in Him. Because Christ is mingled with us, our relationship with Christ is most intimate. We are in Christ, Christ is in us, and we are mingled with Him, even joined to Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62815" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">First Corinthians 6:17</span> says, “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.” What could be closer than this?

Peter, John, and even Paul were in the beginning of the kingdom age, but we are in the closing of this age. Where would you rather be—in the beginning, in the middle, or in the conclusion? Martin Luther was in the middle, but we are neither in the beginning nor in the middle, but at the end. Great men like Martin Luther stood on the shoulders of the early apostles, but now we are on the shoulders of Martin Luther and other great ones. Hence, we are higher than all of them. Even the smallest among us is able to give a strong testimony on being justified by faith both objectively and subjectively. Do not regard this day as an insignificant day.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYNUFHrFx6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> When I was seeking the Lord fifty years ago, the situation was quite poor. We spent much money on books, and we traveled to see certain people. There is no comparison with the situation of today. Today you are all buried with riches. My only concern is that you do not have the adequate appetite. We are feasting every day. We are not in <span class="pg" data-page-id="383" id="383">[383]</span> the transitory period, neither are we in the beginning nor in the middle of the New Testament age; we are in the conclusion of this age. At the conclusion everything is better, higher, and richer. Praise the Lord that we are so close to Christ! Many of the messages you have heard concerning Christ have not been heard by others in the past. Many of you were in Christianity for years. Were you ever told about the all-inclusive Christ? Did you ever hear about eating Jesus? But now we are eating Him and enjoying Him. Thus, we are greater. Do you dare to say that you are greater? According to the principle in the Bible, the later is always the greater. The last will be the first. Because we are the last, we are the greatest.</p>

John and Christ sang “a dirge” to preach repentance, but the Judaizers “did not beat the breast” for the grief of sin. The righteousness of God required them to repent, but they would not obey.

In this verse some authorities read “children” instead of “works.” The kingdom people are the children of wisdom, who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom. Christ is justified by the kingdom people, who know when to eat and when not to eat and who recognize the playing of the flute and the singing of the dirge, knowing when to rejoice and when to repent. We, the kingdom people, the children of wisdom, have the wisdom to discern when to repent and when to rejoice. But the rejecting generation is absolutely foolish. If you play them a song, they do not respond. If you sing them a dirge for repentance, they do not respond to that either. They are stubborn and foolish, and they lack wisdom.</p>

This word implies that the wise and intelligent rejected the Son because the Father was not pleased to give them to the Son. However, all the remnant has been delivered to the Son by the Father.

It is absolutely of the Father’s sovereign mercy that we are in the Lord’s recovery today. We need to worship the Father for this. Among the many Christians in the world, we are in the recovery. I have the deep sense within that through the years the Lord’s recovery has been in this country, He has been reaping a harvest. He has been gathering a remnant among the Christians. During the years we were in Elden hall in Los Angeles, the Lord was gathering His remnant. Month after month, the Lord brought His remnant from various cities, states, and countries. That was a real gathering of the remnant. All those who were gathered together can testify that we were delivered by the Father. The Lord’s recovery is not a <span class="pg" data-page-id="390" id="390">[390]</span> common Christian work; it is the gathering of the Lord’s remnant to recover God’s kingdom in the church life.

Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge; and concerning the Father, only the Son has such knowledge. Hence, to know the Son requires the Father’s revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62864" data-verses="Matthew 16:17">16:17</span>), and to know the Father requires the Son’s revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62865" data-verses="John 17:6">John 17:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62866" data-verses="John 17:26">26</span>).

The Lord’s recovery is absolutely against the enemy’s kingdom of darkness. No doubt the evil one is not willing to let people know the things of the Father, the Son, and the Lord’s recovery. Thus, there is the need of the Father’s sovereign mercy. It is sovereign of the Lord that we have seen certain things and have been brought into them. Although others condemn them, we rejoice over them because we have seen them. Our seeing is not due to our intelligence; it is due to the mercy of the Father.

<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faCKCul4qZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62868" data-verses="Matthew 11:28">verse 28</span> the Lord sounded out a call: “Come to Me, all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="391" id="391">[391]</span> The Lord seemed to be saying, “All you who labor and are burdened, come to Me and rest. All you religious people and all you worldly people who are laboring and are burdened, come to Me and I will give you rest.” What a gracious word! The labor mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62869" data-verses="Matthew 11:28">verse 28</span> refers not only to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations, but also to the labor of struggling to be successful in any work. Whoever labors thus is always heavily burdened. After the Lord had praised the Father, acknowledging the Father’s way and declaring the divine economy, He called this kind of people to come to Him for rest. Rest refers not only to being set free from labor and burden under the law and religion or under any work and responsibility, but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction.</p>

<p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wL48er-vlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62870" data-verses="Matthew 11:29-30">verses 29 and 30</span> we have the way to rest: “Take My yoke on you and learn from Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest to your souls; for My yoke is pleasant and My burden is light.” The Lord’s yoke is to take the will of the Father. It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligations of the law or religion, nor to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father. The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62871" data-verses="John 4:34">John 4:34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62872" data-verses="John 5:30">5:30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62873" data-verses="John 6:38">6:38</span>). He submitted Himself fully to the Father’s will (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62874" data-verses="Matthew 26:39">26:39</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62875" data-verses="Matthew 26:42">42</span>). Hence, He asks us to learn from Him. God’s will is our yoke. Thus, we are not free to do as we please; rather, we are yoked. Young people, do not think that you are so free or liberated. In the Lord’s recovery we all have been yoked. How good it is to be yoked! The Lord’s yoke is pleasant and His burden is light. The Lord’s yoke is the Father’s will, and His burden is the work to carry out the Father’s will. Such a yoke is pleasant, not bitter, and such a burden is light, not heavy. The Greek word rendered “pleasant” signifies fit for use; hence, good, kindly, mild, gentle, easy, <span class="pg" data-page-id="392" id="392">[392]</span> pleasant, in contrast to what is hard, harsh, sharp, and bitter.</p>

Learning from Him</h2><p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0i34MknGM-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62876" data-verses="Matthew 11:29">verse 29</span> the Lord tells us to learn from Him. He is meek and lowly in heart. To be meek means not to resist any opposition, and to be lowly means not to esteem oneself highly. In all the opposition the Lord was meek, and in all the rejection He was lowly in heart. He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself nor expecting to gain something for Himself. Hence, regardless of the situation, He had rest in His heart. He was fully satisfied with His Father’s will.</p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GtSFFb9AsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> The Lord said that if we take His yoke upon us and learn from Him, we shall find rest to our souls. The rest we find by taking the Lord’s yoke and learning from Him is for our souls. It is an inward rest; it is not anything merely outward in nature.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XroqaH7p55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> If we are opposed as we minister, and we resist, we shall not have peace. But if instead of resisting we submit to the will of the Father, testifying that the opposition is of the Father, we shall have rest in our souls. John the Baptist did not regard his imprisonment as of the Father; therefore, he was not at rest. If he had realized that his imprisonment was due to the Father’s will, he would have been at rest, even in prison. Christ, the heavenly King, always submitted to the Father’s will, taking God’s will as His portion and not resisting anything. Hence, He was always at rest. We must learn of Him and also take this view. If we do, we shall have rest in our souls.</p>

The Heavenly King and His Disciples<br/>Going through the Grain Fields on the Sabbath and the Disciples Picking the Ears to Eat</h2>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzklNtLdcsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62879" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">Matthew 12:1</span> says, “At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grain fields; and His disciples were hungry and began to pick the ears and to eat.” “At that time” joins <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62880" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62881" data-verses="Matthew 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. At the time the Lord called people to rest from striving to keep the law and religious regulations, He went on the Sabbath through the grain fields, and His disciples began to pick the ears and to eat, seemingly breaking the Sabbath. Remember, in his record Matthew puts certain facts together to present a doctrine. The record in the other gospels is not exactly the same as the record here. The phrase “at that time” is very important. It refers to the time of calling people into His rest. At that time, all His disciples were hungry. Whenever we are hungry, we do not have rest. Rest <span class="pg" data-page-id="394" id="394">[394]</span> includes satisfaction. When you are satisfied, you are at rest. But if you do not have satisfaction, you do not have rest.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFDBlm27HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> When the Lord called people into rest, His disciples were hungry. For this reason, He brought them to the grain fields, fields growing wheat. No doubt He knew that these fields were rather ripe, full of ears good for eating. The Lord Jesus purposely did this. Realizing that His disciples were hungry, He took them to the grain fields for rest. This is a sign. The call to come to Him for rest given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62882" data-verses="Matthew 11:1">chapter eleven</span> was sounded on the Sabbath day. This is proved by the words “at that time” which begin <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62883" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. The Sabbath was a day of rest. On the day of rest the Lord called people into rest. He seemed to be saying, “You people are keeping the Sabbath, yet you are still laboring and striving to keep the law. You are heavily burdened with all the laws, rituals, forms, and regulations. Although you are keeping the Sabbath outwardly, actually you do not have any rest. You need to come to Me. You labor and are burdened with the matter of law keeping. Come to Me, and you will find rest.” Peter and John might have said, “We are hungry and cannot rest. We need something to eat.” But that day was the Sabbath, and virtually all activity had ceased. Hence, it was difficult for the disciples to find anything to eat. Knowing this, the Lord Jesus took them into the grain fields.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYHvOp0S2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> Years ago I could not understand why the Lord Jesus did this. Now I understand that He did it because He had called people into His rest on the Sabbath. He knew that His disciples were hungry and that, because it was the Sabbath, it was difficult to find something to eat. They could not buy anything, do anything, or go anywhere. The disciples could have said, “Lord Jesus, what shall we do? You have called us to come to You for rest; but we are hungry, and there seems to be no way for us to get anything to eat. How can we rest when we have such hunger?” The disciples were under the burden of keeping the Sabbath regulations. These regulations had become a heavy burden to the hungry disciples. Thus, the Lord Jesus took <span class="pg" data-page-id="395" id="395">[395]</span> the lead not to keep these regulations by bringing His disciples out of a regulation-keeping situation into the grain fields. The Lord’s intention in doing this was to free the disciples from the Sabbath-keeping regulations. When they came into the grain fields, everyone was freed from this burden and was satisfied. Everyone entered into rest. This is the background of the Lord’s rejection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62884" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span>. Should the disciples suffer hunger and keep the Sabbath, or should they forget the Sabbath and find something to eat to satisfy their hunger? The Lord took the lead to bring His hungry disciples into the grain fields where they all found something to eat.</p>

The Pharisees Seeing and Condemning</h2><p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbYzs6EaYwZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62885" data-verses="Matthew 12:2">Verse 2</span> says, “But the Pharisees seeing it said to Him, Behold, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.” The Pharisees, the “Sabbath Patrol,” caught the Lord Jesus and His disciples. They must have been watching the Lord. Otherwise, why would they have been in the grain fields on the Sabbath day? The Pharisees must have been deliberately following Him and spying on Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiFKxK1TZM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> The Pharisees condemned what the Lord’s disciples were doing, saying it was not lawful on the Sabbath. The Sabbath was for the Jews to remember the completion of God’s creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62886" data-verses="Genesis 2:2">Gen. 2:2</span>), to keep the sign of God’s covenant with them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62887" data-verses="Ezekiel 20:12">Ezek. 20:12</span>), and to remember God’s redemption for them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62888" data-verses="Deuteronomy 5:15">Deut. 5:15</span>). Hence, to profane the Sabbath was a serious matter in the eyes of the religious Pharisees. To them it was not lawful, not scriptural. But they did not have adequate knowledge of the Scripture. According to their meager knowledge, they cared for the ritual of keeping the Sabbath, not for the hunger of the people. What folly to observe a vain ritual!</p>

The King’s Defense</h2><p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrECsnpu7irHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> This environment afforded the Lord Jesus the opportunity to reveal more of Himself. To the Pharisees, Jesus <span class="pg" data-page-id="396" id="396">[396]</span> had been caught. But to the Lord Jesus this was an opportunity to reveal both to them and to His disciples who He was. Thus far, He had been revealed as the Physician, the Bridegroom, the Shepherd, and the Lord of the harvest. After being caught by the Pharisees, the Lord revealed Himself in at least five other major aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMhs4rsqqCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9">a. David and His Men Having Entered<br/>into the House of God<br/>and Having Eaten the Showbread</h2><p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz9FocIJxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62889" data-verses="Matthew 12:3-4">verses 3 and 4</span>, the Lord asked the Pharisees, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?” The Pharisees said that it was not lawful for the Lord’s disciples to pick the ears in the grain fields and to eat, condemning them for acting contrary to the Scriptures. But the Lord answered, “Have you not read,” pointing out to them another aspect in the Scriptures that justified Him and His disciples. This condemned the Pharisees for lacking adequate knowledge of the Scriptures. The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, “You come here to catch Me according to the Scriptures. Do not think that you know the Bible so well. You only know it in part, in a very superficial way. You have never touched the depths of the Scriptures. You might have read it, but you do not understand it. Read about what David did when he and those with him were hungry. They ate something, the showbread in the temple, which according to the Levitical regulations they should not have eaten. You Pharisees think that I have done something illegal. But have you not read that David and his followers did the same thing?” We must admire the Lord’s knowledge of the Bible.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxCiUGKfL68vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> The Lord’s word here implies that He was the real David. In ancient times, David and his followers, when rejected, entered into the house of God and ate the <span class="pg" data-page-id="397" id="397">[397]</span> showbread, seemingly breaking the Levitical law. Now the real David and His followers were also rejected and took action to eat, seemingly against the sabbatical regulation. Just as David and his followers were not held guilty, neither should Christ and His disciples be condemned. Both cases were related to eating. King David was a prefigure of Christ, the real David. David had followers, and Christ, the real David, also had disciples as His followers. King David and his followers were rejected by the people, and the real David and His followers were rejected also. Just as David and his followers were hungry, so Christ and His disciples were also hungry. Furthermore, neither David and his followers nor Christ and His followers had anything to eat, but there was the place where there was something to eat. For David it was the house of God, and for Christ it was the grain fields. All this implies that David and his followers were a type, a shadow, of Christ and His disciples.</p>

<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkX_zE9wGiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> Furthermore, the Lord’s word here also implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship. In ancient times, the coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, in which the kings were above the priests. In the age of the priests, the leader of the people should listen to the priest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62890" data-verses="Numbers 27:21-22">Num. 27:21-22</span>). But in the age of the kings, the priest should submit to the king (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62891" data-verses="1Samuel 2:35-36">1 Sam. 2:35-36</span>). Hence, what King David did with his followers was not illegal. Now by the coming of Christ, the dispensation was also changed, this time from the age of the law to the age of grace, in which Christ was above all. Whatever He did was right. The matter of keeping the Sabbath belonged to the old dispensation of the law. But in the age of grace Christ has the final word. It is not a matter of the law, but of Christ. Therefore, the Lord seemed to be saying to the Pharisees, “You shouldn’t condemn Me or My disciples. It is no longer the law that gives the final word, but I, the Christ, I give you the final word. I am the real King, the real David. I am also the Christ who has brought in the dispensation of grace. Thus, whatever I say or do is the final decision.” Supposedly <span class="pg" data-page-id="398" id="398">[398]</span> the Pharisees knew the Bible, but here they clearly lost the case. How strong was the Lord’s defense!</p>

He pointed out that whatever the priests did in the temple on the Sabbath, they were guiltless.</p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57ZimE0aOTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St">c.

He was a Nazarene, but as He stood before the Pharisees He seemed to be saying, “Look at Me. I am greater than the temple.” The Pharisees must have been shocked to such an extent that they could not say anything.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5lrHa795o1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> The Lord’s revealing to the Pharisees that He was greater than the temple was another change, a type-fulfilling change from the temple to a Person. In the case of David, it was a change from one age to another. In this case, a case concerning the priests, it was a change from the temple to a Person who is greater than the temple. Since the priests were guiltless in doing things on the Sabbath in the temple, how could the Lord’s disciples be guilty in doing things on the Sabbath in Him who is greater than the temple? In the first case, it was the king breaking the Levitical regulation; in the second case, it was the priests breaking the sabbatical regulation. In the Scripture, neither was guilty. Hence, what the Lord did here was scripturally right.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn8fAbTw5z3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> Apparently the priests were profaning the Sabbath, but actually they were not profaning the Sabbath, because <span class="pg" data-page-id="399" id="399">[399]</span> they were in the temple. In that sphere every day and everything were holy. Outside the temple everything was common. But once something was brought into the temple, it was sanctified by the temple. Likewise, every day was sanctified by the temple. Outside the temple, there were common days and holy days, but within the temple there was no such distinction. Everything, every day, every matter, and everyone in the temple were holy. The temple, however, was a shadow, not the reality. The reality is Christ, the greater temple. The Lord seemed to be saying, “I am the greater temple, the real temple. In Me, Peter, John, and all the Galilean fishermen are sanctified, holy. In Me every day is a holy day. If the priests were free to move and engage in various activities on the Sabbath in the temple, then how much more can these dear ones freely do things within Me? The temple protected the priests, and I, the greater temple, protect all My disciples. Pharisees, don’t bother Me. Let My disciples be free, for they are all in the greater temple.” This was a change from the type to the reality. The Lord’s defense was too deep for the Pharisees to argue with. They had nothing with which to counter the Lord’s defense. Thus, they were silent.</p>

By this, the Lord pointed out that what the Pharisees did was not according to God’s heart. They were strict in the regulations, but neglected God’s mercy. But God desires to have mercy rather than sacrifice.</p>

He <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> won the case, and the Pharisees, who were shocked and frightened, were silenced. They had nothing to say. The Lord’s telling the Pharisees that He was Lord of the Sabbath was like someone today telling a highway patrolman that he is lord of the highway. Suppose you are stopped by a highway patrolman. Then you tell him, “Don’t bother me. I am the lord of the highway, and the highway belongs to me. You are simply a highway patrolman hired by me. As the lord of the highway, I can change all the regulations. Yes, I gave you some instructions concerning the highway, but now I am changing them.

As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath. Thus, the Lord gave the condemning Pharisees a threefold verdict. He was the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath. Therefore, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by Himself. He was above all rituals and regulations. Because He was there, no attention should be paid to any rituals and regulations.</p>

This took place on another Sabbath day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62898" data-verses="Luke 6:6">Luke 6:6</span>). The Lord Jesus certainly was a troublemaker. After causing trouble in the grain fields, defeating the “Sabbath Patrol,” according to Matthew’s record He went with His disciples to the synagogue to cause even more trouble. <span class="pg" data-page-id="401" id="401">[401]</span> </p>

When the Pharisees inquired of the Lord whether it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath, He said to them, “What man shall there be of you who shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbaths, will he not lay hold of it and lift it out? Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbaths” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62899" data-verses="Matthew 12:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). Here we see the Lord’s wisdom. This time He did not quote a verse, but He referred to their practice. In other words, in the first case the Lord quoted from the Bible, and in the second He appealed to history. Once again their mouths were shut.</p>

And he stretched it out, and it was restored sound as the other.” The Lord gave the man the word, “Stretch out your hand.” In the Lord’s word was the enlivening life. By stretching out his hand, the man took the Lord’s life-giving word, and his withered hand was restored by the life in this word.</p>

<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM4WV8iKGElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> Leading the disciples into the grain fields indicates that the Lord cares for Himself as the Head of the Body. As the Head, He is everything—the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath. Restoring the withered hand signifies that He cares for His members. He healed a man’s withered hand, likening this man to a sheep. The hand is a member of the body, and the sheep is a member of the flock. The Lord would do anything for the healing of His members, for the rescue of His fallen sheep. Sabbath or no Sabbath, the Lord is interested in healing the dead members of His Body. Regulations do not matter, but the rescue of His fallen sheep means everything to Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfOz34Tsbbftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> Instead of reading Matthew as a book of stories or merely as a book of doctrine, we must get into the depths of <span class="pg" data-page-id="402" id="402">[402]</span> this book. By putting these two cases together, we see that in the first case Christ took care of Himself as the Head and in the second He took care of the members of His Body. The hand is a member of the body, and the sheep is part of a flock, which also refers to the Body. In the first case the Lord Jesus took care of His lordship, of His headship. In the second case He took care of one of His weak, sickly members. He does not care for the Sabbath. He cares only for His headship and for the members of His Body, Therefore, we must conclude that the Lord cares only for Christ and the church. The Lord could say, “The Sabbath means nothing. I don’t care for that. I care for My headship and for the members of My Body. Because I am the Head, the Lord, whatever I say is right. I care for My headship. And I also care for My members. I want to make My members living. I want to rescue them, uplift them, and heal them. I don’t care for all these doctrinal, religious practices. I care only that My members are strong and living.” On the heart of this heavenly King was not the Sabbath, not any kind of doctrine, and not any regulation. Rather, on His heart was His lordship. We must see that He is Lord and that He is above the Sabbath. The Sabbath is merely an instrument used by Him, but He Himself is the Lord of the Sabbath. The Lord also cares for His members, including any member of His Body who is sick, weak, or in a difficult situation. He will do something for that member to rescue him, to heal him, and to make him living. I look to the Lord that we all would see this.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EGWH9TnECzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> The principle is the same today. As long as we are for Christ and for the church with all the members, everything is all right. There is no burden or regulation. On the Sabbath the twelve apostles were satisfied and at rest, and on the Sabbath the man with the withered hand was also at rest. Thus, these were genuine Sabbaths to the disciples and to the man with the withered hand because they received either the nourishment from Christ or the healing from Christ. Whatever they needed they received from Him. It is the same today. <span class="pg" data-page-id="403" id="403">[403]</span> </p>

Hence, they took counsel against Him, how they might destroy Him. The breaking of the Sabbath caused the Jewish religionists to reject the heavenly King. The Pharisees, the scriptural ones, plotted to kill Jesus for God! This is difficult to believe. But they were blinded by their religion. They could see neither Christ nor the church, neither the Head nor the members. They were absolutely blinded, veiled, covered, by their religion. According to their understanding, the Lord Jesus had to be destroyed, and they took counsel together for this very purpose. Eventually, they did put Christ on the cross; however, they did it according to the sovereignty of God.</p>

This was due to caring for His headship and for the members of His Body. Because of this, the rejection reached the ultimate. It is the same in principle today. The less we care for religious regulations and the more we care for Christ and His Body, the more intense the opposition will be.</p>

This indicates that while He was being rejected and opposed, He was still full of mercy. The Jews who were opposing Him were like bruised reeds and smoking flax. The Jews used to make <span class="pg" data-page-id="405" id="405">[405]</span> flutes or reeds. When a reed was bruised, they broke it. They also made torches with flax to burn oil. When the oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it. Some of the Lord’s people are like the bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound; others are like the smoking flax that cannot give a shining light. Yet the Lord will not break the bruised ones or quench the smoking ones. Although the Lord was rejected, He was still merciful. Even those who had become bruised reeds He would not break, and those who had become smoking flax He would not quench. Rather, He would still keep open the door of mercy and grace to them all. Among His followers and believers today, many have become bruised reeds that can no longer give a musical song. As a rule, these bruised reeds should be broken and thrown away. But Christ will not do this. Moreover, many of His believers no longer burn as a bright light. As a rule, He should quench them all and cast them away. But He will not do this either. Instead, He is merciful. No matter how much opposition, persecution, and attack, this heavenly King is always merciful. He is a merciful, kingly Savior. You may reject Him today, but He will still be merciful to you. Tomorrow if you say, “Lord Jesus, I repent,” He will deal with you lovingly. What a merciful Savior He is! He will never break a bruised reed or quench smoking flax. Rather, He would wait for you to receive His mercy and grace.</p>

On the one hand, He is strong; on the other hand, He is <span class="pg" data-page-id="406" id="406">[406]</span> merciful and meek. This is the King who established the kingdom of the heavens, and this is the way for Him to establish His kingdom. Do not think that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62912" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> the Lord was defeated. That is a mistaken concept. He was not defeated; He was establishing His kingdom. It is the same with us today. Do not say, “There is so much attack and opposition. Many rumors are being spread against us. How difficult it is for the Lord’s recovery. The recovery will be defeated.” This is wrong. Although we are so small in number, it seems that all of Christianity is rising up against us. But actually we are not wrong. Who loves the Bible and knows it more than we do? Do we not live in the presence of God and love the Lord Jesus? Do we not take Him as our life day by day? Then why do so many dear Christians oppose us and not others? It is the same today with us as it was with the Lord Jesus when He was on earth. Although He was a little man, the enemy of God knew that He was the One who would defeat him and establish the kingdom of the heavens. The principle is the same today. The enemy knows that this is the Lord’s recovery and that the recovery will defeat him and establish the kingdom of the heavens. Never consider the Lord’s recovery as an ordinary Christian work. The more opposition, persecution, criticism, and attacks there are, the more we are confirmed. Do not expect the opposition to decline. If no one opposed us, that would be a sign that we are wrong, that we have lost the testimony. But as long as we are being opposed and attacked, this is an indication that we are right. Instead of losing by being attacked, we are gaining. This is the way the kingdom of the heavens is built. It is built through being attacked, persecuted, and criticized. In Matthew <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62913" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> the Lord Jesus was not losing the battle—He was gaining. It is the same today. Praise the Lord that we do not fight the battle in a human way, but in the way of the Lord Jesus. While He was being attacked, He was gaining the victory. Likewise, the more the recovery is attacked, the more the kingdom of the heavens will be established. Without doubt, it is being established among us in the Lord’s recovery. Praise Him!</p>

<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiFKhKxApM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> We have seen that Matthew is a book concerned with the doctrine of the kingdom. In his Gospel Matthew does not give us a record of history; he takes the facts of history and puts them together to reveal the doctrine of the kingdom. Thus far, we have seen that Christ was born, was anointed, was tested, began His ministry, drew a crowd, decreed the heavenly constitution, and continued His ministry. His ministry produced the environment that enabled Him to reveal Himself in many aspects. Furthermore, His ministry caused Him to be fully rejected by that evil generation. We have also seen that the Lord called the laboring and burdened ones to come to Him for rest. He showed them that the way to rest is to break the regulations of religion and to care for the Head and for the members of the Body. It is through all this that the kingdom of the heavens is established on earth among men. We all need to be impressed with such a clear view.</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0aEjRoEM_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> Now we must see that in order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there is the need of a spiritual battle, of spiritual fighting. This fighting is implied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62914" data-verses="Matthew 12:22-37">12:22-37</span>. In the establishment of the kingdom a fight is raging on. Although we have covered many things, we have not yet seen that the establishment of the kingdom requires spiritual fighting. As Christ, the heavenly King, was establishing the heavenly kingdom among men on earth, He was fighting. People, however, did not see this warfare. They saw what He did outwardly, but they did not realize <span class="pg" data-page-id="408" id="408">[408]</span> what was taking place inwardly. Thus, Matthew selected another historical fact to point out the fighting that was going on as the King was establishing the heavenly kingdom.</p>

Nevertheless, what the Lord did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62916" data-verses="Matthew 12:22">verse 22</span> in healing a man possessed by a demon was a fact of history and could not be concealed.</p>

This is the real condition of all fallen people. Such a man was brought to the King, the King cast out the demon, and the man was able to see and to speak. He uttered what he saw. This undoubtedly was a miracle and a sign. In the Old Testament there is no record of a blind man miraculously receiving his sight. For a blind man to receive his sight is a great sign.</p>

Beelzebub means the lord of the flies. It was changed in contempt by the Jews to Baalzebel, which means the lord of the dunghill, and was used for the ruler of the demons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62920" data-verses="Mark 3:22">Mark 3:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62921" data-verses="Luke 11:15">Luke 11:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62922" data-verses="Luke 11:18-19">18-19</span>). The king of the dunghill, the most dirty place, full of flies, was Satan. Therefore, in the eyes of the ancient Jews, Beelzebub referred to Satan as the king of the demons and as the king of the dirty flies on the dunghill. To say that Christ cast out demons by Beelzebub meant that He cast them out by Satan. What blasphemy to accuse the heavenly King of this!</p>

If I did this, then Satan would be fighting against Satan, and his kingdom could not stand.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62924" data-verses="Matthew 12:26">Verse 26</span> is unique in the whole Bible in that no other verse opens the secret that Satan has his kingdom. Satan is the ruler of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62925" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>) and the ruler of the power of the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62926" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Eph. 2:2</span>). He has his authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62927" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>) and his angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62928" data-verses="Matthew 25:41">Matt. 25:41</span>), who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62929" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>). Hence, he has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62930" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Col. 1:13</span>, Gk.). Satan’s kingdom is built on earth and among men. But the heavenly King has come to establish a heavenly kingdom also among men on earth. Therefore, these two kingdoms are in conflict. Satan’s kingdom is the old kingdom, but the heavenly King is about to establish a new kingdom, the kingdom of the heavens. By this we see that a battle is raging.</p>

This word of the Lord indicates that the Pharisees were one with Satan, the ruler of the demons.</p>

By the Lord’s word <span class="pg" data-page-id="411" id="411">[411]</span> here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by just a man himself, but by a man with the Spirit of God.

This verse says, “Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his vessels unless he first bind the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.” The “house” here signifies the kingdom of Satan, and “the strong man” is Satan, the evil one. The Greek word translated “vessels” also means instruments, apparatus; hence, goods, stuff. The fallen people under Satan are his vessels, his instruments for his use. They are his goods kept in his house, his kingdom. The word about binding the strong man indicates that when the Lord cast out demons, He first bound Satan. The people saw only the casting out of the demon. They did not see the binding of Satan, the strong man. Thus, the Lord used the opportunity afforded Him by the accusation of the Pharisees to reveal the secret of spiritual fighting. Apparently, the Lord was only casting out the demon; actually, He was fighting, binding the strong man. This shows us that if we would build the kingdom today, we must first bind the strong man.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19K_I3CGgOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> The way to bind the strong man is to pray.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62937" data-verses="Matthew 17:21">17:21</span> the Lord told His disciples, “This kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.” If you do not pray and fast, you simply cannot cast out this kind of demon. The Lord’s word to His disciples indicates that before He cast out a demon, He surely fasted and prayed. In order to bind the strong man, we must fast and pray. The Lord fasted and prayed secretly. The disciples did not see this. We must learn of the Lord to fast in secret and to pray in secret. I believe that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He often fasted and prayed to fight the battle and to bind the strong man. We all must be in the same spirit today. Every day our spirit must be a fasting spirit and a praying spirit so that we may daily bind the strong man, who is Satan, the king of the kingdom of darkness.</p>
<p data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HB1W9RKFvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp"> Satan has a kingdom of darkness on earth, and the whole earth is under his usurpation. It is difficult to take one out of Satan’s hand. Every fallen person is a vessel in Satan’s house. Satan’s house is his kingdom, and in his house are many vessels, the many fallen persons. In order to take a fallen person out of Satan’s house, we must bind the strong man by prayer and fasting. This is the fighting of the spiritual battle for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCn4CtuSw2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62938" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">Chapter twelve</span> of Matthew occupies a special place in the New Testament because it reveals that Satan has a kingdom, that Satan is the strong man usurping all the God-created people, and that in order to take people out of his usurping hand, there is the need to bind him. The way to bind the strong man is by fasting and praying. The battle unveiled in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62939" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> is not seen in the foregoing eleven chapters. In those chapters we see the rest and the breaking of the regulations for the Head and for the members of the Body. But we do not see the kingdom of darkness. There are two kingdoms on earth: one is the kingdom of darkness, and the other is the kingdom of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="413" id="413">[413]</span> heavens in the light. These two kingdoms are now confronting each other on earth. Therefore, there is the need to fight the battle. We all must fast and pray to bind the strong man.

<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk8D-ZeIa1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> This is a real revelation. Not many Christians have read Matthew twelve in this way because they do not see the kingdom. To them, the kingdom is either simply a doctrinal term or something suspended for a future time. But we realize that all that the Lord is doing with us today is for the establishment of the heavenly kingdom. We are the kingdom people. Today a battle is raging between two kingdoms. The continuation of the Lord’s ministry produced the opportunity for this further revelation.</p>

But the Pharisees, seeing it, said that the Lord cast <span class="pg" data-page-id="414" id="414">[414]</span> out demons by Beelzebub, ruler of the demons. This was blasphemy against the Spirit.

But if the sinner blasphemes the Spirit, the Spirit will have no ground to work upon him, and there will be none left to cause him to repent and believe. Hence, it is impossible for such a person to be forgiven. This is not only logical, according to reason, but governmental according to God’s administrative principle, as revealed here by the Lord’s word.</p>

God’s forgiveness in this age is for sinners’ eternal salvation. This forgiveness is given both to sinners and believers. God’s forgiveness in the coming age is related to the believers’ dispensational reward. If a believer, after being saved, commits any sin, but will not make a clearance through confession and the cleansing of the Lord’s blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62954" data-verses="1John 1:7">1 John 1:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62955" data-verses="1John 1:9">9</span>) before he dies or the Lord comes back, this sin will not be forgiven in this age, but will remain to be judged at the judgment seat of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62956" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:10">2 Cor. 5:10</span>).

The Jews always seek for signs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62964" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:22">1 Cor. 1:22</span>).

The Pharisees seemed to be saying, “We want you to show us a sign, and you call us an evil and adulterous generation. Before this, you <span class="pg" data-page-id="418" id="418">[418]</span> called us a brood of vipers. We recognize that you are a good teacher. Teacher, show us a sign. Show us a miracle with some significance.” The Lord Jesus seemed to say, “Yes, you will see a sign.

The section of comfort is paradise, where the Lord went with the saved thief after they died (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62970" data-verses="Luke 23:43">Luke 23:43</span>). Hence, the heart of the earth, the lower parts of the earth, Hades, and paradise are synonymous terms, referring to the one place where the Lord stayed for three days and three nights after His death and before His resurrection.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxCiVmKcLa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62971" data-verses="Matthew 12:41">verse 41</span> the Lord continued, “Men, Ninevites, will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.” The Greek word rendered “greater” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62972" data-verses="Matthew 12:41-42">verses 41 and 42</span> is <em>pleion,</em> meaning more in quantity and quality; hence, greater. It differs from <em>meizon,</em> the word for greater in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62973" data-verses="Matthew 12:6">verse 6</span>, which means greater in external size or measure. Christ, as the Prophet sent by God to His people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62974" data-verses="Deuteronomy 18:15">Deut. 18:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62975" data-verses="Deuteronomy 18:18">18</span>), is greater than Jonah the prophet. Jonah was the prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles and was put into the belly of the great fish. After he had remained there for three days, he came out to become a sign to that generation for repentance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62976" data-verses="Jonah 1:2">Jonah 1:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62977" data-verses="Jonah 1:17">17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62978" data-verses="Jonah 3:2-10">3:2-10</span>). This was a type of Christ, who would turn from Israel to the Gentiles, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="419" id="419">[419]</span> who would be buried in the heart of the earth for three days and then be resurrected, becoming a sign to this generation for salvation.</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkX-TE-wmiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62979" data-verses="Matthew 12:41">verse 41</span> the Lord seemed to be saying, “The Ninevites repented because of the sign of Jonah. Yet you, an evil and adulterous generation, which will see such a sign as that of the Son of Man buried in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights, will not repent.” The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62980" data-verses="Matthew 12:40-41">verses 40 and 41</span> was not an ordinary word; it was a prediction. Before the Lord was buried in the heart of the earth, He prophesied in this way, telling the Pharisees that He would be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. I believe that the Lord Jesus told them this in His mercy. He seemed to say, “I give you a prediction of My death and burial. This shall be a sign to you, just as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites that caused them all to repent. I predict this now so that when you see it, you may repent.” However, they did not repent. By this we see how stubborn the Pharisees were.</p>

Solomon built the temple of God and spoke the word of wisdom, and to him the Gentile queen came (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62982" data-verses="1Kings 6:2">1 Kings 6:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62983" data-verses="1Kings 10:1-8">10:1-8</span>).

<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57ZjGE3auTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> Both of these types indicate that Christ, whether as the Prophet sent by God or the King anointed by God, would <span class="pg" data-page-id="420" id="420">[420]</span> turn from Israel to the Gentiles, as prophesied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62984" data-verses="Matthew 12:18">verses 18</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62985" data-verses="Matthew 12:21">21</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faCLSui5KZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> According to history, King Solomon preceded Jonah the prophet. But according to spiritual significance, Jonah came first, as recorded in Matthew. This also proves that Matthew’s record is not according to the sequence of history, but according to the sequence of doctrine. According to doctrine, Christ must first die and be resurrected; then He builds the church and speaks the word of wisdom. This is the real sign to this generation, both to the Jews and to the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62986" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:22">1 Cor. 1:22</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62987" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">24</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5lqna4-Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> By His word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62988" data-verses="Matthew 12:40-42">verses 40 through 42</span> the Lord prophesied fully concerning His death, burial, and resurrection. Jonah was a type of Christ in His death and burial, and Solomon was a type of Christ in His resurrection. If the Pharisees had not been stubborn, they would have realized that such words were not spoken lightly. Rather, the Lord’s word was very serious, significant, and meaningful. The Pharisees should not have considered them as unimportant. If we had been there and had heard these words, we certainly would have considered them serious, weighty, and filled with significance. If the Pharisees had taken in the Lord’s word, they would have repented and believed after the Lord was crucified, buried, and resurrected. In His answer to the Pharisees the Lord was merciful. Although it appears that He was rebuking them, He was more merciful than He was rebuking. He gave them the signs of Jonah and of Solomon, indicating that He was about to die, to be buried, and to be resurrected. His death and resurrection were to be the unique sign to this age and to that generation. This is also true today in the twentieth century. Christ’s death and resurrection are still the unique signs to this age. His death is truly meaningful, and His resurrection is full of significance. Nevertheless, the stubborn Pharisees, representing that evil and adulterous generation, did not care.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn8egbQzZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> The Lord’s word concerning Jonah and Solomon also indicated that from that time onward He would not do any <span class="pg" data-page-id="421" id="421">[421]</span> miracles for the Jewish people.

Since the demon cannot find rest in dry places, it returns into the man’s body it originally possessed and makes its home there (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62993" data-verses="Matthew 12:44-45">vv. 44-45</span>).</p>

Then it goes and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter in and make their home there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it also be to this evil generation.” Doctrinally, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62995" data-verses="Matthew 12:43">verse 43</span> continues <span class="verse" data-ref-id="62996" data-verses="Matthew 12:22">verse 22</span>. In between is a record of the Jews’ rejection of Christ and Christ’s forsaking of them. Here the Lord likened the evil generation of the rejecting Jews to the demon-possessed man. In the eyes of the Lord, the rejecting Jews were like demon-possessed people. The two signs of Jonah and Solomon indicated that the Gentiles would repent, but the case of the demon-possessed man indicated that the rejecting Jews would not repent. They will only sweep away the dirt and add good things to beautify themselves, but will not receive Christ to fill them. Rather, they will remain empty and unoccupied. This is the condition of today’s Jews. Near the end of this age, they will be seven times more possessed by demons, and their state will become worse than ever. <span class="pg" data-page-id="422" id="422">[422]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GtTVFf8AsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> The Lord Jesus likened that evil generation to a demon-possessed person out from whom a demon has gone. Because that person would not repent and accept Christ, he remained empty. Although the demon was cast out, Christ could not come in. Therefore that person was like a vacant house. The Lord Jesus said that this generation was like such a person. The Lord describes this house with three words: unoccupied, swept, and decorated. This word was also a prophecy, a prophecy that has been fulfilled and yet is still to be fulfilled. The Jews who have returned to form the nation of Israel are swept, decorated, and unoccupied. The entire nation of Israel today has been cleansed, and so many things have been cast out. Furthermore, they have been decorated with various good things; the Jewish people excel in science and other areas. However, the nation of Israel remains unoccupied. The Lord’s word in these verses is a prediction of the stubborn generation of Jews today.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrorKH_q55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> I love Israel, but I must speak according to God’s revelation. In a recent visit to Israel, we saw that the Jews are swept, cleansed, and decorated, but they are unoccupied. I agree with the Lord’s word. When the demon realized that the person was unoccupied, it took seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all came to occupy the vacancy. This indicates that year by year the nation of Israel will become more and more devilish. More and more demonic things will be found there. The Jews are like a clean house, but they will not accept Christ and receive Him into them. Rather, they remain unoccupied. Consider the nation of Israel today. What is the Jews’ goal? Many would say that they have no goal other than maintaining the existence of their nation. But that should not be their goal. Whether or not the nation of Israel exists does not depend upon the endeavor of the Jews; it depends upon God’s mercy. I am not concerned for the existence of the nation of Israel. God has restored it, and no one can abolish it. All that the Arabs are doing is in vain because the restoration of the nation of Israel is the work of God. Nevertheless, <span class="pg" data-page-id="423" id="423">[423]</span> the nation of Israel today has no goal; hence, it is unoccupied.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovnZTxzigRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> I became clear regarding this portion about Israel more than forty-five years ago. At that time, of course, I could not see the restoration of Israel or the return of Jerusalem. I will never forget the day in Shanghai when I read in the newspaper about the restoration of Israel; neither will I forget the day in 1967 when I heard that Jerusalem was returned to Israel. No doubt Israel will exist as a nation until the Lord comes back. My concern is that Israel remains empty. Why will the Jews not accept their Messiah? Why will they not allow Christ to occupy them? Today they remain unoccupied, and their situation will become worse and worse.</p>

This also was an environment giving the Lord the opportunity to reveal something. The Lord said, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers? And stretching out His hand over His disciples, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of My Father Who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62998" data-verses="Matthew 12:48-50">vv. 48-50</span>). This indicates that the heavenly King forsook His relationship with the Jews in the flesh. In this chapter, the Jews’ rejection of Christ, having reached its climax, resulted in Christ’s full forsaking of them. At this point, the break between them and Christ began, and they were severed from Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="62999" data-verses="Romans 11:17">Rom. 11:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63000" data-verses="Romans 11:19-20">19-20</span>). After the break with the Jews, Christ turned to the Gentiles. Then His relationship with His followers was no more in the flesh, but in the spirit. Whoever does the will of His Father is His brother for helping, His <span class="pg" data-page-id="424" id="424">[424]</span> sister for sympathizing, and His mother for tenderly loving.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-nUUzwzKgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63001" data-verses="Matthew 12:46-50">verses 46 through 50</span> we see a great turn, even a dispensational turn. From this point onward, Jesus’ relationship with people is not based upon the natural birth, but upon the spiritual birth. Whoever does the will of the Father who is in heaven is a relative of Jesus. In other words, at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63002" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, the Lord indicated strongly that He had given up the entire race of Israel. After that, His relationship with people was to be based upon something spiritual. All those who do the will of the Father are His relatives. Hallelujah, we are not only Christ’s relatives, but His members! We are His members not by our natural blood or natural birth, but by our spiritual birth in our spirit. He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63003" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). Now we are not only His brothers and sisters; we are one spirit with Him, one body in Him, and one new man in Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5DhwGpKoU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63004" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> the Lord Jesus made a clear declaration to the whole universe that He was through with Israel according to the natural blood. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63005" data-verses="Romans 11:1">Romans 11</span> says that Israel was cut off.

In order to understand this chapter, we must keep in mind that Matthew is concerned with the doctrine of the kingdom. Whatever is recorded in the Gospel of Matthew is according to the kingdom and according to the history of the kingdom. The sequence of doctrine in this book is according to the history of the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-nUEz0jqgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> We need to remember the main points covered in the first twelve chapters of Matthew. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63010" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Chapter one</span> covers Christ’s genealogy and birth, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63011" data-verses="Matthew 2:1">chapter two</span>, the Gentile wise men seeking Christ and worshipping Him, the flight of Christ to Egypt and His return to Israel to be raised in Nazareth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63012" data-verses="Matthew 3:1">chapter three</span> we see the recommendation and the anointing; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63013" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">chapter four</span>, the temptation and the beginning of the King’s ministry to gain the crowds; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63014" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63015" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63016" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span>, the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63017" data-verses="Matthew 8:1">Chapter eight</span> includes the continuation of the King’s ministry in healing the leper, the centurion’s servant boy, and Peter’s mother-in-law, and the Lord’s authority exercised over the wind, the sea, and the demons. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63018" data-verses="Matthew 9:1">Chapter nine</span> covers the King’s authority exercised in the forgiveness of sin; the calling of Matthew; the feast where the Lord is revealed as the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new wine, and the new wineskin; signs with dispensational significance; and the prayer to send reapers into the harvest. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63019" data-verses="Matthew 10:1">chapter ten</span> we have the appointment and sending out of the twelve <span class="pg" data-page-id="426" id="426">[426]</span> apostles, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63020" data-verses="Matthew 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, John’s attempt to stir up the King, the King’s answer and His appraisal of John, His rebuke of the stubborn generation, and the calling of people to come to His rest. Finally, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63021" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> covers the breaking of the Sabbath regulations to show that the Lord is the Head and that He cares for the members of His body, the battle for the kingdom, the climax of the King’s rejection, the prophecy of the generation becoming worse, and the forsaking of the Jewish generation and the turning to the believers.</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5DhgGsaYU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> As the Lord continued His ministry, the establishing of the kingdom was accomplished to a certain degree. However, because the Jewish generation utterly rejected the Lord, He was forced to turn from them to His believers. This was a serious move, the turn from Israel to the Gentiles, the turn from the relationship according to natural birth to the relationship in the Spirit. Therefore, the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63022" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> marks a division in the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85wwwR2Yuk42_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> As we have seen, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63023" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63024" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63025" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span> reveal the inward reality of the kingdom. We have pointed out that this constitution is divided into seven sections: the nature of the kingdom people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63026" data-verses="Matthew 5:1-12">5:1-12</span>); the influence of the kingdom people upon the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63027" data-verses="Matthew 5:13-16">5:13-16</span>); the law of the kingdom people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63028" data-verses="Matthew 5:17-48">5:17-48</span>); the righteous deeds of the kingdom people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63029" data-verses="Matthew 6:1-18">6:1-18</span>); the dealing of the kingdom people with riches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63030" data-verses="Matthew 6:19-34">6:19-34</span>); the principle of the kingdom people in dealing with others (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63031" data-verses="Matthew 7:1-12">7:1-12</span>); and the ground of the kingdom people’s living and work (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63032" data-verses="Matthew 7:13-29">7:13-29</span>). In these seven sections we see the heavenly and spiritual reality of the kingdom. This is not behavior or mere outward living; it is the kingdom of the heavens in reality. What is mainly revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63033" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> is the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The inward reality is one thing, and the outward appearance is another.</p>
<p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy7ouK9vXw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> Throughout history, only a handful of Christians has seen this matter of the difference between the inward reality and the outward appearance of the kingdom. It was seen by Robert Govett and his student, D. M. Panton. <span class="pg" data-page-id="427" id="427">[427]</span> G. H. Lang, a teacher among the Brethren, also saw this matter to some degree, but he did not see it as accurately and clearly as Govett and Panton. We have received considerable help from the writings of Govett and Panton. But we thank the Lord that He has led us on in this matter. We have seen the kingdom of the heavens in more detail and in greater depth. I can testify that especially during the past fifteen years this matter has become very clear to me. In 1936 I put out my first writing on this subject. During the more than forty years since the publication of that little book, I have become more and more clear regarding the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFf5ZKSHQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> The basic point concerning the kingdom is the need to differentiate between the inward reality of the kingdom and the outward appearance of the kingdom. If you do not differentiate between these two things, you will not be able to understand this book concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgjxsK_z3SNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> In addition to the section on the reality of the kingdom, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63034" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five through seven</span>, and the section on the outward appearance of the kingdom, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63035" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, there is a third section equally crucial in understanding the kingdom of the heavens: the Lord’s prophecy given on the Mount of Olives recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63036" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>. The reality of the kingdom was revealed on a mountain, the appearance of the kingdom was revealed by the seashore, and the manifestation of the kingdom was spoken of in prophecy also from a mountain. The mountain on which the reality of the kingdom was revealed was not in the region of the administrative center of the government, but in the region related to earning a living, because the reality is intimately related to our daily life. It is not a matter of administration or government.</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I5W46365x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> The geographic features of the land in Israel are significant. The governmental center is in the hill country in the middle of the holy land. At the top of the hill country and in its center is Jerusalem, the capital. In this region the king exercises his administration. To both the north <span class="pg" data-page-id="428" id="428">[428]</span> and the south are two regions for farming, for earning a living. The last time we went there I saw this matter clearly. Beersheba, which is in the south, is full of wheat and barley, indicating that is a rich land for farming. The land north of Jerusalem, rather close to Samaria, is a rich, green plain. This also is farming country where people may make a living. In the middle of these two regions is the governmental administration. We have pointed out that the reality of the kingdom was revealed not in the administrative region, but in the region of living. However, it was revealed on a mountain. The manifestation of the kingdom was prophesied on a mountain in the administrative region near the capital. This is meaningful, for the manifestation is related to administration, to government. Do not consider this matter as having no significance. The Lord Jesus deliberately went to these places to speak of the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation of the kingdom. If you are impressed with these three aspects of the kingdom, you will understand the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4KAayaAv8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> Thank the Lord that we have seen the reality of the kingdom. Now we must see the appearance of the kingdom. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63037" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63038" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63039" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span> there is no falsehood; everything is pure, genuine, heavenly, spiritual, and, to a certain extent, divine. In these chapters we see the nature of the kingdom people and the influence they exert upon the world. They are the salt of the earth and the light of the world. We also see the uplifted law of the kingdom people and the righteous deeds of the kingdom people. These deeds are pure, genuine, and real, performed in secret without any outward show. Furthermore, we see the attitude of the kingdom people toward material wealth and the fact that they have no anxiety regarding riches. Finally, we see the principle of the kingdom people in dealing with others and the ground of their living and work. In this section regarding the reality of the kingdom everything is real, pure, spiritual, and heavenly.</p>

In this chapter we have the tares (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63041" data-verses="Matthew 13:25-30">vv. 25-30</span>) and a great tree which is no longer according to its kind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63042" data-verses="Matthew 13:31-32">vv. 31-32</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63043" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> God created everything, especially the plants and vegetables, according to its nature. For example, a peach is according to the peach nature, and a banana is according to the banana nature. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63044" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> a mustard seed becomes a great tree. This indicates that it changes its nature, that it is no longer according to its nature. Therefore, in this chapter we see something of a façade, an appearance without reality. Along with the tares and the façade, there is also leaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63045" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">v. 33</span>). All these things, found in the appearance of the kingdom, cause the appearance of the kingdom to be a mixture.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS4268fV-asIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> It is easy to see this mixture in today’s Christendom. Today’s Christendom exactly matches the portrait in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63046" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. In Christendom there are millions of tares, a great façade, and corrupting leaven. However, none of these things is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63047" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63048" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63049" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span>, where everything is real, pure, spiritual, and heavenly. But what a mixture we see in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63050" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>!</p>
<p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2wZLrE9R0EzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63051" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> concerning the manifestation of the kingdom, we shall see that the manifestation is even more strict than the reality, just as the period of examination is a stricter time than that during the regular course of study. The students work diligently during the week in the reality of their schooling, but they may play, go dancing, or attend the movies during the weekend. That is like the appearance of the kingdom. The students should not be so happy and joyful, for they must consider the coming examinations. Furthermore, they must think of graduation, which will be the time of manifestation. By these three things—reality, appearance, and manifestation—we are able to understand the book of Matthew.</p>
<p data-content-id="KJEWVtLfOnw9Yxg9_3P5BKft_o_AanTep0fB8fNd2CrXG7zPGzDylZTVqAClKS52d"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63052" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> Israel was cut off and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="430" id="430">[430]</span> Gentiles were grafted in. At this point certain teachers, including Dr. Scofield, have made a great mistake. They say that after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63053" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, due to the unbelief of Israel, the kingdom had been suspended. They do not see that, instead of being suspended, the kingdom was given over to another people. The Lord did not say, “From now on, I have no brothers, sisters, or mother.” If He had said this, then the kingdom would have been suspended. What the Lord did was turn from one people to another. The Lord seemed to be saying, “The ones who do the will of My Father, who are born of My Father and live by His life, they are my brother, and sister, and mother.” Hence, the kingdom has not been suspended. Rather, it has been shifted from one people to another.</p>

<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCn5ituQw2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63054" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13:1</span> says, “On that day Jesus, going out of the house, sat beside the sea.” To most Christian teachers, this verse is insignificant. When I read this verse as a young man, it meant nothing to me. But now I realize that this verse is very meaningful. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63055" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, the heavenly King, having been fully rejected by the Jewish leaders, made a break with them. On that day He went out of the house to sit beside the sea. This is very significant. The house signifies the house of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63056" data-verses="Matthew 10:6">10:6</span>), and the sea signifies the Gentile world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63057" data-verses="Daniel 7:3">Dan. 7:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63058" data-verses="Daniel 7:17">17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63059" data-verses="Revelation 17:15">Rev. 17:15</span>). The King’s going out of the house to sit beside the sea signifies that after His break with the Jews, He forsook the house of Israel and turned to the Gentiles. It was after this that, on the seashore, He gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom. This signifies that the mysteries of the kingdom were revealed in the church. Hence, all the parables in this chapter were spoken to His disciples, not to the Jews. <span class="pg" data-page-id="431" id="431">[431]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk8CeZeKa1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> The first three words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63060" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, “On that day,” join this chapter to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63061" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, just as the words, “At that time,” connect <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63062" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63063" data-verses="Matthew 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. The words, “On that day,” refer to the day that the Lord declared that He had forsaken Israel, the day He cut off Israel and grafted in the Gentile believers. On that day He went out of the house, signifying the house of Israel, to the sea, signifying the Gentile world. This move from the house to the sea corresponded to His declaration. He had declared that He no longer had anything to do with His natural relatives but that He had turned to the believing Gentiles. Now He was walking according to His declaration. Therefore, we see that this verse is very meaningful.</p>

The sea is the Gentile world, and the boat is the church in the Gentile world. It was in the boat, in the church, that the King of the heavenly kingdom, after forsaking the Jews and turning to the Gentiles, revealed the mysteries of the kingdom in parables. Hallelujah, today we are neither the house nor the sea—we are the boat! We are the boat with the King. One day the King stepped into our boat. Now we have the King in our boat, the church. But the crowd stood on the shore. Are you standing on the shore, or are you in the boat with the King?

This is the only place where we can understand the mysteries of the kingdom. Oh, we are in the church, in the boat! The church is neither the house of Israel nor the sea of the Gentiles; rather, it is the boat of the believers. In the church all the mysteries of the kingdom are revealed to us.</p>

If you do not know how to allegorize the Bible, you will not be able to interpret the parables. For example, the boat is a parable. How can you interpret the boat if you do not know how to allegorize it? All the opposers need to follow this way. Then they will know the Bible. However, because they do not have the way to allegorize the Bible, they do not know it. Because we have the way to allegorize the Scriptures, we know the significance of the house, the sea, and the boat. Furthermore, we know all the parables. How happy I am to know the parables!</p>

I had many unanswered questions about what is found in this chapter. I bought some books on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63068" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>, but they were all worthless. These books even said that leaven refers to the power of today’s Christianity and that the tree is the wonderful and magnificent organization of Christianity. But as I read those books, I did not have a good feeling within me; I did not believe what they said. However, I did not have a way to understand this chapter. Therefore I wrote to Brother Nee, telling him of my desire to know the Bible word by word and asking him to recommend the best book to help me in this matter. In his reply he told me that the best set of books was the <em>Synopsis of the Bible</em> by John Nelson <span class="pg" data-page-id="433" id="433">[433]</span> Darby. However, he pointed out that Darby’s Synopsis was extremely difficult to understand. When I read Darby’s <em>Synopsis</em> several years later, I discovered Brother Nee was right. I simply could not understand Darby’s writing. To speak the truth, I did not receive any help from Darby’s <em>Synopsis</em> as far as understanding Matthew was concerned. But through Brother Nee himself I received great help in knowing the parables. Now I can say with full assurance that we know the parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63069" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>. Nothing is hidden from us. To us, the mysteries of the kingdom are no longer mysteries, for these mysteries have all been opened to us.</p>

And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.” The King of the heavenly kingdom revealed the things of the kingdom in parables (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63072" data-verses="Matthew 13:34">v. 34</span>) in order to make them mysteries to the opposing and rejecting Jews, that they might not understand them. From the time the King came to sow the seed until He comes back to reap the harvest, everything concerning the kingdom is a mystery to the natural mind. Only the enlightened mind of a submissive heart can understand these mysteries.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYHu-p2S2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> When the disciples asked the Lord why He spoke of the kingdom in parables, the Lord seemed to say, “In order to keep it from them and to let you know. Everything depends on you and on them, not on Me. Whether or not you can understand what I speak in parables depends on you.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63073" data-verses="Matthew 13:12">verse 12</span> the Lord continued, “For whoever has, it shall be given to him, and he shall be in abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from <span class="pg" data-page-id="434" id="434">[434]</span> him.” The words “whoever has” refer to the receiver and follower of the heavenly King, to whom the revelation concerning the kingdom will be given in abundance. But the one who does not have is the opposing and rejecting Jew, from whom what the heavenly King has spoken and done will be taken away. This is the real condition of the Jews today. They have no knowledge whatever concerning the kingdom of the heavens. It is altogether a mystery unknown to them.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUuUmDSq80trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63074" data-verses="Matthew 13:13-14">Verses 13 and 14</span> say, “Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, neither do they understand. And in them is being fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, Hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive.”</p>
<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbYztKEYYwZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63075" data-verses="Matthew 13:15">Verse 15</span> says, “For the heart of this people has grown fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with the heart and turn around, and I will heal them.” The reason those in that stubborn generation could not understand lay in their heart, which had grown fat. Fat signifies the pride of having something. The heart of those in that stubborn generation was proud. That was the actual situation of the Pharisees. Because their heart had grown fat, their eyes and ears were affected. They could see, but not perceive; they could hear, but not understand. As a result, the mysteries of the kingdom meant nothing to them. All the parables were mysteries simply because of their pride.</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiFLBK3TZM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> This is exactly the situation today. If certain Christian teachers and leaders were to hear a message like this, they would condemn it, criticize it, and reject it. They would listen, but they would not understand. They would see, but they would not perceive. The reason they could not understand or perceive is the pride in their heart of having something. If the Brethren teachers heard this message, they would say, “No, the kingdom has been suspended. This is <span class="pg" data-page-id="435" id="435">[435]</span> not the dispensation of the kingdom; it is the dispensation of the church. The dispensation of the kingdom will be in the millennium, in the coming age of a thousand years.” This indicates the fatness of their heart, their pride in having something. This pride keeps people from understanding and perceiving. We must learn the first lesson given in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens: “Blessed are the poor in spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63076" data-verses="Matthew 5:3">5:3</span>). When we are poor in spirit, we have no pride in our heart. We are not proud of anything. Rather, we are unloaded, empty, and ready to receive something new from the Lord. We all need to prepare ourselves for what is revealed in this chapter.</p>

Throughout these many years, I have not doubted anything regarding our understanding of them. In fact, in these days of working on the Gospel of Matthew I have been all the more confirmed that we have the correct interpretation, for our interpretation matches the history of the church and our experience. Because of the situation of today’s Christianity, we all need to know this crucial chapter, a chapter that is even more crucial than <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63077" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">chapters five</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63078" data-verses="Matthew 6:1">six</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63079" data-verses="Matthew 7:1">seven</span>.

<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVAXW7hutTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> At the beginning of the first of the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord did not say, “The kingdom of the heavens was likened unto,” as He did in the other six parables (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63084" data-verses="Matthew 13:24">vv. 24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63085" data-verses="Matthew 13:31">31</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63086" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63087" data-verses="Matthew 13:44">44</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63088" data-verses="Matthew 13:45">45</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63089" data-verses="Matthew 13:47">47</span>), because the kingdom of the heavens began with the second parable. In the first parable, the Lord was going out only to sow the seed for the kingdom. The seed had not yet grown to be the crop for the formation of the kingdom. Hence, the kingdom had not yet come, but had only drawn near in the Lord’s preaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63090" data-verses="Matthew 4:17">4:17</span>).</p>

The Parable of the Sower—<br/>the Preliminary Work of the King<br/>for the Kingdom</h2><p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKgwdwhD5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> When the Lord Jesus came, He came to do the preliminary work for the establishment of the kingdom. Throughout His human life, from His birth to His resurrection, the kingdom of the heavens still had not come. What He did in His life was a preparation for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UASjEcel8zKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ">1. The Sower Having Sown the Seeds</h2><p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5lqHa48Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63091" data-verses="Matthew 13:3-4">Verses 3 and 4</span> say that a sower went out to sow some seeds. In His preliminary work for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord Jesus came as a sower. <span class="pg" data-page-id="438" id="438">[438]</span> Several times the Lord was called a teacher. But here He likens himself not to a teacher, but to a sower. The sower in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63092" data-verses="Matthew 13:3">verse 3</span> is the Lord Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63093" data-verses="Matthew 13:37">v. 37</span>). Actually, the Lord did not come to teach, but to sow the seed. What is this seed? It is the word of the kingdom with the King in it as life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63094" data-verses="Matthew 13:19">v. 19</span>). The seed is also the sons, the people, of the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63095" data-verses="Matthew 13:38">v. 38</span>). If we check with our experience, we shall realize that the seed sown by the Lord Jesus into our humanity is just Himself as life to make us the seed of the kingdom. Here three things are interrelated: the word of the kingdom, the sons of the kingdom, and Christ Himself as the life within the seed. These three cannot be separated. The word of the kingdom actually is Christ Himself as the word of life. This seed eventually produces the sons of the kingdom, who are the believers. Therefore, the seed refers to the word of the kingdom, to Christ Himself as life, and to us, the sons of the kingdom. By Christ’s being the living word of life sown into our being, we are made the sons of the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn8eAbQxZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> In this parable we see that Christ establishes the kingdom of the heavens not by fighting or teaching, but by sowing Himself as the seed of life into believing people so that the kingdom of the heavens may grow up. The establishment of the kingdom of the heavens is absolutely a matter of growth in life. To establish the kingdom is to grow the kingdom. The kingdom is not established by outward working, but by inward growing. We need to emphasize this matter again and again. Because many Christian workers have not seen this, they still think that the church is built up by work and labor. But the church can be produced only by sowing Christ as the seed into humanity. This seed will grow within people and produce the church. The seed of life, Christ Himself in the word, sown into humanity will grow the church. The church is not produced by work; it is altogether produced by the growth in life. Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is brought into being not by teaching or by working, but by sowing Christ as the living word of life into humanity. This seed will <span class="pg" data-page-id="439" id="439">[439]</span> grow, and the life in it will produce the kingdom. The kingdom is absolutely a matter of life which has grown. The source of the kingdom is Christ as the seed of life. May we all be deeply impressed with the fact that the kingdom is a matter of life.</p>
<p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wL5Mes_PlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> In this parable, which gives us a clear picture of the preliminary work of the kingdom, Christ came as a sower, Everyone who has sown seed knows that if there is no life in the seed, nothing will happen. Without life, it is impossible to have growth. In this parable Christ came neither as a great prophet to prophesy nor as a mighty king to rule. Yes, He was a prophet and a king, but in this parable He appears as a sower, not as a prophet or a king. In His hand there is not a scepter for ruling or for exercising authority, but seed for producing life. He came as a sower to sow Himself as the seed. Oh, may we all see this! This vision will revolutionize our concept and our Christian work. If we see this vision, we would no longer trust in what we do because we would know that the kingdom is a matter of life, that the church is a matter of growth in the life seed sown into our humanity. Therefore, we would trust completely in the growth of life. Those who have been with us for a number of years can testify that I do not teach others what they should do. I do not give them instructions regarding their behavior. But in meeting after meeting, conference after conference, and training after training, I have ministered Christ as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. It has always been a matter of Christ, life, the Spirit, and the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLfiReWCjfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> We all need to see this basic vision that the kingdom is a matter of life growing in us. The young people who are burdened for the campuses must see this vision. Young people, if you go to the campuses to do a work, that will mean nothing. You should not go there to work, but to sow the seed, to be a sower. During the years I was with Brother Nee in China, I saw that he was not working; he was sowing Christ as a seed. He told me that Miss M. E. Barber did not come to China to work. She was in China sowing Christ, even sowing herself in Christ. She was a seed sown <span class="pg" data-page-id="440" id="440">[440]</span> into that district in China. Eventually, something grew out of that seed. The Lord’s recovery today is the produce of the seed sown by Sister Barber and Brother Nee. Do not think that our working means very much. No, our working does not mean anything. If you study the Gospels again, you will see that the first Christian worker was Christ Himself. However, He did not work very much. Instead, He was sowing.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0i358kgGs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> In the parable of the sower the Lord gives us a picture of what He came to do. He came as a sower to sow the seed. To those who are proud this parable is a mystery. The Pharisees would probably say, “We know all about this and don’t want to hear of it. We know what a sower is. We know that a sower simply sows seed and that this seed falls on various types of soil. This is elementary. We want to hear something deep, something philosophical. Speak to us about the laws of Moses. Jesus, have you never read Moses and the Psalms? We would like to hear about this, not about some seed falling on the wayside, rocky places, thorns, and good soil. You are just a kindergarten teacher.” But to those who are poor in spirit and pure in heart this parable is much more profound than the teaching of Moses and all the Psalms. Hallelujah for the sower, the seed, and the good earth! This is altogether a matter of life. We need more hymns on the sower, the sowing, the seed, and the growth. Again I say, the kingdom grows; it is not built by our labor. Do not try to build the church, for what the church needs is growth. Day after day we need to sow Christ.</p>

<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GtT1Fc9gsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> Recently an opposer told a brother, “We are going to stop you.” He said that they were planning to stop the Lord’s recovery. If the opposers try to do this, they will find themselves in trouble. Do not touch anything of life, for the more you touch it, the more it multiplies. If you leave it alone, it may remain dormant. But if you touch it, it will grow. Suppose you say to some seed, “Seed, I shall stop you. I shall bury you in the earth.” How good that would be for the seed! But if you leave the seeds on a pedestal, <span class="pg" data-page-id="441" id="441">[441]</span> appreciating them, looking at them, and treasuring them, that will be the most effective way to stop them. But if you try to terminate the seed by burying it in the earth, the seed will grow. The opposers simply do not know what the Lord’s recovery is. The Lord’s recovery is not work, teaching, or theology. It is a seed; it is the living Christ as a seed. I have the assurance to declare to the whole universe that the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit has been sown into thousands of Americans. Do not touch them. If you try to persecute them or bury them, the one grain will be multiplied into many more grains. Who can stop the Lord’s recovery? The seed has already been sown. The Lord came to the earth as a sower to sow Himself. Hallelujah, Jesus has been sown into humanity! The principle is the same in the Lord’s recovery today. The recovery as the seed of life has been sown in America, Europe, Brazil, and many other places. No one and nothing can stop it. The Lord’s recovery is not a movement. It is Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into our being. The sower is Christ, and the seed is also Christ, Christ in the word sown into us to make us the sons of the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrorqH8qZ5GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> According to this parable and the Lord’s own interpretation of it, this seed is sown into our heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63096" data-verses="Matthew 13:19">v. 19</span>). In the past we have pointed out that our heart is not the receiving organ, but the loving organ, and that our receiving organ is our spirit. We say this based upon <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63097" data-verses="Ezekiel 36:1">Ezekiel 36</span>, where God promises to give us a new spirit and a new heart, a new spirit to receive God and a new heart to love Him. Here the Lord Jesus does not mention anything about the spirit; but He does say that the heart is the place where the seed is sown. Nothing can enter our spirit without first passing through our heart. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63098" data-verses="1Peter 3:4">1 Peter 3:4</span> our spirit is called the inner man of our heart. This indicates that our spirit is surrounded by our heart. The three main sections of the heart are the mind, the emotion, and the will. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we had no awareness that we were exercising our spirit. But we did realize that we believed in Him with our heart. In other words, when we <span class="pg" data-page-id="442" id="442">[442]</span> believed in Him, we opened our heart. The result, however, was that He came into our spirit. When we opened our heart to believe in Him, He came into our spirit. But our spirit is not the soil for growing Christ. The soil is our heart. This parable makes it perfectly clear that our heart is the soil, the earth, the very place where the seed is sown and where it grows. Therefore, in this parable the Lord does not deal with our spirit; He mainly touches our heart.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovnZzxwiARSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP">2. Some Seeds Falling beside the Way</h2><p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMjv-JHgzAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63099" data-verses="Matthew 13:4">Verse 4</span> says, “And as He sowed, some seeds indeed fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured them.” Beside the way is the place close to the way. Because it is hardened by the traffic of the way, it is difficult for the seeds to penetrate it. This kind of wayside signifies the heart that is hardened by the worldly traffic and does not open to understand, to comprehend, the word of the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63100" data-verses="Matthew 13:19">v. 19</span>). The birds signify the evil one, Satan, who came and snatched away the word of the kingdom sown in the hardened heart.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqEjRFL7_5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> If you compare the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens with the parable of the sower, you will see that this parable is based upon the concept of the constitution. The constitution covers the matters of being poor in our spirit and pure in our heart. Those who are the wayside cannot receive the seed because they are neither poor in spirit nor pure in heart. Because the wayside, part of the soil for farming, was so close to the traffic, it became hardened by the traffic. This made it impossible for the seed to penetrate it. Thus, the seed remained on the surface of the wayside. This signifies those who are not poor in spirit or pure in heart because they have so much worldly traffic. Education, commerce, politics, science, business, and other kinds of worldly traffic go back and forth within their mind, emotion, and will. They are occupied with promotion, position, and ambition. For this reason, it is very difficult to preach the gospel to those in politics. The politicians have too much worldly traffic in their being. Those <span class="pg" data-page-id="443" id="443">[443]</span> seeking advancement in politics are ambitious to gain a position or to surpass others. Likewise, it is difficult to preach the gospel to those on Wall Street. Unless the Lord knocks them down, they are too hard to receive the word into them. Day and night they are preoccupied with figures, money, and business. They cannot be poor in spirit or pure in heart. The Wall Street traffic makes them hard in their heart. When you attempt to sow the seed into them, the seed cannot penetrate them. There is no room in them for the seed. This is also true among so many in education, especially those pursuing a doctoral degree. There has been so much traffic in their heart that their heart has been hardened, just like the wayside in the Lord’s parable. Although they may hear the gospel of Christ, not a word can penetrate their heart.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-nU0zwxKgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> We thank the Lord that, in His mercy, when the gospel was preached to us, we were poor in spirit and pure in heart. On the day I was saved by the Lord, I said to Him, “If the whole world could be mine, I would not take it. I don’t want it and I don’t like it. Lord, I want to keep my heart for You. I don’t like to have any worldly traffic in my heart.” It is never good to have traffic through farmland. No farmer would allow this. Are you part of the wayside? Do not stay close to the way. Stay in the center of the farm. Then the worldly traffic will not touch you.</p>

The sun with its scorching heat signifies affliction or persecution (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63102" data-verses="Matthew 13:21">v. 21</span>), <span class="pg" data-page-id="444" id="444">[444]</span> which dries up the seed that is not rooted. The heat of the sun is for the growth and ripening of the crop once the seed is deeply rooted. But due to the seed’s lack of root, the sun’s growing and ripening heat becomes a death blow to the seed.</p>
<div id="displayv"> </div> </div><div class="section" data-section="3">
<p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy7oeK29Hw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> The things signified by the rocks correspond to what is covered by the complemented laws in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63103" data-verses="Matthew 5:17-48">5:17-48</span>). The second type of earth corresponds to the temper, lust, self, and flesh—the things hidden in our heart. Perhaps not many among us are part of the wayside, but I am very concerned that a good number may be rocky places. In appearance they are the same as others, for the soil is on the surface. But they have no depth. Rather, they have lust, temper, self, and flesh. All these are rocks hidden beneath the soil. Therefore, the first type of soil corresponds to those who are not poor in spirit and pure in heart, and the second corresponds to those who still have their temper, lust, sin, self, and flesh beneath the surface. Some of you may still be hiding your lust, your selfishness, and your flesh. You may shout hallelujahs in the meetings, but you do not have much depth. Instead of depth, there are rocks. Sooner or later, all these rocks will be exposed because the word that has been sown into you will not be able to be rooted in you. You may be happy and joyful, shouting praises to the Lord, but there is no root in you. Hence, when the affliction and persecutions come, you will be dried up like a plant without root that withers under the scorching heat of the sun. May the Lord have mercy upon us and dig out all the hidden rocks. May He dig out our temper, lust, self, flesh, and any other negative thing so that there may be room in our heart for the seed to be rooted deeply within us.</p>

Some Falling on the Thorns</h2><p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfOz24Tqabftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63104" data-verses="Matthew 13:7">Verse 7</span> says, “And others fell on the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.” The thorns here signify the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches, which choke the word from growing in the heart and cause <span class="pg" data-page-id="445" id="445">[445]</span> it to become unfruitful. The thorns, the anxiety of this age and the deceitfulness of riches, match the section in the constitution covering the attitude of the kingdom people toward riches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63105" data-verses="Matthew 6:19-34">6:19-34</span>). Several times in that section of the constitution the words “anxious” or “anxiety” are used. The Lord tells us not to be anxious about our living, about what we shall eat, drink, or wear. The third type of soil is not as bad as the second, but it is still difficult for the seed to grow in it because of anxiety and the deceitfulness of riches. All these thorns must be uprooted. If the anxiety of this age and the deceitfulness of riches are rooted out of our heart, the seed will grow.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EGXH9VmECzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> The parable of the sower seems very simple, but it is actually deep and profound. It exposes the real condition of our heart in the presence of the heavenly King. Whatever is in us is exposed. This parable covers the hardness by the worldly traffic; the hidden lust, self, and flesh; and the anxiety of the age and deceitfulness of money. These are the wayside, the rocks, and the thorns. As long as you are either the wayside, the soil with hidden rocks, or the soil with thorns, the kingdom cannot grow in you. In other words, the church cannot grow in those types of soil. In order for the church to grow, the seed must fall on good earth.</p>

Such a heart gives every inch of its ground to receive the word that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63107" data-verses="Matthew 13:23">v. 23</span>). The good heart is a heart which has no worldly traffic, no rocks, and no thorns. It has no hidden sins, selfishness, lust, or flesh and no anxiety of the age or deceitfulness of money. This kind of heart is truly pure to match the spirit. Such a heart <span class="pg" data-page-id="446" id="446">[446]</span> is the good soil that grows Christ. Christ as the seed of life can grow only in this kind of heart, this kind of soil. This is the soil that can grow the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuarLNTqnji_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> In the United States of America there are millions of Christians. Recently a magazine said that there are fifty million regenerated Christians in this country. Only the Lord knows how many among this number are genuine Christians. Although there are so many Christians, I wonder how many are the good earth. How many have no worldly traffic, no hidden sins, flesh, lusts, or self, and no anxiety or deceitfulness of money? How many are poor in spirit and pure in heart? It is very difficult to find such Christians. Although we may be surrounded with Christians, we rarely find one who is truly poor in spirit and pure in heart. How about you? Do you still have worldly traffic in your heart? Are you truly poor in spirit and pure in heart? Are there any hidden rocks deep within? What about the anxiety of this age and the deceitfulness of money? Although we must consider these questions, we should not be discouraged. Rather, we should be encouraged. Nothing can stop God’s economy. There will be at least some who are the good earth. According to the percentage indicated by the Lord’s parable, this is twenty-five percent of the believers. I would be happy with even five percent. How good it would be if among all the real Christians five percent were poor in spirit and pure in heart, had no hidden self, flesh, or sin, and had no anxiety or deceitfulness of money! How wonderful it would be if five percent were pure for Christ to grow in them! Here and there, in so many major cities, the Lord will find the good earth. The Lord is merciful. We might have had too much traffic, but the Lord saved us from the wayside and placed us in the center of the farmland. I know of many brothers and sisters in whom the Lord has dug out all the hidden things and uprooted all the thorns to make their heart the good earth. Praise the Lord for this! There is no doubt that among us a good many are the good earth, the good soil. The kingdom and the church are growing here. Here in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="447" id="447">[447]</span> church life we are growing Christ, and we are growing the kingdom. The kingdom does not come by our working. It comes only by the growth of Christ within us. May we all be impressed that today in the Lord’s recovery the Lord is doing the work of sowing Himself into people so that He may have the good earth to grow Himself into the kingdom. This is the first parable, and this is the preliminary work for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgjxsq_3liNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> In the last message we saw that the good earth is the people according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. The constitution is a complete description of the good earth, of one who is poor in spirit and pure in heart, who has no worldly traffic within him, whose being is not hardened, who has no hidden rocks of temper, lust, self, and flesh concealed within him. All this corresponds to the requirements given in the constitution. Those who are the good earth have no thorns, no anxiety of life, and no deceitfulness of riches. Therefore, they become the good earth in which the seed can grow. This good earth is the people who live according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. In other words, their living exactly matches the constitution.</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I5WY6wo5x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> The kingdom of the heavens is built by the multiplication of the seed. The sower sows the seed, the seed grows and multiplies, and eventually the multiplication of the seed becomes the constituent of the kingdom. This reveals that the kingdom is not built by any kind of work, but that it is built by the multiplication of the seed sown by the sower. Christ came as the sower sowing Himself as the seed of life. This seed of life enters humanity to bring forth fruit, the sons of the kingdom. This is the multiplication of the seed. The kingdom is built by this multiplication. Therefore, the kingdom is the multiplication of the seed sown by the sower. The sower Himself is the seed, and the multiplication of the seed is the multiplication of the sower. Hence, the kingdom is built with the multiplication of <span class="pg" data-page-id="450" id="450">[450]</span> Christ. The kingdom is the enlargement of Christ, the multiplication of Christ as the seed sown into us. If we see this, we shall know what kind of living we should have and in what kind of situation we should be so that we may participate in the kingdom. Having seen this matter, let us now proceed to consider the second parable (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63108" data-verses="Matthew 13:24-30">13:24-30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63109" data-verses="Matthew 13:36-43">36-43</span>).</p>

<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS42a8XGOasIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63110" data-verses="Matthew 13:24">Verse 24</span> says, “The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field.” With the second parable the Lord began to say, “The kingdom of the heavens was likened to,” because the kingdom of the heavens began to be established when the church was built (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63111" data-verses="Matthew 16:18-19">16:18-19</span>) on the day of Pentecost, the time when the second parable began to be fulfilled. It was from that time, after the church was founded, that the tares, the false believers, were sown amidst the true believers, the wheat.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19K-I3BHAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> The kingdom of the heavens began with the second parable. This is the reason the Lord used the words “The kingdom of the heavens was likened to.” These words were not spoken by the Lord in the first parable because at that time the kingdom of the heavens had not yet come. Rather, that parable was concerned with the preliminary work for the kingdom of the heavens. But at the time of the second parable, the kingdom of the heavens had come; thus, the Lord said that the kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field.</p>

In the first parable the seed sown by the sower was the word of the kingdom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63112" data-verses="Matthew 13:19">Verse 19</span> says this clearly. But in the second parable we see that the seed has developed into the sons of the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63113" data-verses="Matthew 13:38">v. 38</span>). Firstly, this means that the seed was <span class="pg" data-page-id="451" id="451">[451]</span> the word sown into humanity and, secondly, that it has grown into the sons of the kingdom. In the foregoing message I pointed out that the seed is the word with Christ in it as life. According to the second parable, this seed grows into us, the kingdom people, the sons of the kingdom. Therefore, the wheat is the sons of the kingdom, the real believers, those regenerated with the divine life.</p>

It was when the Lord’s slaves were sleeping, not watching, that the Lord’s enemy, the Devil, came and sowed false believers amidst the true ones.</p>
<p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCKu9pkEb4qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63116" data-verses="Matthew 13:25">Verse 25</span> says that the enemy sowed tares amidst the wheat. A tare is a kind of darnel, a weed resembling wheat. Its seeds are poisonous, producing sleepiness, nausea, convulsions, and even death. The sprout and leaves of the tares look the same as those of the wheat. It is impossible to discern one from the other until the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow, but that of the tares is black.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rXHlsThQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> In the Old Testament, the children of Israel in the kingdom of God were likened to grapes growing in the vineyard (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63117" data-verses="Matthew 21:33-34">21:33-34</span>), whereas in the New Testament, the kingdom people in the kingdom of the heavens are likened to wheat growing in the field. The vineyard was fenced, limited only to the Jews; whereas the field is worldwide, unlimited, open to all peoples.</p>
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePH29gWTwGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> This parable discloses that not long after the establishment of the kingdom by the building of the church, the situation of the kingdom of the heavens changed. It was established with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat. But the sons of the evil one, the tares, grew up to alter the situation. Hence, a difference has arisen between the kingdom of the heavens and its outward appearance. Whereas the sons of the kingdom, the wheat, constitute the <span class="pg" data-page-id="452" id="452">[452]</span> kingdom, the sons of the evil one, the tares, have formed the outward appearance of the kingdom, which today is called Christendom.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvR2tgp6vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> The wheat is the sons of the kingdom, the real believers regenerated with the divine life. The tares are the sons of the evil one, the Devil. In the early stages of their growth, the tares appear exactly the same as wheat in color and in shape. Even experts cannot discern the difference until the fruit appears. There is a great difference in the fruit of the tares and the fruit of the wheat, for the fruit of the tares is black and the fruit of the wheat is greenish yellow. The sons of the kingdom are the sons of God who have the divine life within them. The sons of the evil one are the false believers, believers only in name, who do not have the divine life in them.</p>

The King’s Slaves<br/>Wanting to Gather Up the Tares,<br/>but the King Allowing the Tares<br/>to Grow with the Wheat until the Harvest</h2><p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY4iPC9YclV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> When the King’s slaves wanted to gather up the tares (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63118" data-verses="Matthew 13:28">v. 28</span>), He said, “No, lest while gathering the tares you may root up the wheat at the same time with them.” Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field, and the field is the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63119" data-verses="Matthew 13:38">v. 38</span>). The false believers and the true ones live in the world. To gather up the tares from the field means to take away the false believers from the world. The Lord did not want His slaves to do this, lest while taking away the false believers from the world, the true ones may be taken away from the world. The Catholic Church did much of this and by so doing killed many true believers.</p>
<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIr7tE4J85SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> Many Christian teachers have wrongly interpreted the field, saying that it is the church. According to this interpretation, in the church there are both false ones and real ones. But the Lord says clearly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63120" data-verses="Matthew 13:38">verse 38</span> that the field is the world. The wheat and the tares are allowed to grow together in the world, not in the church. According to the Epistles, not even sinful ones are allowed to remain in the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63121" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:1">1 Corinthians chapter five</span> the Apostle Paul <span class="pg" data-page-id="453" id="453">[453]</span> charged the church at Corinth to excommunicate the sinful one. If even the real but sinful ones must be cast out, then how much more the false ones? The church is not to tolerate the false believers, but both the false and the true are allowed to grow together in the world. Please be clear that the field refers to the world. In the world there are both true and false believers, but this must not be so in the church.</p>

<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzkkdtId8sSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> The Lord told His slaves not to separate the wheat from the tares, but to allow them both to grow together until the harvest. Otherwise, the wheat may be rooted up with the tares. This means that the false believers must be allowed to exist in the world with the true believers. In the past centuries the Catholic Church has made the serious mistake of trying to uproot those who were considered tares. But most of those taken away by the Catholic Church were the real ones, even the best ones. This is the reason the Lord Jesus did not allow His slaves to do such a thing.</p>

At the consummation of this age, the Lord will send the angels firstly to gather all the tares, all stumbling blocks, and those who do lawlessness, bind them into bundles, and burn them with the fire of the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63124" data-verses="Matthew 13:30">vv. 30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63125" data-verses="Matthew 13:40-42">40-42</span>).

<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiFLhK2T5M5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> In this parable the Lord points out the serious matter of the judgment upon the tares. This will be a special judgment, for the tares will be bound into bundles and cast into the furnace of fire, which is the lake of fire. The first two to be cast into the lake of fire will be Antichrist and the false prophet. Following them, the tares will be cast into the lake of fire at the time of the Lord’s coming back. The judgment upon the tares will be so serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God’s economy. In the eyes of God, the tares are exceedingly evil.</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0aFjRsUs_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> The modernists of today are evil. They blaspheme the Lord by saying that He was an illegitimate child. They also say that the Lord Jesus was not the Redeemer, that His death was that of a martyr, and that His death was not for redemption. They also deny that Christ was resurrected. Furthermore, some modernists are very vague about God. It is difficult to determine what they believe concerning God. If you ask them about God, Christ, or the Spirit, they will respond that it is all a matter of definition. This answer is subtle and more than evil. Therefore, at the consummation of this age, the angels will bind the tares into bundles and cast them into the lake of fire. There will be no need for them to pass through the judgment at the white throne. By this judgment we can see how evil the tares are in the eyes of the Lord.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrECt3pt4CrHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> Although the tares have caused confusion, frustration, and damage, some so-called Christian groups actually boast of having tares among them, and they condemn us for not having any tares.</p>
<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMhtoruoqCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> When the Lord Jesus came, He did not sow tares; He sowed only wheat. In His preliminary work for the establishment of the kingdom, He sowed only Himself, and He was very careful in so doing, sowing only one kind of seed. While the Lord’s slaves were sleeping, the enemy, the evil one, Satan, came in to sow another seed, the seed of the tares. This took place not too long after the church was established on the day of Pentecost. The book of Acts indicates that certain false ones who had not received Christ into them as their life came in apparently as real ones. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="457" id="457">[457]</span> they were tares, not wheat. In the early part of the fourth century Constantine the Great made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. At that time tens of thousands of false believers came into Christianity. In order to Christianize the people, Constantine encouraged them to be baptized. Many who were baptized into Christianity were given a material reward of silver or clothing. This was the greatest opportunity for the evil one to sow his tares. At that time there were perhaps ten tares for every stalk of wheat. This has continued until the present. In Christendom there are millions of so-called Christians, but so many of them are not real believers.</p>
<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz9E4cKLxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> Let me illustrate this from my own experience. I was born of a Southern Baptist mother. She taught us the stories of the Bible; however, at that time, although she was for Christianity, she herself definitely had not been saved. There were so many tares there it was difficult to find the wheat. The professor of world history in the American Presbyterian college where I studied came from a Jewish background. He was a false believer, believing neither in the Bible nor in the resurrection of Christ. Nevertheless, the Presbyterian mission sent him as a mission teacher to be a professor in their college. Some of the missionaries in China were modernists. Among both the Methodists and the Presbyterians, modernistic missionaries taught the people that the Bible was a book of fairy tales. They said that the Red Sea was not actually opened by God, but that the Israelites passed through a portion of the sea made shallow by the blowing of the wind. By now modernism might have penetrated the seminaries of even the Southern Baptists. Union Theological Seminary in New York treated John Sung like a mental case. After John Sung was saved, he was beside himself in the Lord, but those in that seminary, considering him a mental case, sent him to a mental hospital. Later John Sung returned to China, preached the gospel, and became probably the greatest evangelist in China. In today’s Christendom there are thousands and thousands of tares.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxCiVWKeLa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63130" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> we see a picture of the outward <span class="pg" data-page-id="458" id="458">[458]</span> appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. (Please refer to the chart on pages 454 and 455.) The kingdom of God covers everything from eternity past to eternity future. Between the two eternities there is time divided into various ages or dispensations. The first is the dispensation before law. After Adam was created, he was placed in the garden where there was no sin or darkness. From him, is the period of the Patriarchs, the fathers, extending to Moses. This period of the Patriarchs is known as the dispensation before law. Then comes the dispensation of law. Following this are two crucial dispensations, the first of which is the dispensation of grace, the church age, and the other, the dispensation of the kingdom, the millennium. As we have pointed out already, the kingdom of the heavens covers only these two dispensations. In the dispensation of grace there are a number of complications, for the kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: the aspect of reality, the aspect of appearance, and the aspect of manifestation. As long as the church is normal, it is the reality of the kingdom. In a normal situation the church equals the reality of the kingdom. The third aspect of the kingdom, the manifestation, is in the heavenly part, the upper part, of the millennium. The lower part, the earthly part, is the Messianic kingdom, the kingdom of the Messiah, but the heavenly part is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. This heavenly part in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63131" data-verses="Matthew 13:43">13:43</span> is also called the kingdom of the Father, whereas the earthly part is called in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63132" data-verses="Matthew 13:41">Matthew 13:41</span> the kingdom of the Son of Man. Therefore, the kingdom of the Son is the kingdom of the Messiah, and the kingdom of the Father is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkX-jE8wmiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> In this message we are concerned with the appearance of the kingdom. On the chart we have noted the appearance of the kingdom with a dotted line. It seems that Christendom is different from the world, but actually there is no difference at all. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is today’s Christendom. It is dark, devilish, and even hellish, and we all must condemn it. Where are you? Are you in the appearance of the kingdom or in the reality of the kingdom? You used to be in the world, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="459" id="459">[459]</span> now you are in the church. But the church is no longer normal; rather, it has become abnormal. Therefore, there is the need of the dotted line within the church. The normal church is the reality, but the area in the dotted line indicates the abnormal church. All real Christians are in the church, but some of these Christians have become abnormal and defeated. You may say that you are neither in the world nor in Christendom, the appearance of the kingdom. You are in the church. But are you in the church in a normal situation or in an abnormal situation? The believers who are the thorny soil are abnormal. They are real Christians, but the growth of the seed is choked by the thorns so that it does not bring forth fruit. Fruit denotes both multiplication and expression. But those believers who are on the level of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens are normal. They are poor in spirit, pure in heart; have all their temper, lust, self, and flesh dealt with; have no anxiety; and are not deceived by money. They are the good earth growing Christ into the kingdom. Therefore, they are in the normal church, which is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCbb4PbBmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> When the Lord Jesus comes back, where will you be? If we have endured unto the end, that is, have kept ourselves in the spirit until the end, we shall be saved and shall be in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the heavenly part of the millennium. Those who are there will rule with Christ. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63133" data-verses="Matthew 13:43">13:43</span>, they will “shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” This is the real barn where all the wheat will shine over the nations. That shining will be the ruling, the reigning as kings.</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq__Y7HTtmhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> We need to see that today’s Christianity is in darkness. So many do not know where they are, where they should be, or where they will go. But in the Bible there is light, and the view is very clear. What we have seen is absolutely not according to human thought; it is a word according to the divine revelation. Everything in this chart is confirmed in the Bible. Everyone in the Lord’s recovery must be deeply impressed with this chart. We are in an age of complications. Christ has come and has sown the seed, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="460" id="460">[460]</span> the enemy has also come in and has done things to cause complications. Therefore, in this age we have the worldly people; the wheat, the sons of the kingdom, the children of God; and the tares, the false believers, the nominal Christians, the sons of the Devil, who are among the children of God. Many of the sons of the kingdom have become degraded and have fallen below the standard. Hence, they are abnormal.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57Zj2E1auTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> Thus, there are four classes of people: the normal believers, the abnormal believers, the false believers, and the worldly people. Day after day, we are involved with all four categories. In the very place where you work all four types may be represented. We need to face this situation with a clear view of today’s age. We would not stand with the world nor be a part of Christendom. Furthermore, we would not be real yet abnormal believers. Rather, we want to be real and normal believers, real sons of the kingdom who live according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. We would grow Christ by living a life according to the constitution. Whatever we grow will be the multiplication which is the constituent of the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, today we are not only in the reality—we are the reality. Then when the Lord Jesus, the King, comes again, we shall be in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, shining over the world to reign as Christ’s co-kings and enjoying the heavenly part of the millennium.</p>

As the parable of the tares reveals, the constituents of the kingdom are the sons of the kingdom, who have the divine life within them. However, the tares, the sons of the Devil, have come in. Because of these false ones among the constituents, the kingdom in its outward appearance has become Christendom. Formerly it was purely the kingdom of God, but now it has become Christendom with both real believers and false ones. When many people talk about Christianity, they are actually talking about Christendom. The kingdom of the heavens is not as large as Christendom, for the kingdom is smaller than Christendom and seems to be within it. The kingdom is real, composed of the genuine constituents who are the sons of the kingdom, the sons of God. But the tares sown by Satan have caused a mixture among the so-called Christians in the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, which is Christendom.</p>

First we have the parable of the sower, who sows the seed to bring forth the constituents of the kingdom of the heavens. Then we have the parable of the tares sown by the enemy, the false ones among the constituents <span class="pg" data-page-id="462" id="462">[462]</span> that cause the kingdom of the heavens to become Christendom.

This indicates that the kingdom people, the constituents of the kingdom and the church, should be like a crop to produce food that satisfies God and man. Both wheat and mustard are good for food. In fact, it is very healthy and nourishing to eat wheat bread with mustard on it. However, in both the second and third parables we see the thought of the evil one, the subtlety of Satan. The evil one came in to sow tares among the wheat. As any farmer can tell you, tares greatly frustrate the growth of the wheat because they exhaust the fertility of the soil which is meant to nourish the growing wheat. Because the soil has been exhausted, wasted, by the tares, the wheat cannot grow properly. We may apply this to our present situation. Many false Christians have frustrated the growth of the genuine Christians. Wherever there are many false believers, it is difficult for the real believers to grow in life. This is the subtlety of the enemy. As we shall see, the subtlety of the enemy with respect to the mustard seed is to cause it to grow into a huge tree that is no longer good for food.</p>

(This is against the law of God’s creation, that every plant must be after its kind—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63138" data-verses="Genesis 1:11-12">Gen. 1:11-12</span>.) This happened when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world in the first part of the fourth century. He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church. Hence, this third parable corresponds to the third of the seven churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63139" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">Revelation 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63140" data-verses="Revelation 3:1">3</span>, the church in Pergamos (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63141" data-verses="Revelation 2:12-17">2:12-17</span>). The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant. The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth. But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled in the earth as a tree, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches to lodge many evil persons and things. This has formed the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85wwwSmYn3Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> For a mustard seed to become a tree is a violation of the principle ordained by God in His creation for living matter—that every plant must be according to its kind. This is what is referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63142" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, where we are told that every life grows according to its kind. A peach grows after the peach kind and an apple after the apple kind. This principle applies not only to plant life, but also to animal life and even to human life. Every type of life must develop according to its kind. A cow must be a cow, a donkey must be a donkey, and a horse must be a horse. A mule is an example of an animal not according to its kind. A mule is neither a horse nor a donkey; it is a hybrid between a horse <span class="pg" data-page-id="464" id="464">[464]</span> and donkey. If a certain form of vegetable or plant life is not according to its kind, it will be abnormal and against the principle ordained by God in His creation. In keeping with this principle, a mustard must be according to a mustard, and a tree must be according to a tree. It is abnormal for a mustard to break God’s principle and become a tree. But by growing into a tree, the mustard herb breaks this principle. This kind of growth is abnormal, a violation of God’s regulation. Suppose human life developed without any regulation, and some Chinese grew into oxen, some Japanese grew into horses, and some Americans grew into elephants. How grotesque this would be! Thank God that in His creation He has put a governing principle into every type of life! However, when the Lord sowed the seed of a mustard herb, this herb grew into a tree. How abnormal is such a development!</p>
<p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy7r-K18nw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> When I was young, I read some books which said that this big tree was something positive. But this tree, although very large, is not positive at all. Suppose a man grew into an elephant. Would this be positive or negative? We all would be terrified of such an abnormal development. Today’s Christendom is huge and devilishly abnormal. It is not only a tree, but a great tree. By this we see that not only the nature of the constituent of the kingdom has been changed, but that the size of the kingdom has become abnormal. If an herb is to be good for food, it should not grow too large. When an herb grows abnormally large, it is no longer tender, delicious, or good for food. In His economy God intends that His children be like wheat or mustard, the smaller and the more tender, the better. Furthermore, we should be annuals like wheat and mustard, neither of which remains more than a year. The church people must be annuals, not perennials. We should not be rooted deeply into the earth for a long period of time, for the Lord’s intention is that we be sojourners on earth. As long as we are annuals like wheat and herbs, we shall produce the best foodstuff, grain to make loaves of bread and mustard to match the bread. This will afford <span class="pg" data-page-id="465" id="465">[465]</span> others excellent food for their nourishment and satisfaction. However, the enemy has made the mustard a perennial tree that does not produce any foodstuff.</p>

Instead of producing foodstuff, this tree is a roost for birds.

They lodge in the branches of the great tree, that is, in the enterprises of Christendom. The birds refer to the evil one and to evil persons, evil matters, and evil things—in short to all evil pertaining to the evil one. In today’s Christendom, there are many evil persons, evil things, and evil matters. Christendom has become a big tree producing no fruit, but having become a lodging place for so many evil things.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EGUn9WlkCzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> When this parable was spoken by the Lord, it was prophecy; but today it has become history. In the Vatican we see the fulfillment of this parable. The Vatican is even an independent country, formed by an agreement between Mussolini and the pope. From that time onward, the Vatican and various nations of the world have exchanged ambassadors. This is a further indication that the Christian religion has become a big tree. Today there are approximately eight hundred million Catholics in the world, perhaps one fourth of the world’s population, under the authority of the pope. Such a large number of people is under the papal system. Although Christianity has become a big tree, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63147" data-verses="Luke 12:1">Luke 12</span> the Lord Jesus called His church the “little flock.” We should not be in the big tree, but remain in the little flock.</p>

In the Catholic Church and in the denominations it is difficult to find a grain of wheat or a mustard seed. Instead of food, there is lodging for the birds.

The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ—the unleavened fine flour—as its content, must be the unleavened bread (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63154" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7-8">1 Cor. 5:7-8</span>). However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified by the woman here, took many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ to leaven the whole content of Christianity. This fourth parable corresponds to the fourth of the seven churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63155" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">Revelation 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63156" data-verses="Revelation 3:1">3</span>, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="467" id="467">[467]</span> church in Thyatira (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63157" data-verses="Revelation 2:18-29">2:18-29</span>).

<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYNWVHrEx6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> Meal, for making the meal offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63158" data-verses="Leviticus 2:1">Lev. 2:1</span>), signifies Christ as food to both God and man. Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63159" data-verses="Genesis 18:6">Gen. 18:6</span>). Hence, to hide the leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. This is the actual situation in the Roman Catholic Church. This is absolutely against the Scripture, which strongly forbids putting any leaven into the meal offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63160" data-verses="Leviticus 2:4-5">Lev. 2:4-5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63161" data-verses="Leviticus 2:11">11</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuNfellpDkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> The parable of the leaven reveals the matter of mixture. The three measures of meal refer to fine flour made of wheat grain. This fine flour was always used in the meal offering, the food for God’s priests. Those who served God as priests fed on the fine flour of the meal offering. The meal offering was not only for the satisfaction of God’s priests, but also for the satisfaction of God Himself. Thus, the meal offering was food both for the priests and for God. The meal offering is a full type of Christ in His humanity, with the fine flour signifying Christ. When the Lord appeared to Abraham, Abraham told Sarah, his wife, to prepare a full meal with three measures of fine flour. Hence, in the Bible, three measures denotes a full meal. The fact that three measures of meal have been leavened by the woman indicates that everything related to Christ has been leavened by this evil woman.</p>

The author of <em>The Two Babylons,</em> a book written to expose the leaven of Roman Catholicism, himself used the term reverend, indicating that he himself was not completely purged of the leaven. If you read the history of Christianity, you will see that everything in it has been leavened. For example, in the Vatican there is a painting supposedly of the Trinity. Between the picture of an old man, who represents the Father, and a young man, who represents the Son, there is a young lady, called the mother of God. Above these three there is a dove, denoting the Holy Spirit. According to this picture, Mary is ranked in the deity, and the Trinity has become a quaternity. What leaven is this!</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I5Vo6165x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> The Roman Catholic Church has leavened everything related to Christ. They do have Christ, the meal, but they have put leaven into the meal. They also have the golden cup, but it is filled with abominations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63171" data-verses="Revelation 17:4">Rev. 17:4</span>). There is no doubt that the Catholic Church has some amount of the divine things, signified by the golden cup, but they are mixed with abominations and all manner of devilish matters. This is today’s Christendom. Without exception, everything in Christendom is a mixture. Consider the charismatic movement which has been brought into Catholicism and even mixed with the worship of Mary. Many Catholic charismatics think they are spiritual, yet they still worship Mary. The Roman Catholic Church also has what is called charismatic masses.</p>

The Catholic Church uses this as an excuse for the use of leaven. They say they must make it easy for people to receive Christ. The Catholic Church says that Christ is mysterious, spiritual, and abstract and that people need pictures of Him in order to apprehend Him. Our natural being likes to use certain methods to make spiritual things easier to assimilate. This is what the Bible calls leaven, and we must be careful of it. We must be purged of all leaven.</p>

Rock music and drama are types of leaven used to make spiritual things easier for people to accept. When I was in China, I knew of some young men in a certain organization who mixed basketball with the preaching of the gospel. Using basketball for gospel preaching is also leaven. I doubt that very many were saved through this. The whole principle of the Y.M.C.A. is leaven, for the goal of the Y.M.C.A. is to bring the heavenly standard down to the earthly level, to bring the gospel to secular society in a worldly way. So many things in Christianity are leaven. These include Christmas, Easter, idols, pictures, images, rock music, drama, and the entire Y.M.C.A. system. We must be careful not to take anything other than Christ for God’s purpose, because anything other than He is leaven. Oh, the subtle one is crouching nearby waiting for his prey! We can easily become his prey because in our human nature is the desire to make it easy for people to experience spiritual things. But whatever you use to help people to touch spiritual things is a type of leaven. The pure and sanctified way to preach the gospel and to bring people to Christ is prayer and the ministry of the Word. Do not take any other way. If after praying and ministering the Word, people will still not receive the gospel, that is up to the Lord. Whether or not people receive our word is a matter of the Father’s will. We do not want to use any gimmicks to help in our preaching. Every gimmick is leaven. We are not <span class="pg" data-page-id="470" id="470">[470]</span> for a work or for a movement—we are for the testimony of Jesus.</p>

We can apply this picture to today’s Christianity. Throughout Christianity we can see tares, abnormal growth, and the corruption caused by leaven. In nearly every part of today’s Christianity there is corruption. Although there is a certain amount of truth, it is mixed with leaven. Instead of purity, there is mixture. Those who oppose and criticize us, claiming to defend the truth, must deal with all these things. Praise the Lord that we have been called out of the façade and kept from the leaven! Nevertheless, we must be on the alert not to allow another kind of leaven to come in. Be careful not to take anything other than Christ. In building up the church and spreading the Lord’s testimony, the only way is to pray and to minister the pure Word. In the eyes of God, any gimmick—anything other than Christ, the Word, prayer, and the Spirit—is leaven. We must pray until our preaching is in the power of the Spirit, and we must pray until our testimony is filled with the riches of Christ. This is the pure meal as food for God and man. This is what the Lord wants today.</p>

We must see the difference between the reality of the kingdom and the appearance of the kingdom. The reality is precious to God, but the appearance is abominable to Him. Therefore, we must treasure the reality and reject the appearance. We do not like the tares, the big tree, or the rottenness. We care for the pure wheat flour and the little mustard herb which are good for food. This is the church’s testimony, which is food to God and man. Not until the hungry and seeking ones <span class="pg" data-page-id="471" id="471">[471]</span> come into the Lord’s recovery can they find the pure food for their spiritual satisfaction. Many of us can testify that we were hungry for years, but that once we came into the church, we were satisfied. Our spirit told us that here in the church there is food. Here there are no gimmicks or leaven, but fine flour with the mustard herb. This is the Lord’s recovery, and this is the dining table. This is the Lord’s testimony without the tares, the big tree, or the leaven.</p>

<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFDDVmyp3NHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> In the Bible the number seven is composed of six plus one, three plus four, or four plus three. The seven churches in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63175" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">Revelation 2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63176" data-verses="Revelation 3:1">3</span> are made up of three plus four. But the seven parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63177" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> are made up of four plus three. The first four parables were given in the boat in the open air. These are the parables of the sower, the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven. The last three were given privately to the disciples in the house. The previous three parables concerning the outward appearance of the kingdom were spoken publicly by the heavenly King in the boat to the crowds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63178" data-verses="Matthew 13:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63179" data-verses="Matthew 13:34">34</span>), whereas the three parables following these were given privately in the house to the disciples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63180" data-verses="Matthew 13:36">v. 36</span>). This indicates that the things covered by these three parables are more hidden.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYHt-pzA2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> In each of the first four parables there was something related to eating. By this we see that the first four parables cover the matter of food. God’s intention is to have a people on earth to be the constituents of His kingdom, and these people must be like food that is good to satisfy both God and man. But the enemy came in to plant tares among the wheat to frustrate the growth of the wheat and to damage it. Nevertheless some wheat has grown up and multiplied. Thus, in the fourth parable we have the meal. The fine flour composing the meal comes from wheat. The reason the Lord Jesus sowed wheat seeds was that God desires to have fine flour. Although Satan, God’s enemy, sowed tares among the wheat to frustrate its growth, God <span class="pg" data-page-id="474" id="474">[474]</span> cannot be defeated. Some wheat grew to produce grain, and the grain was ground into fine flour to make a loaf. While this was taking place, Satan caused the mustard herb, intended to be a source of food, to grow abnormally into a big tree and thereby to lose its function of producing food. Instead, it became an evil lodging place. This is a picture of Christendom today. In the various Christian organizations we see big buildings, offices, and complex hierarchies. We see the branches of the big tree, but nothing of the fine flour or the mustard herb. According to the fourth parable, Satan then took the further step of adding leaven to the fine flour. Here we see Satan’s subtlety. Firstly, he sowed tares among the wheat to frustrate the growth of the wheat; secondly, he caused the mustard herb to grow abnormally and to lose its function; thirdly, seeing that some wheat was produced to make fine flour for a loaf to satisfy God and man, Satan added leaven to the meal.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUuXmDW4s0trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> The first four parables are all related to the farm. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63181" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span> Paul says, “Ye are God’s farm, ye are God’s building” (Gk.). In this chapter we see that God’s farm eventually produces gold, silver, and precious stones. How mysterious it is that the produce of God’s farm becomes gold, silver, and precious stones, the materials for God’s building. God’s farm produces the things of life, and these things of life become the materials for God’s building. Thus, God’s farm is for God’s building.</p>
<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbYzuKETLQZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> In the first four parables in Matthew we have the life growing, and in the next parable we have the treasure hidden in the field. The treasure must be made up of gold, silver, and precious stones, probably mainly precious stones. In the following parable we find the pearl. The New Jerusalem is built with gold, precious stones, and pearl. Gold is the material of the city proper, and precious stones and pearl are the two other building materials for the city of God. In the first four parables the Lord revealed the life that grows Christ into the kingdom. In the next two parables He revealed the matter of transformation for building. This brings us back to the basic thought of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="475" id="475">[475]</span> Bible—life and building. The parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63182" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> reveal the matters of life and building. Life is Christ Himself as the seed sown into our humanity. This life grows within us, growing Christ into the kingdom. The growing of this life eventually produces precious stones and pearls.</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiFIBK9ApM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> After spending much time on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63183" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>, I found that its basic thought is the same as that of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63184" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span>. In both chapters we have God’s farm and God’s building. The first four parables are related to God’s farm for growing Christ into the kingdom, and the following two parables are related to transformation for producing precious materials for God’s building. If we are not impressed with this matter, we shall not be able to understand the fifth and sixth parables.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvR1Ngp4vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> We have consulted a number of books on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63185" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>, but none of them touch the depth of this chapter. None of the interpretations given in those books satisfied us. Even D. M. Panton says that the treasure hidden in the field is the kingdom and that the pearl is righteousness, for in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63186" data-verses="Matthew 6:33">6:33</span> we are told to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. The teaching prevalent among the Brethren did not get into the depth of this chapter. Although D. M. Panton saw that the treasure hid in the field referred to the kingdom, he was not clear about the pearl. In this message we need to consider these two parables in a definite way.</p>

Because the church is the practical kingdom today, and the New Jerusalem will be the kingdom in manifestation in the coming age, therefore the treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom hidden in God’s created world. <span class="pg" data-page-id="476" id="476">[476]</span> </p>

In the Bible the earth signifies the world created by God, and the sea signifies the world corrupted by Satan. The earth also signifies Israel, the Jewish nation, because Israel was chosen by God, separated by God, and placed by God in a specific situation. Hence, the Jewish people stand before God as the earth created by Him. Based upon the same principle, the sea also signifies the Gentile world, for the Gentiles are the people corrupted by Satan. Therefore, in the Bible the earth and the sea stand for two things each.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFDDVm26HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> The first four parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63192" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> provide a clear picture of so-called Christianity. After giving forth these parables, the Lord privately spoke to His disciples the parables of the treasure hidden in the field and the pearl from the sea. If we understand the significance of the earth in the Bible, we shall know that the treasure hidden in the field must be the kingdom, and that the pearl produced out of the sea must be the church. The kingdom is truly a treasure to the Lord. How precious it is in His sight! The church is also a valuable pearl to Him. The Lord is continually seeking two things—the kingdom as the treasure and the church as the pearl. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63193" data-verses="Ephesians 5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span> says that Christ will present to Himself a glorious church without spot, wrinkle, or any such thing.

This stone will eventually become a great mountain filling the entire earth. The stone is Christ, and the great mountain is Christ enlarged to be the universal kingdom on earth. All this is related to the treasure in the earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63203" data-verses="Revelation 11:15">Revelation 11:15</span> says, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever.” This will take place at the time of the millennium, when the whole earth will be Christ’s kingdom.

Christ first found the treasure when He came out to minister, declaring, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” When the Jews’ rejection of the Lord reached its peak, He forsook them. From that time onward, He hid the treasure. Then He went to the cross to buy not only the treasure, but also the field, and He thereby redeemed the earth created by God.</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiFIBK1QZM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> Christ went to the cross to redeem the God-created <span class="pg" data-page-id="478" id="478">[478]</span> earth because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure. For the kingdom, for this treasure, Christ redeemed the earth created by God. In order for Him to have the kingdom on earth, He must redeem the earth because it had been polluted and damaged by Satan’s fall and by man’s sin. The Lord sold all that He had and bought the earth; that is, He sacrificed all He had on the cross to redeem the earth for the treasure of the kingdom. No doubt this kingdom is realized in the church life. But its manifestation is related to the redeemed nation of Israel. During the millennium, the earth will become the kingdom of Christ. At that time, the nation of Israel will be the center of Christ’s kingdom. Hence, the kingdom is mainly related to the nation of Israel and involved with Israel.</p>

At the cross He sold all, whatever He had, and bought that pearl. The pearl, produced in the death waters (the world filled with death) by the living oyster (the living Christ), wounded by a little rock (the sinner) and secreting its life-juice around the wounding rock (the believer), is also the material for the building of the New Jerusalem. Since the pearl comes out of the sea, <span class="pg" data-page-id="479" id="479">[479]</span> which signifies the world corrupted by Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63219" data-verses="Isaiah 57:20">Isa. 57:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63220" data-verses="Revelation 17:15">Rev. 17:15</span>), it must refer to the church, which is mainly constituted with regenerated believers from the Gentile world, and which is of great value.</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkX9DE9xGiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> The Lord is not only seeking the kingdom; He also desires a beautiful church, the pearl. We have pointed out that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63221" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span>, the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones and pearls. In other words, the New Jerusalem is a combination of the treasure and the pearl. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63222" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> these are two, the treasure in the field and the pearl out of the sea. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63223" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span> they are combined in one entity. The New Jerusalem is both the kingdom and the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63224" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> the terms church and kingdom are used interchangeably. Firstly the Lord said, “I will build My church”; then He said, “I give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.” The fact that these terms are used interchangeably means that the church is equal to the kingdom and the kingdom to the church. Ultimately, in the New Jerusalem the kingdom and the church become one entity.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCbYYPaBGmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> At this point some may be asking the following question: Since the kingdom is the church and the church is the kingdom, what is the difference between them? This brings us to a matter difficult to understand. Let me approach it by asking whether we in the Lord’s recovery are in the church or the kingdom. It is correct to say that we are in both the church and the kingdom, but we must know in what sense we are the church and in what sense we are the kingdom. In other words, we must know in what sense we are the treasure and in what sense we are the pearl. As the kingdom, we are something of the earth created by God and redeemed by Christ; and as the church, we are something out of the world corrupted by Satan and condemned by God. The treasure, the symbol of the kingdom, is concealed within the earth. Hence, it is altogether related to the earth. But the pearl, the symbol of the church, has nothing whatever to do with the earth. It is something produced out of the sea. Out of the Satan-corrupted and <span class="pg" data-page-id="480" id="480">[480]</span> God-condemned sea such a beautiful thing as a fine pearl has been produced. As the church, we have been produced out of the world, but we no longer have anything to do with the world. Although we are the pearl out of the sea, we are no longer in the sea. We have been regenerated to become a beautiful pearl. Being in another category, we have nothing to do with this rotten world. As the kingdom we have nothing to do with the Satan-corrupted world, but we are related to the God-created earth and Christ-redeemed earth. On the one hand, we are through with the world; on the other hand, we are building up something on earth. We are not building a tower of Babel; we are building the kingdom of the heavens. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63225" data-verses="Matthew 6:10">Matthew 6:10</span> says, “Let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.” God’s kingdom cannot be established in the sea, and God’s will cannot be done in the Satan-corrupted world. God’s will must be done on the God-created earth, and God’s kingdom must be established on the Christ-redeemed earth. At the same time we are both in the church and in the kingdom, in the pearl and in the treasure.</p>

<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq__bbHStGhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> When the New Jerusalem comes, there will be no more sea, and the earth will be renewed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63226" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Rev. 21:1</span>). On that new earth there will be a combination of the treasure and the pearl, of the kingdom and the church. In the New Jerusalem the treasure will no longer be hidden in the field, but built upon the surface of the field. In that combination of the treasure and the pearl, the treasure will be built up with the pearl. If you have this vision, you will see that even among us today the kingdom and the church are built up together. We do not have two entities, but just one entity. On the one hand, this entity is the treasure, the kingdom; on the other hand, it is the pearl, the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57ZgWE0ZOTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> Among us in the Lord’s recovery there should be no sea. Instead of the sea, we should have the renewed earth. But suppose you visit the church in Anaheim, and in many of the homes you hear nothing but gossiping. This would be a sign that the sea is still present with those brothers and <span class="pg" data-page-id="481" id="481">[481]</span> sisters. Although a church filled with gossip is still a church, it is a church in the water of the ocean. Such a church cannot be the kingdom. It is the pearl, but not the treasure. But suppose in all the homes of the church in Anaheim there is no gossip, criticism, or idle words. Rather, there is nothing but the experience of Christ and the church. In such a case, there will be no sea. Instead, there will be life, light, and transformation. Such a church is the renewed land for the kingdom. In every home you see the proper humanity, and immediately you sense that there is no more sea, only the renewed earth. On this renewed earth there is the New Jerusalem composed of the pearl and the treasure. This is not only the church, but also the kingdom. In such a church you have the treasure in the field and the pearl out of the sea.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faCICuh6qZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> By this illustration we see that the church can be both the pearl and the treasure. When we are the pearl, we are out of the sea, out of the world. When we are the kingdom, we are on the earth. However, we are not on the earth in a subdued way, but in a reigning way, for we are on the earth as the heavenly kingdom. This should not be mere doctrine to us. It must be our genuine daily practice. If our conversation is filled with talk about worldly things, about money or the movies, it is a sign that we are filled with the things of the Satan-corrupted world. This is the sea. But if among us there is no gossip or criticism, but Christ, the church, and transformation, this is a sign that we are the new earth. Among us here in Anaheim we have the new earth. On this new earth we have the treasure, the kingdom, and the proper human life. Even today, this treasure is no longer hidden; it is on the surface of the earth. To the worldly people and to the unbelieving Jews, this treasure is hidden within the earth. Praise the Lord that we have such a treasure in the renewed earth! None of the outsiders or unbelievers understands this. Sometimes they say, “We don’t understand those people. We don’t know what they are doing. However, we realize that they are good people.” This is the treasure, the evidence that we are living a <span class="pg" data-page-id="482" id="482">[482]</span> proper human life on the God-created and Christ-redeemed earth. At the time of the millennium, in the eyes of God the entire earth will be a treasure.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5lp3a68Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> In the first four parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63227" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> we see only the growing of life: we see nothing of transformation. In these parables we have the wheat, the grain, the mustard, and the fine flour. Praise the Lord for the two following parables! We have not only four parables on the growing life, but also two parables on transformation. Transformation makes us pearls and precious stone, pearls for the church and precious stones for the kingdom. On the one hand, we are out of the world, having nothing to do with the corrupted world. On the other hand, we are living on earth as the proper humanity. For us, there is no more the sea, but the dry land created by God and redeemed by Christ. Now we are living and walking on this land. This is not only the church as the pearl, but also the kingdom as the treasure. I praise the Lord that I am part of the pearl and of the treasure. As part of the pearl, I have nothing to do with this rotten world. But as part of the treasure, I am very interested in this earth. I do not desire to go to heaven. I prefer to be here on this good earth where there is no more sea. We are the pearl and we are the treasure. We are out of the world, but we are still on the earth. This is the correct interpretation of these two parables.</p>

<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkQ_TE6i2iT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> Before we consider the parable of the net, I would like to say a further word regarding the treasure and the pearl. In the Bible the number seven is composed of four plus three, three plus four, or six plus one. The first time the number seven is mentioned in the Bible, it is composed of the six days of creation plus one day, the Sabbath, for rest. In Revelation the seven churches are composed of three plus four. The seven seals are firstly composed of four plus three, then of six plus one. The principle is the same with the seven trumpets and the seven bowls. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63228" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> the number seven is composed firstly of four plus three, then of six plus one. The first four parables are all related to foodstuff, but the fifth and sixth parables are related to transformation for building. Although even the hardest bread can be leavened, pearl and precious stones cannot be leavened. Furthermore, although a wafer or even hard bread may be ruined by water poured upon it, this is not true of either precious stones or pearls.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCcaIPeSGmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63229" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> is not merely a prophecy or a doctrine. It is also a vision of the practical situation of today’s Christianity with respect to the church and the kingdom. The Lord’s word about the mysteries of the kingdom is not idealistic or ethereal. It is practical. Thus, if we would understand these parables, we must look to the Lord for some practical application of them. Our understanding of the parables must match the practical situation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="484" id="484">[484]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_4ZLHX-WhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> If you look at today’s Christendom, you will see that the real Christians are the wheat and that the false Christians have been mixed with the real ones to frustrate their growth. Everywhere on earth, especially in Europe, we see more false Christians than real ones. In Catholic countries like Italy and Brazil it is difficult to find one genuine Christian among many so-called Christians. Therefore, the interpretation of the tares as being false Christians is not only doctrinal, but also practical according to history and the present situation. Furthermore, the big tree stands before us. Every day we behold the huge façade of Christendom. This is neither doctrine nor mere prophecy. In front of our eyes we have the practical fulfillment of prophecy. We also see leaven everywhere. In Christendom there is leaven in everything. Every aspect and every corner of Christendom has been leavened. If there is a little truth, there is a great deal of leaven added to it. This is the actual situation today.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57eiGE-JuTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> We can interpret the first four parables in a practical way and apply them in a practical way. Now we must do the same with the fifth and sixth parables. Recently the Lord has shown us the practical way to understand them. In order to understand any prophecy in a practical way we need the facts. Only when we see the facts can we understand the prophecy of these parables in a practical way. In the Lord’s recovery we have the treasure and the pearl. In the first four parables we have the wheat, the tares, the mustard, and the leaven. We are not the tares; we are the wheat and the fine flour. However, in the Lord’s recovery it is not adequate simply to be wheat or fine flour. If we are just wheat or fine flour, we shall not be satisfied. In the Lord’s recovery there is also a pearl and the treasure, the precious stones. In His recovery the Lord must have a church that is pure, solid, and genuine like a pearl. In such a pearl there is no mixture or opaqueness. Rather, it is absolutely pure and bright. If you would know what the church in the Lord’s recovery is, look at a pearl. By looking at a pearl, you will know what the church should be. <span class="pg" data-page-id="485" id="485">[485]</span> Although we are not yet completely satisfied, we can say that the churches in the Lord’s recovery are like pearls. No matter how solid bread may be, it is still possible for it to be leavened. But when the church has become a pearl, it can no longer be leavened. Who could put leaven into pearl or precious stone?</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faFKSuqqaZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> In the Lord’s recovery we on the one hand must be like a pearl and on the other hand like precious stone. Concerning life, we are the pearl; concerning our living, we are the treasure, the precious stone. Look at the New Jerusalem: all the gates are pearls, but the walls are built with precious stones. The pearl gates are for entrance, for the beginning; and the walls are for expression. The church is our life, and the kingdom is our living. As the church, we have been regenerated out of the Satan-corrupted world. But we are not only the pearl for the beginning, the entrance; we are also the precious stone for the expression. This signifies our living under the heavenly ruling. This is the kingdom. As the church, we are the pearl having life, a new start, and an entrance. As the kingdom, we are the treasure, the precious stone, standing there as something that has been built up to express Christ under the heavenly constitution. This is our living and our expression.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EBWn9WnkCzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> Some teachers say that the kingdom is related to Israel, but maybe no one says that the pearl is related to the church. Those who relate the kingdom to Israel are too doctrinal and dispensational, not at all practical. We need to apply the parables of the treasure and the pearl not only in a doctrinal way or a dispensational way, but also in a practical way. In order to apply them in a practical way, we must see that during the period of the existence of Christendom, the Lord is working to gain the treasure and the pearl. Christendom continues with the wheat, the tares, the big tree, and the leaven in the meal. But the Lord spoke not only the four parables for Christendom, but two parables for the genuine and proper church life. The churches in the Lord’s recovery are in the fifth and sixth parables. The churches in the recovery today are the <span class="pg" data-page-id="486" id="486">[486]</span> treasure and the pearl. As far as life is concerned, we are the pearl; and as far as our living is concerned, we are the treasure. For life, we are the pearl gates; for our living, we are the walls made of precious stones. This latter is the kingdom life, the living of the church under God’s dominion.</p>
<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhnnzpNSw69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> This enables us to have a fuller understanding of the New Jerusalem. The twelve pearl gates signify the church as the entrance, and the walls built with precious stones signify the kingdom, the expression of living under the heavenly rule. When you say, “Lord Jesus, how I thank You that I have the divine life,” that is the pearl. But when you say, “O Lord, grant me more grace that I may be poor in spirit and pure in heart, that I may be under Your ruling, that I may be dealt with by You so that I will not have any rocks or thorns within me, and that I may live under the heavenly constitution,” you immediately become the treasure. On the one hand, we are the pearl; on the other hand, we are the treasure.</p>

<p data-content-id="Xrfm_0_wHtlK1HVoKjia9zcO6XsNx9Cw0kdxF7iwt4aGYrrICB0YkaHGfAxzlMrpi"> The fifth parable speaks of a man finding a treasure and the sixth, of the merchant seeking a pearl. For the kingdom, Christ is the man, and for the church, He is the merchant. This fits in with the concept of the entire Bible. The kingdom requires a man. In order to have God’s kingdom on earth, there is the need of a man. Christ came as this man, not as the first man, but as the second man. Firstly this man found the kingdom. Then, because of the rejection of Israel, He hid the kingdom from the Jewish people. For the church, Christ is the merchant, one who is always seeking to gain something of high value. Regarding the kingdom, the man bought the field, the earth. The reason he bought the earth is that the kingdom is in the earth. However, in order to gain the pearl, the merchant did not purchase the sea; rather, he bought only the pearl. Christ is the One who bought the pearl directly, but He did not buy the treasure directly. Instead, He bought the field directly. Although Christ redeemed the church and the earth, He did not redeem the kingdom. The kingdom does not require a redeemer or a buyer. However, the lost earth, <span class="pg" data-page-id="487" id="487">[487]</span> the earth created by God and then lost, requires a redeemer. Furthermore, the church as God’s chosen and predestinated people also requires a buyer because those people became lost. Therefore, the kingdom needs only a man, but the church needs a merchant and a redeemer.</p>

The net here does not signify the gospel of grace, which is preached in the church age, but the eternal gospel, which will be preached to the Gentile world in the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63232" data-verses="Revelation 14:6-7">Rev. 14:6-7</span>). The sea into which this net is cast signifies the Gentile world, and “every kind” signifies all the nations, all the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63233" data-verses="Matthew 25:32">25:32</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OQinPIuG0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> Throughout the centuries, the parable of the net has been misunderstood and applied incorrectly. Many have said that the net signifies the gospel of grace. They have also likened this parable to the parable of the tares, saying that in the parable of the tares we have the real ones and the false ones, and that in the parable of the net we have the good ones and the bad ones. They claim that the good ones are the wheat and the bad ones are the tares. If this is true, then the Lord Jesus would have not been so wise, for He would have used two parables for the same thing.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKnx9woQ5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> Once again we need to consider the way the number seven is constituted. Firstly, it is composed of six plus one. The first six parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63234" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> are related to the church. In the church there are the abnormal ones, and around the church there are the false ones. Thus, directly or indirectly, the first six parables are related to the church. But what happens to the people outside of the church, those in the world? Surely there is the need of a parable to cover them. If the seven parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63235" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> covered only the church, then there would be no parable to cover the nations. In such a case, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63236" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> would not <span class="pg" data-page-id="488" id="488">[488]</span> be perfect. The seventh parable, the parable of the net, is related not to the church, but to the world, to the nations.</p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAVikcW2szKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> Those related to the church are classified into three groups: the real and normal Christians, the overcomers; the real, yet abnormal Christians, the defeated ones; and the false Christians. At the time of the Lord’s coming back, the false Christians, the tares, will be bound into bundles and cast into the furnace of fire, that is, into the lake of fire. That will be the destiny of the tares. The normal, real Christians, the overcomers, will be transferred into the manifestation of the kingdom to be co-kings with Christ. The abnormal ones will be put in a certain place to be chastened, disciplined, and punished. These six parables give us a clear view regarding the real Christians and the false Christians. The seventh parable, the parable of the net, covers the destiny of the worldly people.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPNeBzmMoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> The net here is not the gospel of grace. Instead, it is the eternal gospel declared in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63237" data-verses="Revelation 14:6-7">Revelation 14:6 and 7</span>. (See Life-study of Revelation, Message Forty-seven, pp. 541-547.) Most Christian teachers have neglected this gospel. During the tribulation, Antichrist, who will oppose all religion, will persecute both Christians and Jews. Christ will consider these persecuted Christians His brothers. Because Antichrist will persecute the Jews and the Christians, an angel will be sent forth to proclaim the eternal gospel. The eternal gospel is absolutely different in content from the gospel of grace. The gospel of grace is preached for repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus. The eternal gospel, however, will say that men should fear God and worship Him. It will not touch the matter of repentance nor will it require faith. Rather, because Antichrist will set himself up as God, erecting an image of himself and compelling people to worship it, the eternal gospel will tell people to worship God, the One who created the heavens, the earth, and the sea, not to worship the idol of Antichrist. Furthermore, the eternal gospel will command the people to fear God because Antichrist will be leading them to persecute and to kill God’s people. Those who kill God’s people must hear <span class="pg" data-page-id="489" id="489">[489]</span> that God will come in to avenge them. Hence, they all must fear God.</p>

Christ will judge the living at the time of His coming back. This will take place before the millennium. In addition to the Jews and the Christians, there have been throughout the centuries a great many unbelievers, most of whom will have died before the Lord comes back. But a number will still be living at the time He comes again. These living ones will be the nations. When Christ comes back, He will exercise His judgment upon them. He will judge them not according to the law of Moses nor according to the gospel of grace, but according to the eternal gospel declared in the three and a half years immediately prior to Christ’s coming back. In the Bible both the law of Moses and the gospel of grace are a basis for God’s judgment. The eternal gospel declared in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63240" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> will be the basis for Christ’s judgment upon the living nations.</p>

But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63242" data-verses="Psalms 100:1">Psalm 100</span> reveals that all the people on earth are the sheep of the Lord. Hence, in the Lord’s eyes all the peoples on this earth are His sheep. When He comes back, He will gather them all before the throne of His glory, and there He will exercise His judgment upon them, based upon the eternal gospel. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63243" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">Matthew 25</span>, the King will judge the nations according to the way they have treated His little brothers. During the tribulation, the Jews and the Christians will suffer a great deal. They will lack food and clothing, they will be sick, and they will be imprisoned. The ones who hear the eternal gospel and who fear God and worship Him will secretly help the believers, rendering them some financial or material assistance. Those who treat the believers favorably will be regarded by the King as sheep. But those <span class="pg" data-page-id="490" id="490">[490]</span> who do not treat them well will be regarded as goats. The goats will be cast into eternal fire, but the sheep will be transferred to the millennium to be the citizens on the earth.</p>

The worldly people are covered in the parable of the net. The church is a pearl out of the sea. After the church has been called out of the sea, what remains in the sea is the nations who will be living in the Gentile world. At the Lord’s coming back, He will send out His angels to collect all the things in the sea. After they have been collected before the throne of His glory, they will be divided according to the way they have treated the believers during the tribulation. Those who have treated them well will be considered the sheep, the good ones, and those who have treated them poorly will be considered the goats, the evil ones. The good ones will be transferred to the millennial kingdom, which has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world (not before the foundation of the world). There these good ones will be the citizens of the coming kingdom. But the evil ones will be cast into the lake of eternal fire. This will close the age.</p>

<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4NBKyZBP8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> This added parable concerns a scribe who has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens. A scribe was a scholar in the Old Testament, one who knew the books of Moses and the prophets. In this parable the Lord does not use the word “believed,” but the word “discipled.” Such a learned one has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens. Formerly he was a scholar of the Old Testament dispensation, but now he has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens. This means that he has been discipled into God’s new economy. He knew God’s old economy, but now he has been discipled into God’s new economy. For this reason he is likened to a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old. When the new things are put with the old things, we have the precious things. The Apostle Paul was such a person. He was an Old Testament scribe who one day was discipled into God’s New Testament economy. Hence, Paul could bring forth the old things and the new things. This qualified him to write the book of Hebrews. In this book Paul brings forth many of the old things, with the new things as the interpretation.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZRjedx8Cy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> In giving this parable the Lord was expecting that some of His listeners would be scribes, not all fishermen like Peter, John, James, and Andrew. The Lord Jesus is wise. At the turn of the new economy, He had to go to Galilee to find the unlearned fishermen. But after the turn had taken place, there would be the need of some learned ones to carry out all the mysteries. Although those Galileans heard the Lord speak all the mysteries, they were not scribes. In his writing, Peter did not refer to many things from the Old Testament; neither did John. But Paul was not a Galilean <span class="pg" data-page-id="492" id="492">[492]</span> fisherman. He was a scribe who had been discipled into the kingdom. Therefore, he had a rich store, a rich treasure.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS_3q8cVeasIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> The Lord’s recovery needs not only the unlearned Galileans, but also the scribes. After the Lord spoke the parables of the kingdom to the Galilean fishermen, He spoke another parable regarding the scribe discipled into the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord seemed to be saying, “You Galilean fishermen must listen to this. You are not adequate to carry out God’s New Testament economy. I can use you to make the turn, but after the turn has been made, you will not be adequate. I need some scribes. I need one like Saul of Tarsus who studied at the feet of Gamaliel.” In this matter we see the Lord’s wisdom. Young people, you need to go to the best colleges and earn a degree. Then you will be scribes. Today the Lord needs not only the Galilean fishermen to make the turn; He also needs the scribes.</p>
<p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2weK7E-SUEzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> When the disciples heard the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, they might have been very happy and said, “Hallelujah, we, the Galilean fishermen, know all the mysteries of the kingdom!” But the Lord might have said, “You are happy, but I still need some scribes. Sorry, none of you is a scribe. Peter, you will be good for the day of Pentecost, good for throwing the net and catching a large number of people. But after so many have been brought into the church, how will you deal with them? You Galilean fishermen do not have the ability for this. I need some scribes full of knowledge, some scribes discipled into My economy. These scribes will pull out the things new and old both from their knowledge and from their experience.” Because Paul had advanced in religion, he could write the book of Galatians. Peter, however, could not write such a book. This is proved by Peter’s word in his second book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63246" data-verses="2Peter 3:15-16">2 Pet. 3:15-16</span>). Perhaps he was the leading fisherman in casting the net, but he was not advanced in the Jewish religion. He did not know the books of Leviticus and Psalms as well as Saul of Tarsus did. Thus, all the Galilean fishermen were subdued by the parable of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="493" id="493">[493]</span> scribe. If we apply this parable to Paul, we see what a rich treasure he had. Out of his treasure he could bring forth new doctrines and old doctrines, new experiences and old experiences. I hope that some of the young people will become scribes. For the Lord’s recovery today we need both the fishermen and the scribes. </p>

Throughout the centuries, these two parables have not been properly and thoroughly understood, nor have they been correctly applied. I want to approach these parables not in a doctrinal way, but in the way of application.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GqSFFYuQsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu">THE FACTS OF HISTORY</h2><p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrvqaH75Z5GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> Firstly, we need to be reminded that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63248" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> is a chapter on the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. The mysteries unveiled in these parables cover the entire span of Christian history. In other words, the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens encompass the main points of Christian history between the Lord’s first coming and His second coming. To interpret these parables properly, we need to take care of the facts of history. Otherwise, what we say about them will be imaginary and not practical. For example, in order to interpret Nebuchadnezzar’s dream recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63249" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>, we cannot afford to neglect the facts of history. We need to know what historical facts correspond to the golden head, the silver chest and arms, and the other parts of the great image Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63250" data-verses="Revelation 6:1">Revelation 6</span> also illustrates the need to know the facts of history in order to interpret the Scripture. In this chapter we have the four horses: the white horse, the red horse, the pale horse, and the black horse. Many interpretations of the four horses have been offered. However, none of them has satisfied us because those interpretations did not correspond to the facts of history. According to the historical facts, from the time of the ascension of Christ there has been the preaching of the gospel, the spreading of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="496" id="496">[496]</span> glad tidings, represented by the white horse. Following that, there has been war signified by the red horse, famine signified by the black horse, and death signified by the pale horse.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovgYDx2xQRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP">A COMPLETE PICTURE OF CHRISTENDOM</h2><p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMkuOJOwTAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> With this principle in mind, we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63251" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>. As we have pointed out, the first four parables reveal the general situation of Christianity. The wheat signifies the real believers; the tares symbolize the false believers; the big tree represents Christendom with its huge organization; and the leaven added to the meal by the woman stands for the evil doctrines and heathen practices of the apostate church. We have seen that in the Bible the fine flour signifies Christ as the food to both God and His people. When all these items are put together, we have a complete picture of Christendom.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqDihFDrP5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v">THE OVERCOMERS</h2><p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbY0sKEaZwZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> The parables of the treasure hidden in the field and the pearl out of the sea are puzzling. What facts of history fit in with these parables? The true believers are the fulfillment of the wheat; the false believers, of the tares; Christendom, of the big tree; the apostate church, of the woman; the evil things of heathenism and various heretical teachings, of the leaven; and Christ as food for God and man, of the meal. But what is there in history that can be regarded as the fulfillment of the treasure and the pearl? As I was considering this matter before the Lord, He showed me that in history besides the real believers, the false believers, Christendom, the apostate church, the heresies and heathen practices, and Christ as food, there have been the overcomers, who are more solid, genuine, precious, and valuable in the eyes of God than the wheat. In God’s eyes these overcomers are likened to the treasure hidden in the field and to the pearl out of the sea. From the first century until the present, among the many real Christians represented by the wheat, there have been a small number of more solid ones like the transformed precious <span class="pg" data-page-id="497" id="497">[497]</span> stones hidden in the field. This is especially true today. In the Lord’s recovery there are a good number of saints who love the Lord, who have given up the world, and who do not live by their natural life. Although they have had some failures, they still like to live in the spirit, spend time in the presence of the Lord, stay in the Lord’s will, and be one with Him in a practical way. Those who are like this are not just the wheat, bulky in size and abundant in quantity; they are the transformed precious stones, smaller in quantity and hidden under the earth. Not many people can see them, but the Lord sees them.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiCKBK1SZM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX">REDUCED AND MADE SOLID</h2><p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0dEDRvWM_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> Many saints in the Lord’s recovery can testify that they are not merely wheat, but something more solid, valuable, and precious. Before certain brothers and sisters came to the Lord’s recovery, they were wheat. Outwardly, they were rather bulky and showy. But during the years they have been in the recovery, they have been constricted and reduced. They have become smaller year by year. When you were bulky, you were soft and light like cotton, easily ruined by a little water. But after you are reduced, constricted, and transformed, you have the assurance that you are more precious to the Lord. Many of us can testify of this. We in the Lord’s recovery are not as bulky as we used to be. Instead, we are constantly being reduced, transformed, and made more solid. After you have become as solid as a precious stone, not even a flood can damage you. Instead of damaging a precious stone, water only makes it more clean and valuable.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEFsXpu6irHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> If we examine Christian history, we shall find those who belong in the categories of the treasure and the pearl. The parables of the treasure and the pearl refer to the overcomers throughout the centuries. As an illustration of the genuine believers, the Lord uses the example of wheat grown from seed sown in the field. This, however, is a general illustration of the genuine believers. The Lord uses other illustrations to describe the overcoming members of the church. They used to be lifeless grains of sand. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="498" id="498">[498]</span> they wounded Christ, the oyster living in the death water, and stayed at Christ’s wound, where they participated in the secretion of Christ’s life. This not only enabled them to be regenerated, but also caused them to become pearls. This is more than a seed sown in a field to produce wheat; it is something that has become precious through the secretion of the life of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMmsIrspqCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9">THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM</h2><p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz6FYcIKxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> We have pointed out that the treasure no doubt refers to precious stones. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the church life and the kingdom life, for in this city the church life is combined with the kingdom. The building of New Jerusalem is mainly of the pearl gates and the precious stones which form the wall and its foundations. All this is set upon a golden base that upholds the entire building. In this message we are focusing on the pearl gate and the treasure wall. The pearl refers to the church, and the treasure, to the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxClU2KcKa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> The church and the kingdom are spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63252" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> in a mysterious way in parables. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63253" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> the Lord speaks a clear word to His disciples regarding the church and the kingdom. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63254" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">16:18</span> He says, “On this rock I will build My church,” and in the following verse, “I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.” In these verses we see the church and the kingdom. In order to understand the treasure and the pearl in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63255" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>, we must consider the church and the kingdom in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63256" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span>. If you pray over these two chapters, you will spontaneously see that the treasure is the kingdom and that the pearl is the church. Both the treasure and the pearl are in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkQ_DE-xmiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63257" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span>, the Lord Jesus sold whatever He had and bought the pearl. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63258" data-verses="Acts 20:28">Acts 20:28</span> says that the Lord purchased the church with His blood. This means that on the cross He sold all He had and bought the church. This verse is a strong proof that the pearl in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63259" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> is the church, for the pearl was purchased by the merchant. No doubt the merchant is the Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="499" id="499">[499]</span> </p>

Regeneration is related to the pearl, for the pearl is produced by the principle of regeneration. By being reborn we enter into the sphere of God, into the realm of the kingdom. After we were regenerated, we began to live by Him. Because we loved Him, we wanted to stay under His control and be restricted by Him. Many of us have experienced being restricted on every side. We are not limited by man, but by something inward that is invisible—by the life under the heavenly ruling. We may try to do certain things, but we are restricted from doing them by a mysterious, invisible, inward control. Our relatives or schoolmates are free to do those things, but we cannot do them. Something invisible exercises an inward control over us, and we live under this control. This is the treasure, the kingdom life.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57eiWE0bOTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> Before we became Christians, we were sand. But we have been regenerated. This means that something living has entered into us. As more life juice is secreted over us, we become precious and begin to live under a mysterious control. This is the experience of the pearl and the treasure.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faFKCuh4qZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> The local church in the Lord’s recovery is a pearl. But in the eyes of the Lord, this church must also be a treasure hidden from the world. Neither the worldly people nor those in Christianity know what we are doing. But deep within we know that we are living a pearl life and a life under an invisible control. We are the pearl and the treasure.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5ir3a785o1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> The first four parables of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63261" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> do not fully cover us. We are not just the wheat or the fine flour. We are more precious, solid, and genuine than this. We are the pearl and the treasure. This is the church life with the kingdom life in the Lord’s recovery. If we did not have the second group of parables, we would not know where we should be. I am happy to say that I am no longer in the first group—I am in the second. Can you say this? Are you <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> simply a believer who has a little of Christ? If this is your situation, then you must be a genuine Christian in Christendom. We thank the Lord that we are not in Christendom. Praise Him that many of us are the pearl and the treasure in the Lord’s recovery!</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn7fwbTx5z3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx">TAKING HEED HOW WE BUILD</h2><p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wM48ev-vlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> The parables of the pearl and the treasure match the verses which say, “Enter in through the narrow gate...for the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63262" data-verses="Matthew 7:13-14">7:13-14</span>). The wide gate and broad way lead to destruction. At this point we need to refer to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63263" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:1">1 Corinthians 3</span>, where Paul admonishes us to take heed how we build upon the foundation of Christ. Are we building with gold, silver, and precious stones, or with wood, hay, and stubble? Gold, silver, and precious stones are materials that can withstand the test of fire. But the wood, hay, and stubble will be consumed. In today’s Christianity there is a great deal of wood and dry grass, but there is very little gold. Among today’s Christians it is difficult to find the gold, pearl, and precious stones. These materials are not bulky, but small. Look at Christianity: wood, hay, and stubble are everywhere; but where is the gold, and where is the precious stone? The way of Christianity is the broad way, but the way of the Lord’s recovery is the constricted way. At times the enemy will attempt to lure us away from this constricted way into something that is outwardly big and bulky, something made of wood, hay, and stubble. However, in the New Jerusalem there will be nothing wooden, nothing that can be burned or consumed. Everything in the New Jerusalem will remain for eternity. Nothing can damage the gold, pearl, and precious stone. Our work and testimony must be like this.</p>
<p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLYjheVDDfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> I am burdened that we would all see that we are neither in Christendom nor on the broad way. We are in the Lord’s recovery. We are not in the first four parables, but in the fifth and sixth parables. In the Lord’s recovery the quantity is small, but the quality is higher and more solid, because here we have the treasure and the pearl. <span class="pg" data-page-id="501" id="501">[501]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0iw4MkjGM-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux">STAYING IN THE CONSTRICTED WAY</h2><p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GqSFFf9AsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> Although a great many works have been performed in Christianity, will all this work be approved by the Lord? Toward the end of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord said, “Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63264" data-verses="Matthew 7:22">7:22</span>). But the Lord Jesus will say, “I never knew you; depart from Me, workers of lawlessness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63265" data-verses="Matthew 7:23">7:23</span>). The Lord may say, “I never approved you; I never allowed you to do these things. In My eyes everything you did was lawless.” I do not believe that the works of Christianity will meet with the Lord’s approval. But what about us? We need to be strengthened to remain in the constricted way. None of us should want to stay in the first group of parables, but we should go on to be in the second group. Let others gain a huge number and carry out a great work. We prefer to stay in the pearl and in the treasure where we are constricted.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrvqaH_p55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> Because many Christians have been leavened, they have become large and bulky. But from the day we turned to the Lord’s recovery, we began to be constricted. We all can testify of this, especially those who were somewhat well-known in Christianity. Nothing in the Lord’s recovery has made us greater. Instead, many things have taken place to reduce us. Christ will constrict us to the point that we shall be small enough to be put in a little bottle. But in this bottle there will be a treasure. Because our way is the constricted way, the Lord’s recovery is His testimony. In today’s Christendom the Lord can find a great deal of wheat and a small amount of meal, even in the Catholic Church. But He cannot find much of the pearl and the treasure in Christendom.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovgYDxzhgRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> Although we are not proud, we realize that we in the Lord’s recovery are different. I am a sinful human being, worse in my nature than you are. But I can testify, and the Lord can also testify for me, that there are many things that I simply cannot do because I have a constricting life <span class="pg" data-page-id="502" id="502">[502]</span> within me. Day by day this life says “no” to certain things I want to do. This is the kingdom life mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63266" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Romans 14:17</span>. Because we are in the kingdom and under the reigning, we cannot do many of the things that other Christians are free to do. This is the treasure which is precious, valuable, and lovely in the eyes of the Lord. On the cross He sacrificed everything to buy both the pearl and the field in which the treasure is hidden. His buying the field and the pearl reveals that He is for the kingdom and the church. That we are in the Lord’s recovery is not the result of our doing. We are here because the Lord has brought us together to be His living testimony. I have no doubt that, in the eyes of the Lord, the treasure and the pearl are here in the recovery.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMkuOJFizAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> In the first four parables the Lord covers Christendom in a general way, and in the next two parables He covers His overcomers in a particular way. The seventh parable, the parable of the net, covers the nations. At the time of the Lord’s coming back there will be three peoples on earth: those in Christendom, those in the Lord’s recovery, and those among the nations. In the parable of the net the nations are likened to fish in the sea. These “fish” are brought to the presence of the Lord, and the Lord exercises His judgment upon them. This will mark the completion of the age at the Lord’s coming back. All this is covered by the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. We are neither in the first four parables nor in the seventh, but in the fifth and sixth. We are the treasure and the pearl. These parables of the treasure and the pearl are most precious. What a privilege it is to be the fulfillment of these parables!</p>

Because we stand in need of the Lord’s healing, He firstly unveiled Himself as our Physician, our Healer. After this, He unveiled Himself as the Bridegroom, the most pleasant person; as our Shepherd, the One who takes care of us; and as the Lord of God’s harvest. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63275" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> Christ unveiled Himself as the real David, the greater temple, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, and the greater <span class="pg" data-page-id="504" id="504">[504]</span> Solomon. If we put all these titles together—the Physician, the Bridegroom, the Shepherd, the Lord of the harvest, the real David, the greater temple, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, and the greater Solomon—we shall realize that Christ as the King of the heavens is so much to us.</p>

Furthermore, He is the new wine and even the new wineskin. Do you not desire to enjoy Christ as the new cloth and as the new garment? Do you not want to drink Him as the new wine and preserve your enjoyment in Him as the new wineskin? I certainly desire this.</p>

You are my Physician, my Healer. I believe that You will grant me a complete healing.” I have the assurance that we are all under His healing. Therefore, we are healthy and sound.

Hence, we may forget our needs because He is our Shepherd. Christ is the Lord of God’s harvest. He is also the real David, and we are His followers. In addition, He is the greater temple, and we are the priests serving, worshipping, and ministering within Him. We are not ministering in a religion; we are ministering in a Person who is the greater temple. Christ is also the Lord of the Sabbath, the Lord of rest. Thus, we have not only rest, but the Lord of rest. We do not need to seek for rest, for we have the Lord. Eventually, Christ is our greater Jonah and our greater Solomon.

At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63277" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, this rejection reached its climax. Christ was utterly rejected by that incurable generation of Jewish religionists. The rejection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63278" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> exposed the fact that the rejecting nature of that generation was incurable and, in a sense, unforgivable both in this age and in the age to come. Because the Jews rejected the heavenly King to such an extent, He forsook them. He forsook the natural, fleshly relationship with the Jews and denied His natural relationships with His kindred. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63279" data-verses="Matthew 12:1">chapter twelve</span> we see that the Jews firstly rejected the Lord and then that their rejection resulted in the King’s forsaking them.</p>

This signifies that He went into the church. In the church He unveiled the mystery of God’s kingdom. In other words, He revealed the mystery of the church, which is the life-pulse, the reality, of the kingdom. Because the mystery of the kingdom was delivered in parables, only those who loved Him, followed Him, and were one with Him could understand it. We have seen that the Lord decreed the constitution of the kingdom to the crowd on the mountain. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63281" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> He unveiled the mystery of the kingdom to His followers.</p>

Peter, Andrew, James, and John, and all of the other disciples knew that the Lord was the Physician, the Bridegroom, and the Shepherd. They realized so many aspects of what He was. Furthermore, they heard the mystery of the kingdom. Now they needed to know the way to follow Him. Therefore, what is revealed beginning at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63282" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> is the pathway to follow this rejected King.</p>

The record of Matthew is not according to historical facts; it is according to the sequence of doctrine. In his Gospel, Matthew presents the doctrine concerning the heavenly King and His genealogy, birth, youth, recommendation, anointing, testing, ministry, unveiling of Himself, and His unveiling of the mystery of the kingdom. After seeing all this, we may say, “How wonderful and marvelous! We know so many things about the King and the kingdom. What else do we need?” What we need is the way to follow Him. He is wonderful, and the kingdom is marvelous; but we need to know how we can get into this kingdom and follow Him.

This King has been rejected by this generation and is still being rejected by it. Nevertheless, we would follow Him as those preferring to participate in His rejection. Hallelujah, we are the partakers of the enjoyment of Him and partakers of His rejection! He is the rejected King, and we are His rejected followers. He took the lead to be rejected and He is still taking it, and we are following Him on the pathway to glory. At the beginning of this pathway, there is nothing but rejection; however, at the end of it there is glory, the manifestation of the kingdom.</p>

Instead, you must be willing to be rejected. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63287" data-verses="Matthew 13:53">13:53—14:13</span> we see the increase of rejection.

Knowing Him according to the Flesh<br/>and Blinded by Their Natural Knowledge</h2>
<p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2weKbE-QUEzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> The heavenly King was rejected firstly by the Jewish religionists. The religious leaders rejected Christ to the uttermost because they were fully occupied, possessed, and veiled by their religion. Because religion was everything to them, they could not recognize this heavenly King. Blinded by the religious veils, they rejected Him. After the Lord had been rejected in Jerusalem, the religious center, He turned to a geographical area that was not so religious—Galilee, the place where He was born and raised. Galilee was rather close to Gentile territory. However, He was not even welcomed in Galilee. Although the Galileans did not oppose Him, they rejected Him because of their natural knowledge. When they saw Him and heard Him speak, they said, “Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his <span class="pg" data-page-id="508" id="508">[508]</span> brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63288" data-verses="Matthew 13:55-56">13:55-56</span>). Here we see that the Galileans knew Him according to the flesh, not according to the spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63289" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:16">2 Cor. 5:16</span>). Thinking that they knew everything about Him, they were blinded by their natural knowledge. They saw the wonders, the miracles, He did, but they were preoccupied by their natural concepts. The religious people were preoccupied by their religion and by their religious concepts, and the Galileans were preoccupied by their natural knowledge.</p>
<p data-content-id="KJEWVtLfOnw9Yxg9_3P5GLvt8pfAanTep0fB8fNd2CrXG7zPGzDylZTVqAClKS52d"> If we would know Christ and follow Him, we need to realize that religion and natural knowledge are both veils. Some of our opposers belittle us by saying that we do not have theological training. But the Lord Jesus, a carpenter’s son, had no theological training Himself. Brother Nee, the one who helped me so much, much more than anyone else, had no theological training either. Religion and natural knowledge are two great obstacles frustrating people from recognizing who Christ is. If you follow religion, you will remain in Jerusalem, and if you follow your natural knowledge, you will be in Galilee. But Christ neither stays in Jerusalem nor remains in Galilee. As we shall see, He departs to the desert. Because Jerusalem was filled with religious concepts and Galilee was filled with natural knowledge, the Lord went to the desert. Are you in Jerusalem or Galilee, or are you in the desert? In the desert there is no religion, culture, or theological training. In Jerusalem there is religion and in Galilee there is natural knowledge, but in the desert there is the presence of Christ. Oh, in the desert we have Christ! This is our boast and enjoyment. We do not have religion or knowledge—we have Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19N_Y3CHgOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> Because we belittle knowledge, we have been condemned and accused of being mind benders. But our minds are not being bent—they are being renewed from natural and religious knowledge. We must be bold to declare that we are no longer religious or natural. Instead of <span class="pg" data-page-id="509" id="509">[509]</span> natural and religious knowledge, we have Christ as our wisdom, a wisdom that surpasses knowledge.</p>
<p data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HG1G9RLFvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp"> Any attempt to know Christ by natural knowledge will result in rejection. According to natural knowledge, Christ was the son of a carpenter and his mother was an ordinary woman. His countrymen knew all of His outward features, but they did not see that God was in Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63290" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:16">2 Corinthians 5:16</span> Paul says that, along with others, he knew Christ according to the flesh. When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he knew Christ according to the flesh; he thought that Jesus was merely a little Nazarene. He did not realize that within Jesus was God. But one day on the road to Damascus the Lord Jesus said to him, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” When Saul asked the Lord who He was, He responded, “I am Jesus.” On the road to Damascus Saul realized that Jesus of Nazareth was now in the heavens. Jesus seemed to be saying, “I was not only the flesh—I was God, for the very God was in Me. Saul, you knew Me according to the flesh, not according to the spirit within.”</p>
<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCg4StuRw2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> It is the same today. We need to know other Christians not according to outward things, not according to their country, language, parentage, education, or outward appearance or qualification. If we know Christians according to these things, we know them according to the flesh. But we should know Christians according to the spirit, because Christ is in them. Several months ago, one of the opposers was invited to my home for lunch. We spent more than three hours together. At one point he said, “You don’t have scholars among you, do you? We have more than a hundred scholars with us.” However, eventually we, who are not supposed to have scholars among us, printed articles in the newspaper that the opposers are not able to answer. They have been troubled by so many carpenter’s sons.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk7DuZeLa1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> As we follow the Lord in His recovery, we should not know people according to the flesh or estimate them according to the flesh. We should know them according to <span class="pg" data-page-id="510" id="510">[510]</span> one thing—according to the measure of Christ. Knowledge, intelligence, and outward appearance mean nothing. Perhaps a certain brother cannot speak well and uses poor grammar. Yet whenever he opens his mouth, Christ comes out. Even when you are sitting in his presence, you realize that some amount of Christ is with him. In the church life in the Lord’s recovery we do not care for the outward appearance; we care only for the spirit within, where Christ is. This is the way to know Christ, the way to know other Christians, and the way to follow the Lord.</p>

The unbelief of the Galileans caused the Lord not to do many works of power among them. Because of the Galileans’ natural knowledge, the Lord Christ could not do anything with them. The Galileans did not say, “Jesus, we don’t want You! Get away from here!” They simply asked, “Is this not the carpenter’s son? Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?” These questions were sufficient. The heavenly King could no longer remain there, and His gracious works of power could no longer be enjoyed by them. Therefore, He departed from them to the desert where there was no culture, no religion, and, as we shall now see, no politics.</p>

Following this came the rejection due to natural knowledge. The rejection by politics coincided with the rejection by religion and natural knowledge. The religionists, those with natural knowledge, and the politicians did not hold a conference for the purpose of rejecting the Lord Jesus. Nevertheless, their rejection of Him coincided. Religion, natural knowledge, and politics all came together in the rejection of Christ.</p>

Our eyes need to be opened to see that in religion there is no welcome to our heavenly King. Neither is there a place for Him in natural knowledge nor in today’s rotten, dark politics. In this generation there is no place for the heavenly King. Religion, culture, and politics are all one in rejecting the heavenly King. How I thank the Lord for the record in the Gospel of Matthew. If you read the chapters prior to fourteen, you will see the deceitfulness in the Jewish religion. You will also see that natural knowledge has caused great damage to people. Furthermore, you will see the rottenness and darkness in Roman politics, which was the leading political system on earth at the time.

The first station is the rejection by natural knowledge, and the second is the rejection by politics. The rejection both by culture and by politics compelled the heavenly King to retreat. When He heard of the execution of John the Baptist, “He departed from there in a boat to a desert place privately” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63299" data-verses="Matthew 14:13">14:13</span>). Due to the rejection by all the religious, cultured, political peoples, the heavenly King left them for a desert place. This indicates that henceforth He would hide Himself privately in a desert, in a place without culture, away from the religious, political, and cultured people. He did this in a boat, implying He would do this through the church. Due to the rejection of the civilized world, the Lord, through the church, has always been hiding Himself privately from the religious and political circles in a realm without much culture.</p>

They did this by leaving their cities. It was not that the King came to their cities to visit them, but that they left their cultured cities to follow Him in the desert. Through all the centuries, the true followers of Christ have left cultured spheres to follow their heavenly King outside the cultured world. We are among those who have followed Him. Where He is, we go. We follow Him through all manner of rejection to the desert.</p>

Don’t keep the crowd here. Send them away.” Was not this a good idea that proceeded out of a good heart? Today’s Peters all have good hearts. In the church life the good-hearted ones often make proposals. Do not be such a Peter. <span class="pg" data-page-id="514" id="514">[514]</span> </p>

Learning to Take Care of<br/>the Need of Others</h2><p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_4Z7HRsmhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> In reading the book of Matthew we need to take care of the doctrinal arrangement of the book. Many readers consider Matthew either a storybook or a history book. But it is not a history book; it is a book of doctrine. The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63303" data-verses="Matthew 14:16">verse 16</span>, therefore, is significant: “They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat.” The disciples asked the Lord to send the crowds away that they might go and buy food for themselves. But the Lord told the disciples to give the crowds something to eat. Their concept was to ask people to do something; this was the principle of the law. But the Lord’s concept is to give people something to enjoy; this is the principle of grace. What the disciples proposed was wholly based upon the principle of the law.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57ei2E3buTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63304" data-verses="Matthew 14:16">verse 16</span> the Lord Jesus stopped the disciples. The Gospels record a number of times that Peter was stopped. He was very experienced in this matter of being stopped in speaking. On the mountain, when he proposed building three tabernacles, he was stopped by God. When he told the man who collected the half-shekel tax for the temple that his Master paid the tax, he was stopped by the Lord. The Lord Jesus always stopped the good-hearted one. If you do not have such a good heart, the Lord will not stop you. But if you have a good heart, be prepared to be stopped by Him. Your good heart needs to be stopped because it is natural. The Lord Jesus stopped the disciples by saying, “You give them something to eat.” The Lord seemed to be saying, “Do not ask the crowd to do something in order to get something. That is law. You should give them something to eat. This is grace. I’m not here as Moses telling people to do something in order to get something. I am Jesus Christ. I came with grace. I always give people something. The law came through Moses, but grace came with Me. Therefore, you must give the crowd something to eat. You disciples are completely wrong, for you are still under the law, telling people to do certain things. <span class="pg" data-page-id="515" id="515">[515]</span> Are the people hungry? Certainly they are. I know this. I haven’t done anything up to this point in order to expose you. I waited for evening to come just so that you might be exposed. If I had done something about their need, you would never have been exposed.” Often in the Lord’s recovery such instances occur. The Lord has deliberately done certain things to exhaust the patience of the natural ones. However, the good-hearted ones cannot bear this. Often, minutes before the end, they make a proposal. If they had waited for another few minutes, their folly would not have been exposed. Nevertheless, we must learn to get away from the regulations and commandments of the law. Instead, we must learn to know grace, to exercise grace, and to give to others according to the principle of grace.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faFKiui4KZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> When the Lord Jesus told them to give the crowd something to eat, the disciples said, “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fishes” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63305" data-verses="Matthew 14:17">v. 17</span>). When you are about to exercise grace, you will see that you have nothing. If you simply issue commandments to others, you will not realize how poor you are. You may think that you are very smart and say to yourself, “How smart I am! No one else has noticed that evening has come. But I know everything. I can even instruct Jesus. In the Lord’s recovery I am the most intelligent one. I can tell others to do this and that. I know the time, I know the situation, I know what to say, I know what to do, I know everything. I even know how to command the Lord Jesus.” However, when we are told by the Lord to exercise grace, we shall say, “When I am under the law, I am blind and don’t know myself. Under the law, my poverty is not exposed. But now the Lord Jesus, speaking a word of grace, has told me to give them something to eat. This gracious word exposes my poverty. Immediately, I see that I have nothing. I have only a commanding mouth. I can give commands, I can instruct, and I can teach, but I have nothing to give.” The law does not expose us that much. But whenever we are about to exercise grace, our poverty is exposed. We see that we have nothing to give to others, even nothing to feed ourselves.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5irXa49Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> May the Lord be merciful to us! Do not think that this <span class="pg" data-page-id="516" id="516">[516]</span> is merely a story about the Lord Jesus feeding five thousand men plus women and children with five loaves and two fishes. You may be familiar with the story of this miracle, but you may still lack the revelation or the light it contains. But today we are under the Lord’s enlightenment. All of us are Peters. When we think that we know what to do and can tell others what to do, we are a Peter under the law. We are not one under grace. One who is under grace will always say, “Lord, I have nothing to give. There is a great need, but I cannot meet it. I realize that today is the day of grace, not the day of the law. Nevertheless, I have nothing to give. Grace exposes me.” Are you under the law or under grace? If you are under the law, you will still feel that you have something to boast of—your smart mind, your foresight, your knowledge, your ability to instruct others. But when the Lord puts you under grace, your poverty and nothingness will be exposed, and you will have to admit that you have nothing to give, even nothing with which to feed yourself. Here we see clearly the principle of the law and the principle of grace.</p>

Praise the Lord that we all can give ourselves to Him! We may have nothing but a poor, ugly self, but we can give our self to Him. Even a sick person can give himself to the Lord. Let us give whatever we are to Him. The Lord needs our consecration. If what we have is kept in our possession, it will be nothing. But if it passes out of our hands into the Lord’s hands, it will become a great blessing. Consecrate <span class="pg" data-page-id="517" id="517">[517]</span> yourself to the Lord.

<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0iw4skgFs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> We all must see the doctrine in this portion of the Word. The doctrine is that we must not be under the law, but under grace. Grace exposes our poverty and our nothingness. Yet we have something—ourselves—to give to the Lord.

By having the crowds recline on the grass, He put the people into good order. This shows the Lord’s wisdom and orderliness. By looking up to heaven the heavenly King indicated that His source was His Father in the heavens. Then He blessed the loaves and fishes and broke them. This indicates that whatever we bring to the Lord must be broken for it to become a blessing to others.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMkuuJEiTAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> The Lord will break whatever is consecrated to Him. This means that after we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we shall be broken by Him. However, many of us have prayed, “Lord, have mercy on me and do not break me. Lord, You know my wife is breaking me into pieces. Keep me whole, and save me from my wife’s breaking hand.” A number of sisters have also prayed to be saved from the breaking hand of their husbands. But the more you pray in this way, the more breaking there will be. We, however, are more like rubber than bread. It is easy to break bread, but difficult to break rubber. Therefore, with us, breaking is not enough. Sometimes the Lord also has to cut us. I am not <span class="pg" data-page-id="518" id="518">[518]</span> joking, for I know my own case. Nevertheless, whatever you are and whatever you have must be offered to the Lord. If you do this, in His hand nothing will remain whole. Rather, everything will be broken. The Lord will break whatever is placed into His hands. If we are not broken, our consecration does not mean anything, and it is not effectual. Our consecration only works by our being broken by the Lord.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqDiBFI5f5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> After the Lord broke the loaves, He gave them to the disciples. The loaves were from the disciples, and they brought them to the Lord. After being blessed and broken by the Lord, they were given back to the disciples for distribution to the crowds, to whom the loaves became a great satisfaction. This indicates that the disciples were not the source of blessing; they were only the channels used by the Lord, who was the source of the people’s satisfaction. The broken bread was passed on to the disciples, and the disciples distributed it to the crowds. This broken bread became the satisfaction to all the hungry people, and there was great blessing. The principle is the same today. No doubt there has been great blessing in the Lord’s recovery in this country. Nevertheless, we must realize that some dear ones have offered themselves to the Lord. In the Lord’s hand, they all have been broken, and those broken pieces have brought in the blessing.</p>

In figure, barley typifies the resurrected Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63310" data-verses="Leviticus 23:10">Lev. 23:10</span>). Thus, the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us. While the loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ’s life, the fishes are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ’s life. To satisfy our spiritual hunger, we need Christ’s generating life as well as His redeeming life. Both of these aspects are symbolized by small items—loaves and fishes. This indicates that the heavenly King did not come to His followers in this age to reign over them as a great King, but as small pieces of food to feed them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="519" id="519">[519]</span> </p>

The five loaves and two fishes satisfied about five thousand men, apart from women and children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63312" data-verses="Matthew 14:21">v. 21</span>). What we offer to the Lord may be very little; but the blessing will be great, and the overflow, the surplus, will be greater than what we offered. What we offer to the Lord cannot be exhausted. Rather, it will be used by the Lord to bless others abundantly, even with a surplus, to testify that this is the Lord’s marvelous doing. In this record of the miracle, the Holy Spirit’s intention in His inspiration is to show that the real need of the followers of the heavenly King is the proper food to satisfy their hunger. The disciples of Christ did not know this, nor did the crowds who followed. The heavenly King knew this and would do something miraculously to impress them with their real need and His provision for that need. All they needed was His resurrection life to satisfy their spiritual hunger, as signified in this miracle.</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM_WF8kIGElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> What the heavenly King did also clearly indicates that He provides for the necessities of His followers while they follow Him in this rejecting world. This corresponds with His word in the heavenly constitution that the kingdom people need not be anxious concerning what they shall eat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63313" data-verses="Matthew 6:31-33">6:31-33</span>).</p>

After these rejections, we shall be in want and have certain needs. But do not worry about your needs or be anxious concerning them, for the Lord takes care of them, even at the end of the day in a desert place. The Lord has a way to meet your need. Simply offer what you are and what you have into His hand, let Him break the offering, and let the broken offering feed the <span class="pg" data-page-id="520" id="520">[520]</span> hungry ones. If you do this, you will enjoy satisfaction, and there will be a surplus remaining.</p>

The miracle here indicates that as the rejected King, Christ has the adequate, sufficient, rich life supply for His followers. He not only takes care of our physical and material needs; He also affords the life supply to satisfy our hunger. Many of us can testify that after passing through rejection, we came into a situation where we had a shortage. Nevertheless, the Lord took care of us, and we did not lack anything. Eventually, we did not care about the material supply, but about the life supply to satisfy our spiritual hunger. As we follow the rejected King on the pathway to glory, we can testify that we are enjoying the life supply. Moreover, we are feeding others. And after such an enjoyment, there are still twelve baskets full of life supply.</p>

Therefore, we can say, “The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.” Not only are we without want—we are rich, we are satisfied, and we have twelve baskets full. With Him we have the material supply and the life supply. As we follow Him, even in the desert, we enjoy Him as our source of supply. Thus, we are not afraid of anything. Because He is with us, we shall not want. As long as we have His presence, everything is all right. We welcome the rejection and, in a sense, we even welcome the situation of being in want, for we have Him. Our need affords Him an excellent opportunity to do something for us.</p>

Humanly speaking, as we follow the rejected King on the pathway to glory, there is nothing good. It seems that everything is a problem. Do you like rejection? Do you enjoy lacking the things you need for your daily living? Do you appreciate the storm on the sea? If on our pathway there is no rejection, shortage of daily necessities, or storm, it is an indication that we are not actually on the pathway.

As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63320" data-verses="Matthew 14:23">verse 23</span> indicates, He went up into the mountain to pray. Before the Lord sent them away, the disciples participated in the enjoyment of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="522" id="522">[522]</span> Lord’s supply. The lack of necessities had issued in a very pleasant experience. The disciples were enjoying the Lord’s supply, and they were happy. If we had been there, we would certainly have been joyful. I believe that Peter talked a great deal about what the Lord had done. He might have said, “John, isn't this wonderful? Look what the Lord did with five loaves and two little fishes!” Then the Lord seemed to say, “Don’t talk. Step into a boat and go before Me to the other side. I realize you have been having an enjoyable time, but now you must go.” The disciples might have said, “Lord, will You go with us?” Then the Lord might have answered, “No, you go by yourselves. I am going to the mountain to pray.” Many times, immediately after a pleasant enjoyment of the Lord, He suddenly tells us to go to the sea. Then He leaves us. This is a portrait of today’s situation. The Lord has gone to the mountain, to the heavens. However, He has charged His church to go ahead on the sea, where there often are contrary winds and storms.</p>

When He compelled the disciples to step into the boat and to go before Him, He foresaw that a storm was coming. Nevertheless, He did not go with them. Rather, He went away to the mountain to pray. Today the Lord Jesus is on a mountain, that is, in the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63325" data-verses="Romans 8:34">Rom. 8:34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63326" data-verses="Hebrews 7:25">Heb. 7:25</span>), and the church is on the sea. Day by day we face the contrary winds. From the day we first came to Anaheim, the contrary winds have been blowing. We have not had one calm day. The church boat has constantly been distressed. However, this is our destiny. The fact that the Lord is in the heavens praying for us is a source of comfort and encouragement to us. We do not care how strong the contrary winds are, for we know that the Lord is on the mountain praying for us. The storm is not under the control of the opposition; it is under the Lord’s feet.</p>

Sometimes my wife is surprised that I am not troubled by the problems. I have many things to do, and it is my duty to take a good rest. Because our destiny is in the Lord’s hand, there is no reason for us to be afraid of anything. The contrary winds and the opposition are under His feet. The Lord is on a high mountain praying for us and interceding for us. He knows how strong the wind is. But He laughs at the wind and seems to say, “Little wind, you mean nothing to Me. What are you trying to do? You can’t do anything with My church. Those in the boat are My followers. In fact, they are just Me. Although I am here in the heavens, I am also with them.” What a marvelous picture this is of the high mountain, the troubling waves and contrary winds, and the little boat on the sea! The winds and the waves all work together for our good. Do you not believe that the opposition is working for our good? It certainly is. <span class="pg" data-page-id="524" id="524">[524]</span> In Anaheim we have seen how much good the opposition has accomplished for us.</p>

They accuse me of being too inward, of always telling you not to look to the heavens, but to look to Christ within you. The truth is we need to look in two directions. First, we must look to the Lord within us and say, “O Lord Jesus, are You happy with Your abode in me? Do You enjoy this place?” We all need to see that Christ is in us. In order to enjoy Him, we must know that He dwells within us. If He were far away, we could not enjoy Him. Second, in order to trust in the Lord, we must look to Him in the heavens where He sits with authority and intercedes for us. Soon He may be on His way to come to us. Hallelujah, He is both within us and in the heavens interceding for us! If we see this, we shall not be distressed, troubled, or bothered by any storm, for we shall have the assurance that the boat is His boat, that the church is His church. The sea cannot damage the boat. On the contrary, the sea serves the boat. As we shall see, the wind and the waves taught Peter a great deal.</p>

Only Peter was bold enough to do this. I doubt that any of us would have been as bold as Peter. It was a miracle that Peter could walk on the waters. He walked on the waves by faith. Faith is our action upon the word of the Lord. To have faith does not mean that we are able to do things; neither does it mean that we make up our mind to go in a certain direction. Faith simply means that, although we may be very weak, we dare to act upon the Lord’s word. The Lord said to Peter, “Come,” and Peter took that word, acted upon it, and walked on the waves. Do not examine whether or not you have faith. If you examine yourself, your faith will disappear immediately. Do not ask yourself, “Am I strong in faith? Is my faith adequate?” If you question yourself like this, you will immediately sink beneath the waves.</p>

He should have walked only by faith in the Lord’s word, not by the sight of the circumstances (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63337" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:7">2 Cor. 5:7</span>). When <span class="pg" data-page-id="526" id="526">[526]</span> Peter cried out for help, “Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63338" data-verses="Matthew 14:31">v. 31</span>). Since the Lord said to Peter, “Come” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63339" data-verses="Matthew 14:29">v. 29</span>), Peter should have stood on that word and not doubted. Hence, the Lord rebuked him. Faith comes from the Lord’s word and stands on the Lord’s word. As long as we have the Lord’s word, we should simply believe in His word and not doubt.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LTFbnA_faKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> Do not be troubled by any storms, for we are in the boat, the Lord’s church. Even if we cannot see the Lord or feel that He is with us, we may be assured that He is on the mountain interceding for us. Perhaps He is even on the way to the boat. Whether He is on the mountain interceding or on the waves walking toward us, we should not be disturbed. At times we may not only have peace inwardly, but even receive a word from Him to walk on the waves. When we receive such a word, we should simply walk on the stormy sea. Do not be bothered by the opposition and persecution. With the Lord’s word we may walk to meet Him, even walking through all the opposition and upon it. This is faith.</p>
<p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY_i_C9ZclV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> We should not blame Peter for having little faith. Among all the disciples in the boat, Peter was the first to enjoy the Lord’s presence. Some of us are too slow and too timid. Do not criticize others for being too quick. You need to be quick yourself sometimes. Which do you prefer—to be like Peter or to be like Thomas? Peter was bold, but Thomas was timid and cautious. In the churches there are many careful, cautious ones. But Peter was not cautious. As soon as he heard a word from the Lord, he stepped out of the boat and onto the water. However, the cautious ones may say, “But Peter had to cry out to the Lord to save him. There is no need for us to cry for help. We are safe here in the boat.” Yes, you are safe in the boat, but you are not in the Lord’s presence. You are not like Peter who was the first to get back into the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIs7dE4I85SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> Peter caused a great deal of trouble.

The timid ones do not cause trouble, but neither do they bring in the presence of the Lord. With the cautious ones, nothing seems to happen. Year after year goes by, and everything remains calm. But those who are like Peter are always stirring things up. They may cause trouble, but they are rescued by the Lord and thereby are brought into His presence. Some of you cautious ones need to stir up a little trouble, then cry out to the Lord to be saved, and get into His presence. Who do you think enjoys the Lord more—the cautious ones or the quick ones? The answer certainly is the quick ones. Nevertheless, the timid ones may say, “Let us sleep. Sooner or later, the Lord Jesus will come. We don’t need to jump in the water, cause trouble, and then cry out for rescue. We don’t need to be so quick to get into the presence of the Lord. If we take it easy and be calm, the Lord will come.” In one sense, the cautious ones are right and those like Peter are wrong. But the bold ones have more enjoyment of the Lord than the timid ones. Eventually, however, the Lord’s presence is not just with Peter, but with all the disciples in the boat.</p>

When we have the Lord in our boat, the wind ceases. The record of the two miracles in this chapter implies that while Christ was rejected by the religious and political peoples, He and His followers were in the barren desert and on the stormy sea. Nonetheless, He is able to provide for their need and to carry them through hardships.</p>

Some of us are like Peter and others are like Thomas. Some are quick and bold, always causing trouble and making mistakes; others are timid, cautious, and sleepy. The timid ones may murmur against the bold ones, “Brother So-and-So is too quick. I don’t agree with that. He is utterly wrong. But I am slow and cautious.” I am very clear about the situation in the churches regarding the quick ones and the cautious ones. I know those who are bold and who cause trouble and those who are cautious and never cause problems. I appreciate all the cautious ones; however, I do not agree with them. Because they are so cautious, they never stir up anyone or anything. People need to be stirred up to walk on the waves so that they may get into the presence of the Lord. Those who do this will bring the Lord to the boat. No cautious one, timid one, slow one, or careful one has ever brought the Lord Jesus to the boat. In the case of the cautious ones, the Lord must come to the boat on His own. If He does this, He will find the cautious ones sleeping. No one will be waiting for Him. After waking from their slumber, the cautious ones will say, “Lord, You are here. This is rather good. Praise the Lord for this! Now it is time to go back to sleep.” Those who are slow and careful never cause any trouble or problems. We need to be quick and bold. However, in being quick and bold to step out of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="529" id="529">[529]</span> boat and walk on the sea, we must take care of four things: first, that we act upon the word of the Lord, not without hearing a word from Him; second, that our direction is toward the Lord Himself; third, that we get into the Lord’s presence; and fourth, that we come back to the boat. If we take care of these four things, we shall be right, even if we appear to be wrong.</p>

THE POWER OF HEALING</h2><p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEFtHps6irHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> After Jesus and the disciples came to Gennesaret, the people of that place brought to the Lord all who were ill. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63346" data-verses="Matthew 14:36">Verse 36</span> says, “And they besought Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment; and as many as touched were made thoroughly well” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63347" data-verses="Matthew 14:36">v. 36</span>). The healing power went out, not from the inner being of Christ, but from the fringe of His garment. The Lord’s garment signifies Christ’s righteous deeds, and the fringe signifies the heavenly ruling (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63348" data-verses="Numbers 15:38-39">Num. 15:38-39</span>). Out of Christ’s heavenly-ruled deeds is the virtue that becomes the healing power. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63349" data-verses="Numbers 15:1">Numbers 15</span>, the fringe of the garment signifies the virtue of God’s people who walk according to His regulations. The fringe was made with a blue ribbon. This revealed that their daily walk was regulated by God’s heavenly rule as indicated by the color blue, a heavenly color. When Jesus was on earth as a man, He walked in this way. His daily walk was regulated by God’s heavenly commandments. Therefore, there was with Him a virtue that could flow out to heal others.</p>
<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMmtYrupqCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> The healing that takes place in the church life does not mainly issue from the inner being of the Lord Jesus. Rather, it primarily issues from the virtue of the Lord’s human life. In the church life we experience the Lord’s presence with us on the sea in the midst of the contrary winds. His presence prepares the way for His virtue to flow out to reach the sick people and to heal them. This type of healing is different from the miraculous healing by divine power. The garment of Jesus does not signify His divinity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="530" id="530">[530]</span> Rather, it signifies the righteous deeds of His humanity. His humanity bore the mark of the blue ribbon, of being regulated by the heavenly ruling. This produced a virtue that was capable of healing the sick. This kind of virtue can be expressed only through the proper church life where Jesus is present.</p>
<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz6EIcKKxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63350" data-verses="Revelation 22:2">Revelation 22:2</span> says that the leaves of the tree of life are for the healing of the nations. In typology, the fruit of the tree of life represents the Lord’s divine life, and the leaves represent the Lord’s human deeds. The fruit, the Lord’s divine life, is for nourishing us, and the leaves, the Lord’s human deeds, are for the healing of others. In the new heaven and the new earth the leaves of the tree of life will be for the healing of the nations, that is, the virtue of Christ’s humanity will heal the people. In Matthew, after the boat reached its destination, the virtue of the Lord’s human deeds became so prevailing that every manner of sickness was healed. Likewise when we have the proper church life with the Lord’s presence today, there is among us the uplifted humanity of Jesus. This uplifted humanity has the virtue signified by the fringe of Christ’s garment. If we, the church people, have the proper church life and live by Christ, we shall live out His uplifted humanity. In this kind of living there will be a virtue with the power to heal those around us.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxClVmKeKa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> In typology, the land visited by the Lord after the boat came to shore was a figure of the millennium. In the millennium there will be a great deal of healing. Nevertheless, the healing to be found in the millennium should be experienced today. The church people should have a foretaste of the millennium. We must live out the uplifted humanity of Jesus to have the virtue that can heal those surrounding us. For others to be healed means that their corrupted character is changed. Those around the church life are all in darkness and corruption. But if the church people live out the uplifted humanity of Christ, this will cause a healing power to flow into them. Even other Christians will be healed.</p>

For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.” Although the Lord had forsaken the rejecting religionists, they still would not cease to trouble Him. They came to Him from their religious center, Jerusalem, in order to discover His faults. However, their troubling afforded Him another opportunity to reveal the truth about how to be really clean (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63353" data-verses="Matthew 15:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63354" data-verses="Matthew 15:15-20">15-20</span>). The Pharisees and scribes asked the Lord Jesus why His disciples transgressed the tradition of the elders. This reveals that the disciples did not keep the old traditions in following the Lord. They cared only for the heavenly King’s presence, not for anything else.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFEAVm-p3NHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> The elders spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63355" data-verses="Matthew 15:2">verse 2</span> were not the elders of the people, but the people of ancient times, those of bygone generations. In the past, some of those who claimed to be for God had certain practices, and their practices eventually became the traditions that were observed by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="532" id="532">[532]</span> Jews when the Lord Jesus was on earth. For example, certain of the ancients adopted the regulation of washing their hands whenever they ate. At the time of the Lord Jesus, this was a tradition. However, it was not a commandment in the Bible. Nothing commanded by God could ever become a tradition, for God’s word is always fresh. A tradition, on the contrary, is something invented or initiated by man.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0iw5MkgHs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> Some of the opposers have said that we should return to the so-called historic church and follow the traditional practices. Recently, a group of so-called fundamental Christians even published an article appealing to Christians to return to the historic church. But the historic church has adopted many regulations that are absolutely unscriptural, and it has made many decisions regarding things not found in the Bible. Consider, for example, the worship of Mary, which was sanctioned by the Council of Ephesus. There are more traditions in Christendom today than in Judaism when the Lord Jesus was on earth. Traditions are very prevailing in Christendom today. The traditional celebration of Christmas is an example. One of our critics has said that the origin of Christmas is not pagan. He even denied the fact that the Christmas tree is pagan. The Christmas tree is pagan, evil, and idolatrous. There can be no reconciliation between the Lord’s living testimony and the traditional church. We are opposed because we, as the disciples following the Lord today, would not keep such traditions.</p>

They ignored God’s commandment by caring for their tradition. In principle, the religious people today do the same. In many ways both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations make void the word of God because of their traditions.</p>

God in His government among men has ordained that man should honor his parents. Among the ten commandments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63358" data-verses="Exodus 20:12">Exo. 20:12</span>), He has made this the first commandment concerning human relationships. Fallen human nature, however, always attempts to ignore the parents, that is, to rebel against God’s government. The Lord as the heavenly King, in order to bring man back to God’s government, emphasized that man should honor his parents. This corresponds to His word in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens concerning the fulfillment of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63359" data-verses="Matthew 5:17-19">5:17-19</span>). Hence, the Apostle also emphasized this matter strongly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63360" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1-3">Eph. 6:1-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63361" data-verses="Colossians 3:20">Col. 3:20</span>). We the kingdom people must honor our parents and not excuse ourselves as the Jewish religionists did. Any excuse indicates that we are not under the heavenly ruling, but that we are following our fallen human nature and the rebellious trend of today’s generation. </p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqDjhFL4_5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> In the Lord Jesus’ encounter with the Pharisees, the Lord did not care for the traditions. On the contrary, He referred them to the word of God. In principle, we are doing the same today. Men are still making void God’s word by means of their tradition, and we are being accused today of not keeping the traditions. Recently, one of our opposers twisted <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63362" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>, a verse that speaks of the three parts of man—the spirit and soul and body. He said that in this verse the Greek word translated “and” could <span class="pg" data-page-id="534" id="534">[534]</span> also be rendered “even.” But if we use “even” for the Greek conjunction in this verse, the spirit, soul, and body would equal one another. This is like a doctor saying that a person’s legs are the same as his stomach and the stomach as the heart. What medical quackery that would be! In Christendom many still insist on the traditions, and in the so-called churches these traditions are very prevailing. But the Lord has raised us up to come back to the pure Word. We do not care for man’s tradition, teaching, or practice. This has offended some, and we have been accused of damaging the “church.” But the “church” we are accused of damaging is not actually the church; rather, it is the traditional church, the denominations, the sects.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-gUEzzwqgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> Praise the Lord for the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63363" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">Matthew 15</span>! All the aspects of this record coincide with our situation today. The Lord Jesus and His followers were accused by the traditionalists, and today we are accused by the religionists. In answering those who accused His disciples, the Lord seemed to say, “You Pharisees accuse My disciples of breaking your traditions. You need to see that you have broken God’s commandment by holding to your tradition, and you continue to break it.” In this way the Lord brought them back to the pure Word, telling them what was the commandment of God and what was man’s tradition. It is the same today. We are accused of not following the historic church, that is, of not following the traditions. We answer that we must come back to the pure Word and not care for the traditions of the historic church. In the various councils and creeds of the historic church, there is no mention of the seven Spirits. This means that if we follow the traditional concept of the Trinity, we shall neglect the seven Spirits. Our critics say, “You don’t honor the ancient councils which formulated the creeds regarding the Trinity.” We respond, “We don’t follow the creeds. They are man’s teaching and tradition. Instead, we come back to the pure Word. In the Bible we find something more than what is included in the creeds, for the Bible speaks of the seven Spirits. Can you find a word about the seven Spirits <span class="pg" data-page-id="535" id="535">[535]</span> in your creed?” This is merely one illustration of the gap between the Lord’s recovery and traditional Christianity. This gap exists because the recovery is based wholly upon the pure Word, whereas Christianity is filled with traditions.</p>

Honoring God with the Lips,<br/>but the Heart Being Away from Him</h2><p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85ww3R2Yn0Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63364" data-verses="Matthew 15:7-8">verses 7 and 8</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Hypocrites! Isaiah has well prophesied concerning you, saying, This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me.” The heavenly ruling of the kingdom requires inward reality, not mere outward practice, in that it deals with the real condition of the heart, not the expression of the lips. The tradition of the Pharisees was outward, but the Lord’s concern was for something inward. Some in today’s religion oppose us because they are for the outward things. They do not know the inner life or the subjective truths. Some claim that because Christ is in the heavens, He cannot actually dwell in us but He is merely represented in us by the Holy Spirit. This indicates that they do not have the subjective Christ; they have only the objective Christ. But we in the Lord’s recovery have both the objective Christ and the subjective Christ. Those who teach that Christ is merely represented in us do so because they believe that in the Godhead the Father, Son, and Spirit are three separate individuals. Because the Son is in the heavens, they insist that it is impossible for Him to be in us. Those who argue this way are in practice tritheists. They believe in the one-in-three, but not in the three-in-one. However, in the Bible there is not a hint to indicate that the three in the Godhead are separate. On the contrary, the Lord Jesus said to Philip, “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63365" data-verses="John 14:10">John 14:10</span>). In the same verse the Lord continued by saying, “The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works.” This verse reveals that when the Son speaks, the Father works. <span class="pg" data-page-id="536" id="536">[536]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63369" data-verses="John 15:26">John 15:26</span> the Lord says that He will send the Spirit from <em>with</em> the Father. According to the human concept, the Spirit is sent from the Father, and the Father remains in the heavens. However, the Spirit of reality is sent by the Son, not only from the Father, but also with the Father. The Comforter comes from the Father and with the Father. The Father is the source. When the Spirit comes from the source, it does not mean He leaves the source, but that the source comes with Him. This Spirit, sent by the Son and coming with the Father, will testify concerning the Son. The three of the Godhead are three-in-one. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three separate Gods, but the one unique God. This is the correct understanding of the Triune God according to the pure Word of God. However, those who hold the traditional concept of the Trinity in actuality have three Gods.</p>

How can they experience Him subjectively if they do not believe that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit? Because they lack the subjective experience of Christ, they accuse us of being heretical. Furthermore, they deny the fact, revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63370" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>, that the believers are partakers of the divine nature. They teach that in this verse the phrase “divine nature” does not mean divine nature, but divine virtue. They also claim that to have the divine nature is to become God Himself. Furthermore, they accuse us of teaching evolution into God. Yes, we do say that we have the divine nature, because we have been born of our God. How ridiculous to say that a son does not have the nature of his <span class="pg" data-page-id="537" id="537">[537]</span> father! Because we have been born of the divine Father, we certainly have His life with His nature. But this does not mean that we become or are becoming God Himself. According to the pure Word, we also say that the church today is the manifestation of God in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63371" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15-16">1 Tim. 3:15-16</span>). Because we say this according to the Bible, we are again accused of making ourselves God and of teaching evolution into God. We are actually accused of making the church the fourth member of the Godhead! How evil is this charge!</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfO02ITqbbftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> In October, 1977, an international conference was held in Taipei. From January of that year I began to seek the Lord concerning the subject on which I should speak during that conference. By the first of October, I still had no idea what the subject would be. When asked about it, I could only say, “I don’t know.” But on October 2, 1977, a speech against us was delivered before a large congregation. Many of our brothers and sisters attended that meeting and gave us a report concerning it. Upon hearing their report, I immediately realized that I should speak on the subjective experiences of Christ. I realized that those opposing us do not know anything about the subjective experience of Christ. They care only for objective knowledge and doctrine of the Bible, of Christ, and of the church. Thus, I was burdened to tell all the churches represented in the conference that we need to experience Christ in a subjective way.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EBX39VnECzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> The problem between the Pharisees and the Lord Jesus and His followers was that the Pharisees cared only for outward tradition, ritual, and practice, for example, the washing of hands. They cared nothing whatever for inward reality. Therefore, the Lord Jesus pointed them to the inward matter of the heart. The Lord seemed to say, “Don’t care for this outward practice of washing of hands. The dirt that needs to be cleansed away is within you.” In the Lord’s recovery today we likewise do not care for outward things; rather, we care for inward reality.</p>
<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhnmjpOSQ69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> In 1968 many saints in Los Angeles were stirred up to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="538" id="538">[538]</span> buried in the water. As a result, a number of opposers condemned me for teaching rebaptism. However, I did not teach this. But I was happy to see the saints who felt they were old bury themselves in the water. Certainly this is much better than attending a casino. Certain Christians in Hong Kong played Mah-Jongg, and the pastors did not condemn it. However, when some leaped into the water to bury themselves, the pastors said that this was heretical. Today many of those who were buried in the water are very much with the Lord. The Lord cares for inward reality, not for the outward practice. To those who criticized the ones who were baptized again, I said, “The children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, which is clearly a type of baptism (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63372" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:1">1 Cor. 10:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63373" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:2">2</span>). But later they crossed the Jordan River. Was that not a burial? The children of Israel had to pass the River Jordan because they had become old. If, after they passed through the Red Sea, they had been faithful to the Lord and had entered into the good land, there would have been no need to cross the Jordan. But because of their unbelief and their years of wandering in the wilderness, they became old. Hence, they needed to bury the oldness and to be renewed by passing through the River Jordan. Twelve stones were buried in the river to represent the old Israel, and twelve stones were brought out of the river and set on the land to represent the renewed Israel. Yes, you were baptized years ago, but since that time you have been wandering in the wilderness. You need to be buried and renewed.” The Lord does not care for outward rituals or regulations; He cares only for inward reality.</p>
<p data-content-id="Xrfm_0_wHtlK1HVoKjia9yMO5WMNx9Cw0kdxF7iwt4aGYrrICB0YkaHGfAxzlMrpi"> Because the Lord cares for inward reality, we are not concerned about the outward way of having our meetings. It means very little whether the meeting is loud or quiet. We care only for the inward experience of Christ, for inward reality. It is an insignificant matter whether our hands are dirty; it is the condition of our inward parts that is important.</p>

The outward practice of the traditions seemingly is for God. Actually, however, the inward being of so many who follow the traditions is not for God. Do you believe the majority of Christians observe Christmas for God? Apparently they may be; actually, in the practice of Christmas, the heart of many is not for the Lord. They have the appearance, but not the reality. They have an outward professing lip, but their heart is away from the Lord. In the Lord’s recovery we are not talking without inward reality. If we speak without reality, we are more than pitiful. Tradition is a matter of utterance from the lips without reality in the heart.</p>

The main cause of this is the teaching of the commandments of men. We must worship God according to His word, which is the truth. Many of those who condemn our meetings for being too noisy have no heart for God. Again I say, in the eyes of God it is not a matter of the outward appearance, but a matter of the inward reality, not a matter of what we say, but a matter of what we are. Consider the so-called Christian services in which solos are sung by beautiful young ladies in short skirts. Where is the heart of many who are listening to them? It may be in fornication. Why are not these solos sung by old ladies instead of by attractive young women? Is this the worship of God? No, it is an abomination to our holy God! But our noise is not an abomination to Him. Let us make a joyful noise to the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63376" data-verses="Psalms 100:1">Psa. 100:1</span>) from the spirit. We like to shout, “Praise the Lord! Amen!

Their blindness led them to fall into a pit.</p>

I appeal to your <span class="pg" data-page-id="541" id="541">[541]</span> conscience and ask this question: Can you deny that there is some amount of reality in the Lord’s recovery? In the recovery genuine help has been rendered to assist you to experience Christ in a subjective way and to enjoy Him. I think that you all can say from your conscience that never before and in no other place were you helped so much to enjoy Christ. Nevertheless, a number are opposing us. But they have missed the blessing and enjoyment. As the Lord Jesus said, these blind leaders have not been planted by the Father. Rather, they are self-assuming ones, not God-planted ones.

<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEFtnpqoyrHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> As we have pointed out many times, the Gospel of Matthew is not a book of history, but a book of doctrine. Matthew puts together certain historical facts for the purpose of revealing a doctrine. If you compare the four Gospels, you will see that Matthew presents the facts of history in an order different from that found in Mark or John. Mark and John were written according to the sequence of history. The arrangement of the facts in Matthew’s record, however, is not according to history, but according to doctrine, because Matthew presents to us the doctrine concerning the kingdom. Thus, Matthew does not care for historical sequence; he cares for doctrinal sequence.</p>
<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMmt4rr6KCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63380" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, immediately after the dispute regarding the washing of hands, there is a record of feeding on Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63381" data-verses="Matthew 15:21-28">15:21-28</span>). Perhaps in your reading of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63382" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> you have not found the way to connect <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63383" data-verses="Matthew 15:1-20">verses 1 through 20</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63384" data-verses="Matthew 15:21-28">verses 21 through 28</span>. But these two sections go together. In the original text of the Bible, there were no paragraphs or verses. Thus, the second section was the immediate continuation of the first section. Matthew had a definite reason for putting these two sections together. His purpose was to show that what the Lord wants is not the washing of hands, but the eating of Him, the taking in of Him as food. He does not want us to wash outwardly; He wants us to eat, to take Him in. No matter how many times we may wash our hands, we shall still be hungry. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63385" data-verses="Matthew 15:21-28">15:21-28</span> we do not have washing; we see a dirty <span class="pg" data-page-id="544" id="544">[544]</span> dog eating. The Lord does not care about the washing of hands. Whether you are outwardly dirty or not does not mean anything to Him. What truly matters to the Lord is that your hunger is satisfied. The Lord Jesus did not say to the Canaanite woman, “Yes, you have the right to eat of Me, but you are dirty. Wash yourself first and then come back to eat.” No, the outward washing is in the foregoing section, not in this section. Here we see the matter of eating. In this chapter we see that what matters to the Lord is not outward practices, but the inward condition. We should not outwardly wash away the dirt; rather, we need to be cleansed from within.</p>
<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz6EocOZBMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> The question is how we can be inwardly cleansed. In order to be cleansed from within, something must get into us, and the only way this can take place is by eating. As the nourishing food, the Lord Jesus is the best cleansing element. When He comes into us as food, He not only nourishes us, but also inwardly cleanses us. He does not wash our hands; He washes our system, our very being. This matter of inward cleansing through the eating of Jesus is the link that joins the first two sections of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63386" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxClVGKVZa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> In today’s religion what is taught is mostly like the washing of hands. On Sunday after Sunday, sermons are given mainly on the outward washing. However, what people need is not the outward washing, but the inward cleansing, the cleansing in life and nature. They need a cleansing element that can get into their system, even into their vessels. They do not need the outward washing of hands, but the inward washing that comes from the proper eating. Jesus is not only the nourishing food; He is also the cleansing element. I can testify that day by day the Lord Jesus is getting into me to cleanse me from within. He is washing my inner being. In the church life we are not being washed outwardly; on the contrary, we are being cleansed and purified inwardly.</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkQ-zE2i2iT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> Many of the saints are willing to be purified from within. Often they pray, “Lord Jesus, come into me. I want <span class="pg" data-page-id="545" id="545">[545]</span> to be purified more and more. Lord, I hate not only sin and the world, but also myself, my natural life, and my natural disposition. O Lord, I am so contaminated by my disposition. How I long to be cleansed from this defilement!” As we pray in this way, we spontaneously eat the Lord Jesus, and He comes into us both as the nourishing food and as the cleansing element. Deep within our conscience we can testify that, as we enjoy the Lord in the church life, we are purified, even when we do not have the intention of being purified. As long as we are enjoying the Lord, we are being purified from within. Therefore, what we have is not the washing of hands, but the cleansing of our being. In these days we have been falsely accused of brainwashing. However, we do not practice brainwashing, but we do experience the washing of our disposition. Not only our mind, but our entire being, needs to be cleansed. The Lord can testify for me that very often I pray, “Lord, I am still dirty. Lord, I sense that I am still so natural and so much in my disposition. Lord, I love You and I want to live by You. But even today, Lord, I have been in my natural disposition. O Lord, because I am dispositionally dirty, I need Your cleansing.” This is the kind of cleansing we need. This is not a matter of outward washing of hands to make a display of how clean we are. It is a matter of the inward cleansing that comes from eating Jesus. We all need such an inward cleansing from the Lord.</p>

The Canaanite woman addressed the Lord Jesus as the Lord, the Son of David. The title Lord implies Christ’s divinity, and the title, Son of David, His humanity. As a Gentile woman, it was proper for her to address Christ as the Lord. However, she had no right to call Him Son of David; only the children of Israel were privileged to do so.</p>
<p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY_ifC-Z8lV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> The disciples were troubled by the crying out of the Canaanite woman, and they asked the Lord to send her away. This indicates that once again they were instructing the Lord, telling Him to do something. This also was the principle of the law. The disciples seemed to be saying, “Lord, she is crying out and troubling us. Can’t you do something, Lord? Please send her away.” At this point the Lord said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63392" data-verses="Matthew 15:24">v. 24</span>). If you read the Gospels carefully, you will see that the Lord Jesus never took a word from His disciples. When they made a proposal, the Lord always refused to consider it. But whenever the disciples did not want to do a particular thing, the Lord would tell them to do it. Likewise, when we want to do something, the Lord says no. But when we do not want to do anything, the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="547" id="547">[547]</span> says go. The purpose of this is to train us not to live and act according to the self or our natural concept. Peter could have said to the Lord, “Lord, if You have come to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, what are You doing here in Tyre and Sidon? Why have You come here?” But if Peter had said this to the Lord, the Lord still would have had a way to subdue him. No one can defeat the Lord Jesus. The disciples lost the case, and their mouths were shut.</p>

Here another opportunity was created for Him to reveal Himself as the children’s bread. The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord, a divine Person, and the Son of David, a royal descendant, great and high to reign. But He unveiled Himself to her as small pieces of bread, good for food. This <span class="pg" data-page-id="548" id="548">[548]</span> implies that, as the heavenly King, He rules over His people by feeding them with Himself as bread.

Certainly the Lord foreknew that He had to feed this woman. Why then did He not do it immediately? Although the woman came and cried to Him, He remained silent at first, saying nothing. It almost appeared as if He were dumb. His dumbness caused the disciples to implore Him to do something for her and to send her away. The reason the Lord Jesus did not do something right away was that He wanted to take this opportunity to teach His disciples. When the disciples came to Him, He said that He had come only for the lost sheep of the house of Israel. When the woman came to Him, He indicated to her that He had come as bread for the children and that it was not lawful to cast the children’s bread to the dogs.</p>

The Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord’s word, but rather admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became crumbs under the table as a portion to the Gentiles. The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, came as a <span class="pg" data-page-id="549" id="549">[549]</span> portion to the children of Israel. But they threw Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile country, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles. What a realization this Gentile woman had at that time! No wonder the heavenly King admired her faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63402" data-verses="Matthew 15:28">v. 28</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMmt4rvpKCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> The Gentile woman seemed to be saying, “Yes, Lord, I am a dirty, pagan dog. But don’t forget, Lord, that even dogs have their portion. The dog’s portion is not on the table like the children’s portion. The children’s portion is on the table, but the dog’s portion is under the table. Now, Lord, You are not on the table, in the land of Israel. You are under the table, in the Gentile world. You are in the very place where I am. You are not on the table where the children are. You are now under the table where the dogs are. Lord, the dogs may eat the crumbs that are under the table.” The Canaanite woman was keen, and the Lord Jesus was caught by her.</p>

<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkQ-zE9yGiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> Because I am very careful in doctrinal matters, I have wondered why the Lord Jesus did not tell the Canaanite woman to wash herself and then come back and eat. If I had been the Lord, I would have said, “Yes, as a dog, you have your portion. But don’t you realize how dirty you are? If you would eat Me as the crumbs, you need to wash yourself.” According to doctrine, this woman definitely needed to be washed. But why did the Lord Jesus not ask her to wash herself before eating of Him? If the Lord had done this, He would have been acting contrary to what He had said in the foregoing verses when He belittled the matter of outward washing. Here the Lord is emphasizing the matter of eating. But this does not mean that we do not <span class="pg" data-page-id="550" id="550">[550]</span> need to be washed. The blood is available. We may strike the blood and eat the Lamb. But in order not to confuse matters, in this section on eating, the Lord Jesus said nothing about washing. I believe that the Lord Jesus did this purposely to show His disciples that they needed only one thing—the eating. Even if we are as dirty as pagan dogs, we still have the right and the position to eat Jesus. Oh, we need to be uninhibited eaters! Do not wait until you have washed. Come to the Lord just as you are and eat of Him. As the words of a hymn say, “Just as I am, I come.” We need to say, “Lord, I come just as I am. I don’t need to change or to be cleansed. Lord, I need You, and I come to You to eat. Even if I am a dirty dog, I come to You just as I am.” Eating is primary, and eating is everything.</p>

But the Lord turned the situation to the matter of eating. The Lord did not say, “I came as a Physician to the children of Israel, and I cannot heal any heathen. I cannot cure dogs.” Rather, the Lord seemed to be saying, “I came as bread to the children. It is not right to throw the children’s bread to the dogs.” Although the woman’s request had nothing to do with eating, the Lord purposely related her case to the matter of eating to show us that what we need is not outward washing, but eating for the inward nourishing. In his doctrinal arrangement Matthew put these matters together that we might understand that for the kingdom of the heavens we do not need outward cleansing, but what we need is for Christ to get into us. Are you sick or weak? Do you have certain problems? Do not try to deal with these things in an outward way. Instead, deal with them in an inward way by eating Jesus. In fact, you should forget about all those things. What you need is not outward washing, but Christ coming into you. The Lord seemed to be saying to the Canaanite woman, “You don’t need healing. You need Me! And you do not need Me outwardly; you need Me inwardly. You need to eat Me. I came as bread for people to eat, to digest, and to <span class="pg" data-page-id="551" id="551">[551]</span> assimilate. I would like to get into your being, into your system, vessels, and fibers. I would like to get into your very constituent and become you. Thus, you need to eat Me. Don’t deal with things in an outward way. Rather, deal with everything in an inward way by taking Me into you. As long as I can get into you to nourish you, every problem will be solved.”</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_4YrHTsmhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> We do not need outward rituals or practices. In today’s religion people are following outward practices. But God’s economy is not a matter of outward things; it is a matter of Christ coming into us inwardly. For this, we need to take Christ in by eating Him.</p>

Before you came into the church, you never heard a word about eating Jesus, for all the teachings in religion are concerned with the outward washing of hands, not with presenting the edible Jesus to people. But this ministry has come here with the commission to minister the edible Jesus to His believers. I do not care for the opposition and the attack. I know what I am doing. Thinking that I am too bold, some may say, “Why is this man so bold? Don’t we have many scholars in this country, men with doctoral degrees from the best seminaries?” I do not care about those degrees. I care only for my burden. I have the strong assurance that I have something of the Lord from the heavens that is not found in today’s religion. I am not here teaching or preaching—I am ministering the edible Christ. This is what the Lord’s people need today. You do not need religious washings. Forget about such things! As dirty dogs, we need the eating of Jesus. We need to take Jesus in. Hallelujah, today Jesus is not on the table! He is under the table. He has been cast off the table by the Israelites, and now He is in the Gentile world. All of us, including me, are dirty, pagan dogs. Nevertheless, we can praise the Lord that we are dogs, because the very bread of life from the heavens is now where the dogs are. If the bread were on the table, it would not be available to us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="552" id="552">[552]</span> But today the bread is under the table where the dogs are. We need the edible Christ who is now so near to us.</p>

According to the doctrinal arrangement of the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63406" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, healing comes after eating. In other words, the proper healing comes from inward eating. Dieticians say that if one eats properly, he will not have illness. Illness comes from improper eating, but healing comes from adequate, proper eating. This is the doctrinal point regarding healing in this portion of the Word.</p>

However, if you read these two sections carefully, you will see that the purpose of each is different. The purpose of the section about the feeding of the five thousand is to show us that as we are following our rejected King on the pathway to glory, He is able to take care of us. But the purpose of the record of the feeding of the four thousand is to show that we should not simply eat Jesus as crumbs individually as dirty dogs. We also need to eat Him in a corporate way together with many others. Let us all eat Him together. In this corporate eating we do not eat the crumbs, but the whole bread, and a surplus remains. Today in the church life we are no longer dirty dogs eating. Rather, we are proper men eating Him in a corporate way. Every church meeting is a time of corporate eating. When we first came into the church life, we came as dirty dogs, and we ate under the table. But now we are no longer under the <span class="pg" data-page-id="554" id="554">[554]</span> table; we are sitting at the table. Although we are in the desert, we are nevertheless at the table. This is the corporate eating, an eating that is complete. The full bread is on the table of the saved ones.</p>

It seems that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63422" data-verses="Matthew 16:1-12">16:1-12</span> has nothing to do with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63423" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>. However, when we probe into the depth of the doctrine revealed in Matthew, we see that there is a connection.</p>

BEING WARY OF THE LEAVEN<br/>OF THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES</h2><p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLYiBeQQzfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> When it comes to the matter of eating, we must be careful not to eat any leaven. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63424" data-verses="Matthew 16:1-12">16:1-12</span> what is crucial is not the temptation presented by the Pharisees and Sadducees, but the leaven. Hidden within this temptation of the Lord Jesus, there was leaven. Yeast is a leavening agent, used in making bread. What we see, however, is not the leaven, but the bread. When we eat bread, we may not realize that we are also eating leaven, for leaven is hidden in the bread and thus is invisible. Although no one could see the leaven hidden in the temptation presented by the Pharisees and Sadducees, it was nonetheless concealed within it.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0iw5skpVM-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> As we have seen, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63425" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> deals with the matter of eating. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63426" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">15:1</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63427" data-verses="Matthew 16:12">16:12</span>, Matthew’s record is <span class="pg" data-page-id="556" id="556">[556]</span> very much concerned with eating. Eating unclean things may defile us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63428" data-verses="Matthew 15:1-20">15:1-20</span>). What we need is not the outward washing, but the inward eating. Eating is the way to partake of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63429" data-verses="Matthew 15:21-28">15:21-28</span>), and eating causes Gentile dogs to become children of God, even proper men. By eating we feed on the unlimited and inexhaustibly rich supply of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63430" data-verses="Matthew 15:32-39">15:32-39</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63431" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">Matthew 15</span> concludes with the record of corporate eating. However, we must beware of eating leaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63432" data-verses="Matthew 16:5-12">16:5-12</span>), especially the religious leaven hidden within religious people, such as the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Pharisees were the ancient fundamentalists, and the Sadducees were the ancient modernists. I am thankful that the Bible mentions them both. In today’s religion there are also fundamentalists and modernists. The first group, the fundamentalists, have sound, scriptural beliefs. The second group, the Sadducees, deny what the Bible says.</p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GqTlFUuQsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63433" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> Christ was present as bread, but the religious ones had hidden, damaging leaven. To repeat, Christ was the bread, and with the religious people, both the ancient fundamentalists and modernists, there was leaven. In the subtlety of religion, leaven tries to creep into the bread. Remember the parable of the leaven (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63434" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">13:33</span>). Christ is the fine flour to feed God’s people for God’s satisfaction. But the woman, the apostate Roman Catholic Church, took leaven and hid it in the fine flour. Apparently leaven makes fine flour easier to take in; actually, it produces corruption. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63435" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> we see the bread available not only for Gentile dogs, but also for the men in the wilderness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63436" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> the Lord warned His disciples and seemed to be saying to them, “Take care regarding your eating. It is right to eat Me, but you must beware of religious leaven.” At the Lord’s time there were the Pharisees and Sadducees, and today there still are Pharisees and Sadducees. These religious people, whether they are fundamentalists or modernists, have some secret, hidden leaven.</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85ww3RWYn2Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> Now we can see the connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63437" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">chapters fifteen</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="557" id="557">[557]</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63438" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">sixteen</span>. We can see the reason Matthew speaks of leaven immediately after the record of corporate eating. Be careful. As you are enjoying the corporate eating, it is easy for leaven to secretly creep in. Eventually, leaven did creep into the church. The church was not very careful about this, and not too long after the day of Pentecost leaven came in. The bread on which the church had been feeding became completely leavened. Thus, the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63439" data-verses="Matthew 16:6">16:6</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63440" data-verses="Matthew 16:11">11</span> was not only a warning, but also a prophecy.</p>
<p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy8oOK19nw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> By the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63441" data-verses="Matthew 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>, the disciples were helped to realize that the Lord Jesus had come to be bread to the children of God. Firstly, the heathen were dirty dogs, but after eating Christ they had been regenerated and caused to become children of God, proper men to enjoy Christ in a corporate way. When all this was made clear to the disciples, they must have been happy. However, then the Lord seemed to say, “It is good to eat Me and to enjoy the corporate eating. But there are religious people who in the name of God, under the cloak of worshipping God, and presumably for the purpose of glorifying God, will bring in leaven. They will be utilized by the enemy to secretly bring in some damaging and corrupting thing. You must beware of this.”</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM_XF8nKmElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> The Lord Jesus came as bread to be taken in by sinners so that they may be regenerated to be the children of God and transformed into the proper men to feed on Christ corporately. Although this is wonderful, there is the danger of religious leaven that comes from religious people. In Christianity religious people are highly respected. But I speak of them in a negative way because I realize that the religious ones always have some leaven. Under the cloak of religion, they bring in certain matters that corrupt and damage the things of God. Therefore, we must learn to beware of leaven as we are enjoying Christ as our heavenly bread.</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfO02oTpb7ftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> This leaven always comes from religion, from the Pharisees and Sadducees. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63442" data-verses="Mark 8:15">Mark 8:15</span> speaks also of the leaven of Herod. Matthew does not mention this type of leaven <span class="pg" data-page-id="558" id="558">[558]</span> because his purpose is to show that in feeding on Christ there is the danger of taking in something religious. Anything religious may have leaven in it. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees was their teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63443" data-verses="Matthew 16:12">16:12</span>). None of the Pharisees taught in a way that would obviously damage people. If they did this, no one would listen to them. The same was true of the Sadducees. If they did not give people the impression that their teaching would help them, no one would listen to them. The principle is the same today. In today’s Christendom there is teaching upon teaching. Every teaching appears to help people. No one will ever tell you that the teaching he is about to give you may damage you or lead you astray. On the contrary, everyone with a certain teaching pretends that his teaching is good and helpful. This is the reason people like teachings. But we need to realize that leaven may often be concealed under the cloak of religious teachings.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1EBXX9WmkCzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> Christ is the bread of heaven sent by God and from God. Leaven, however, is something sent by Satan and from Satan. Thus, God sent bread, and God’s enemy sent leaven. God is endeavoring to put Christ into His people, and the enemy is working to put in leaven as God’s children are taking in Christ. This principle is evident in today’s Catholicism. Take the example of Christmas. The birth of Christ and the incarnation of Christ are the fine flour as food to us. But Christmas is leaven. The birth of Christ is pure. How pure it is that God has been incarnated! But consider how defiled and corrupt is the practice of Christmas today. There are even such things as Christmas dancing parties. What leaven there is in this matter of Christmas! Christmas is so full of leaven that it is difficult to find any fine flour at all.</p>
<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhnmDpNTw69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> We may apply this principle to nearly everything in today’s Christendom. For example, there is nothing wrong with being a servant of God. But why should people use the title Reverend? To call yourself Reverend is to bring in leaven. It is also leaven to use denominational names, such as Lutheran and Baptist. All these titles are leaven. <span class="pg" data-page-id="559" id="559">[559]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Xrfm_0_wHtlK1HVoKjia9ysO6WsNx9Cw0kdxF7iwt4aGYrrICB0YkaHGfAxzlMrpi"> Furthermore, it is pure to sing praise to the Lord, but to have a soloist is to add leaven. Although we enjoy the corporate eating of Jesus, we need to beware of hidden, religious leaven. Even some of the dear saints in the Lord’s recovery may wonder what is wrong with having a soloist in the meeting. Oh, how we must beware of every kind of leaven! It is not easy to discern that leaven is hidden in the bread.</p>

Nothing is more deceitful than miracles. Suppose Antichrist appeared and set up his image in front of you, and the false prophet was able to make this image speak to you. You could easily be deceived by this and say, “This is marvelous. If this were not a miracle, how could he make the image speak?” Leaven always creeps in through the subtlety of miracles. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63445" data-verses="Matthew 16:1-12">16:1-12</span> the two key words are sign and leaven. The religionists, the Pharisees and Sadducees, came to the Lord Jesus and asked Him to show them a sign from heaven. However, the Lord Jesus refused to show them such a sign. The pure bread, the pure Christ, does not perform signs. As we shall see, He Himself is the unique sign.</p>

And He left them and went away.” Jonah was the prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles and was put into the belly of the great fish. After remaining there for three days, he emerged to become a sign to that generation for repentance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63448" data-verses="Jonah 1:2">Jonah 1:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63449" data-verses="Jonah 1:17">17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63450" data-verses="Jonah 2:2-10">2:2-10</span>).

The Lord’s word here implies that to that evil and adulterous, Jewish and religious generation, the Lord would do nothing but die and be resurrected as a sign, the greatest sign to them, that they might be saved if they would believe. In speaking of the sign of Jonah, the Lord seemed to be saying, “You Pharisees and Sadducees do not need miracles. You need to discern that this generation is evil and to believe in Me and take Me into you as the crucified and resurrected One. You need to repent as the people of Nineveh did, and you need to believe that I will die for your sins and be resurrected to impart Myself into you as life. This is the sign for this generation. No other sign will be given. I am the sign to you, the sign of the crucified and resurrected Christ. You need to repent and to receive Me into you as your bread.”</p>

The Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees</h2><p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsRcKr3cNhgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> At this juncture the Lord brought in the matter of leaven, saying, “Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63453" data-verses="Matthew 16:6">v. 6</span>). As we have pointed out, this leaven is the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63454" data-verses="Matthew 16:12">v. 12</span>). The teaching of the Pharisees was hypocritical (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63455" data-verses="Matthew 23:13">23:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63456" data-verses="Matthew 23:15">15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63457" data-verses="Matthew 23:23">23</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63458" data-verses="Matthew 23:25">25</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63459" data-verses="Matthew 23:27">27</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63460" data-verses="Matthew 23:29">29</span>), and the teaching of the Sadducees was like today’s modernism, denying the <span class="pg" data-page-id="561" id="561">[561]</span> resurrection, angels, and spirits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63461" data-verses="Acts 23:8">Acts 23:8</span>). Hence, the teachings of both the Pharisees and Sadducees were impure and evil, and were likened to leaven, which was forbidden to be seen with God’s people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63462" data-verses="Exodus 13:7">Exo. 13:7</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFY55KRGwD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> Again I say that the words sign and leaven are the two crucial words in this section. We should not believe in any miracle that does not have in it the essence of Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection. I have seen the so-called healing services in the Pentecostal movement. However, to speak truly there was a great deal of leaven there. The essence of the crucifixion of Christ and of the resurrected life of Christ was lacking. Every miracle, every sign, must be based upon the principle of the crucifixion and the resurrection. The sign of Jonah, the sign of the crucified and resurrected Christ, must accompany every genuine miracle. Otherwise, the miracles will simply be a type of leaven. A great many Christians have been leavened by miracles. Today the so-called speaking in tongues has become a type of leaven, and so many of those who speak in tongues have been leavened by this practice. When some come to a meeting, they care only for speaking in tongues, no matter whether or not the tongues are real and genuine. As long as there is the manifestation of “tongues,” they are happy. This shows how leavened they are. They have no heart for the pure bread, for the pure sign with the essence of Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection. On the contrary, they are leavened. Again I say, beware of every kind of leaven.</p>

Caesarea Philippi is in the northern part of the Holy Land, close to the border, at the foot of Mount Hermon, on which the Lord was transfigured (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63466" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-2">17:1-2</span>). It was far from the holy city with the holy temple, where the atmosphere of the old Jewish religion filled every man’s thought, leaving no room for Christ, the new King. The Lord brought His disciples purposely to such a place with a clear atmosphere that their thought might be released from the effects of the religious surroundings in the holy city and holy temple, and that He might reveal to them something new concerning Himself and the church, which is the pulse of His heavenly kingdom. It was here that the vision concerning Him as the Christ and the Son of the living God came to Peter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63467" data-verses="Matthew 16:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>).

<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS_2a8dU-asIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> Several months ago, some other brothers and I visited both Jerusalem and Caesarea Philippi. The religious atmosphere of Jerusalem was foul and terrible. Physically, mentally, and spiritually, the atmosphere was stuffy. We were disgusted with what we saw there. One day we drove to the north, to Caesarea Philippi. How fresh the air was there! We saw a fountain which was one of the three sources of the Jordan River. We lingered there for a while, enjoying our lunch and having a pleasant time. The reason the Lord Jesus brought His disciples to Caesarea Philippi was to clear them of the foggy religious atmosphere of Jerusalem and the Jewish religion. Only after the Lord had brought the disciples to Caesarea Philippi did He begin to ask them questions regarding who He was. Caesarea Philippi was the right place for the Lord Jesus to be revealed to His disciples. It was also the right place for the revelation to be given regarding the church. <span class="pg" data-page-id="563" id="563">[563]</span> </p>

The connection is that if we are still under the influence of religious leaven, we shall never be clear about Christ or the church. In order to be clear about Christ and the church, you need to eliminate all leaven. You not only need to get away from the religious center, from the holy city with the holy temple, with the stuffy, foul, atmosphere filled with religious concepts, but you also need to be purged of the religious leaven. If there is still leaven within you, you will be under a veil, and your eyes will not be able to see Christ and the church. To see Christ and the church you need to get away from the religious center and all the so-called holy things, places, and persons, and you need to eliminate every kind of leaven.</p>

Neither can they see Christ in a pure and genuine way because they are saturated with religious leaven. Now we can see the reason Matthew placed the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63469" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> immediately after his account of the corporate eating. In our eating we need to beware of leaven. Moreover, if we would see Christ and the church, we should not have any religious leaven. We need a clear sky and a clear atmosphere; we also need a clear mind and a clear understanding, an understanding not under the influence of religious leaven. If we still hold the concept that there is nothing wrong with Christmas or with the denominations, it is an indication that our understanding is saturated with hidden religious leaven. This leaven creates not an outward fog, but an inward mist. If there is such a mist within us, our vision will be blurred. The inward condition of some saints is like this. They are filled with mist. But every once in a while a little hole appears, and a portion of clear sky can be seen. However, immediately afterward the mist covers the clear spot. Some of these saints may say, “What’s wrong with the title Southern Baptist? A denomination is not a gambling casino, is it?” If you think like this, your vision will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="564" id="564">[564]</span> blurred. Questions like these indicate that you still hold on to leavened, religious concepts.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19N-I3DGAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> Many of us have been leavened from the time we were born. Throughout our childhood we were constantly under the influence of leaven. Although you knew nothing of Christ, you were familiar with Santa Claus, Christmas stockings, and trees decorated with colored lights. Your thought and feeling were completely leavened. To you, the church was a bungalow with a high tower and bell. This shows that unconsciously and subconsciously you were leavened. Moreover, the more you were educated and trained in school, the more the leaven saturated your being. Therefore, we need to leave the religious center and go far to the north, to the region of Caesarea Philippi, where the sky is clear. Also, we need to say to the Lord inwardly, “Lord Jesus, purify me of every kind of leaven. I don’t want there to be fog without or mist within. I want to be a clear person under a clear sky.”</p>

The very Christ preached and taught by today’s religion has been leavened. Consider how much leaven there is in the preaching of Christ and in the teaching regarding the church. The “bread” of the church, that is, the truth concerning the church, has been especially leavened. Recently I was grieved to hear that some Christian preachers have issued a call for Christians to come back to the so-called historic church. Do they not know that the councils of the historic church made many evil decisions, one of which made at the Council of Ephesus (A.D. 431) was to sanction the worship of Mary? As you know, the charismatic movement has penetrated the Catholic Church and has even been mixed with the worship of Mary. How can those who have had the charismatic experience tolerate such idolatry? But today some are saying, even over the radio, that there is no idolatry in Catholicism. A certain group in Berkeley is striving to investigate us. I wonder why they do not investigate the Catholic Church. Why do they not go to the Vatican and <span class="pg" data-page-id="565" id="565">[565]</span> see the paganism, idolatry, and heresy there? The fact that they investigate us but not the Catholic Church exposes their evil intention, which is to suppress us and to terminate us. In every corner of today’s Christendom there is hidden leaven. Nothing there is pure. The whole of Christendom has been leavened. This is not my word; it is the prophetic word of the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63470" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">13:33</span>, where the Lord said that “the whole was leavened.” We, however, stand against the leaven and we are testifying the pure Jesus. Although this is offensive to many, there is nothing we can do about it. We must testify the pure Christ and stand against all leaven.</p>

In this chapter the Father reveals something from the heavens to Peter. This heavenly revelation from the Father is the rock. It is not an insignificant matter that the church is built both upon Christ and upon the revelation concerning Christ. The denominations are not built upon this rock. For example, the Southern Baptist denomination is built upon the revelation of baptism by immersion, not upon the revelation of Christ. In the same principle, the Presbyterian denomination is built upon the doctrine of presbytery. Likewise, the charismatic churches or groups are not built upon this revelation concerning Christ; they are built upon their knowledge of the charismatic things and on their experience of them. Thus, the Foursquare denomination is built upon the revelation of the foursquare gospel, not on the revelation of Christ.</p>

Many of us can testify that before we came to such a place, the revelation of Christ and the church did not come. It comes only in Caesarea Philippi. We feed on Christ not only as the crumbs, but also in a corporate way as the rich, unlimited, inexhaustible supply of life. Only then can we see the revelation of Christ and the church. Thus, three things are vital: that we know how to feed on Christ and to enjoy the inexhaustibly rich supply of Christ; that we are purged of all religious leaven; and that we are in Caesarea Philippi under a clear sky.

For Christ to build His church, He must go to the religious center, pass through crucifixion, and enter into resurrection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63500" data-verses="Matthew 16:21">verse 21</span> the Lord first revealed to His disciples His crucifixion and resurrection. Before this time, He had not mentioned anything about these things. Following the revelation of Christ and the church, the Lord Jesus revealed to His enlightened disciples His crucifixion and resurrection. This is very meaningful. After we see Christ and the church, we must be prepared to take the way of the cross. You may be wondering what the way of the cross is. To take the way of the cross is not to reserve anything of the self. No matter how good, right, or profitable you may be, you need to be crucified. For the enjoyment of Christ and for the building of the church, we must be crucified. Nothing of our being should be reserved.</p>

The disciples, however, picked up the matter of crucifixion, but neglected the matter of resurrection. The disciples heard that the Lord was to be killed, but it seems that they did not hear that He would be resurrected. Nevertheless, the Lord did say that He would be raised on the third day. They did not grasp this part of the Lord’s word because they had no concept of resurrection. Within them was the fear that the Lord Jesus would be killed. Thus, when the Lord spoke about His resurrection, the disciples did not apprehend it. It is the same with us today. We immediately take in whatever corresponds to our concept. But if a certain thing does not correspond to what is already within us, we do not take it in. Some people wonder why in my speaking I repeat things again and again. Although I may repeat certain things, some people still do not get them. Again I say that although the Lord Jesus spoke of two matters, crucifixion and resurrection, the disciples grasped the first, but not the second.</p>

Here Peter was bold enough to rebuke the Lord. As Peter was rebuking the Lord, his expression might have been that of Satan. Peter’s words—“God be merciful to You, Lord”—sound very nice, but they were actually a rebuke. Peter had been offended by the Lord’s word about being killed.

<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0dGTRvXM_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63507" data-verses="Matthew 16:25">verse 25</span> the Lord continues: “For whoever desires to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63508" data-verses="Matthew 16:23-25">verses 23 through 25</span>, three things are related to one another: mind, himself, and soul-life. Our mind is the expression of our self, and our self is the embodiment of our soul-life. Our soul-life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, our thought, our concept, our opinion. When we set our mind, not on the things of God, but on the things of men, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself. This was what happened to Peter. Hence, the Lord’s following word indicated that he had to deny himself and not save his soul-life, but rather lose it. To lose the soul-life is the reality of denying the self. This is to take up the cross.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEFuHpu7irHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> Actually, in these verses four things are related: Satan, mind, self, and soul-life. This message is concerned mainly with these four things, which begin with the mind and <span class="pg" data-page-id="575" id="575">[575]</span> ultimately consummate with Satan. The mind is the expression of the self, and the self is the embodiment of the soul-life. The soul-life is lived out by the self, and the self is expressed through the mind. What the mind thinks or considers is an opinion, idea, or concept. The mind’s opinion, concept, or idea is the expression of the self, the embodiment of the soul-life. The soul-life is embodied in the self, just as the Father is embodied in the Son. The soul-life is like the Father, the self is like the Son, and the mind is like the Spirit. Thus, we have here a trinity of mind, self, and soul-life.</p>

<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMmuYrsqqCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> The soul-life, the source, is embodied in the self, which is expressed in the mind. Perhaps you have never before considered your mind the expression of the self. If you saw this, you would probably not use your mind so much. Your opinion is the expression of your self. Beware of your opinion, for it is not a positive thing. Natural opinions, concepts, ideas, and thoughts are negative things, for they are the expression of the self. The soul is embodied in the self and lived out through the self, and the self is expressed in opinions. When the self is expressed through the mind as opinion, that is Satan.</p>
<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz6HIcIJxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> I have learned to be afraid of my opinions. During the years, I have been enlightened to see that the natural opinion or concept is the incarnation of Satan. If this were not so, how could the Lord Jesus have rebuked Peter and called him Satan? The first time I read this in the Bible, I was shocked. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63509" data-verses="Matthew 16:23">verse 23</span> Peter and Satan had become one in Peter’s selfish opinion. Peter’s opinion was Satan. To repeat, the soul-life is embodied in the self, and the self is expressed through the mind. When the mind expresses an opinion, that is the incarnation of Satan.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxClWmKfL68vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> Have you ever realized that often your opinion has been the expression of Satan? I doubt that you have ever understood the matter in this way. It is crucial that we see that our natural opinion is the incarnation of Satan. Nothing damages your Christian life more than your opinions. The expression of the natural opinion is the product of satanic <span class="pg" data-page-id="576" id="576">[576]</span> inspiration. Because your natural opinion comes from Satan’s inspiration, you need to beware of it. If you use your mind excessively, the Lord Jesus will call you Satan. If you exercise your mind too much, you will be the expression of Satan, and the Lord Jesus will say to you, “Get behind Me, Satan.”</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkQ9TE9wGiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> To take the way of the cross to enter into glory requires that we not use our mind in a natural way. We must deny the self, bear the cross, and follow Christ. I do not believe that anyone who exercises his mind in a natural way can be a good follower of Christ. When we exercise our mind too much, we do not follow Christ. Christ is not in our mind, but in our spirit. If you examine these verses in their context, you will see that the mind is the expression of the self, that the self is the embodiment of the soul-life, and that all this must be put on the cross.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCcYIPaAGmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63510" data-verses="Matthew 16:24">verse 24</span> the Lord said, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.” The cross is not merely a suffering; it is primarily a killing. It kills and terminates the criminal. Christ first bore the cross and then was crucified. We, His believers, have first been crucified with Him and then bear the cross today. To us, bearing the cross is to remain under the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, our natural life, and our old man. In so doing we deny our self that we may follow the Lord.</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_4bLHSsGhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> Many Christians have a mistaken concept of the cross. They think that the cross is just for suffering. In this section of the Word, however, the cross does not denote suffering, but killing. The ultimate purpose of the cross is not to cause you to suffer; it is to terminate you, to kill you. The Lord’s word here does not have the concept of suffering; His concept concerning the cross is that of killing.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57egGE0aOTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> The Lord Jesus firstly bore the cross and then He was crucified on the cross and terminated. As the Lord Jesus was bearing the cross, He was constantly under the killing, not under suffering. It is a wrong concept to associate the cross merely with suffering. The Lord Jesus began to bear <span class="pg" data-page-id="577" id="577">[577]</span> the cross immediately after His baptism. Baptism means that a person is put into death, terminated, and buried. From the moment of His baptism, the Lord Jesus was constantly putting Himself under the cross and keeping Himself there. He was a person who was constantly being put to death. With Him, the bearing came first and the killing followed. With us it is just the opposite, for we are first crucified with Him and then we bear the cross.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faFISuh5qZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> As a youth, I was taught that to bear the cross is to suffer. This erroneous concept comes from Catholicism. I repeat, the concept of bearing the cross in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63511" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> is not that of suffering, but of being put to death. In order to bear the cross, we must realize that we have already been crucified. We have been killed on the cross with Christ, and now we must remain under this killing. I am a person who has been killed. My self-life, my mind, my natural life, and my whole being have been killed. Now I need to remain under this killing. This is what it means to bear the cross.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5ipna795o1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> When I was a young person, I heard certain exhortations given to others related to bearing the cross. A wife who was suffering the unkindness of her husband was told to bear the cross. In other words, she was told that to suffer the unkindness of her husband was to bear the cross. But suffering cannot build up the church. However, the genuine bearing of the cross builds up the church, because it puts to death the self, the soul-life, and the natural life. We all have been buried, baptized, and terminated. Now we need to stay in this termination. This is to take the way of the cross.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn7dgbTw5z3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> A dead man has no opinion. It is impossible to bend his mind because his mind no longer functions. If your mind can be bent, it means that it is still alive, active, and aggressive. If you tried to bend the minds of those buried in a cemetery and they could speak, they would say, “You have come to the wrong place. We all are dead, and our minds have stopped functioning. There is no need for you to come to bend our minds.” If we bear the cross, we shall be like <span class="pg" data-page-id="578" id="578">[578]</span> those buried in the cemetery. We shall remain in a state of termination and lie there under death. This is the correct meaning of bearing the cross.</p>
<p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wM6sev9vlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63512" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> Peter was very active and aggressive. On the one hand, it is good to stir up things by being aggressive. However, all the quick brothers need to be killed. I love the quick ones, the bold ones, the troublesome ones, because they stir up things. If there were no brothers like this in the Lord’s recovery, no one would cause trouble. Because of brothers like this, there are always troubles in the recovery. Without these troubles, the Lord Jesus could not be revealed to such a great degree. Eventually, however, the Lord called Peter, the quick one, Satan. All the quick Peters must be terminated. They need to be killed and stay under the killing of the cross. Otherwise, there will be no way for the church to be built.</p>
<p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLYhxeVADfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> To take the pathway to glory ultimately means to put ourselves to death. This pathway is not only a matter of rejection, of experiencing the lack of necessities, of facing the storm on the sea, of encountering the accusations of religion, of learning to eat the Lord Jesus as the inexhaustible life supply, of being warned to beware of the leaven, and of seeing the vision of Christ and the church. In addition to all this, we need to be terminated. The last station of the pathway to glory is the station of self-termination. The view presented in the Gospel of Matthew is marvelous. Matthew’s view covers rejection, necessity, the storm, the accusation from religion, the leaven, Satan, the self, the mind, and the soul-life. If you do not know how to face these things, it will be difficult for you to enter into glory. The last step before entering into glory is the termination of the self. It is not sufficient merely to pass through rejection or to experience the Lord’s supplying our material necessities. Also, it is not adequate to endure the stormy sea, to deal with the religious accusation regarding outward things, to feed on Christ, and to beware of leaven. Ultimately, the pathway to glory is a matter of being terminated. <span class="pg" data-page-id="579" id="579">[579]</span> </p>
<div id="displayv"> </div> </div><div class="section" data-section="3">
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0iw6ckiHs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> You may think that Satan is in the rejection, the storm, or the accusation. Actually, Satan is not in these things; instead, only demons are there. The demons are behind the rejection, the storm, and the religious accusations. But Satan, the king of the demons, is in your mind, your self, and your soul-life. Therefore, you must hate your self more than you hate rejection. Martin Luther once said that he was more afraid of himself than he was of the pope, for he knew that he had the strongest pope, the self, within him. The subtle, concealed enemy, even the adversary, is our self. Thus, the last dealing along the pathway to glory is to deal with this self.</p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GqQVFe8gsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> As we have seen, the self is active in the opinions, concepts, and ideas expressed by our mind. Christians today fight and are divided because of differing opinions. For this reason, the Apostle Paul said that we all need to be attuned to the same opinion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63513" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:10">1 Cor. 1:10</span>). Hence, to take the pathway to glory is ultimately to deal with our self.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrvoKH-rZ5GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> I believe that we have seen a clear vision that bearing the cross is not a matter of suffering, but of keeping the self under the termination of death. The cross of Christ is the terminating death, and we must stay in the place of this termination. To remain there is to bear the cross. I am bearing the cross, for I keep myself under Christ’s termination. Therefore, because I have been terminated, I have no idea, no concept, no opinion. By the Lord’s grace, I wish to remain in the place of termination for my whole life.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovgaTxyjARSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> Resurrection follows termination. When we keep ourselves under Christ’s termination, spontaneously there will be a reaction in our spirit. This reaction is resurrection. Resurrection is what is needed for the building up of the church. To experience termination and resurrection is the way to enjoy Christ and to build up the church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63514" data-verses="Matthew 16:24">verse 24</span> the Lord tells us to follow Him. Before the Lord’s crucifixion, the disciples followed Him in an outward way. But since His resurrection, we follow Him in an inward way. Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving <span class="pg" data-page-id="580" id="580">[580]</span> Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63515" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>) dwelling in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63516" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Tim. 4:22</span>), we follow Him in our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63517" data-verses="Galatians 5:16-25">Gal. 5:16-25</span>).</p>

If we save it in this age, we shall lose it in the coming age. But if we lose it for Christ’s sake, we shall find it in the enjoyment of the kingdom in the coming age.</p>

Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?” The enjoyment of the soul-life today is wrapped up with the world. To gain the world for the enjoyment of the soul is to forfeit the life in the enjoyment of the kingdom in the coming age. Even if we gained the whole world for the enjoyment of the soul-life in this age by forfeiting the enjoyment of the soul-life in the coming age, it would profit nothing. Nothing is worthy to be given in exchange for the enjoyment of the soul-life in the kingdom.</p>

His followers not only shared His rejection by the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63530" data-verses="Matthew 13:53-58">13:53-58</span>), but were also persecuted and even martyred by Gentile politics (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63531" data-verses="Matthew 14:1-12">14:1-12</span>). Therefore, they were in the desert with Him in a situation of poverty, yet they were richly cared for by Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63532" data-verses="Matthew 14:13-21">14:13-21</span>).

At that point, many sick ones were healed by touching Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63534" data-verses="Matthew 14:35-36">14:35-36</span>), but the hypocritical worshippers of God came to accuse Him because His followers transgressed their tradition (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63535" data-verses="Matthew 15:1-20">15:1-20</span>). Then His disciples followed Him through Gentile country, where a demon-possessed Gentile was healed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63536" data-verses="Matthew 15:21-28">15:21-28</span>). After this, they followed Him along the sea of Galilee and up the mountain, where those with all kinds of sicknesses were healed and the need of His followers in the crowd was again richly provided for in a barren desert (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63537" data-verses="Matthew 15:29-39">15:29-39</span>).

After all this, He brought His followers to the border of the holy land, close to Gentile country, that they might have a revelation of Him, of the church, and of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="584" id="584">[584]</span> cross as the way for them to enter into the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63540" data-verses="Matthew 16:13-28">16:13-28</span>).

On the pathway to glory we face rejection, the storm, and the accusations. We experience the eating, we beware of leaven, and we have a revelation of Christ and the church. Furthermore, we take the way of the cross and deny the self and the soul-life. These are the steps along the pathway to glory.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKnztwvD5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63544" data-verses="Matthew 13:53">Matthew 13:53—17:8</span> is a marvelous doctrinal section. Thirty-four years ago, I gave a message on this portion of the Word in Shanghai. I had just arrived there as a newcomer in the work with Brother Nee. I was asked to give the message one Sunday morning. Then I received the burden to minister on the subject of the pathway to glory. I asked the congregation to read more than three chapters of Matthew, from the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63545" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> to the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63546" data-verses="Matthew 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>. Then I gave a long message on these chapters. Nearly all the points in that message were the same as those covered in these messages on the pathway to glory. Although I had not yet seen the matter of eating, the structure of the message was the same as that of these messages. How wonderful it is to be on the pathway to glory! I can testify that during the past forty-four years I have taken every step of this pathway. I have experienced rejection, the lack of material necessities, the storms, and the accusations. Moreover, I have seen the revelation concerning Christ and the church. Because I have been walking this pathway for such a long time, in a sense I have already entered into glory. Others of us are either in the glory or are very close to it. Although some of us may be in the glory, we are still on the pathway to a greater degree of glory. We all need to keep walking on this pathway until the Lord comes back. <span class="pg" data-page-id="585" id="585">[585]</span> </p>

To receive the revelation concerning Christ and the church we must be far away from the religious environment; but to see the vision of the transfigured Christ we need to be on a high mountain, far above the earthly level.</p>
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OQg3PIvG0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63551" data-verses="Matthew 17:2">Verse 2</span> says, “And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light.” Not many Christians realize that Christ’s transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom. In the past we pointed out that the Lord’s coming will not take place suddenly; rather, it will come gradually. In a sense, the Lord will come back from heaven; but in another sense, He will come out of us. When He fully lives Himself out of us, that will be the time of His coming. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63552" data-verses="Matthew 17:1">Matthew 17:1</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63553" data-verses="Matthew 16:28">16:28</span>, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification. When He was transfigured, He was glorified.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKnztwoR5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> Now we must see what it means to be glorified. When Christ, who is God, became a man, His divinity was incarnated in His humanity. He was a unique person, one <span class="pg" data-page-id="586" id="586">[586]</span> possessing both divinity and humanity. His divinity was concealed within His humanity. Outwardly, He was a man, but inwardly He was the very God. God was hidden, contained, concealed, within this man. Glory is God manifested, God expressed. It is nothing other than God Himself manifested and seen by man. The God hidden within the humanity of Jesus was the very glory. Thus, the glorious divine element was concealed within the human element of Jesus. As He walked on earth, no one could see His glorious divinity. Many saw the miracles and realized that He was someone extraordinary, but prior to His transfiguration no one had ever seen the glory concealed within Him. Then one day He brought three of His most intimate disciples to a high mountain, and was there transfigured before them. For the Lord Jesus to be transfigured meant that His humanity was saturated and permeated with His divinity. We may say that His humanity was soaked with divinity. This transfiguration, which was His glorification, was equal to His coming in His kingdom. This indicates that Christ’s coming in His kingdom is linked with His transfiguration. Where His transfiguration is, there the coming of the kingdom is also. The coming of the kingdom is the Lord’s glorification, His transfiguration; and His glorification is the saturation of His humanity by His divinity. This is the meaning of transfiguration. Because the Lord has been transfigured, He is now in glory.</p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAVg0cW3szKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> In Christ’s transfiguration, His humanity was glorified; it was brought into God’s glory. Before that time, God was in Him, but His humanity was not in God’s glory. In His transfiguration His humanity was thoroughly saturated with His glorious divinity. In the coming manifestation of the kingdom, Christ will be like this. He will be the very Christ with both divinity and humanity, but His humanity will be soaked with His divinity.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPNcRzmPoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> The day is coming when we shall not only see this, but also experience it ourselves. We now have the divine life with the divine nature within us. However, we still have our natural humanity. No matter how spiritual and holy <span class="pg" data-page-id="587" id="587">[587]</span> we may be, our humanity is still natural. It has not yet been saturated with the divine glory. But at the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, our humanity will be glorified by the glorious divinity within us.</p>

Do they think that to be glorified is merely to enter the realm of glory? This is a very superficial understanding of glorification. To be glorified is to be saturated with God’s glory. It is to be transfigured, not from without, but from within. One day we shall be a great surprise to the unbelievers. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63555" data-verses="2Thessalonians 1:10">Second Thessalonians 1:10</span> says, “When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.” The unbelievers will be shocked by our glorification. Because in our humanity we are the same as the unbelievers, they can see no difference between us and them. But the day is coming when they will see a glorious difference, for our humanity will be saturated with divinity, and we shall become a glorious people. We shall not just be spiritual, holy, pure, and clean. We shall be glorious. This is the coming of the kingdom. We are waiting for this to take place.</p>

Perhaps you are wondering how Peter was able to recognize them. In the <span class="pg" data-page-id="589" id="589">[589]</span> Lord’s conversation with Moses and Elijah there must have been some indication of their identity that made it possible for Peter to recognize them.

The effect of Peter’s absurd proposal was to put Moses and Elijah on the same level with Christ, which means to make the law and the prophets, represented by Moses and Elijah, equal to Christ. This was absolutely against God’s economy. In God’s economy the law and the prophets were only a testimony to Christ; they should not be put on the same level with Him.</p>

This is the second time the Father declared the same thing, this time to vindicate the Son in His transfiguration, which prefigures the coming kingdom. In God’s economy, after Christ came, we should hear Him, no longer the law or the prophets, since the law and the prophets were all fulfilled in Christ and by Christ.</p>

Peter proposed to rank Moses and Elijah, that is, the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving no one except Jesus Himself alone. The law and the prophets were shadows and prophecies, not the reality, which is Christ. Now that Christ is here, the shadows and prophecies are no longer needed. No one except Jesus Himself alone should remain in the New Testament. Jesus is today’s Moses, imparting the law of life into His believers. He is also today’s Elijah, speaking for God and speaking forth God within His believers. This is God’s New Testament economy.</p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoJxgK5_Vsw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> God took Moses and Elijah away because He would not tolerate seeing His children rank anyone on the same level as His Son Jesus Christ. Therefore, when the disciples saw the Lord Jesus, they saw no one except Him alone. This was a lesson to them. In the kingdom God will not allow the law or the prophets to be held equal to Christ. Since the kingdom has come, there should be nothing but Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCNtdpmFb4qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> In God’s economy today Christ is the living lawgiver, the One who has imparted Himself into our being as the Giver of the law of life. Thus, Christ is our real Moses, who was a type, a shadow of Christ. The law Moses gave was not the real law; rather, it was the law of dead letters. The real law is the law of life, which only Christ can give us. Because He has given us the law of life, He is the real lawgiver. Furthermore, in God’s economy Christ is the real prophet. Elijah also was a type, a shadow, of Christ, who is the true prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63570" data-verses="Acts 3:22">Acts 3:22</span>). Christ is within us not only to impart the law of life into our being, but also to speak for God. Christ speaks forth God. Because we have Christ as the real Moses and the real Elijah, we do not need any other Moses or Elijah in God’s New Testament economy.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rQEFsRgQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> As we await the coming of the kingdom, we must learn not to rank Moses, Elijah, or anyone else on the same level as Christ. Instead, we need to learn to experience Christ as our Moses and Elijah. He is the One imparting the law of life into us. In other words, as our present, real, subjective <span class="pg" data-page-id="591" id="591">[591]</span> Moses He is regulating us from within.

He might have felt sad about being rebuked. It was a serious matter to be rebuked in such a glorious situation. While everyone was having an enjoyable time, Peter spoke nonsense, and he was rebuked for it. Perhaps James and John said to him, “Peter, you are always doing things like this. Perhaps by now you have learned your lesson. When we were having a good time with the Lord Jesus on the mountain, you spoke nonsense, and you were rebuked. But, Peter, we shared the shock of this with you. We would not have been shocked, if you had not been shocked first. But please don’t do that again.”</p>

If we believe in resurrection and live in resurrection, we shall be in glory, even though the manifestation of the kingdom has not yet come. When we live and walk in resurrection, we have the sense that we are in glory and that we can see the glorious manifestation of the kingdom.

<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzjn9tJfcsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> The disciples had a theological problem. They seemed to be saying to the Lord, “Lord Jesus, Your kingdom has come, and we have seen it. But the scribes told us that Elijah would appear before the coming of the kingdom. We saw You coming in Your kingdom, but Elijah has not appeared. How can this be?” The disciples were bothered because they had some knowledge of scriptural doctrines. If I had been one of them, I would have asked the same thing. In contrast to Peter’s nonsensical proposal on the mountain, the disciples’ question was logical. Often when we are in a glorious situation, we do nonsensical things. But after we become clear and sober, we are very logical.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFEDVm05HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> The Lord Jesus told the disciples that Elijah would come and restore all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63582" data-verses="Matthew 17:11">v. 11</span>). This word indicates that the coming of the kingdom was not yet in full. In the future there will be a full manifestation of the kingdom. Before this, Elijah will come. On the one hand, Elijah has come; but on the other hand, he has not yet come in full. John the Baptist was Elijah, but he was not Elijah in full. The full coming of Elijah will take place in the future. The Elijah who had already come was rejected and killed. The disciples understood that the Lord was speaking of John <span class="pg" data-page-id="593" id="593">[593]</span> the Baptist. Just as the transfiguration of Christ was the coming of the kingdom, but not in full, so the coming of John the Baptist was the coming of Elijah, but not his coming in full.

<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYAt-pxSWD97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> In the Bible the fulfillment of prophecy is often like this. First there is a partial fulfillment, then the complete fulfillment. The same is true in principle with our experience of being in glory. During the past years, I have experienced being in glory, but this experience was not in full. At the time of the full manifestation of the kingdom of Christ, we shall all enter fully into glory. But today we see in Christ’s transfiguration a miniature of the coming manifestation of the kingdom. The miniature assures us that the full manifestation will come.</p>

Following this, the Lord spoke to His disciples the second time about His crucifixion and resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63584" data-verses="Matthew 17:22-23">17:22-23</span>). Then we have the incident regarding paying the half-shekel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63585" data-verses="Matthew 17:24-27">17:24-27</span>). As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63586" data-verses="Matthew 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>, it may be difficult to understand the connection between all these things. If we would understand the Gospel of Matthew, we need to remember that Matthew puts different facts together to reveal a doctrine. Although the three disciples, who represented the other disciples, had been in the miniature of the manifestation of the kingdom, there was still the need for three things: the dealing with the demon-possessed person, the revealing of the Lord’s crucifixion and resurrection, and the paying of the half-shekel to the tax gatherers.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4MBKyeS_8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc">I. THE POWER OF DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM</h2><p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZQjed1vCy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> We have pointed out that the coming of the kingdom in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63587" data-verses="Matthew 16:28">16:28—17:2</span> was not the coming of the kingdom in full; it was simply a miniature and a foretaste. The prophecies concerning the manifestation of the kingdom have not yet been completely fulfilled. When we get out of the sphere of the transfiguration, out of the atmosphere of the manifestation of the kingdom, we face the power of darkness outside the kingdom. Demon possession signifies the power of darkness. In the realm of the Lord’s transfiguration there is glory, but outside this realm there is the power of darkness. While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon <span class="pg" data-page-id="596" id="596">[596]</span> possession. During an inspiring conference or training, we may have the sense that we are on the mount of transfiguration. However, when we return home, we realize that the power of darkness is still all around us. To deal with the power of darkness there is the need of the exercise of the authority of the heavenly King (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63588" data-verses="Matthew 17:18">17:18</span>). We can exercise this authority only through prayer and fasting. As the heavenly King, the Lord has such authority, but we need to pray, even with fasting, to execute the Lord’s authority.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS-3q8ZGOasIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ">II. CHRIST’S CRUCIFIXION AND RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2wfK7E0C0EzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63589" data-verses="Matthew 17:22-23">17:22 and 23</span> the Lord said to His disciples, “The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill Him, and on the third day He shall be raised up.” When the disciples heard this, “they were exceedingly grieved.” The transfiguration on the mountaintop was not the full transfiguration. Christ still had to pass through crucifixion and enter into resurrection. Matthew specifically says that the disciples “were exceedingly grieved.” According to the concept of Peter, James, and John, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified. Thus, they might have said, “Christ has already been transfigured. Why does He still need to pass through crucifixion and resurrection?” Because the disciples had a mistaken concept, they were grieved at the Lord’s word.</p>
<p data-content-id="KJEWVtLfOnw9Yxg9_3P5HLPt37vAanTep0fB8fNd2CrXG7zPGzDylZTVqAClKS52d"> We also may have times when we have a foretaste of the transfiguration. Afterward, however, we still need to descend from the mountain and bear the cross in the presence of our husband or wife. No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross. By bearing the cross we pass through crucifixion into resurrection. This is the connection between these three sections of Matthew.</p>

APPLICATION OF THE REVELATION<br/>AND VISION CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz7FIcILxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> Unless we receive light from the Lord, it is difficult to see the connection between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63590" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-23">verses 1 through 23</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63591" data-verses="Matthew 17:24-27">verses 24 through 27</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="597" id="597">[597]</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63592" data-verses="Matthew 17:24-27">17:24-27</span> we have the matter of paying the half-shekel to the poll-tax gatherers. This is a test to determine whether or not we know how to apply the revelation and vision concerning Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63593" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> Peter received a clear revelation from the heavenly Father regarding Christ as the Son of the living God. From that time onward, Peter was certain that Christ was the Son of the living God. Following this, on the mountaintop he saw a vision of Christ manifested as the Son of the living God. Therefore, he both received the revelation and saw the vision. It is possible to have a revelation without having a vision. What Peter received from the heavenly Father in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63594" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> was merely the revelation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63595" data-verses="Matthew 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> he saw the Son of God manifested and expressed through the man Jesus of Nazareth. Nothing could have been more clear than this revelation and vision.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxCkUmKcLa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> Peter, however, had to be tested regarding the application of the revelation and the vision. To receive the revelation and to see the vision is one thing, but to apply them in a practical way is another. For example, we probably all have received the revelation from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63596" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> that we have been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in us. Perhaps even the weakest one among us has received this revelation. However, when your wife or husband gives you a difficult time, can you still say, “It is not I, but Christ”? When you are with your wife or husband, the revelation of having been crucified with Christ and of Christ living in you may vanish. Very few who have received this revelation apply it to the practical matters in their daily living. Peter might have been like this. He might have said, “I have received the revelation that Jesus is the Son of the living God, and I saw Him transfigured on the mountain. This is very clear to me. Perhaps you have not seen this vision, but I have.” For Peter to receive the revelation and see the vision was wonderful. But now he had to be tested by those who collected the poll tax.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkR_TE-wmiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4">A. Peter’s Natural Concept</h2><p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCdaIPZBmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63597" data-verses="Matthew 17:24">Verse 24</span> says, “And when they came to Capernaum, <span class="pg" data-page-id="598" id="598">[598]</span> those who received the half-shekel came to Peter and said, Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel?” The half-shekel was a Jewish poll tax for the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63598" data-verses="Exodus 30:12-16">Exo. 30:12-16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63599" data-verses="Exodus 38:26">38:26</span>). When Peter was asked this question, he immediately said, “Yes.” Peter did not know how to apply the revelation and the vision, and he was exposed. On the mount of transfiguration, Peter heard the voice from heaven charging him to hear Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63600" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">17:5</span>). If he had still remembered what had taken place on the mountain, he would have referred the question to Christ to hear what He would say. But instead of listening to Christ, he gave his own answer. On the mountain Peter heard the Father say, “This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight; hear Him!” At that time, Peter talked too much, and he was rebuked for it. Now when the poll-tax gatherers asked him whether or not the Lord paid the half-shekel, he still had too much to say and did not hesitate to answer. If he had learned the lesson, he would have said, “Gentlemen, let me go to Him and hear Him. I need to ask Him whether or not He pays the half-shekel. I don’t have the right to say anything.” Peter, however, did not respond this way, and he was exposed by this test. It is the same with us today. After a conference or training, we may proclaim that we shall never be the same. But I assure you that after you return home, you will be exactly the same. However, do not let this disappoint you.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_5ZLHRtmhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt">B. Christ’s Correction</h2><p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57fiGE3auTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63601" data-verses="Matthew 17:25-26">Verses 25 and 26</span> say, “And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers? And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free.” The poll-tax gatherers came to Peter because he was so prominent, like the nose on our face. The quick ones, the bold ones, are the “nose” in the church life. Whenever the church undergoes a test, the “nose” is the part that gets hurt because it is the first to bump into things. Because he stood out so much, Peter got into <span class="pg" data-page-id="599" id="599">[599]</span> trouble. After telling the tax gatherers that the Lord Jesus paid the half-shekel, Peter came into the house. But as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63602" data-verses="Matthew 17:25">verse 25</span> says, Jesus “anticipated him.” Peter was quick, but the Lord was sovereign and did not give him a chance to say anything. On the mountaintop Peter was interrupted by a voice from heaven, and in the house he was stopped by the Lord. Peter had spoken presumptuously. Hence, the Lord stopped him and corrected him before he could speak to Him.</p>

<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faEKSui5KZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> The Lord asked Peter whether the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax from their sons or from strangers. The sons of kings are always free from paying custom or poll tax. The half-shekel was paid by God’s people for His temple. Since Christ is the Son of God, He was free from paying it. This was contrary to what Peter had just answered.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5jrna4-Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> Peter had received the revelation concerning Christ being the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63603" data-verses="Matthew 16:16-17">16:16-17</span>) and he had seen the vision of the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63604" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">17:5</span>). Now, in application, he was put to the test by the poll-tax gatherers’ question. He failed in his answer by forgetting the revelation he had received and the vision he had seen. He forgot that the Lord was the Son of God who did not need to pay the poll tax for His Father’s house.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn6fgbQzZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> When the Lord asked Peter whether the kings of the earth received tax from their sons or from strangers, Peter answered, “From strangers.” Doctrinally and theologically Peter answered correctly. When the Lord said to him, “Then the sons are free,” Peter must have been stunned. It seems that the Lord was saying, “Peter, have you forgotten the revelation that I am the Son? On the mountaintop you saw Me as the Son.” The half-shekel was not a tax paid to the secular government. It was collected for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the temple of God, God’s house on earth. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63605" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63606" data-verses="Exodus 38:1">38</span>, every Israelite had to pay a half-shekel to care for the Lord’s house. Because Jesus is the Son of God, there is no need for Him to pay this tax. When the Lord said that the sons are free, He was indicating that He, as the Son of God, <span class="pg" data-page-id="600" id="600">[600]</span> was free from paying the poll tax. After hearing this, Peter did not know what to say. He might have just agreed and said, “Yes, the sons are free. Since You are the Son of God, You are free. Lord, I am sorry for answering the way I did. I forgot the revelation and the vision. I received the revelation that You are the Son of God, and I saw the vision of You as the Son of God. But when the test came, I forgot all about it. Lord, please forgive me.”</p>

Flexibility by Christ<br/>as the Living Law-giver Replacing Moses</h2><p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLZjxeVCDfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63607" data-verses="Matthew 17:27">Verse 27</span> says, “But that we may not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for Me and you.” After convincing Peter that He did not need to pay the half-shekel, the Lord, as the New Testament Law-giver, today’s Moses, gave the command to Peter to pay it for Him. The Lord did this purposely to teach Peter that in God’s New Testament economy, He is the unique One; neither Moses, Elijah, Peter, nor anyone else has the position to speak or to give a command.</p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0ix4ckjHM-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux">D. Application through a Miracle<br/>Prophesied by Christ<br/>as the Living Prophet Replacing Elijah</h2><p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GrSVFf8AsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> After shutting Peter’s mouth, the Lord, as the New Testament prophet, today’s Elijah, told him to go fishing to obtain a shekel in order to pay the tax. This prophecy was fulfilled. No doubt Peter was troubled about having to go fishing and perhaps having to wait a long time for a fish to appear with a shekel in its mouth. While the Lord was correcting and teaching Peter, He took care of his need. This is always the Lord’s way in dealing with us.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XruqKH_q55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> When Peter answered yes, the Lord said no. But when Peter was convinced that the Lord did not need to pay the tax, the Lord told him that He would pay it. Perhaps Peter was about to go after the poll-tax gatherers and tell them that the Lord did not need to pay the tax. Peter might have <span class="pg" data-page-id="601" id="601">[601]</span> been considering this when the Lord charged him to catch a fish with a shekel in its mouth and to use that shekel to pay the tax. The tax had to be paid in order not to stumble others. We cannot subdue the Lord Jesus. Whatever He says is always right, and whatever we propose to Him is always wrong. Christ is today’s Moses; He makes the laws. When He says yes, the answer is yes; and when He says no, it is no. What we say means nothing. It is what He says that counts. The meaning of the vision on the mountaintop is that we should hear the Lord Jesus and not anyone else, including ourselves. Christ, not Moses, is the One to say yes or no. Regarding the same matter, the Lord may say yes to someone else and no to you. If he does this, do not argue with Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovhYTxzigRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> When Peter had to go fishing in order to find a half-shekel, he learned a lesson. Don’t you think that Peter was troubled by having to go fishing? Certainly he was. Although the Lord Jesus is kind and merciful, One who will not break a bruised reed or quench smoking flax, He sometimes deals with us in a hard way. When the Lord indicated to Peter that He would pay the temple tax, He did not reach into His pocket, take out a shekel, and give it to Peter. If He had done that, He would have been too easy on Peter. A shekel had been prepared by the Lord, but Peter had to fish for it. I wonder how Peter felt. Did he feel like laughing or weeping? I believe that as Peter was fishing, he was unhappy and very troubled. If I had been Peter, I might have said to the Lord, “Lord, since You can provide a shekel out of the mouth of a fish, why don’t You just reach into Your pocket and give me one? Why are You so troublesome? Now I must go down to the sea and fish. Maybe a storm will come while I am fishing. Lord, if You intend to perform a miracle, why not do it now?” Peter, however, had learned a great deal; and this time, instead of saying a word, he did what the Lord had told him.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMlueJEjTAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> I do not believe that the fish came immediately. Rather, I believe that the Lord exercised His sovereignty to keep the fish away for a period of time. Thus, Peter was waiting without any sign of a fish. As he was waiting, he <span class="pg" data-page-id="602" id="602">[602]</span> might have rebuked himself and said, “Why did I answer so quickly? I shouldn’t have faced those tax gatherers. James and John didn't get into trouble. But because I am so bold and so quick, I got myself into trouble.” Eventually, the fish came with a shekel in its mouth. This was sufficient to take care of both the Lord and Peter.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqCixFI4f5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> The record here is very simple, but the story is rich in its implications. It implies that Christ is the Prophet, for He told Peter to go fishing and that the first fish would have a shekel in its mouth. Was that not a prophecy? The Lord’s prophecy was practical, and it was fulfilled exactly as He had spoken. Thus, Peter’s experience here was a proof that the Lord is the real Elijah and that we should hear Him. This story also implies that the Lord is today’s Moses. It is not up to us to say yes or no; it is altogether up to Him. We simply need to do whatever He says. Moreover, we should not do what He doesn’t tell us to do.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-hVUzwzKgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> Through this incident, Peter was tested that he might know how to apply the revelation and the vision concerning Christ. Through this experience, he came to learn what it means to “hear Him.” He realized that he did not need to hear Moses or Elijah, but to hear Him. For us today, Christ is our Moses and Elijah. He is our present, living Law-giver and our Prophet. Whatever He says, that is the law, the law of life. Furthermore, what He says is today’s prophecy to meet our present, practical situation. This is not merely a story; it is a lesson for Peter and for us as well.</p>

In previous chapters we have seen the King’s decree of the constitution of the kingdom, the King’s ministry, and the revelation of the mystery of the kingdom. We have also seen the pathway to glory and the practical matters that followed the Lord’s transfiguration. Now we must see the relationships among the kingdom people, that is, how to be related to one another in the kingdom. This is a practical matter. It is not merely doctrinal, as the constitution of the kingdom, or prophetic, as the mystery of the kingdom. In particular, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63611" data-verses="Matthew 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> deals with how to be in the kingdom of the heavens: it is to become as little children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63612" data-verses="Matthew 18:2-4">vv. 2-4</span>); not to stumble others or to set up any stumbling block (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63613" data-verses="Matthew 18:5-9">vv. 5-9</span>); not to despise even a little believer (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63614" data-verses="Matthew 18:10-14">vv. 10-14</span>); to hear the church and not be condemned by it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63615" data-verses="Matthew 18:15-20">vv. 15-20</span>); and to forgive a brother to the uttermost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63616" data-verses="Matthew 18:21-35">vv. 21-35</span>). All this indicates that to enter into the kingdom of the heavens we must be humble and not despise any believer, but love our brother and forgive our brother.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rRGFsUyQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> Before we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63617" data-verses="Matthew 18:1-20">18:1-20</span>, we need to have an overall view of these three chapters, which cover five matters. The first is pride. If we would relate to others in a proper way in the kingdom, our pride needs to be dealt with. We need humility. Not one of us is a humble person. Every fallen person is proud. In the past certain brothers and sisters have told me that their wives or husbands were humble. <span class="pg" data-page-id="604" id="604">[604]</span> Later these brothers and sisters had to admit that their wives or husbands were not that humble. Some brothers who had told me that their wives would never give them a problem later came to me in tears telling me of the trouble they were having with their wives. There is no such thing as a humble person.</p>
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePB3dgQAgGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> Being in the kingdom is a corporate matter, not an individual matter. However, whenever we come together as a company, there will be difficulties. This is the reason certain young people do not want to get married. Although it will cause them problems, the young people nevertheless need to get married. Because it is difficult to be together in company, Matthew includes these chapters covering our relationships with one another. We have no choice concerning this. If I had my choice, I would prefer to stay by myself, devote all my time to prayer, and wait alone for the kingdom to come. But we have been predestinated to be together. However, in our being together pride is the first problem.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvX3NggqPuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> The second problem is our inability to forgive others. The matter of forgiveness is covered in the second half of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63618" data-verses="Matthew 18:1">chapter eighteen</span>. We all must learn to forgive others, something that none of us enjoys doing. Deep within our heart, we do not want to forgive others.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LSELnLtPaKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> According to the Bible, to forgive is to forget. For us, to forgive a person may mean that we simply do not care about the particular offense. However, we still remember it. How difficult it is to forget an offense against us! Without the Lord’s mercy and grace, we would remember others’ offenses even in eternity. But when God forgives, He forgets. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63619" data-verses="Hebrews 10:17">Hebrews 10:17</span> says, “And their sins and their lawlessnesses I will by no means remember any more.” To forgive something absolutely is to forget it. Our Father in heaven considers us as if we have never sinned, for He has forgiven and forgotten our sins. But when we forgive an offense, we often remind others of it. For example, a sister may say, “The elders treated me very poorly; however, I have forgiven them. But let me tell you a little about what <span class="pg" data-page-id="605" id="605">[605]</span> happened.” Genuine forgiveness means that we forget the offense.</p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFZ4ZKSHQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> The root of our unwillingness to forgive others lies in our dispositional anger. No matter how nice you may be, you still have dispositional anger. The reason you are offended is that you have such a disposition. I may strike a chair again and again, but the chair will not be offended because it has no disposition. But if I strike you, you will be offended because of the dispositional anger hidden within you. We all are subject to dispositional anger. Sometimes when I have offended a brother, he has said that he does not care about the offense. Actually, we all care when we are offended. The outward reaction or appearance may be different, but the dispositional anger, the anger hidden in our disposition, is the same. Because of our dispositional anger, it is difficult to forgive others.</p>
<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgj3tK_z3SNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> This dispositional anger shows up between husbands and wives. I advise the young sisters never to offend their husbands. If they do, it will be hard for their husbands to forget that offense. Although your husband may say that he has forgiven you, deep within he has not done so. Every man has a disposition that makes it easy for him to be offended, especially by his wife. Women find it easy to complain to their husbands. The reason there are so many separations and divorces is that the women complain and that the men find it difficult to forgive. Sisters, try your best not to complain to your husband. If he is late, forget about it. Do not make an issue of it. Brothers, I advise you to ignore the complaints of your wife. I advise the sisters not to complain and the brothers not to be offended.</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I_X46365x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> We have seen the matters of pride and of our inability to forgive others. Now we come to the problem of lust, which is indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63620" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>. In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens lust was thoroughly dealt with. It was also touched in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63621" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, the chapter concerning the mystery of the kingdom of the heavens. Lust is a great problem to the kingdom people. Many separations and divorces are related to lust. Therefore, in <span class="pg" data-page-id="606" id="606">[606]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63622" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> the Lord Jesus touched this matter of lust. Apart from the Lord’s grace, none of us is able to overcome it.</p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4MBayaAv8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> The fourth problem is the problem of riches. It is very difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, even more difficult than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. The matter of riches is a great frustration to the kingdom life, and it is also dealt with in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens and in the parable of the sower in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63623" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZQjOdy8iy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> The last problem is ambition, which is covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63624" data-verses="Matthew 20:1">chapter twenty</span>. Zebedee’s wife, ambitious that her two sons would enjoy a high position in the kingdom, said to the Lord, “Say that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and one on Your left, in Your kingdom” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63625" data-verses="Matthew 20:21">20:21</span>). The Lord told her that she did not know what she was asking. Matthew records the story of Zebedee’s wife making requests for her sons, but John does not record it because his Gospel is not the Gospel dealing with the kingdom. Matthew records this incident because in the kingdom there is the problem of ambition for position.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS-368fV-asIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> Ambition has been a problem both in the East and in the West. Many times when elders were appointed in the churches, brothers were offended because others were appointed instead of them. Although, at the most, a church needed three or four elders, the number of self-appointed candidates for eldership might have been more than fifteen. Whether or not those brothers prayed about being appointed elders, I do not know. But I am rather certain that they expected to be appointed. When they realized that they had not been appointed elders, they began to speak negatively about the church, simply because they did not receive the position they desired. We have encountered this problem in the church in Taipei, a church with more than twenty thousand members. Every time a new home meeting was opened, there was a need to appoint two or three leading brothers and leading sisters to manage the practical affairs of that home meeting. Nearly <span class="pg" data-page-id="607" id="607">[607]</span> every time the leading ones were appointed, some sister was offended because she was not among those appointed. Because they were offended, they stopped coming to the meetings for a period of time. This exposes the problem of ambition.</p>

<p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2wfKrE9R0EzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> These three chapters actually cover these five things. They deal thoroughly with pride, dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition. All these problems are within us. If we would get into the depths of these chapters, we would certainly be touched. For instance, we would see that we are people full of pride and that anger is hidden in our disposition. No matter how patient or forbearing we try to be, anger is still deeply rooted in our disposition. This is what makes it difficult for us to forgive others. Furthermore, we are troubled by lust and riches, both of which damage the kingdom life. Finally, there is the problem of ambition. Matthew purposely covers these five problems in his Gospel to show that we must take care of them in order to be in the kingdom. Pride, dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition are all “scorpions.” We need a divine pest control to kill these “scorpions.” Under God’s inspiration, Matthew selected various cases and put them together in order to expose these things. Now we need to consider them one by one.</p>

In principle, all the kingdom people must be little children. To be humble is to be like a little child. If we are not humble, we shall either be offended by others or we shall offend others, that is, we shall either be stumbled by others or stumble others. All stumbling takes place because of pride. If we were not proud, we would not be stumbled. The fact that we can be stumbled proves that we are proud. If a little child is offended, the offense will be forgotten in just a few minutes. But once adults are offended, they are stumbled because of their pride. Furthermore, the stumbling we cause to others also issues from our pride. <span class="pg" data-page-id="608" id="608">[608]</span> </p>

If the hand, the foot, or the eye causes us to stumble, we must deal with these causes of stumbling in a serious way. Otherwise, we shall not be one in the proper kingdom life. In order to be in the proper kingdom life, we need to be humble. Then we shall not be stumbled or be a cause of stumbling to others. All stumbling must be abandoned.</p>

A Gentile or tax collector is someone who does not have fellowship in the kingdom life or in the church life. To consider someone a Gentile or a tax collector does not mean to excommunicate him. It means that he is considered as one cut off from the fellowship of the church. Excommunication is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63635" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:1">1 Corinthians 5</span>. The church must excommunicate fornicators and idolaters. But the offending brother who will not listen to two or three or to the church may not necessarily require excommunication. Although the situation with him is unpleasant, it is not in the same category as fornication or idolatry. He is cut off from the fellowship of the church in order that this loss of fellowship may encourage him to repent and to recover his fellowship with the church.</p>

<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUoVWDU4s0trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> It may seem that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63650" data-verses="Matthew 18:1">Matthew 18</span> is not a deep chapter and that the parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63651" data-verses="Matthew 18:23-35">verses 23 through 35</span> is shallow. Actually, what is revealed in this chapter is very deep. When most Christians read Matthew, they do not realize that this book deals not only with the doctrine of the kingdom, but with the practical kingdom life. If we would understand any portion of Matthew, we need to keep this fact in mind. When I was young, I did not care to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63652" data-verses="Matthew 18:1">Matthew 18</span> because I did not see that this chapter deals with the kingdom life. Although you have read this chapter before, you probably have not seen what it really deals with. Rather, you may have thought that it is merely concerned with Christian behavior, that it is merely a word about forgiving our brothers. Because of our natural concept, we do not see that this chapter is deeply concerned with the kingdom life.</p>
<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbY1s6EdLQZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> The fact that this portion of the Word deals with the practical kingdom life is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63653" data-verses="Matthew 18:1">verse 1</span>: “In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?” To enter into the kingdom of the heavens means to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, this chapter, along with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63654" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">chapters nineteen</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63655" data-verses="Matthew 20:1">twenty</span>, deals with the kingdom life.</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiDKxKzApM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> In order to remain in the kingdom life, we must have humility. If we have humility, we shall neither offend others nor be offended by others. We shall neither stumble others nor be stumbled by them. All stumbling, of <span class="pg" data-page-id="614" id="614">[614]</span> ourselves or of others, comes from pride. We need to hate pride and treat it as a “gopher” that must be killed. Otherwise, the “gopher” of pride will ruin the kingdom life.</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0cEzRmEM_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63656" data-verses="Matthew 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> we see how to deal with someone who offends others. If a brother offends us, we should go to him directly in love. If he does not listen to us, we should go to him again with one or two witnesses. If he still does not listen to us, even in the presence of witnesses, we should tell the matter to the church and let the church deal with him. If he refuses to hear the church, then the church should consider him a heathen or a tax collector and cut off his fellowship with the church. Although this is a word telling us how to deal with a brother who causes offenses, it is also a word indicating that it is a serious matter to offend others. The seriousness of this is shown by the danger of being cut off from the fellowship of the church. To be cut off from the fellowship of the church means to be put out of the kingdom life. This is serious.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEEsnpmoyrHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> In the Lord’s word about dealing with an offending brother, the authority of the kingdom is involved. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63657" data-verses="Matthew 18:18">Verse 18</span> says, “Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in heaven.” If someone offends the brothers and rebels against the church, the heavens will bind him. Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63658" data-verses="Matthew 18:18">verse 18</span> says that the church binds what has already been bound in the heavens. This indicates that the offense and the rebellion cause the heavens to bind the one responsible for the offense. If you reject the church and rebel against the church, the heavens will bind you. Because the heavens have bound you already, the church executes what the heavens have already bound. If you consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63659" data-verses="Matthew 18:18">verse 18</span> in its context, you will realize that it is not an insignificant matter to rebel against the church. The church simply follows the heavens to bind what the heavens have already bound. The church’s binding is the execution of the heavens’ binding. Before the church says, “Lord, we bind this rebellious brother,” he has already been bound in the heavens. <span class="pg" data-page-id="615" id="615">[615]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5jrHa48Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> The same is true regarding repentance. To repent to the church for your rebellion is a matter of great significance. If you repent to the church, the heavens will immediately loose you, and then the church will loose what has been loosed in the heavens. To rebel against the church is serious, and to repent to the church is very significant. By this we see that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63660" data-verses="Matthew 18:1">Matthew 18</span> covers the kingdom life.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn6fAbQxZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> What is found here is not simply a matter about offending someone or listening to the church. It is a matter of whether or not we shall remain in the kingdom. If we rebel against the church, the heavens stand behind the church and support it. Hence, if you rebel against the church, the heavens will say, “I bind you.” Then the church will rise up to bind what the heavens have bound. But if you repent, the heavens will say, “You are loosed.” Then the church will carry out what has been loosed in the heavens. Whether we rebel against the church or repent to the church, both are serious. Both reveal that our relationship with the brothers and with the church has a great deal to do with the kingdom life.</p>

Forgiving the Offending Brother<br/>Even Seventy Times Seven</h2>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0ix48kgGs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> After listening to the Lord’s word about the kingdom life, Peter asked Him a question: “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Until seven times?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63661" data-verses="Matthew 18:21">v. 21</span>). Peter did not ask this on behalf of others; rather, being quick and bold, he asked it according to what was in him. Those who are quick often offend others. The more active, quick, and bold we are, the more we offend others. But those who are cautious and slow rarely offend anyone. Why was it not John who asked this question? It was Peter who was concerned about the Lord’s word regarding the offending brother. Because Peter often offended others, he was very concerned and asked the Lord about forgiveness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="616" id="616">[616]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GrS1Fc9gsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63662" data-verses="Matthew 18:22">Verse 22</span> says, “Jesus says to him, I do not say to you until seven times, but until seventy times seven.” Seventy times seven means that we must forgive others an unlimited number of times. There is no need to count or keep a record of the number of times you forgive others. Over and over and over, you need to forgive them.</p>

<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMlu-JHgzAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63663" data-verses="Matthew 18:23-35">verses 23 through 35</span> the Lord gives a parable as an illustration. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63664" data-verses="Matthew 18:23-24">Verses 23 and 24</span> say, “Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is likened to a man, a king, who desired to settle accounts with his slaves. And when he began to settle them, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.” According to the context of this parable, the settling of accounts here refers to the Lord’s dealing with us in this age through such things as severe illness or certain extreme hardships which cause us to realize how much we owe the Lord and to beg Him to forgive us. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63665" data-verses="Matthew 18:24">verse 24</span>, one slave owed him ten thousand talents, that is, about twelve million dollars. It was impossible for the debtor to pay off this debt. This refers to the heavy debt of our failures accumulated after we were saved.</p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqCiRFL7_5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v">2.

This refers to the forgiveness of our debts in our defeated Christian life for the restoration of our fellowship with the Lord.</p>

The hundred denarii spoken of in this verse is less than a millionth part of ten thousand talents. This refers to a brother’s sin against us after we have been saved. How small is any brother’s debt to us compared to our debt to the Lord!</p>

And he would not, but went away and threw him into prison until he should pay what was owed.” The offended brother, the one not willing to forgive others, was certainly saved. Thus, in this parable the Lord is dealing not with sinners, but with believers, with saved ones. He deals with a brother who has been offended, yet who is not willing to forgive.</p>

If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, we shall be disciplined by the Lord until we forgive him from the heart, that is, until we have paid everything we owe. Then the Lord will forgive us. This is forgiveness in the kingdom. This implies that if <span class="pg" data-page-id="618" id="618">[618]</span> we do not forgive a brother from our heart today, we shall not be allowed to enter into the kingdom in the coming age.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuatKNTqnji_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> Many Christians do not understand this portion of the Word. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63671" data-verses="Matthew 18:34-35">Verses 34 and 35</span> indicate that the one who does not forgive his brother from his heart will be under the hand of the tormentors until he forgives everything. Certainly such a one is a saved one. Nevertheless, he is given over to the tormentors for a period of time. This does not mean, however, that he is cast into prison forever. Rather, he will be tormented until he pays the debt, that is, until he forgives his brother from his heart.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVGWW7k8NTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> Today most Christians believe that as long as they are saved, there will be no problem in the future. But in this parable the one who refuses to forgive his fellow slaves is not a false Christian, but a real Christian. You need to realize that it is possible for a real Christian one day to be delivered to the tormentors. Perhaps you will say, “The Lord Jesus will not do this to me. I have never robbed a bank. I have always been righteous and have not mistreated others.” But the Lord may say, “No, you didn’t rob a bank or damage anyone, but you have not forgiven your brother from your heart.” Do you think that such an unforgiving brother is actually in the kingdom in a practical way? According to God’s mathematics, to forgive is to forget. However, you may not be willing to forgive those who have offended you. This is a serious matter. If you claim to be in the kingdom life in a practical way, why then are you not willing to forgive others from the heart? Your unwillingness to forgive causes you to lose the kingdom life.</p>
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7ORiHPKvG0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63672" data-verses="Matthew 18:15-20">verses 15 through 20</span> the emphasis is on the offending brother needing to repent. But in the parable the emphasis is on the offended one needing to forgive. Both our unwillingness to repent and our unwillingness to forgive will keep us out of the kingdom. If we offend someone but are not willing to repent and ask for forgiveness, we shall be kept out of the kingdom. In the same principle, if we are offended but are unwilling to forgive, we shall also be kept out of the kingdom. Often we think that we are in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="619" id="619">[619]</span> kingdom when, according to God’s mathematics, we are not. It depends on whether or not we are willing, on the one hand, to repent and ask for forgiveness and, on the other hand, to forgive others from our heart.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKmxdwqR5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> I have observed these two problems in the church life throughout the years. When certain brothers offended others, they were not willing to repent and ask for forgiveness. As a result, they were out of the church life. By being out of the church life, they were out of the kingdom. I also saw those who were offended but who were not willing to forgive the one who had offended them. They also were kept from the church life. Apparently those who do not repent and those who do not forgive others are in the kingdom. Actually, according to God’s reckoning, they are not.</p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAUiEcU3szKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> Whenever a church is newly established, the church experiences a honeymoon. During the honeymoon, everything is wonderful. The brothers and sisters say, “How marvelous it is to be in the church! We used to be scattered and divided in the denominations. But now the captives have returned home. Praise the Lord for bringing us back!” However, as time goes by, there will be offenses. In the church life we simply cannot avoid offending one another, for we are daily in close contact with one another. We may offend others without having any intention of doing so. From the day I first came into the ministry until now, I have not had any intention to offend anyone. I have even prayed that the Lord would give me wisdom to know how to go in and out among the Lord’s people. But no matter how much I prayed to the Lord regarding this, I have unconsciously and unintentionally offended others. The same is true in married life. I do not believe that there is one couple who has not had offenses between them. Offenses are unavoidable.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPMehzkPoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> During the years, I have visited church after church. Everyone in a new church is happy, and all the faces are smiling. But when I visited the same church two years later, I saw many unhappy faces there. Privately I contacted some of those who seemed the most unhappy <span class="pg" data-page-id="620" id="620">[620]</span> and asked what had happened to them and why they were silent in the meetings. They told me of the offenses and the unhappy feelings toward the elders or toward others. Whenever I heard this, I prayed desperately for the church and said, “Lord, the church simply cannot go on like this.” Then I contacted the elders and asked them about the situation. Sometimes the elders said, “Brother Lee, forget about that person. Although he was one of the pioneers of the church life here, he has offended almost everyone.” Upon hearing this, I asked the elders if they would forgive him. In many cases, they were unwilling to do so. Thus, one side was unwilling to repent, and the other side was unwilling to forgive. If such a situation continues, the church life is over. The saints may still come together and sing a few hymns, but because of the offenses, the judgment, and the unwillingness to repent or to forgive, there is no kingdom life in that place. God who sees everything knows what is hidden beneath the surface of the church life. We may meet as a church, but among us there may not actually be the kingdom life. Because of the unwillingness to repent and to forgive, the kingdom life vanishes.</p>

<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsQdar2cthgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> In God’s governmental administration, His forgiveness is dispensational. For His administration, He has planned different ages. The period from the first coming of Christ to eternity is divided dispensationally into three ages: this age, the present one, from Christ’s first to His second coming; the coming age, the millennium, the one thousand years for restoration and heavenly reigning, from Christ’s second coming to the end of the old heaven and the old earth; and eternity, the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. God’s forgiveness in this age is for sinners’ eternal salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63673" data-verses="Acts 2:38">Acts 2:38</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63674" data-verses="Acts 5:31">5:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63675" data-verses="Acts 13:39">13:39</span>).

He will not be rewarded with the kingdom to participate in the glory and joy with Christ in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, but will be disciplined to make a clearance of this sin and be forgiven in the coming age. This kind of forgiveness will maintain his eternal salvation, but will not qualify him to participate in the glory and joy of the coming kingdom.</p>

This means that he will not share in the manifestation of the kingdom. Do not listen to the mistaken teachings that Christians cannot have any problems in the coming age. Some will have great problems and will be excluded from the glory and joy which the overcomers will share with the Lord Jesus during the millennium. Furthermore, they may be put under the hands of the tormentors. If today you can be considered by the church as a heathen or a tax collector, then what will happen to you during the manifestation of the kingdom? It is a very serious matter to offend the saints or the church and to rebel against the church. If you remain in such a state, where will you be at the time of the manifestation of the kingdom? Also, what about those who are unwilling to forgive those who have offended them? Yes, certain ones may have offended you, but you need to remember how much God the Father has forgiven you. Why will you not conduct yourself as a beloved son of the Father and forgive others as He has forgiven you? We all have a weakness here, for we all are unwilling to forgive others. If you still remember a brother’s offense against you, it indicates that you have not forgiven him from your heart. If this is your <span class="pg" data-page-id="622" id="622">[622]</span> situation when the kingdom comes, you will be delivered to the tormentors.</p>

Many Christians do not know how to interpret this part of the Word because they have not seen God’s dispensational administration. They do not realize that God has ordained three ages: the present age, the coming age, and the eternal age. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63678" data-verses="Matthew 12:32">Matthew 12:32</span>, certain sins cannot be forgiven either in this age or in the coming age. This indicates that other sins can be forgiven in this age or in the next age. If you offend the church and rebel against the church, you commit a sin. But if you repent to the church, this sin will be forgiven in this age. However, if you do not repent to the church, this sin will not be forgiven in this age. Rather, you will need to wait until the coming kingdom age before this sin is forgiven. During the kingdom age, you will be under the discipline of God. Then you will repent and be forgiven. Although you may be disciplined in the coming age and dealt with by God, you will not be lost. After you have been dealt with, you will repent and apply the blood. Then, in that age, you will be forgiven. We need to be very serious about this matter. Have you offended anyone? If you have, you need to repent. Has anyone offended you? If so, by the Lord’s grace you must forgive that offense and forget about it. If we do this, there will be no friction among us. All offenses will be removed by our repentance and forgiveness.</p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4MBqyfAP8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> If we do not practice the way of repentance and forgiveness, the longer we stay in the church life, the more offenses there will be. The offenses will accumulate until they are as high as a mountain. This will annul the kingdom life and cause us to forfeit the church life. May the Lord grant us the grace we need. If I offend you, I need to go to you and repent. If you offend me, I need to look to the Lord for the grace to forgive you from my heart. And once I have forgiven an offense, I should forget it and never mention it again. If we do this, we shall have the proper <span class="pg" data-page-id="623" id="623">[623]</span> kingdom life. Then we shall share in the manifestation of the kingdom. Otherwise, during the millennium we shall be under God’s discipline so that we will repent of our offense or forgive the one who offended us.</p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63680" data-verses="Matthew 19:3-12">19:3-12</span> the Pharisees tempt the Lord by asking Him about divorce, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63681" data-verses="Matthew 19:16-22">19:16-22</span> a rich man inquires of Him concerning eternal life. The Gospel of John does not mention either of these cases. But in Matthew they are not only recorded; they are put in the same portion of Matthew’s Gospel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63682" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> we see the matter of divorce and the matter of loving riches. Between these two things we have the matter of receiving the little children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63683" data-verses="Matthew 19:13-15">vv. 13-15</span>). Apparently, these three things are not related. But when we get into the depths of the significance of these things, we see that all are related to entering the kingdom of the heavens. Hence, they are the requirements of the kingdom.</p>

<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn6fQbYjpz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> If we mean business with the Lord concerning the kingdom, we must deal with lust, pride, and the love of wealth. The Gospel of John says nothing about dealing with lust because John is a book of life. But because Matthew is a book on the kingdom, it speaks of dealing with lust and other things as well. The kingdom is a matter of exercise, and most of this exercise involves various kinds of dealings. Lust, pride, and the love of wealth keep us from entering into the kingdom. The love of money is no doubt related to the self. By nature, we all love money for ourselves. However, if we would enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we must deal with this love of money. Again and again, the Gospel of Matthew deals with lust. In the constitution of the heavenly kingdom, the King explicitly mentions dealing with lust. The reference to plucking out our eyes or cutting off our hands in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63688" data-verses="Matthew 5:29-30">Matthew 5:29 and 30</span> shows how strict and serious we must be in this matter. Otherwise, there is no way to enter the kingdom of the heavens. The thorough dealing with lust has been neglected by today’s Christians. Very few Christians have ever heard a sober word from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63689" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63690" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">19</span> regarding lust. Because of this lack, there is no genuine church life or kingdom of the heavens among today’s Christians. How the Lord needs a testimony on earth! For His testimony the Lord must have a recovery. We are not concerned about having a large number. At the time of Elijah, the Lord had only seven thousand. If the Lord had seven thousand in this country, He would have a prevailing testimony against all adulterous things.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19M_I3BHAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63691" data-verses="Matthew 19:3">Matthew 19:3</span> says, “And the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?” The religionists did not let the Lord go, but came again and again to tempt Him. However, their tempting always afforded the Lord an opportunity to unveil Himself and God’s economy. Here <span class="pg" data-page-id="627" id="627">[627]</span> the opposition of the religionists afforded the Lord the opportunity to expose the seriousness of divorce. The source of divorce is lust. If there were no lust, there would not be any divorce.</p>
<p data-content-id="O5Us-Y27ulW9G-CiFo-HH1W9SLlvFgnd97jagSjZfq71HumK9i3Q1k113CGe2BNcp"> The Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63692" data-verses="Matthew 19:4-6">19:4-6</span> not only recognizes God’s creation of man, but also confirms God’s ordination of marriage, that is, one man and one woman joined and yoked together as one flesh, inseparable by man. Marriage is the union of one man and one woman. This is God’s ordination, and it is very serious for anyone to break it. God’s ordination here involves not only physical things, but also spiritual things; for the union of one man and one woman in marriage signifies the oneness of Christ and the church. As there is one husband for one wife, so there is one Christ for one church. There should not be more than one wife for one husband, or more than one husband for one wife. How serious it would be if there were one Christ and many churches, or one church and more than one Christ! God’s ordination is to have one Christ and one church. In figure and in shadow, there must be one wife for one husband. That this was God’s ordination in creation is clearly recorded in the Word.</p>
<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCh4CttQQ2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63693" data-verses="Matthew 19:7">verse 7</span> the Pharisees asked the Lord, “Why then did Moses command to give her a writing of divorce and to put her away?” This commandment was not a part of the basic law, but a supplement to the law. It was given by Moses, not according to God’s ordination from the beginning, but temporarily because of the hardness of man’s heart.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk6D-ZdK61byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> Instead of arguing with the Pharisees, the Lord said, “Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it has not been so.” The commandment concerning divorce given by Moses was a deviation from God’s original ordination, but Christ as the heavenly King recovered it back to the beginning for the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that the kingdom of the heavens, corresponding with God’s ordination from the beginning, does not allow any divorce.</p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoIzAK7-Vsw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63694" data-verses="Matthew 19:8">verse 8</span> we see the principle of recovery. Recovery means to go back to the beginning. Things that exist may <span class="pg" data-page-id="628" id="628">[628]</span> not date back to the beginning. We need to go back to the beginning. In the beginning, God ordained one husband and one wife, and there was no divorce. Because of the hardness of the people’s hearts, Moses tolerated divorce and allowed a man to divorce his wife by giving her a writing of divorce. The Lord was asking the Pharisees if they would care for God’s ordination or for the hardness of their heart. Every seeker of God should say, “O Lord, have mercy upon me that I may care for Your original ordination. I do not want to care for the hardness of my heart. I condemn and reject the hardness of my heart and return to Your original ordination.” This is what is meant by recovery.</p>
<p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCMv9pkEb4qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> Today many Christians are arguing for certain things. Because of the hardness of the fallen human heart, the Lord tolerates some of those things. Should we agree with this toleration and the hardness of the human heart? Certainly not. Rather, we must receive the Lord’s grace to go back to God’s original ordination. We must go back to the beginning.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rRGlsThQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63695" data-verses="Matthew 19:9">Verse 9</span> says, “But I say to you that whoever puts away his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her who has been put away commits adultery.” The Greek word for fornication means harlotry, whoredom, which is worse than adultery. The Lord’s word here indicates definitely that nothing but fornication breaks the marriage tie. (Of course, death automatically breaks it.) Except for fornication, there is no ground for divorce.</p>

Once one is married, he is fully bound, without any way to be released, unless the other party commits fornication or dies. It was such a realization that caused the disciples to think that it was better not to marry. But it is not up to them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="629" id="629">[629]</span> </p>

Paul was such a one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63699" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:7-8">1 Cor. 7:7-8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63700" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:5">9:5</span>).</p>

<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzildtId8sSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> A eunuch is one who deals thoroughly with lust. In order to be such a spiritual eunuch, we need grace. Only grace can afford us the strength and the supply to have a thorough dealing with lust. Lust is a great problem in our life. Because in ourselves we are not able to deal with this “scorpion,” we need to look to the Lord and pray, “Lord, have mercy on me and grant me the grace I need.” By grace it is possible to deal with the subtle, evil “scorpion” of lust that damages our life.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFFB1m17nNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> Lust damages not only the kingdom life and the church life, but also human life. It ruins marriages and society. It damages the spirit, mind, and body. Anyone who is under the dominion of the “scorpion” of lust will be ruined for the proper human life, family life, social life, church life, and kingdom life. Lust damages every kind of life. The corruption in today’s society mainly comes from lust. If lust is dealt with, most of this corruption will disappear. We in the church life must deal with lust in a serious way. For this, we must depend on the Lord’s grace.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYBvep3TWD97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> The religionists’ temptation here afforded an opportunity for the Lord to unfold a further matter concerning <span class="pg" data-page-id="630" id="630">[630]</span> the kingdom of the heavens. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63701" data-verses="Matthew 18:1">Chapter eighteen</span> reveals how we must deal with the brothers that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63702" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> reveals that firstly married life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63703" data-verses="Matthew 19:3-12">vv. 3-12</span>) and then our attitude toward riches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63704" data-verses="Matthew 19:16-30">vv. 16-30</span>) are related to the kingdom of the heavens. Married life involves lust, and our attitude toward riches involves covetousness. The kingdom of the heavens rules out every trace of our lust and covetousness.</p>

Then He laid His hands on them. Here the Lord stresses again that to participate in the kingdom of the heavens, we must be like little children.</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiDKhK2T5M5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> On the surface, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63706" data-verses="Matthew 19:13-15">19:13-15</span> seems to deal with an insignificant matter. Actually, these verses are concerned with pride. The Lord seemed to be saying to His disciples, “You should not reject these little ones. On the contrary, you must become a little one yourself. Pride is hidden within you. You must condemn and reject your pride. If you reject your pride and become as little children, you will be in the kingdom of the heavens.”</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0cEjRsUs_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> Matthew placed the dealing with pride between the dealing with lust and money. This arrangement is meaningful. Every fleshly person who is a lover of money is a proud person. Pride is always found between lust and the love of money.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEEs3pt4CrHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki">IV.

Matthew is concerned with the kingdom, whereas John is concerned with life. To have eternal life in John is to be saved with God’s uncreated life that <span class="pg" data-page-id="631" id="631">[631]</span> man may live by this life today and for eternity, whereas to have eternal life in Matthew is to participate in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in this age and to share in its manifestation in the coming age.</p>
<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz7F4cKLxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> In the Gospel of John the eternal life is mainly for regeneration, for the new birth. By regeneration, we become the children of God. Furthermore, the Gospel of John reveals that by the eternal life, the life of God within us, we may bear fruit. Hence, the eternal life in John is for reproduction. But in the Gospel of Matthew, eternal life is not for the new birth, but for the kingdom. Many Christians confuse the eternal life in John with the eternal life in Matthew. It is the same eternal life in both John and Matthew, but with different purposes. To repeat, in John the eternal life is for the new birth, but in Matthew it is for the kingdom. No one can have the kingdom life without God’s eternal life.</p>

One is good.” This One is God. Only God is good. This indicates not only that the young man asking the question is not good, but also that the Lord Jesus is God, who is good. If He were not God, He also would not be good.</p>

To enter into life means to enter into the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63709" data-verses="Matthew 19:23">v. 23</span>). The kingdom of the heavens is a realm of God’s eternal life. Hence, when we enter into it, we enter into God’s life. This differs from being saved. To be saved is to have God’s life enter into us, whereas to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to enter into God’s life. The former is to be redeemed and regenerated with God’s life; the latter is to live and walk by God’s life. One is a matter of birth; the other is a matter of living. <span class="pg" data-page-id="632" id="632">[632]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57fi2E1auTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> According to the Gospel of John, to have eternal life is to receive eternal life into us. But according to Matthew, to have eternal life is to enter into eternal life. The eternal life enters into us to give us the new birth to become God’s children. Then we enter into eternal life to have the kingdom life. Thus, in John eternal life involves salvation, but in Matthew it is not related to salvation.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faEKiug5KZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> “If you want to enter into life,” the Lord said to the young man, “keep the commandments.” Keeping the commandments is not the requirement for salvation; it is related to entering into the kingdom of the heavens. According to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, to enter into life requires us to meet not only the standard of the old law, but also the standard of the complemented new law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63710" data-verses="Matthew 5:17-48">5:17-48</span>). Salvation requires only faith, whereas the kingdom of the heavens requires a surpassing righteousness, which issues from the keeping of the old law plus its complement given by the heavenly King.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5jrXa6-Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> The disciples’ question in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63711" data-verses="Matthew 19:25">verse 25</span>—“Who then can be saved?”—indicates that they thought entering into the kingdom of the heavens was the same as being saved. Many Christians today have the same concept. They know only about salvation; they know nothing about the kingdom of the heavens. When we first preached the kingdom more than forty years ago, we proclaimed the assurance of salvation. Although missionaries had been in China for more than a hundred years, they had not made the assurance of salvation clear to the Chinese saints. Thus, wherever we went, we tried to help the believers to be sure of their salvation. When we preached the assurance of salvation, many pastors opposed us and condemned us for being proud. Some said, “We have been pastors for many years, and not even we dare to say that we are saved. How can you claim to be saved? You are too proud. We all must believe in the Lord Jesus, behave ourselves, and wait until we die and go to the Lord. Then the Lord will tell us whether or not we are saved.” But we fought the battle for the assurance of salvation, giving the people verse after verse to prove that we can know that we have been saved <span class="pg" data-page-id="633" id="633">[633]</span> and that there is no need to wait for us to die and go to the Lord. After a few years of fighting, we gained the victory.</p>

<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn6fQbSzZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> After winning this battle, we preached the kingdom reward. We began to say to people, “Yes, there is no doubt that you have been saved. But to be saved is one thing and to receive the kingdom reward is another.” Although this word did not offend very many pastors, it offended many careless Christians. When we preached the assurance of salvation, all the careless Christians were happy and said, “Hallelujah, we are saved! The Bible tells us so. As long as we believe in the Lord Jesus, we are saved.” But their happiness did not last very long, for the same ones who preached to them the assurance of salvation told them that they may have a problem, lose the kingdom reward, and be disciplined. None of the careless, worldly Christians wanted to hear this. After a message on the kingdom, a wealthy woman once said to me, “Brother Lee, is what you are talking about related to my going to heaven? I don’t care about anything else. If I can only be a doorkeeper at the gate of heaven, I shall be satisfied.” Many Christians have this idea. As long as they are saved and bound for heaven, they are happy. Those who say this have been drugged, caring only for salvation and heaven. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63712" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">Matthew 19</span> the Lord speaks about entering into the kingdom of the heavens. Although you may be saved, you may be in danger of not entering into the kingdom of the heavens. Surely the Lord’s word about it being easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God is not concerned with salvation. This word is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens. It is very difficult for one who loves riches to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

To Be Perfect by Laying Up Treasure<br/>in the Heavens and Following Christ</h2><p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLZjBeTCDfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> When the young man told the Lord that he had observed all the commandments, the Lord said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven, and come, <span class="pg" data-page-id="634" id="634">[634]</span> follow Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63713" data-verses="Matthew 19:21">v. 21</span>). Even if the young man had observed the commandments of the old law as he had claimed, he was still not perfect, not up to the standard of the requirement of the complemented law; for he was not willing to sell what he had and lay up treasure in heaven, as the constitution of the kingdom required (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63714" data-verses="Matthew 6:19-21">6:19-21</span>). To follow the Lord is to love Him above all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63715" data-verses="Matthew 10:37-38">10:37-38</span>). This is the supreme requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0ix4sklHM-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63716" data-verses="Matthew 19:22">Verse 22</span> says, “But the young man, hearing this word, went away sorrowing, for he had many possessions.” Loving material possessions above the Lord causes one to sorrow, but those who love Christ above all things are joyful in losing their possessions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63717" data-verses="Hebrews 10:34">Heb. 10:34</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GrSlFZ8AsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> There are two kinds of rich men: those who are rich with many material possessions and those who dream about being rich although they actually are not rich. In the past, some of us may have dreamed of being a millionaire. In the sense of dreaming about riches, everyone is a rich man. The desire of some young women is to marry a rich man. This is their dream. If you are not the first kind of rich person, then you probably are the second.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6Xruq6H5q55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> The Lord said that it is more difficult for someone who loves money to enter into the kingdom than it is for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. This illustration reveals the seriousness of the love of money as far as the kingdom is concerned. The love of money is the greatest hindrance to entering into the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovhYjx1igRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> The Lord dealt with the young man in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63718" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> in a wise manner. He had come to the Lord to ask Him what he should do in order to have eternal life, that is, to live in the kingdom. Knowing the young man’s heart, the Lord told him to keep the commandments. When the Lord was asked which commandments, He listed six of them: the commandments regarding murder, adultery, stealing, bearing false witness, honoring father and mother, and loving our neighbor as ourself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63719" data-verses="Matthew 19:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>). Then the young man said, “All these things I have observed; what do I lack yet?” The Lord was ready to answer him and told him <span class="pg" data-page-id="635" id="635">[635]</span> what to do in order to be perfect. In His answer the Lord seemed to be saying, “Even if you have kept all the commandments, you still are not perfect. You may be perfect according to the law of Moses, but not according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. To be perfect according to the constitution of the kingdom, you must sell your possessions, give them to the poor, and follow Me.” This was a killing word. When the Lord mentioned six of the commandments, the young man was very encouraged, for he was one who kept the law. But when the Lord told him to uproot his love for money and to follow Him, he went away sorrowful.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMluuJCjTAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> When I was young, I was troubled by the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63720" data-verses="Matthew 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> concerning forgiveness. I regarded it as a sobering word, and I took it seriously. I asked myself if I was willing to forgive everyone. When I came to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63721" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>, I asked myself whether or not I could uproot the love of money. Like most students in China at the time, I was quite poor. But even a poor Chinese student could dream of becoming rich. At that time I did not have the boldness to say, “Yes, Lord, I can uproot the love of money.” I realized that probably I could not succeed in doing this. The love of money exposes how far off the course many of today’s Christians are. To them, the Gospel of Matthew is a story book. When they read it, it seems that nothing touches them. But we must be touched by the Lord’s sobering word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63722" data-verses="Matthew 19:1">chapter nineteen</span> regarding the requirements of the kingdom. Do you mean business with the Lord for His kingdom? If so, then what about the love of money? Is there still room in you for the love of money? This is a serious matter.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqCiBFO4f5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> Only by the divine life can we fulfill the requirements of the kingdom. It is easy to fulfill these requirements when we have the grace to do so. By our human life it is impossible, but by the divine life with the divine grace it is easy. In fact, it is a joy. What a joy to lay up treasure in the heavens!</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-hVkz2zKgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> We, the people in the kingdom, are altogether different from the worldly people. We are even different from those <span class="pg" data-page-id="636" id="636">[636]</span> in Christianity. Our heart has been touched, and we are serious with the Lord concerning His kingdom. Riches and material possessions do not mean much to us. By our natural life it is very difficult to have such an attitude toward riches. But by the divine life with the divine grace, we can say that it is a joy for us to lay up treasure in the heavens.</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5FgAGvKoU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> We have seen three requirements for entering into the kingdom of the heavens: dealing with lust, dealing with pride, and dealing with the love of riches. To deal with the love of riches is to deal with the self. Those who love money do so for two reasons: for security and for pleasure. People in this country are worried about their security. They are anxious to provide for their future and their old age. Others love money for the pleasure it gives them. They enjoy counting how much money they have in the bank. Both security and pleasure are related to the self. Thus, the love of money is a matter of the self. To deal with the love of money is to deal with the self, although the self is dealt with indirectly.</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85ww2QWYj2Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> The Lord’s sober word regarding the requirements of the kingdom should not merely be doctrine to us. We need to take the Lord’s word in a serious way and open ourselves to the Lord concerning lust, pride, and the hidden love of riches for the sake of the self. May the Lord have mercy upon us to give us a thorough dealing with these matters for the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

The Lord’s word to the young man concerned entering into the kingdom of the heavens, but the disciples considered that it referred to salvation. They had the natural, common concept of being saved.

To Receive a Hundredfold in This Age</h2><p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85ww2RmYn3Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> The kingdom reward is of two parts. The first part is in this age, and the second part is in the coming age. The first part of the kingdom reward is mainly related to material things and natural things. If, for the kingdom’s sake, or for the sake of the Lord’s name, we leave all these things, the Lord will reward us a hundredfold. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63733" data-verses="Matthew 19:29">verse 29</span> the Lord said, “Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands for My name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life.” To receive a hundredfold, houses, lands, and relatives, is to be rewarded in this age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63734" data-verses="Mark 10:30">Mark 10:30</span>). This refers to the enjoyment of the brothers and sisters in the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="639" id="639">[639]</span> with their possessions today. I can testify that I have left everything to follow the Lord, including my relatives. I hardly have a friend outside the local church. But I have hundreds of brothers, sisters, and mothers. In the church life we all have many mothers, brothers, and sisters. In a sense, those in the church life love me more than my relatives do. This is a reward. We need to believe the promise of the Lord that if we leave everything behind us to follow Him, we shall receive a reward, even in this age.</p>

In the coming kingdom, the overcomers will sit on thrones to reign over the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63739" data-verses="Revelation 20:4">Rev. 20:4</span>). The first twelve apostles, including Peter, will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, while the others will rule over the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63740" data-verses="Revelation 2:26">Rev. 2:26</span>).</p>

Not Being a Legal Matter</h2><p data-content-id="Xrfm_0_wHtlK1HVoKjia8ycO5XMNx9Cw0kdxF7iwt4aGYrrICB0YkaHGfAxzlMrpi"> After hearing the Lord’s answer, Peter had nothing more to say. His mouth was shut. But the Lord went on to say, “But many that are first shall be last, and the last first” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63741" data-verses="Matthew 19:30">v. 30</span>). Many Christians use this verse, but most use <span class="pg" data-page-id="640" id="640">[640]</span> it incorrectly. I am concerned that many of us do not understand this verse properly. Some say that a person who has just been saved but who has considerable experience is an example of the last becoming first. This is a natural interpretation. Others say that the young ones, who are last, have become the first, and that we, the older ones, are out of date and have become the last. This also is a natural understanding. Knowing that we would take His word in a natural way, the Lord gave the parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63742" data-verses="Matthew 20:1-16">20:1-16</span> to explain the meaning of this verse. The word “For” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63743" data-verses="Matthew 20:1">20:1</span> indicates that this parable is an explanation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63744" data-verses="Matthew 19:30">19:30</span>. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63745" data-verses="Matthew 20:16">20:16</span> the Lord again says that the last shall be first and the first last. This also proves that the parable is an interpretation of the Lord’s word.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuatLtTqlji_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> In order to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63746" data-verses="Matthew 19:30">19:30</span> and the parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63747" data-verses="Matthew 20:1-16">20:1-16</span>, we need to see that Peter had a commercial mentality. His commercial mentality was exposed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63748" data-verses="Matthew 19:27">19:27</span>, when he asked, “What then is there for us?” In other words, Peter was saying, “Lord, we have paid the price. Now what will You give us?” At the supermarket we pay a certain price and receive in exchange something with a certain value. We get what we pay for. This was Peter’s concept. He said that they had left everything to follow the Lord, that is, they had paid the full price. Now he wanted to know what he would get in exchange for the price he had paid. The Lord Jesus was fair and answered Peter in a clear way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63749" data-verses="Matthew 19:28-29">19:28 and 29</span>. The Lord seemed to say, “When I sit on the throne of My glory, you will sit on twelve thrones. Peter, this is what you have paid the price for. Everyone who has left houses or relatives for My name’s sake will receive a two-part reward, the first part in this age and the second part in the coming age. In this age you will receive a hundredfold to replace the material things you left. In the coming age you will have the full enjoyment of eternal life.” The Lord’s answer was clear and fair, and I believe Peter was very satisfied with it.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVGX27l8tTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> The Lord, however, did not let Peter go, for he needed a <span class="pg" data-page-id="641" id="641">[641]</span> further lesson. Therefore the Lord said that many (but not all) who are first shall be last, and the last first. This indicates that many, like Peter, who were the first would be the last to receive the reward. The Lord said this in order to revolutionize Peter’s commercial mentality. The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter, “Those who are the first will be last, and those who are the last will be first. I say this to show you that what I give you is not based upon your commercial sense. Although you must pay in order to receive the reward of the kingdom, receiving the reward is not a commercial matter. Actually, the price you have paid means nothing.”</p>

<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7ORjnPLvm0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> The same, of course, is true of us today. What we have given up does not mean anything. Even if the President of the United States were to give up his presidency in order to have the kingdom reward, that would not mean anything. However, what the Lord gives means a great deal. If you pay a dollar for something at the department store, you receive something worth a dollar; and if you pay a hundred dollars, you receive something worth a hundred dollars. But, in the eyes of the Lord, the price we pay for the reward is just a few cents, but the reward He gives is worth millions. What could we pay to receive the full enjoyment of eternal life? The full enjoyment of eternal life in the manifestation of the kingdom is priceless. The price we pay cannot compare with the reward we shall receive. Receiving the reward is not a commercial transaction. It is not a matter of paying a certain amount and of receiving something equal to that in value.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKmw9wrQZy7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> Actually, what we pay is dung (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63750" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">Phil. 3:8</span>). Everything apart from Christ is dung. The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter, “Peter, in the kingdom you will be sitting on the throne ruling over the children of Israel. This is the kingship. Peter, all you have given up to obtain this is dung. Do you think you can buy the kingship with dung? If you attempt to pay Me with dung, I would not accept it. Rather, I would tell you to get rid of those things. Although the price you pay is dung, I shall reward you with <span class="pg" data-page-id="642" id="642">[642]</span> the kingship.” Peter, who had a commercial mentality, needed to be reeducated by the Lord Jesus. The Lord was wise and patient with him and gave a long parable to explain what He meant when He said that the first would be last and the last first.</p>

However, I’d like to show you that My reward is not a commercial matter, but a matter of grace. Peter, you need to learn the lesson of grace. The reward is a matter of grace according to My desire.

This shattered and corrected Peter’s natural and commercial mind.</p>

In His answer to Peter, the Lord strongly indicated that His reward to His followers is not commercial, but according to His desire and grace. For the disciples to gain the kingdom of the heavens, they need to leave all and follow the Lord. But what He will give them as a reward is more than they deserve. It is not according to the principle of commerce, but according to the Lord’s good pleasure. This is an incentive to His followers.</p>

In working, the earliest ones came first, but in receiving the reward, the last became the first. It is this way that the Lord makes the last first and the first last. Therefore, the reward is not a legal matter, but a matter of grace.</p>
<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIt7dE-L85SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> We should not have a commercial mind. Salvation is based upon grace. The Lord Jesus has done everything for us, and there is no need for us to work. The kingdom reward, however, is according to our work, according to the price we pay. If we pay the price, then the Lord will give us a reward. It may seem that the reward is purchased by our work. If we think this, then we are like Peter with a commercial mentality. We need to be reeducated to see that even the reward is based upon grace. The way to <span class="pg" data-page-id="646" id="646">[646]</span> receive the reward is not to pay the price, but to enjoy grace.</p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzikttPdcsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> To be saved is to receive grace, and to gain the reward is to enjoy the grace we have received. When we believed in the Lord, we received grace and were saved. After receiving grace we must learn to enjoy grace. To leave all things behind and follow the Lord is not to pay a price; it is to enjoy the grace we have received. Do not think that you have sacrificed anything. What you sacrifice is just dung; it is vanity of vanities. Everything under the sun is vanity. Your education, position, and future are all vanity. Dung cannot be considered a price. To leave all things behind is to be unloaded and released. You have been under the heavy load of your position, wealth, and concern for your future. Thus, you need to be unloaded, and the way to be unloaded is to enjoy grace. Grace unloads us. To be unloaded through the enjoyment of grace, however, is not to pay a price. We are not here paying a price. Rather, we are enjoying liberation. Hallelujah, I have been liberated! I have been liberated from my relatives, fame, position, future, and everything; I am completely free. I am not paying a price—I am enjoying grace.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFFAFmy7HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> We all need to give up the commercial mentality. Some saints have said, “I have left everything for the church. I have suffered very much, and now I have nothing.” Whenever I have heard this kind of complaint, deep within me I said, “You cannot receive anything, because your giving up of all things and your suffering have not been done in the proper spirit. If you were in the right spirit, you would be thankful, joyful, and praise the Lord that you are no longer burdened.” If we have given up all things for the Lord in a proper spirit, we would say, “O Lord, I thank You that I am not bearing the load of position, ambition, or concern for the future. All the worldlings are under a heavy load. But, Lord, I praise You that I have been unloaded and liberated. I am not paying a price—I am daily enjoying grace. Lord, whatever You give me is not a reimbursement, but a further enjoyment of Yourself.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="647" id="647">[647]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYBuupwS2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> I believe that we are in the last group of workmen, those hired at five o’clock in the afternoon. But we shall be the first to be rewarded, although we shall not work as long as Peter, James, John, and Paul, who have been working for nearly twenty centuries. They have labored the entire day, bearing the scorching heat. But we have labored for such a short time, at the most a number of years. Perhaps as we are receiving the reward, Peter will say to John, “Look, these people are receiving the reward before us.” But that will be the fulfillment of the Lord’s word that the last shall be the first and the first last. Perhaps John will say to Peter, “Peter, be patient. If these last ones are receiving such a reward, we shall certainly receive much more.” However, Peter and John may be surprised to receive the same reward as those hired last. But the Lord may say to Peter and to all those hired first, “Didn’t I make an agreement with you? Was not My promise satisfactory? Do not complain, but take your reward and go to the throne. Do I not have the right to do things according to My desire? Am I wrong for being good?” One day, we shall receive the same reward as Peter, and we shall receive it first. Peter’s reward will be a denarius, and ours will be the same. This denarius denotes the full enjoyment of the divine life in glory in the manifestation of the kingdom. This will be our reward.</p>

The first was in Caesarea Philippi, before His transfiguration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63772" data-verses="Matthew 16:13">16:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63773" data-verses="Matthew 16:21">21</span>). The second was in Galilee, after His transfiguration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63774" data-verses="Matthew 17:22">17:22</span>). This time was on the way to Jerusalem. This revelation was a prophecy, altogether strange to the natural concept of the disciples, yet fulfilled literally in every detail.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuatL9Tv3Ti_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> It seems to me rather unusual that after the definition of the kingdom reward the Lord would once again unveil His crucifixion and resurrection. Apparently this has no significance. However, if you get into the depth of this book, you will see that this is a very significant continuation. In order to receive the kingdom reward, we need to experience the cross and the resurrection. Although we may know everything regarding the kingdom, we must still have a proper grasp of the Lord’s crucifixion and <span class="pg" data-page-id="650" id="650">[650]</span> resurrection. Apart from experiencing the Lord’s cross and resurrection, it is impossible to experience the Lord’s life for the reward of the kingdom. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63775" data-verses="Philippians 3:1">Philippians 3</span> Paul said that for Christ’s sake he counted all things but dung. Then he said that he desired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to Christ’s death. Paul had an adequate understanding of the Lord’s death and resurrection. This understanding is for us to experience Christ as our life for the kingdom. For the kingdom reward, we need the experience of the Lord’s crucifixion and resurrection. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63776" data-verses="Matthew 20:17-19">20:17-19</span> is a continuation of the foregoing section.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVGXm7vutTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> The third time the Lord revealed His crucifixion and resurrection He did so to His disciples again. As He was going to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside and told them about His coming crucifixion and resurrection. The Lord must have had a specific purpose in doing this. He specifically told the twelve that He needed to go to Jerusalem, to be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, to be condemned to death, to be delivered to the Gentiles, to be mocked, scourged, and crucified, and to be resurrected on the third day. He spoke to His disciples concerning His death and resurrection in a detailed way.</p>

THE THRONE OF THE KINGDOM</h2><p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvX2Ngp4vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> What was the disciples’ reaction to the Lord’s full unveiling of His crucifixion and resurrection? They did not say, “Amen, Lord. The first and second times we didn’t see this. Thank You, Lord, for taking us aside this time and purposely telling us about this. Now we realize that You must pass through death and resurrection. No doubt this includes all of us. Eventually, we also shall experience this wonderful death and resurrection.” The disciples definitely did not react like this. Rather, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63777" data-verses="Matthew 20:20-21">verses 20 and 21</span> say, “Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him. And He said to her, What do you desire? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand <span class="pg" data-page-id="651" id="651">[651]</span> and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.” The mother of the sons of Zebedee was the Lord’s aunt, His mother’s sister, and Zebedee’s sons, James and John, were His cousins. Thus, there was a natural relationship between them and the Lord. Immediately after the Lord had unveiled His death and resurrection for the third time, the mother of James and John came to Him asking that her two sons might sit on His right hand and left hand in the kingdom. Although the Lord had spoken of the crucifixion and the resurrection, their mind was set on the throne. Often we are exactly like James and John. Again and again they heard about the crucifixion and the resurrection. But in them and in their mother there was the desire for the throne. This is the ambition for position. The mother of James and John might have said to herself, “One day, when the Lord is enthroned, maybe my two sons will be sitting one on His right hand and the other on His left hand. How glorious this would be!” This was their reaction to the Lord’s word about His death and resurrection.</p>

Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink? They said to Him, We are able. He said to them, My cup you shall indeed drink, but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.” If we want to sit on the throne in the kingdom, we must be prepared to drink the cup of suffering. To suffer the cross is the way to enter into the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63779" data-verses="Acts 14:22">Acts 14:22</span>). The selfish entreaty of the mother of John and James afforded an opportunity for the Lord to reveal the way to enter into the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIt7NE7Jc5SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> In answering the mother of James and John the Lord said, “To sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63780" data-verses="Matthew 20:23">v. 23</span>). These words indicate that the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="652" id="652">[652]</span> had a submissive spirit. He did not assume anything, but gave place to the Father. Standing in the position of man, the Lord was fully subject to the Father, not assuming the right to do anything outside the Father. We all need to learn to give everything to the Lord. We have no place to say anything regarding position.</p>

The twelve were filled to the brim with ambition for position, and nothing regarding the Lord’s death and resurrection penetrated them. What a pitiful situation! If this had taken place in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63782" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">chapter four</span>, we might sympathize with them. But this was their reaction after the decree of the constitution of the kingdom, after so many revelations concerning Christ, after the unveiling of the mystery of the kingdom, and after experiencing the many negative factors on the pathway to glory. After all this, the twelve were still fully occupied with the matter of position. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63783" data-verses="Luke 22:24">Luke 22:24</span> says that the disciples were striving among themselves concerning who would be the greatest. Peter, Andrew, James, John, and all the others were fighting for greatness.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYBu-p0T2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> Matthew mentions the rivalry among the disciples in order to expose the same ambition for position that is still hidden within us today, even though we are in the church. Some are ambitious to be elders or deacons. If they cannot be an elder or a deacon, they at least aspire to be a group leader.</p>

But in the Epistles we are told that there are leaders in the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63787" data-verses="Hebrews 13:17">Heb. 13:17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63788" data-verses="Hebrews 13:24">24</span>). The Bible, however, is not contradictory. We need to see that what is in the mind of the Lord is utterly different from what is in our natural mentality. In the mind of the Lord the elders or the leaders should not control others. In the church life there should not be any control. But this does not mean that there is no governing, no ruling. To rule is one thing and to control is another. All the leaders in the churches must be clear about this. In the Lord’s churches we need ruling, but not controlling.</p>

<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiDLBK1QZM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> At this point we need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63789" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>. “And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.” The “helps” mentioned in this verse refer to the service of the deacons. These “helps” are mentioned before governings, which refer to the function of the elders. Hence, in the New Testament there is a verse telling us that the governing of the elders is lower than the help of the deacons. You may find this fact very surprising. According to our natural concept, the elders are much higher than the deacons. But the Apostle Paul, under the inspiration of God, lists the function of the elders after the function of the deacons. In this verse, Paul deliberately reverses the order of the elders and deacons, listing the office of the elders next to the last item, which is speaking in tongues. When Paul wrote this book from Ephesus, Corinth was a hotbed of Pentecostalism. In writing this book, he purposely diminished the significance of speaking in tongues, making it the last item, and listed the function of the elders after the function of the deacons.</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0cFDRsWs_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> Everyone who is put into eldership becomes a slave. The elders are not kings; they are slaves. As one in the Lord’s ministry, I also am a slave. Others may enjoy their freedom, but I have no freedom because I have been purchased to be a slave. Likewise, every elder is a slave. In the world, to have a position means to have glory. But in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="654" id="654">[654]</span> church, to have a position means to be in slavery. In Catholicism there is a hierarchy of priests, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope, all of whom are above the laity. This is vainglory. In the church there is no such vainglory; instead, there is slavery.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEEtXpt6CrHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> It is a shame that some are ambitious for position in order to have honor and glory. This is a “scorpion” creeping into the church life. If it were not a matter of function, I would not sit in the front row. Do not think that it is glorious to sit in the front. I much prefer to sit in the back. However, if the elders began to sit in the back, then in your eyes the rear seats would become the most honorable. This indicates that it is not a matter of where the elders sit, whether in the front or in the back, because the honor of their seats exists only in our mentality. Oh, how our mind needs to be renewed! For the new man, we need to be renewed in the spirit of the mind and drop the hellish concept of position.</p>
<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMntIrvoKCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> During the years I was with Brother Nee, I observed that no one who desired to be an elder was appointed to be one. For the kingdom life we must kill the ambition for position. It is a shame to talk about position, about who is higher than others. To seek a position in the church life is not a glory, but a shame.</p>
<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz7EYcLLRMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> Regarding the matter of ambition for position, two things are clear: first, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63790" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span> Paul lists the function of the elders after the function of the deacons; second, to be an elder is to be a slave. The matter of the leading ones being slaves corresponds to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63791" data-verses="Matthew 20:25-27">20:25 through 27</span>: “Jesus called them to Him and said, You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave.” How contrary this is to the natural, self-seeking mind! The eldership is a form of slavery. Every leader must be a slave. Therefore, there should be no hierarchy among us. Rather, we all are brothers on the same <span class="pg" data-page-id="655" id="655">[655]</span> level. The indignation of the ten disciples afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal the way to be in the kingdom, that is, to be willing to serve others as a servant, even as a slave, rather than to rule over others.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxCkV2KfK68vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63792" data-verses="Matthew 20:28">Verse 28</span> says, “Even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve and to give His life a ransom for many.” In this book, the book of the kingdom, the Lord always stands in the position of a man. Although the kingdom of the heavens is constituted with the divine life, it is carried out in humanity.</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkR-DE9xGiT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> It is helpful to see the difference between rule and control. To control others means to make decisions for them and to tell them what to do or not to do. It is to put people under your direction. In the Lord’s recovery, we must hate this kind of control. No one should exercise control, because we all are under the one Lord and have the one Spirit living in us and leading us. However, there is a need for ruling. If in a meeting the saints are told what to do, that is control. But there must be some ruling in the meeting. Suppose, for example, someone worships an idol and claims the freedom to do so. This must be ruled out. We even need some ruling in deciding the times of the meetings. If we are democratic and there is no rule, some may insist on meeting at 4:30 a.m., while others may want to meet at an equally inconvenient time in the afternoon. Thus, the elders need to go to the Lord in prayer, fellowship with the saints, and use their spiritual nose to discern the feeling of the saints so that they can determine what time is best for the meetings. Then the elders should make a decision. This is not control; it is ruling.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCdbYPaBGmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> It is not easy to be an elder. In order to be an elder, you need to have a good spiritual nose to sense the situation of the saints. You also need to have a living, keen spirit with a sharp intuition to know God’s will. Then you will be able to make the right decisions. Sometimes the elders make decisions concerning the time of the meetings according to their convenience. This is a mistake. The time of the meetings should not be decided according to the elders’ <span class="pg" data-page-id="656" id="656">[656]</span> convenience, but according to the situation of the saints. For this, you must exercise your intuition toward God to know what He wants.</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_5YbHStGhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> Decisions such as these are made by the elders because the government is in their hands. But do not think that governing is higher than helps. Our concept regarding this needs to be revolutionized. We need to have a spiritual understanding and a heavenly concept concerning the things of the church. What is revealed in the Bible is absolutely different from our natural understanding. Do not think that to be an elder is to occupy a high position. I repeat, to be an elder is to be a slave. When a brother is made an elder, he should say, “I have been drafted into the eldership, and I have no choice. I don’t want to be an elder, but there is nothing I can do about it. The Lord has drafted me and has made me an elder.” The sisters whose husbands are elders should say, “When my husband became an elder, he became a slave. But I am happy that the Lord has drafted him in such a heavenly way.” When our concept has been thoroughly revolutionized, the shame of ambition for position will be slain.</p>

But when the Apostle Paul refers to teachers and leaders, he does not mean kings or a hierarchy. Thus, both the Lord Jesus and the Apostle Paul spoke the same thing, and the Bible is not contradictory. I am thankful for Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63794" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span> and for the Lord’s word that those who take the lead should become slaves.

They might have thought that <span class="pg" data-page-id="657" id="657">[657]</span> they were following Christ, but actually they were on the wayside, for they had not yet seen the way. Instead of having a proper understanding of the Lord’s crucifixion and resurrection, they were still seeking a position. Because they were blind, they needed to be healed.</p>

The principle is the same in the New Testament. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63796" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span> says, “To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God.” This indicates that the healing of blindness is for the kingdom. No one who is blind is on the way to the kingdom. Apparently James and John were on the way; actually, they were blind and on the wayside. Their eyes had not yet been opened to see the way of the cross.</p>
<p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wN58eu_PlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63797" data-verses="Matthew 20:17-34">20:17-34</span> we see three things: the unveiling of the cross and the resurrection, the disciples’ poor response because of their ambition for position, and the healing of the two blind men. Anyone who is ambitious is blind. As long as we are ambitious, we are on the wayside and need healing. As soon as the two blind men received their sight, they followed the Lord on the way. This indicates that when we see the cross and the resurrection, we are on the way following the Lord. When the two blind men who had been healed began to follow the Lord Jesus, they were on the way, no longer on the wayside. It was from the time these two men were healed that James and John began to follow the Lord.</p>

The Lord’s word here may be considered prophecy. To drink the cup of the cross means to become a martyr. James was the first of the twelve disciples to be martyred, and John was the last.</p>

But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63804" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, He brought His disciples to the north, far away from Jerusalem, which was in the center of the Holy Land, in the territory of Benjamin.

And how do You know that the man will allow us to take them?” Here we see the Lord’s omniscience and sovereignty. He wanted His disciples to know that He was the sovereign King who owned all things. Thus, the donkey and the colt belonged to Him. The Lord also indicated to them that He was omniscient, for He could see things clearly without physically being in a certain place.

The Lord did not tell His disciples to get a carriage or a wagon, but a donkey and a colt. He did not even choose to ride on a horse, but on a little donkey. I have spent considerable time to find out why the Lord was mounted on a donkey and a colt. Was He riding on the donkey or on the colt? Why did the Lord Jesus need both the donkey and a colt, a baby donkey? The colt must have been a baby donkey because it is called a foal of a beast of burden, and this beast of burden must have been a donkey. The donkey was probably the mother, and the colt was probably her offspring. Both the mother and the offspring worked together to bear the King, for He was mounted on both the donkey and the colt. Perhaps the Lord rode upon the donkey first and shifted to the colt when He was close to the city. Mark and Luke mention only the colt, not the donkey (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63824" data-verses="Mark 11:1-10">Mark 11:1-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63825" data-verses="Luke 19:29-38">Luke 19:29-38</span>), whereas John speaks of a young donkey, a donkey’s colt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63826" data-verses="John 12:14-15">John 12:14-15</span>). Thus, the emphasis of the four Gospels seems to be on the colt.</p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAUjEcW2szKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> The donkey and the colt together give us an impression of meekness and humility. If the Lord has been mounted only upon a donkey, the impression of meekness would not have been so striking. Suppose a very small sister stands before us holding a tiny baby in her arms. This would give us a deep impression of smallness, for the tiny baby would strengthen the impression of smallness. The significance of the Lord’s riding on a donkey is not smallness, but meekness. The heavenly King came not with haughty splendor, but with gentle, humble meekness. This impression of meekness is strengthened by the colt accompanying a donkey to bear the meek King. The Lord Jesus did not ride into Jerusalem proudly on a horse. He came mounted upon a little donkey, even a small colt. No earthly king would do <span class="pg" data-page-id="662" id="662">[662]</span> this. The Lord Jesus seemed to be telling His disciples, “Take the donkey and the little colt. I shall ride upon the beast of burden, but the colt must go along too in order to show My meekness. This will help the people see how meek the heavenly King is.”</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPMfhzmMoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> The Lord Jesus came not to fight or to compete, but to be a meek King. The presence of the baby donkey testified that the Lord did not care to fight or compete with anyone. Rather, He was humble and meek. I believe that this was the impression the Lord Jesus wanted to convey to the people. Yes, He was the heavenly King, but He had no intention to come as a great King fighting or competing with others. Instead, He came as a meek King who did not fight against anyone or compete with anyone.</p>

<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsQcar3dNhgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63827" data-verses="Matthew 21:7">verse 7</span> we see that the disciples put their garments on the donkey and the colt, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63828" data-verses="Matthew 21:8">verse 8</span> says, “And most of the crowd spread their own garments in the road.” Garments signify the human virtues of people’s conduct. The disciples honored the lowly King by putting their garments on the donkey and colt for Him to ride on, and the crowd honored Him by spreading their garments in the road for Him to pass through. The people honored the Lord with their clothing, that is, with whatever they had. No matter how poor a man is, he at least has some clothing with which to cover himself. We need to honor the Lord, the meek King, with whatever we are. No matter what our condition may be, we have something with which to honor Him. I do not believe that the garments put on the donkey and on the road were splendid or beautiful. Nevertheless, the people used what they had. Although we are sinful, pitiful, and even evil, the Lord likes to be honored with what we are. Even sinners can honor the Lord with what they are, if they have a heart to honor Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="663" id="663">[663]</span> </p>

The crowd used both their garments and the palm tree branches to celebrate the lowly King’s coming. A palm tree, signifying the victorious life, is rooted deeply in hidden springs and grows prevailingly upward into the air. This signifies the victorious life. In honoring the meek King with whatever they were, the people recognized that He was the One with the victorious life.</p>

The title “the Son of David” was the royal title of the lowly King. In the warm welcome of the heavenly King, the people shouted out a quotation from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63836" data-verses="Psalms 118:1">Psalm 118</span>: “Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63837" data-verses="Psalms 118:26">v. 26</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63838" data-verses="Psalms 118:1">Psalm 118</span>, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in such a way. Thus, the spontaneous praise of the people sovereignly indicated that this meek King came not in His own name, but in the name of Jehovah. Those who welcomed the King indicated through their praise that He was the One sent by the Lord, thus the One who came in the name of the Lord.</p>

Any earthly king, upon entering the capital, would immediately have ascended to the throne. But the Lord did not do this because He was not for His own interests, but for God’s interests. His heart was not for His kingdom, but for God’s house.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19M-Y3DHAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> It is the same in principle with us today. When we welcome the Lord into us as our King, He does not go immediately to the throne; rather, He goes to our spirit and cleanses it. Many of us have experienced this. When we received the Lord as life, we also received Him as the King. On the day He came into us to be our life and our King, He did not enthrone Himself, but cleansed God’s temple, which today is our spirit, the habitation of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63841" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Eph. 2:22</span>).</p>

But when Jesus comes into us He drives all the robbers away and cleanses the temple of our spirit. After the cleansing, the Lord healed the blind and the lame in the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63842" data-verses="Matthew 21:14">v. 14</span>). This indicates that His cleansing of the temple causes people to have the sight to see and the strength to move. It is the same with us today. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63843" data-verses="Matthew 21:15">Verse 15</span> says that the children were “crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son <span class="pg" data-page-id="665" id="665">[665]</span> of David.” At least a few times the Gospel of Matthew mentions children, for this book stresses that the kingdom people need to become as children. Only those who have become children will praise God. This was after the healing of the blind and the lame. When our blindness and lameness are healed, we also shall praise the Lord as little children.</p>

Every evening He departed to lodge in Bethany, on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63845" data-verses="Mark 11:19">Mark 11:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63846" data-verses="Luke 21:37">Luke 21:37</span>), where the house of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus and the house of Simon were (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63847" data-verses="John 11:1">John 11:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63848" data-verses="Matthew 26:6">Matt. 26:6</span>). In Jerusalem He was rejected by the leaders of Judaism, but in Bethany He was welcomed by His lovers.</p>
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePB2tgUTwGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> After the Lord Jesus comes into us and cleanses our spirit, we may sense that He leaves us, just as He left Jerusalem for Bethany after cleansing the temple. The Lord may come into you, cleanse your spirit, which is the temple of God, and leave for another place. Perhaps you will say, “This is not my experience. My experience is that after the Lord Jesus has cleansed my spirit, He stays with me.” If this is your experience, then you must be one of the lovers of Jesus like Mary, Martha, Lazarus, or Simon. However, after many Christians receive Christ into them and experience His cleansing of their spirit, they do not love Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="666" id="666">[666]</span> Thus, in their experience the Lord leaves them to lodge in another place, a place called Bethany.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvX29gr6vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> According to the New Testament, Bethany is the place of the Lord’s lovers. In the New Testament we read of two houses in Bethany: the house of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus and the house of Simon the leper. All these dear ones were lovers of the Lord Jesus. During the last week of His life on earth, He went every day into Jerusalem, but every night He went out of Jerusalem and lodged in Bethany. Jerusalem was the place where He was examined, tested, and slaughtered; but Bethany was His lodging place.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LSF7nB9_aKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> In a very definite sense, today’s religion is a Jerusalem to the Lord Jesus; it is not His lodging place. The lovers of Christ are not in Jerusalem, but in Bethany. Are you in Jerusalem or in Bethany? We should not be the Jerusalem people, but the Bethany lovers. If you are among the Jerusalem people, Jesus will come to be tested and examined by you. But if you are among His lovers in Bethany, He will come to lodge with you. If the Lord Jesus comes into you and cleanses your spirit, yet you still do not love Him, it means that you remain among the Jerusalem people. You are not one of the Bethany lovers. Although He cleanses the temple in Jerusalem, He does not lodge there. Rather, He goes out of the city to lodge in Bethany. How meaningful this is!</p>

The fig tree the Lord saw was full of leaves but fruitless, signifying that at that time the nation of Israel was full of outward show, but had nothing that could satisfy God. According to the Bible, leaves are an outward show, but the fruit is something real and solid to satisfy God and man. At that time, the Lord Jesus came from God to Israel hungry for some fruit to satisfy God’s hunger. However, instead of fruit. He found only leaves.</p>

As we shall see, the fig tree is mentioned again in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63855" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>, where the fig tree signifies the restoration of Israel, which took place in 1948.</p>

<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiDLxKwT5M5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> According to our experience, we can testify that first the meek King comes into us, and we welcome Him. However, He comes in not to be enthroned, but to cleanse the temple of God, because He cares for God’s house. Caring also for God’s satisfaction, He desires fruit from God’s people. But most of His people cannot afford Him any fruit. As a result, they are dried up. Many of us have experienced this. The meek King came into us, we welcomed Him, and He cleansed the temple of God. But because we did not bear fruit, we were dried up. Perhaps you will say, “Isn’t the Lord merciful and gracious? Since He is merciful and gracious, how could He curse us in such a way?” Nevertheless, when we do not bear fruit, we are dried up.</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0cFzRqUs_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> Most Christians today have become dried up. Although they have welcomed the heavenly King and He has cleansed their temple, they have no fruit for God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="668" id="668">[668]</span> satisfaction, and thus they are dried up. How many Christians today are living and bearing fruit? Very few. Whenever someone is dried up, his spirit does not function. Hence, there is no temple and no fruit, no proper worship and no satisfaction to God.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEEtnpr4CrHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> The concern of the meek King is for God’s house and God’s satisfaction. He cleanses us that we may offer proper worship to God, and He deals with us that we may bear fruit for God’s satisfaction. In the practical kingdom life in the church today, Christ must be welcomed as the King. Then He must cleanse God’s temple, that is, He must purify our spirit. Then we, as the kingdom people, shall bear fruit for God’s satisfaction. Otherwise, we shall be cursed until the day of restoration. This was the situation with the nation of Israel when the Lord was on earth, and it is the situation among Christians today. Because the nation of Israel was dried up, the kingdom was taken away from them and given to another people. If we are not cleansed in our spirit to offer God the proper worship and to bear fruit for His satisfaction, the kingdom will also be taken away from us and given to others.</p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63859" data-verses="Matthew 21:23">21:23—22:46</span> the Lord was tested and examined. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63860" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>, the passover lamb had to be examined four full days. In the Jewish calendar, four days could also be considered six days, for part of a day was counted as one day.

And who gave you this authority?” The chief priests represented the religious power, and the elders represented the civilian power. These two powers came together to test Christ, who was standing before them as the Passover Lamb to be examined by the children of Israel. These Jewish leaders asked the Lord where He had received His authority and who had given it to Him. The Lord Jesus did not answer them directly, but with another question.</p>

From heaven or from men?” This was a difficult question for the chief priests and elders to answer. If they had said that John’s baptism was from heaven, the Lord would have asked them why they did not believe him.

The man told the first child to work in the vineyard. At first the child refused, but later he regretted it and went. The man told the second child to do the same. But after saying that he would go, he eventually did not go. The Lord Jesus then asked His hearers which of the two did the will of the father. When they said the first, the Lord said to them, “Truly I say to you, that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63869" data-verses="Matthew 21:31">v. 31</span>).</p>

This indicates that the Jews were the firstborn of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63872" data-verses="Exodus 4:22">Exo. 4:22</span>), having the birthright, but due to their unbelief the birthright was shifted to the church, which has become God’s firstborn (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63873" data-verses="Hebrews 12:23">Heb. 12:23</span>). Thus, the Lord’s word here implies a shifting of the birthright. In God’s economy the birthright was taken from Israel and given to another people, a people composed of saved sinners and tax collectors. This means that the birthright of God has been transferred from Israel to the church.</p>

Apparently you obey God, but actually you disobey Him. In the eyes of God, the sinners, tax collectors, and prostitutes are much better than you, because they received the preaching of John the Baptist. Because they received John’s way of righteousness, they will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but you will be shut out.” This means that the birthright was taken from Israel and given to the saved, repentant, and forgiven sinners who constitute the church.</p>

Very few Christians today are clear about God’s building. Although you may have been in Christianity for years and <span class="pg" data-page-id="675" id="675">[675]</span> may have heard that Christ was the Son of God, the Savior, the Redeemer, and perhaps even your life, you probably never heard that Christ is also God’s building stone. As we have pointed out, He was the stone rejected by the builders. The Jewish leaders must have been shocked to hear that Christ was a stone. In talking with them concerning the vineyard, indicating thereby that He was the son of the owner of the vineyard, Christ eventually referred to Himself as the stone rejected by the builders. Today, hardly any Christians have the concept that our Savior is a stone for God’s building.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuatLdTslji_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63913" data-verses="Acts 4:10-11">Acts 4:10 and 11</span> Peter referred to Jesus Christ of Nazareth as the stone rejected by the builders. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63914" data-verses="Acts 4:12">verse 12</span> he said, “And there is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.” Christians often use <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63915" data-verses="Acts 4:12">Acts 4:12</span> in preaching the gospel, but rarely, if ever, do they tell people that Christ is not only the Savior but also the stone. That our Savior is a stone reveals the fact that God’s salvation is for God’s building. The Savior is related to salvation, and the stone is related to building. But today’s Christians have not seen this matter adequately. God’s intention on earth is not simply to have a vineyard—it is to have a building. In the ancient times the nation of Israel was a vineyard; however, today the church is not merely a vineyard, but also a building. The church is a farm that produces materials for God’s building (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63916" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:9">1 Cor. 3:9</span>). Whatever this farm grows is for the building. Although this matter has been missed by both Jews and Christians, the light has come to us in these last days so that this truth may be recovered. We have come to know that Christ is not only the Savior, but also the stone.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVGXG7j8tTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> In the life-study of Revelation, we saw that Christ is the Lion-Lamb-stone. He is the Lion for victory, the Lamb for redemption, and the stone for building. In a sense, both Jews and Christians see the matter of redemption. However, they have not progressed to see the building. Christians today simply do not realize that Christ is a stone. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="676" id="676">[676]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63917" data-verses="Matthew 21:42">verse 42</span> the Lord said that the stone, not the Savior, would be rejected by the builders. Eventually, in resurrection, this rejected stone became the cornerstone. This is seen clearly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63918" data-verses="Acts 4:1">Acts 4</span>, a chapter dealing with the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7ORjXPNvm0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> The cornerstone is the stone that joins the walls. As the cornerstone, Christ connects the Jews and the Gentiles. Through Christ as the cornerstone the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers are brought together as one building for God. Thus, Christ is not only the foundation stone to support the building, but also the cornerstone to join the two main walls.</p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63920" data-verses="Romans 9:32">Romans 9:32</span> Paul says that the Jews “stumbled at the Stone of stumbling.” The Jews that have rejected the Lord Jesus have fallen upon this stone and have been broken to pieces.</p>

Thus, the Lord is also a smiting and scattering stone to the Gentiles. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63922" data-verses="Daniel 2:34-35">Daniel 2:34 and 35</span> say, “Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors.” These verses indicate that when Christ comes the second time, He will be a stone cut without hands falling from the heavens upon the great image. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63923" data-verses="Daniel 2:35">Daniel 2:35</span> also says, “The stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.” The great image signifies the worldly powers from Babylon down to the ten kingdoms of the restored Roman Empire, which will exist at the time of Christ’s coming back. Christ will be the smiting stone that will scatter all the broken nations as chaff. Then He will become a great mountain, that is, the kingdom of God on earth.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPMfxzjPIGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> Therefore, Christ is a stone to three categories of <span class="pg" data-page-id="677" id="677">[677]</span> people: for the believers, He is the building stone; for the rejecting Jews, He is the stumbling stone; and for the Gentiles, He is the smiting stone. If you believe in Him, He will be to you the building stone. If you are a Jew and reject Him and are stumbled by Him, you will experience Him as the stumbling stone and be broken to pieces. If you are an unbelieving Gentile fighting against God, you will know Him one day as the smiting stone, for He will smite you and scatter you like chaff driven by the wind.</p>

Although we are believers and although Christ is the building stone, we may not have very much building. Some genuine believers have even stumbled at Christ. On the one hand, they believe in Christ; but on the other hand, they say that they cannot take the way of Christ, and they shake their head at Him. In other words, they were stumbled at Him. Thus, instead of being built up by Christ, they have been stumbled by Him. Furthermore, some true believers have been smitten by Christ and blown away like chaff. It is rare to find genuine believers who are truly being built together. Such a building cannot be found in today’s Christianity. If you look for it in Catholicism, you will find abominations and fornication instead of building. Neither can the building be found in the denominations. On the contrary, today’s Christianity is full of stumbling and breaking. Yes, many have been brought to the Lord in Catholicism and in the denominations. But after they were brought to the Lord, they were spoiled. Instead of being built, they were stumbled or smitten.</p>

Matthew was the only one among the four writers of the Gospels to give us a clear record of Christ as the stone. His record is complete. In no other portion of the Bible can we find Christ presented as a stone in three aspects: the building stone, the stumbling stone, and the smiting stone. All three aspects are found in Matthew for the kingdom. <span class="pg" data-page-id="678" id="678">[678]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsQcKrxfNhgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> The church is the life-pulse of the kingdom. This means that just as the body dies when the pulse stops, so the kingdom is wholly dependent upon the church. The church, in turn, is completely dependent upon the building. If there is no building, there is no practical church life. The church life is not simply a matter of meeting together or of having a little fellowship. In whatever locality we are, we need to be builded. For this, we must enjoy and experience our Christ as the stone. He is not only the foundation stone that bears us up, but also the cornerstone that joins us together. In Him and through Him we are built together.</p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFZ55KWHQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> Apart from such a building the church is vain, and without the church the kingdom has no life. The church is the kingdom life, and the reality of the church is the building. How we need to experience Christ as the building stone! He is the building element, the building life. Christ is life to us not only for victory, but all the more for building. The inner life people have spoken a great deal about Christ as the victorious life. But I never heard any one of them give a message saying that Christ is the building life. He is not only the victorious life, but also the building life. If you simply experience victory through Christ as life, your experience is not yet adequate. You must go on to experience the building life of Christ. Ultimately, Christ as life within us is for God’s building. You may be victorious, but still not be built. We need to be built. When we are built, we shall have the reality of the church life, and the church will be the life-pulse of the kingdom. Then the kingdom will be here in actuality.</p>
<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgj3sq_33SNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> To repeat, the actuality of the kingdom is the church, and the reality of the church is the building. In other words, the kingdom depends upon the church, and the church depends upon the building. We need to consider to what extent we have experienced Christ as the building stone. I believe that in the days to come the Lord will show us much more concerning the building. This building is closely related to the new man.

<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIt4dE_bM5SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63925" data-verses="Matthew 22:1-14">22:1-14</span>, the parable of the marriage feast. This parable is the continuation of the Lord’s answer to the chief priests and elders of the people. In His answer to their question regarding His authority, He spoke three parables: the parable of the shifting of the birthright, the parable of the vineyard, and the parable of the marriage feast. The parable of the shifting of the birthright reveals that the birthright, which had belonged to the nation of Israel, has been taken away and given to the church. The parable of the vineyard indicates that the kingdom of God was about to be taken away from Israel and given to the church. Thus, these two parables are parallel to each other. If you do not have the birthright, you cannot participate in the kingdom. By this we see that the birthright and the kingdom go together. These first two parables refer to Israel on the negative side, for both the birthright and the kingdom were taken away from Israel.</p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzinttMP8sSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> If the Lord’s answer had stopped here, it would have been incomplete. It would have dealt only with the negative side and had no positive issue. As we come to the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63926" data-verses="Matthew 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span>, we have the realization that there must be something more. Therefore, after the first two parables, the Lord added the parable of the marriage feast as the completion of His answer. In giving this parable, He turned from the negative side to the positive side. <span class="pg" data-page-id="682" id="682">[682]</span> </p>

The king here is God, and the son is Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPMcBzmOoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> In the foregoing parable (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63930" data-verses="Matthew 21:33-46">21:33-46</span>), the Lord illustrated how the Jews would be punished, and how the kingdom of God would be taken from them and given to the kingdom people. Another parable is needed for Him to illustrate how the kingdom people in the kingdom of the heavens will be strictly dealt with. Both parables indicate that the kingdom is a serious matter.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYLWVHoFR6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> In the foregoing parable, the Old Testament was likened to a vineyard, with the focus mainly on the matter of labor under the law; in this parable, the New Testament is likened to a marriage feast, with the focus mainly on the matter of enjoyment under grace. The vineyard is not mainly for enjoyment, but for labor. But in a marriage feast there is no labor. Instead, there is full enjoyment. No one attends a marriage feast for the purpose of laboring; all attend for enjoyment. Thus, the parable of the vineyard depicts labor under the law, and the parable of the marriage feast depicts enjoyment under grace. We in the Lord’s recovery are not laboring under law, but are enjoying under grace. What a contrast between these two parables! Today, we are not under law, but under grace. We are not laboring, but enjoying. This is the basic principle in understanding these parables.</p>

This verse speaks of oxen and fatted beasts, both of which refer to Christ as the One killed that God’s chosen people might enjoy Him as a feast. Christ has many aspects for our enjoyment. As the oxen and the fatted beasts, He has been killed and prepared for our enjoyment. Although everything had been prepared and although the slaves went out again and again, the people refused to come, even laying hold of the slaves, treating them shamefully, and killing them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63933" data-verses="Matthew 22:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>).</p>

The fact that the troops here are described as the king’s troops indicates that all the armies on earth are the Lord’s. Thus, the army of the Roman Empire was actually God’s army. God sent the Roman army as His forces to accomplish His purpose to destroy Jerusalem.</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I_Vo6375x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> During the transitory period between the Old Testament and the New Testament, the old and the new overlapped. In the parable of the vineyard, the owner destroyed the evil men because they rejected, persecuted, and killed his servants. They even killed Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The parable of the marriage feast says that God will destroy the city because, after killing Christ, they also killed the apostles sent to invite them to the marriage feast. God did not destroy them immediately after they <span class="pg" data-page-id="684" id="684">[684]</span> had killed the Son of God. By killing Him they helped to prepare the fatted beasts for the feast. But after the apostles had been rejected and killed, the Lord sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy the city of Jerusalem. Titus was cruel and merciless, tearing down the temple and burning the city. As the Lord Jesus had said, not one stone of the temple was left upon another. Furthermore, Titus killed a large number of Jews, the leaders in particular. This was the complete fulfillment of the Lord’s prophecy in this parable.</p>

Go therefore to the thoroughfares, and as many as you find, call to the marriage feast.” Because of the Jews’ rejection of the gospel, they were not worthy of the enjoyment of the New Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63936" data-verses="Acts 13:46">Acts 13:46</span>). Therefore, the preaching of the New Testament was turned to the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63937" data-verses="Acts 13:46">Acts 13:46</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63938" data-verses="Romans 11:11">Rom. 11:11</span>).

How could anyone answer God’s calling, yet not be saved? As long as we have answered God’s calling, we have been saved. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63941" data-verses="Matthew 22:14">verse 14</span> the Lord Jesus speaks of many being called, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63942" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span> Paul points out that we, the saved ones, are the called ones. We have been called to be saved.

<p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCh6ytuRw2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> The wedding garment signifies our qualification to participate in the marriage feast. The New Testament mentions this feast at least twice, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63950" data-verses="Matthew 22:1">Matthew 22</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63951" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span>. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63952" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span>, those invited to the marriage feast are clothed in white linen. The white linen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63953" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span> is the marriage garment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63954" data-verses="Matthew 22:1">Matthew 22</span>. This white linen signifies the surpassing righteousness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63955" data-verses="Matthew 5:20">Matthew 5:20</span> says, “For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.” This surpassing righteousness which qualifies us <span class="pg" data-page-id="686" id="686">[686]</span> to participate in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age is typified in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63956" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, where we are told that the queen has two garments. We, the believers, should also have two garments. We all have the first garment, the garment that qualifies us to be saved. This garment is the objective Christ whom we received as our righteousness before God. In Christ, who is our righteousness, we have been justified and saved. But after receiving Christ, we need to live Him out. We need to live by Christ so that Christ may become our subjective righteousness. This subjective righteousness, Christ lived out of us in our daily life, is the white linen, the second garment, the marriage garment that qualifies us to participate in the marriage feast.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk6BOZeLa1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> In the parable of the vineyard, the Lord was strict with the husbandmen, requiring that their labor reach a certain standard. We need to drop the idea that because we are under grace the Lord is not strict with us. Many misunderstand the Lord and misuse His grace. Most Christians think that the Lord is not strict with us and that as long as we have His grace, everything is all right. However, the Lord is more strict with those who are under grace. Both the parable of the vineyard and the parable of the marriage feast reveal the strictness of the Lord in dealing with His people, whether Jews under the law or believers under grace. Do not think that because we have been invited to the marriage feast, we can afford to be careless. On the contrary, the Lord may come into the feast and pick you out as one not having the second garment. Yes, you have received Christ as your righteousness to be justified before God. But are you living by Christ? Is He your subjective righteousness?</p>
<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoIxwK4-1sw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> The requirements of the second garment are strict, more than a matter of keeping a few commandments or regulations. Rather, day by day we need to live by Christ and live out Christ. This is not a matter of doing, but of living. In the New Testament economy, God does not mainly deal with our doings, but with our living, by whom and by what way we live. The small things in our daily <span class="pg" data-page-id="687" id="687">[687]</span> living expose whether or not we live by Christ. It is easy to grasp the doctrine that we have been crucified with Christ, that we live no longer, and that Christ lives in us. But do we experience this as a reality in our daily life? Whenever we are careless in our daily living, we are not living by Christ. If we live in a loose, careless manner, we are not those with the marriage garment.</p>
<p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCMtNpnE74qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> There is no problem regarding our salvation, for we have been called and justified. But what will be your situation before the judgment seat of Christ? Will you be qualified to enter the marriage feast? If you believe the first part of the gospel, then you must also believe the second part. How we need to look to the Lord for His mercy! We need to pray, “Lord, have mercy on me. I have received You, Lord, but I need more grace to live by You. Lord, because You are my Savior, I know that I am eternally saved. But I need Your grace that I may live by You as my life.” We need to speak by Christ, and even our anger must be according to Christ. When we are about to lose our temper, we should consider whether or not we are losing our temper by Christ. If we do this, we shall have a proper Christian living by Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rREVsQiwrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> The second garment has been neglected by today’s Christians. Martin Luther helped us to know the first garment, Christ as righteousness for us to be justified by God. This truth was recovered more than four hundred years ago. But in the Lord’s recovery today we have come to the second garment. We need both the objective and subjective righteousness. This is an important matter in the Gospel of Matthew, for it is a requirement of the kingdom.</p>

And he was speechless. Then the king said to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there <span class="pg" data-page-id="688" id="688">[688]</span> shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.” The servants mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63958" data-verses="Matthew 22:13">verse 13</span> must be angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63959" data-verses="Matthew 13:41">13:41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63960" data-verses="Matthew 13:49">49</span>). To be cast out into the outer darkness is not to perish; it is to be dealt with dispensationally for not having lived an overcoming life by Christ to qualify for participation in the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium. At that time, the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63961" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Col. 3:4</span>), whereas the defeated ones will suffer discipline in outer darkness.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LSGbnB__aKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> Because the man without a marriage garment is cast into outer darkness, many Christian teachers say that he is a false believer. But how could a false believer be admitted to the marriage feast of Christ in the air? The reason many Christian teachers say that this man is an unbeliever is that they do not believe that a saved one can be punished by being cast out into outer darkness. However, according to the Gospel of Matthew, believers may be subject to dispensational punishment, a subject covered more than once in this Gospel. Few Christians believe that there will be such a punishment for the saved ones. But for more than forty years we have been teaching that we need to be overcomers. Those who are not overcomers will be excluded from the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium and will probably be punished.</p>
<p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY-h_C8Y8lV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> We have seen that the man without a marriage garment is cast out into outer darkness. Notice that the Lord Jesus did not just say darkness, but outer darkness. The Bible says clearly that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will come in glory. Thus, there will be a sphere, a realm, of glory, and all the believers will be raptured to Him in His glory. In the air the Lord will set up the judgment seat. After the believers have been judged, the defeated ones will be put into outer darkness. This refers to the darkness outside the realm of the Lord’s glory. For this reason the Lord used the word “outer” to describe that darkness.</p>

<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIt4dE5Jc5SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> To be cast out into outer darkness is not to suffer eternal perdition. The New Testament reveals that once a person has been saved, he is saved for eternity and can <span class="pg" data-page-id="689" id="689">[689]</span> never perish. However, the so-called Arminian theology teaches that a person can be saved and then lost again. This, however, is contrary to the Scriptures. Although we cannot be lost, God may deal with us dispensationally. In the past some have argued with me about this and said, “How can a blood-washed and redeemed person still be punished by God?” I replied, “After you were washed by the Lord’s blood and redeemed, did you not experience God’s chastening for your wrongdoings? Has not God punished you?” Knowing that God may chastise those who sin after they have been saved, they lost the case. Others have argued that God chastises us only in this age while we are in the flesh; after the Lord comes back and we are raptured, they think there will be no problem. To this I have said, “Please do not hold this concept. Do not think that there can be no problems after resurrection and rapture. After the sinners have died and are resurrected, they will be brought to the white throne for judgment. This proves that resurrection does not solve all problems. Do not think that death and resurrection will automatically rescue you from having problems in the future. God may still deal with you after your resurrection. Do not be deceived.” Most Christians today reject the teaching concerning the dispensational punishment of believers. This is why so many are loose and careless in their daily living. Instead of fearing God’s dispensational discipline, they say, “I am saved, and the blood has washed me. If I do something wrong, the Lord may correct me a little. But there will be no problems for me in the future.” How misleading it is to hold a concept so contrary to the pure word of God! When we come back to the pure Word, we see that it is a serious matter to come to the marriage feast without the marriage garment.</p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzinttJccsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> We need to read the book of Matthew with a sober mind and consider its teachings seriously. Although this book has been buried for centuries, the Lord has opened it to us. Some may argue that we do not adequately know the love of God and that we present God as One who is too hard and <span class="pg" data-page-id="690" id="690">[690]</span> cruel. But if God were loving according to their concept, how could He send an army to destroy the city of Jerusalem? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63962" data-verses="Romans 11:1">Romans 11</span> Paul says that God is kind, but also that He is severe and that we need to be serious with Him. When God is kind, He is truly kind; and when He is severe, He is very severe. God has been severe with the Jews, and He will also be severe with us.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFFDFm06HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> Today there are many sugar-coated teachings in Christianity. Some preachers dare not teach what they see in the Bible because they are concerned about losing their audience or offending others. Therefore, they sugar-coat many of their teachings. But we must strip away the sugar-coating, come back to the pure Word, and see what the Lord has to say. We need the sober word found in the Gospel of Matthew. Remember, one day you will be examined to see whether or not you have the second garment to qualify you for the marriage feast. Get ready for this by preparing the second garment, the white linen, the surpassing righteousness. May the Lord have mercy upon us for this!</p>

BY THE DISCIPLES<br/>OF THE PHARISEES AND THE HERODIANS</h2><p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxCkW2KbZa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> After the Lord Jesus had been examined by the chief priests and the elders of the people concerning the source of His authority, the disciples of the Pharisees with the Herodians questioned Him about giving tribute to Caesar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63968" data-verses="Matthew 22:15-22">22:15-22</span>). The Herodians were those who took sides with King Herod’s regime and took part with him in injecting Grecian and Roman manners of life into the Jewish culture. Normally they sided with the Sadducees, but were opposed to the Pharisees; here they united with the Pharisees to ensnare the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p data-content-id="jEOEG3jozuzwBy_p1YPkR9DE4i2iT80fXGeveiwsox2N3IWUw2RggXcNu4fxFwOd4"> The Herodians opposed the Pharisees because the Pharisees were very conservative, whereas the Herodians were modern, standing with the Sadducees who also were modernistic in their thinking. However, on this occasion the Herodians and Pharisees conspired to trap the Lord Jesus. They expected Him to fall into their snare. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63969" data-verses="Matthew 22:17">verse 17</span> they said to the Lord, “Tell us therefore, What do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?” This is really an ensnaring question. All the Jews opposed giving tribute to Caesar. If the Lord Jesus had said that it was lawful to do this, He would have offended all the Jews who followed the Pharisees. But if He said that it was not lawful, this would have given the Herodians, who stood with the Roman government, strong ground to accuse Him. The matter of paying tribute to Caesar was very unpleasant to the Jews; they hated it. The Pharisees were especially against it. However, the Herodians agreed with paying tax <span class="pg" data-page-id="692" id="692">[692]</span> to the Roman government. Thus, one of the two parties opposed this matter, and the other favored it. According to their concept, no matter how the Lord answered their question, He would still fall into their snare.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCdYYPQSGmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> The Lord Jesus, however, is wise and knows how to handle every person and every situation. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63970" data-verses="Matthew 22:19">verse 19</span> He said, “Show Me the tribute money.” Then they brought to Him a denarius. The Lord did not show the Roman coin, but asked them to show one to Him. Since they possessed one of the Roman coins, they were caught. By having a Roman coin, they had lost the case already.</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_5bbHZ-WhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63971" data-verses="Matthew 22:20-21">Verses 20 and 21</span> say, “And He says to them, Whose is this image and inscription? They say, Caesar’s. Then He says to them, Pay then what is Caesar’s to Caesar, and what is God’s to God.” To pay Caesar what is Caesar’s is to pay tribute to Caesar according to his governmental regulations. To pay to God what is God’s is to pay the half shekel to God according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63972" data-verses="Exodus 30:11-16">Exodus 30:11-16</span>, and to offer all the tithes to God according to the law of God. The Jews were under two authorities, the political authority of Rome and the spiritual authority of God. In Jerusalem there was not only the Roman government, but also the temple of God. For this reason, the Jewish people had to pay tax to both systems, to the Roman government and to God’s temple. Therefore, the Lord told them to pay to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s. This answer shocked the Pharisees and the Herodians, and they were defeated.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCdYYPZAmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5">V. BY THE SADDUCEES</h2><p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_5bbHRsmhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63973" data-verses="Matthew 22:23-33">22:23-33</span> we see the Lord’s test at the hands of the Sadducees. The Sadducees were ancient modernists who did not believe in angels or in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63974" data-verses="Acts 23:8">Acts 23:8</span>). They were exactly like the modernists and higher critics of today who do not believe in the Scriptures, in angels, or in miracles. These ancient modernists came to the Lord with a question regarding the resurrection. It seemed that they were quite clever. They told the Lord of a woman who had married seven brothers and asked Him, “In the <span class="pg" data-page-id="693" id="693">[693]</span> resurrection, therefore, of which of the seven will she be the wife? For they all had her” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63975" data-verses="Matthew 22:28">v. 28</span>). From the human point of view, this was a difficult question. No doubt the Pharisees, the ancient fundamentalists, would have found it hard to answer. The Lord Jesus, however, gave the Sadducees a strong answer.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57fgWE3buTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63976" data-verses="Matthew 22:29">Verse 29</span> says, “But Jesus answered and said to them, You are deceived, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.” Knowing the Scriptures is one thing, and knowing the power of God is another. We need to know both. The Scriptures here refer to the verses of the Old Testament concerning the matter of resurrection, and the power of God refers to the power of resurrection. In His answer to the Sadducees, the Lord did four things: firstly, He condemned them; secondly, He rebuked them; thirdly, He taught them; and fourthly, He muzzled them. He condemned them by telling them that they were deceived. Every modernist has been deceived. For this, they need to be condemned. Today’s modernists must be condemned for denying the resurrection, angels, and miracles. When I was young, such teachings were spreading in China. For example, the modernists said that the water of the Red Sea was not divided and that the people did not cross over on dry land. They claimed that the shallow water of the sea was blown apart by a strong wind and that this enabled the people to walk on land. What a demonic teaching! The ancient modernists, like those of today, thought they were so clever, but actually they were deceived. Therefore, the Lord rebuked them by saying that they did not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faEICui4KZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> After the Lord condemned and rebuked the Sadducees, He taught them. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63977" data-verses="Matthew 22:30">verse 30</span> He said, “For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as angels of God in heaven.” This means that in resurrection there will be no male or female. Hence, there will be no marriage. This will take place by the power of God. Those who deny the resurrection do not know the power of God.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5jp3a49Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> In order to help the Sadducees know the depth of truth <span class="pg" data-page-id="694" id="694">[694]</span> implied in the words of the Scriptures, the Lord said, “But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.” Since God is the God of the living and is called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, these three who have died will be resurrected. This is the way the Lord Jesus handled the Scriptures—not only by the letter, but by the life and power implied within them.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn6dwbQwZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> I appreciate the Lord’s interpretation of the Bible. He said that God was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If there were no resurrection to come, then God would have to be the God of the dead. The fact that God is the God of the living and that He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob proves that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be resurrected. If they are not to be resurrected, then how could God be the God of the living? This is the genuine, honest, living, trustworthy exposition of the Bible. By giving the Sadducees such an answer, the Lord muzzled them.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wN68es-PlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD">VI. BY A LAWYER OF THE PHARISEES</h2><p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLZhheWDjfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> When the Pharisees learned that the Lord had silenced the Sadducees, they held a council about what to do next. Then one of them, a lawyer, tempted the Lord by asking Him a question about the great commandment in the law. A lawyer was one versed in the law of Moses, a professional interpreter of the law of the Old Testament. The Lord said that the great and first commandment was to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, and mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63978" data-verses="Matthew 22:37-38">vv. 37-38</span>). Then He continued, “And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” These two commandments are both a matter of love, either loving God or loving man. Love is the spirit of God’s commandments.</p>
<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0ix6MkgFs-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> In all these tests the Lord Jesus was questioned regarding four things: religion, politics, belief, and the law. Regarding religion, He was questioned concerning the <span class="pg" data-page-id="695" id="695">[695]</span> source of authority in religious activities. Regarding politics, He was asked about paying tribute to the Roman government. Regarding belief, He was questioned about the belief in the resurrection. Regarding the law, He was asked which was the great commandment. From all four directions those who tested the Lord Jesus were muzzled and had nothing more to say.</p>

MUZZLING ALL THE TESTERS<br/>BY THE QUESTION OF QUESTIONS</h2><p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XruoaH_r55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> After He had been questioned, the Lord had a question for the Pharisees. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63979" data-verses="Matthew 22:41-42">Verses 41 and 42</span> say, “Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose Son is He?” From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63980" data-verses="Matthew 21:23">21:23</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63981" data-verses="Matthew 22:46">22:46</span>, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, Christ was surrounded by the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, Sadducees, and a lawyer, who endeavored to ensnare Him by asking puzzling and crafty questions. Firstly, the chief priests, representing the authority of the Jewish religion, and the elders, representing the authority of the Jewish people, asked Him concerning His authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63982" data-verses="Matthew 21:23">21:23</span>). This was a question according to their religious concept. Secondly, the fundamental Pharisees and political Herodians asked Him a question related to politics. Thirdly, the modernistic Sadducees questioned Him concerning the fundamental belief. Fourthly, a self-qualified lawyer asked Him a question concerning the law. After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them a question concerning Christ. This is the question of questions. Their questions were related to religion, politics, belief, and the law. His question was concerning Christ, who is the center of all things. They knew religion, politics, belief, and the law, but they paid no attention to Christ. Hence, He asked them, “What do you think concerning the Christ?” This question of questions must be answered by everyone.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_ovhaDxzjgRSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> People today have many questions, but all their questions can be classified into the four categories of religion, politics, belief, and the law. Just as in ancient times, <span class="pg" data-page-id="696" id="696">[696]</span> people today care for these things, not for Christ. They simply have no concept concerning Him. But God’s concern is for Christ, and Christ’s concern is for Himself. Hence He asks, “What do you think about Christ? Whose Son is He?” This question touches Christ’s Person, which is a mystery, the most perplexing matter in the universe.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMlsOJEiTAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> Christology is the study of the Person of Christ. From the second century onward, Christian teachers have been fighting with one another concerning Christology. Today the battle between us and the opposers is also related to this matter. For example, one of the leading opposers teaches that Christ is not in us, but is merely represented in us by the Holy Spirit. According to him, Christ is at the right hand of God in the third heaven, and the Holy Spirit represents Him in us. This concept is related to tritheism, the teaching that the three of the Godhead are separate individuals. Those who teach that Christ is merely represented in us by the Holy Spirit actually have three Gods. Deep within, many fundamental Christians subconsciously have this concept. Recently, some opposers have said that Christ’s divinity is in the believers, but His humanity is in heaven. How ridiculous! Now some not only have three Gods, but two Christs, a material Christ and a spiritual Christ. Such peculiar concepts are the issue of our fallen mentality. What a dreadful thing to separate Christ’s humanity from His divinity! This illustrates the fact that the question regarding Christ is still the question of questions today.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqCghFI5f5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> When the Pharisees were asked this question by the Lord, they replied that Christ was David’s son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63983" data-verses="Matthew 22:42">v. 42</span>). No doubt, according to the Scriptures, this answer was correct. Then the Lord said, “How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said to My Lord, Sit on My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his Son?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63984" data-verses="Matthew 22:43-45">vv. 43-45</span>). The question here is how a great-grandfather could call his great-grandson Lord. This was one question the Pharisees did not know how to answer. As God, in His divinity, Christ is the Lord of David; as a man, in His <span class="pg" data-page-id="697" id="697">[697]</span> humanity, He is the Son of David. The Pharisees had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ’s Person, that He was the Son of David according to His humanity. They did not have the other half, concerning Christ’s divinity as the Son of God. The mention of the spirit in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63985" data-verses="Matthew 22:43">verse 43</span> indicates that Christ is only known by us in our spirit through God’s revelation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="63986" data-verses="Ephesians 3:5">Eph. 3:5</span>, Gk.).</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-hXEzwwKgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63987" data-verses="Matthew 22:46">Verse 46</span> says, “And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him any more.” Christ’s question of questions concerning His wonderful Person muzzled the mouths of all His opposers. The Pharisees had studied the Old Testament, and they had seen clearly that Christ was to be the Son of David. But they did not see that Christ was also the Son of God.</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5FigGpJoU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> Even those who have admitted that Christ is both the Son of God and the Son of David have argued whether His two natures were separate or mingled. Instead of arguing about Christ’s Person, we should say, “Hallelujah, we have a Person who is glorious and mysterious! He is so wonderful that we cannot adequately understand Him.” Consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="63988" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” It will take eternity for us to understand this verse. Christ is a child, yet He is the mighty God. He is the Son, yet He is called the everlasting Father. Do not think that we can understand Christ adequately today. No, He is too wonderful and too far beyond our comprehension. We do not even fully understand ourselves, much less Christ. Do you know where your spirit is, or where your soul is? Can you locate your heart? The more you analyze yourself, the more you will find yourself in a maze. When I was very young, I thought I knew myself thoroughly. But the longer I have lived, the more I realize how little I know. If we cannot understand ourselves, how can we adequately understand Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God?</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85ww2S2Yk342_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> How wonderful Christ is! He is both God and man, both the Son of God and the Son of David. Furthermore, He is both in the heavens and in us. He is inside and outside; He <span class="pg" data-page-id="698" id="698">[698]</span> is on the top and on the bottom; He is the greatest and the smallest. Oh, Christ is everything! We need to know Him to such a degree. Then we shall say, “Lord Jesus, I cannot exhaust the knowledge of You. Lord, You are the only worthy One. If there is a God, this God must be You. If there is a genuine human being, this person must be You. Lord, You are the Savior, the Redeemer, the life, and the light.” We today must come to know how inexhaustible the Lord Jesus is as the Son of David and the Son of God. Both the experience of Him and the knowledge of Him are inexhaustible. Because Christ is the all-inclusive One, the enjoyment of Him is inexhaustible.</p>
<p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy9ruK28Hw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> Do not be led into the devilish snare of debate concerning the Person of Christ. Thinking you know everything concerning Christ’s Person is an indication that you have been snared already. Although we can know Christ, we cannot understand Him thoroughly. We know that Jesus Christ is the Son and that He is also called the Father, for the Bible tells us so. But we cannot comprehend this adequately. We also know that Christ is the Son of God and the Son of man and that He has both the divine nature and the human nature in one Person. Thus, He is one Person with two natures and two lives. However, it is beyond our ability to understand this thoroughly. We simply believe whatever the Bible says and praise Him for being so wonderful! We need to worship Him, take Him in, enjoy Him, and experience Him as the wonderful One.</p>

They neither entered in themselves nor allowed those who were entering in to enter. Among today’s Christians, some are just like this. They do not have the heart to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, and at the same time they do not allow those who desire to enter in to do so. Nearly all the opposition against us comes not from unbelievers, but from devoted Christians who desire to frustrate those who want to come this way.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64010" data-verses="Matthew 23:17">verse 17</span> the Lord continues, “Fools and blind, for which is greater, the gold or the temple which sanctifies the gold?” To sanctify the gold is to make the gold holy positionally by changing its position from a common place to a holy one. The temple is greater than the gold because it sanctifies the gold. Sanctification has two aspects, the positional aspect and the dispositional aspect. Here we see that the gold is sanctified by the temple. This is positional sanctification, not dispositional sanctification. Perhaps the gold was once in the market place. When it was there, it was common, not holy, not separated to God. But when the gold was taken from the market place and put into the temple, it was positionally sanctified by being in the temple. Formerly it was the common gold in the market place; now it is the sanctified gold in the temple of God. Although the position of the gold has been changed, its nature remains the same. This is positional sanctification.</p>

The sanctification of the gift by the altar is also a kind of positional sanctification. The sanctification of the gift comes about by changing the gift’s location from a common place to a holy one. Because the altar was greater than the gift, the altar sanctified the gift. For example, when a lamb was with the flock, it was common, not separated to God or sanctified. But once it was offered upon the altar, the altar sanctified the lamb to God. However, as in the case with the gold, the nature of the lamb remained the same. Only its outward position was changed. Formerly it was with the flock; now it is on <span class="pg" data-page-id="704" id="704">[704]</span> the altar for God. This type of sanctification, positional sanctification, does not affect our nature.

Here the Lord made a clear declaration that He, the very glory of God, was leaving the nation of <span class="pg" data-page-id="708" id="708">[708]</span> Israel and that they would not see Him until His coming again. Nearly two thousand years have passed since that time, and Israel still has not seen the Lord Jesus. Some may ask, “Does this mean that the Jews have no opportunity to believe in the Lord Jesus?” As individuals, the Jews still have the opportunity to believe, but as a nation they do not have this opportunity today. As a nation, Israel is through with the Lord. Thank the Lord that He is still merciful to the Jews. Even though He has left the nation of Israel, the back door is still open for individual Jews to come to Him. Today no Jew has the position to come to God as a representative of his nation. But when the Jews are persecuted by their enemies at the end of this age, they will cry out to their God. Then Christ will descend and place His feet on the Mount of Olives, which will be cleft like the waters of the Red Sea. This will enable the Jews to escape from persecution. At that time they will repent to the Lord and call upon Him, and the nation will be saved. This salvation will be not only for individuals, but for the entire nation. However, before the Lord’s coming back, it is impossible for the nation of Israel to repent. But, as we have pointed out, individual Jews can still repent today and come into God’s grace.</p>

<p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy-puKxvXw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> The knowledge most Christians have of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64043" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">Matthew 24</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64044" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">25</span> is vague and indefinite. As we come to these chapters, we need to drop this kind of vague knowledge. For the basic understanding of these chapters we are standing upon the shoulders of many great teachers who have gone before us. These great teachers include Darby, Newton, Pember, Govett, and Panton. According to church history, not until about one hundred fifty years ago were these chapters opened to the Lord’s people. After 1829, when the Brethren were raised up, these chapters began to be opened to the seeking saints. If you collect the various writings regarding Christ’s second coming, the great tribulation, the prophecy concerning the seventy weeks in Daniel, and the rapture, you will see that during the past one hundred fifty years the knowledge of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64045" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">Matthew 24</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64046" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">25</span> has progressed.</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM9Wl8gYmElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> When Brother Nee was young, he was helped a great deal by reading the books of Pember, Govett, and Panton. Of course, he saw something even further, and before 1930 he conducted a study of the book of Revelation, upon which our study of Revelation was based. Later, Brother Nee held a study of Matthew in which he gave several messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64047" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapters twenty-four</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64048" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span>. He also had studies on the matters of the rapture and the tribulation. After he conducted these studies, Brother Nee saw something further. During the last twenty years, I myself also have gone on a little in understanding these matters. Therefore, what I shall present to you in these messages on <span class="pg" data-page-id="710" id="710">[710]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64049" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapters twenty-four</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64050" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span> is not merely the result of my own study, but the product of knowledge that has progressed throughout the past one hundred fifty years. It is not something superficial, but the cream of the labor of many others. The more I have ministered on the Lord’s coming, the rapture, and the tribulation, the more convinced I have become that we have the proper understanding of these things.</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfO23ITvJrftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> Prophecy in the Bible is like a jigsaw puzzle. We need to find the various pieces that are scattered throughout the Bible and see how they fit together. I have been doing this for more than fifty years. What I am presenting in these messages is the result of all these years of study.</p>

This declaration is given at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64053" data-verses="Matthew 23:1">chapter twenty-three</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64054" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">Chapter twenty-four</span> continues, “And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64055" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">v. 1</span>). Notice that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64056" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> begins with the word “And.” This indicates that this chapter is a direct continuation of the last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64057" data-verses="Matthew 23:1">chapter twenty-three</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64058" data-verses="Matthew 23:37-39">23:37-39</span> the Lord said that He desired to gather Jerusalem, that the house was left desolate, and that they would not see Him until they say, “Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord.” Then, immediately after this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64059" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> continues with the words, “And Jesus came out from the temple.” This <span class="pg" data-page-id="711" id="711">[711]</span> indicates that as soon as the Lord had declared that He was forsaking Israel, He came out of the temple and began to go away. The word “away” is very strong, showing that the Lord was not merely going, but going away. The fact that the Lord had come out from the temple indicates that He had left the temple. This was to fulfill His word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64060" data-verses="Matthew 23:38">23:38</span> concerning leaving the temple to the rejecting Jews as their house of desolation. This is equivalent to God’s glory leaving the temple in the time of Ezekiel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64061" data-verses="Ezekiel 10:18">Ezek. 10:18</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_oviYDxwjARSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> As the Lord Jesus was going away from the temple, “His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.” The word “temple” here denotes the entire precincts of the temple. As the Lord was going away, there might have been a distance between Him and His disciples, who were probably still lingering by the temple. Therefore, they came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple. This indicates that the disciples did not agree with the Lord’s forsaking of the temple. The Lord had forsaken the den of robbers, leaving the temple to be a house of desolation. But the disciples still appreciated the temple and were trying to bring Him back to it by pointing out the buildings, perhaps by pointing them out one by one.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMmuOJHjzAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64062" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">Verse 2</span> says, “But He answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, A stone shall by no means be left upon a stone which shall not be thrown down.” This was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when Titus with the Roman army destroyed Jerusalem.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqBihFL4_5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> Notice that the Lord did not say, “I have seen these things”; instead, He said, “Do you not see all these things?” This indicates clearly that the Lord Jesus would not turn His eyes back to look at the buildings. He seemed to be saying, “I don’t like to look at these things, but you have seen them. To you, they are complete, beautiful, splendid, and perfect. But there will not be one stone left upon another which will not be thrown down. Now you point out these things to Me building by building. But the day is coming when all this will be leveled.” We need to visualize the situation here. The disciples kept their eyes <span class="pg" data-page-id="712" id="712">[712]</span> upon the buildings and pointed them out to the Lord. But the Lord would not turn to see them. Rather, He told His disciples that the buildings would be torn down. His answer must have shocked the disciples. As they all walked from the temple to the Mount of Olives, neither the Lord nor the disciples had anything more to say. Because the matter was too serious, the disciples asked Him nothing further until they came to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-iVEzzwqgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64063" data-verses="Matthew 24:3">Verse 3</span> says that after the Lord came to the Mount of Olives and sat down there, the disciples came to Him privately to ask Him about these things. Their meeting with the Lord on the mountain reveals that in order to receive the vision of the Lord’s prophecy concerning this age, we need to climb to the high mountain to enter into His presence.</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5GggGqJIU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> The disciples came to the Lord privately. Having heard the terrible news that the buildings of the temple would be leveled, they wanted to keep this matter confidential. Perhaps as we read these verses today, we do not sense the seriousness of them. But when the disciples heard this word from the Lord Jesus, they were shocked and dared not talk about it openly. Not until the Lord had come to the Mount of Olives and sat down were they bold enough to ask Him about these things.</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85ww1Q2Yn0Y2_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64064" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">verse 2</span> the word “things” refers to the buildings of the temple. But the same term used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64065" data-verses="Matthew 24:3">verse 3</span> refers to matters, which include the things covered from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64066" data-verses="Matthew 23:32">verse 32</span> of the foregoing chapter: the Jews’ filling up the measure of their fathers, the coming of the judgment of God upon them, their persecution of the Lord’s sent ones, and the destruction of the temple. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64067" data-verses="Matthew 24:3">verse 3</span> the disciples were asking the Lord Jesus when these things would transpire.</p>

The Lord’s word from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64071" data-verses="Matthew 24:4">verse 4</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64072" data-verses="Matthew 25:46">25:46</span> answers the disciples’ question concerning these three points.</p>

<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM9Wl8kKGElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> The Greek word rendered “coming” in this verse is <em>parousia, </em>which means presence. Christ’s coming will be His presence with His believers. This parousia will begin with His coming to the air and end with His coming to the earth. Within His parousia, there will be the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64073" data-verses="1Thessalonians 4:15-17">1 Thes. 4:15-17</span>), the judgment seat of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64074" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:10">2 Cor. 5:10</span>), and the marriage of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64075" data-verses="Revelation 19:7-9">Rev. 19:7-9</span>). The question asked here is concerning the sign of the Lord’s parousia and the sign of the end of this age. Hence, His answer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64076" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> deals mainly with the sign of His parousia and with the sign of the end of this age.</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfO23ITqbbftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> The disciples did not ask, “What is Your coming?” They asked, “What is the sign of Your coming?” Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64077" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapters twenty-four</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64078" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span> deal with the Lord’s answer regarding when these things would take place, the sign of His coming, and the sign of the consummation of the age. The consummation of the age denotes the very end of this present age. As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64079" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapters twenty-four</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64080" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span>, we need to be clear that the Lord’s answer is directed to the disciples’ three questions.</p>

For many shall come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they shall lead many astray.” The Lord’s answer is of three sections: the first section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64082" data-verses="Matthew 24:4-31">24:4-31</span>) concerns the Jews who are the elect; the second (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64083" data-verses="Matthew 24:32">24:32—25:30</span>) concerns the church; and the third (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64084" data-verses="Matthew 25:31-46">25:31-46</span>) concerns the Gentiles, the nations. The first section, concerning the Jews, should be literally interpreted; whereas the second section, concerning the church, should be spiritually interpreted, because it is spoken in parables for the reason given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64085" data-verses="Matthew 13:11-13">13:11-13</span>. For instance, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="714" id="714">[714]</span> winter in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64086" data-verses="Matthew 24:20">24:20</span> is a literal winter, but the summer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64087" data-verses="Matthew 24:32">24:32</span> is a symbol signifying the time of restoration. But the third section, concerning the Gentiles, should again be literally interpreted.</p>

<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAXi0cV1MzKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64097" data-verses="Matthew 24:7">Verse 7</span> says, “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines and earthquakes in various places.” “Nation” refers to the peoples, the Gentiles, and “kingdom” refers to the empires. The rising of nation against nation, or people against people, refers to civil war, whereas the rising of kingdom against kingdom refers to international war. From the time of the Lord’s ascension there have been both civil war and international war. Moreover, there have been many famines, which are mostly the issue of war. According to <span class="pg" data-page-id="715" id="715">[715]</span> history, war has always brought famine, signified by the black horse of the third seal in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64098" data-verses="Revelation 6:5-6">Revelation 6:5-6</span>. For example, Germany was defeated in World War I because of the shortage of bread. Thus, the sequence is war, famine, and death.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPPeRzkOoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> The Lord also said that there would be earthquakes in various places.

The Jews, as God’s elect, will suffer birth pangs like a woman in travail to bring forth a remnant who will participate in the Messianic kingdom, the earthly section of the millennium. Then the nation of Israel will rejoice.</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuIdOlkrjkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> As we have seen, the Lord’s answer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64105" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapters twenty-four</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64106" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span> is in three sections, the sections concerning the Jews, the church, and the Gentiles. On earth today there are these three categories of peoples. Thus, in order to give the disciples a full answer to their question, the Lord covers these three peoples in a good sequence, beginning with the Jews and then continuing with the church and the Gentiles. When the Lord spoke this prophecy, His audience, composed of the disciples, had a dual status. On the one hand, they were Jews; on the other hand, they were the disciples of Christ, the representatives of the church. Hence, the Lord spoke to them both about the Jews and about the church. However, we must be careful not to apply the verses in the section dealing with the Jews to the Christians in the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsTdqr2dthgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> We have pointed out that the Lord’s word in the section concerning the Jews is a plain word and requires no interpretation. For example, when the Lord speaks of winter, He means a literal winter; and when He mentions the Sabbath, He is talking about an actual Sabbath. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="716" id="716">[716]</span> the second section, the section concerning the church, requires a great deal of interpretation because in this section the Lord speaks in parables. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64107" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> we see that the church is a mystery. Thus, in order to preserve the mystery of the church, the Lord could not speak in plain words, but needed to speak in parables, which require interpretation. For example, the summer spoken of in this section is not an actual summer; rather, it is a symbol of the restored kingdom of the Jews. Likewise, the fig tree is a symbol of the nation of Israel, and the virgins are symbols of the believers. The third section, the section concerning the Gentiles, is spoken in plain words and does not require interpretation.</p>
<p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFa4ZKQGQD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> The section regarding the Jews is full of suffering because the nation of Israel is compared to a woman giving birth to a child. The process of delivering the child has gone on for nearly two thousand years. What a prolonged delivery! According to the Bible, this long delivery is a form of punishment to the woman. Thus, the nation of Israel, the woman delivering the child, is still suffering. Everything mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64108" data-verses="Matthew 24:4-7">verses 4 through 7</span> is the beginning of birth pangs, not the actual sufferings. The time of suffering will be the great tribulation spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64109" data-verses="Matthew 24:21">verse 21</span>. Hence, the sufferings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64110" data-verses="Matthew 24:4-7">verses 4 through 7</span> are not the great tribulation, but the beginning of birth pangs. Throughout the centuries, the Lord has dealt with the Jews in a sovereign way. Nevertheless, the Jews have passed through one suffering after another. Even today, the nation of Israel is suffering. Many Arab countries are opposing her.</p>
<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgj0tK_x2SNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> Although the nation of Israel has been in the process of delivering a child for such a long time, the child still has not come forth. This child will be the remnant of Israel that will be saved and restored. The nation of Israel today has not come up to God’s intention. Some of us visited Israel this year; the sin, immorality, and superstition we saw there were disgusting. The Bible prophesied that the Jews would return to the good land in unbelief. Nevertheless, the Lord will take care of them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="717" id="717">[717]</span> </p>

To be saved here implies to be saved into the manifestation of the kingdom. Suppose, because of persecution and hatred, some Jewish believers are defeated. Those who are defeated will not participate in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, in this verse, to be saved is not to receive eternal salvation; it is to be saved out of persecution and it is to be saved into the manifestation of the kingdom.</p>

Before the great tribulation comes, everything in these <span class="pg" data-page-id="719" id="719">[719]</span> verses will transpire. The last item will be the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom. I believe that the churches in the Lord’s recovery will bear the burden to bring this gospel to all the inhabited earth. The gospel of grace has been preached in every continent, but not the gospel of the kingdom. The gospel of grace is the lower gospel, but the gospel of the kingdom is the higher gospel. This higher gospel will be brought to every continent through the churches in the Lord’s recovery. This, the strongest sign of the consummation of the age, will take place before the great tribulation. Thus, the most important sign of the consummation of the age is the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to all the inhabited earth.</p>

<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAXiEcSl8zKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> We have seen that the Lord’s answer to His disciples’ question is of three sections: the section concerning the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64121" data-verses="Matthew 24:4-31">24:4-31</span>), the section concerning the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64122" data-verses="Matthew 24:32">24:32—25:30</span>), and the section concerning the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64123" data-verses="Matthew 25:31-46">25:31-46</span>). The section concerning Israel is divided into two parts: from Christ’s ascension to the end of the age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64124" data-verses="Matthew 24:1-14">24:1-14</span>) and during the end of the age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64125" data-verses="Matthew 24:15-31">24:15-31</span>). In order to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64126" data-verses="Matthew 24:1-31">24:1-31</span>, we must keep these subsections in mind. We must also be careful not to misapply the verses, that is, not to apply them to the wrong time or to the wrong people.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPPehzhcIGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> Many Christian teachers do not understand the significance of the term “the end of the age.” The Greek phrase here can also be translated “the completion of the age” or “the consummation of the age.” The end of the age denotes the three and a half years of the great tribulation that will terminate this age. Therefore, the end of the age is not the close of the age, but the very last period of the age. In order to understand the prophecies in the Old and New Testaments, we must have a clear understanding of this matter. Many Christian teachers are confused regarding the prophecies because they are not clear about the end of this age.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYIU1HuXh6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> This term “the consummation of the age” is found in the last verse of Matthew (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64127" data-verses="Matthew 28:20">28:20</span>). Because we hope to be raptured, we expect the Lord to be with us until the end of this age, not until the close of the age. At the close of the age, the Lord will descend to the earth and place His feet on the Mount of Olives. Before this takes place, there will be a period of time which the Bible calls the end of the age, <span class="pg" data-page-id="722" id="722">[722]</span> a period of time which will last three and a half years. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64128" data-verses="Matthew 24:6">24:6</span> the Lord told His disciples that they would hear of wars and rumors of wars, but that “the end is not yet.” He told them not to be disturbed, for such things were but the beginning of birth pangs. The end of the age, the great tribulation, was not yet. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64129" data-verses="Matthew 24:14">verse 14</span> He said that the gospel of the kingdom would be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations and then the end would come. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64130" data-verses="Matthew 24:6">verse 6</span> He said that the end was not yet, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64131" data-verses="Matthew 24:14">verse 14</span> He said that the end would come.</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuId-lv5jkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> We need to remember that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64132" data-verses="Matthew 24:1-14">24:1-14</span> speaks of the things between Christ’s ascension and the end of the age.

The end of the age begins with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64134" data-verses="Matthew 24:15">verse 15</span>. Remember, this chapter speaks especially about the sign of the Lord’s coming and the sign of the end of the age. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64135" data-verses="Matthew 24:14">Verse 14</span> indicates that a strong sign of the end of the age is the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the whole world. When this has been accomplished, we should realize that the last three and a half years are about to begin. Thus, the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom will be the greatest sign of the end of this age. Prior to this preaching, many other things will have taken place. But these things are not the signs of the end of the age, for in speaking about them the Lord said that the end was not yet. Therefore, the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to all the inhabited earth will be the unique sign of the end of this age. Immediately after the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, the events described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64136" data-verses="Matthew 24:15">verse 15</span> will take place. <span class="pg" data-page-id="723" id="723">[723]</span> </p>

The Greek word rendered “desolation” means “causing desolation,” “desolating.” The abomination, the idol of Antichrist, will cause desolation. Antichrist is called the destroyer (Apollyon, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64148" data-verses="Revelation 9:11">Rev. 9:11</span>); he will do much destroying (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64149" data-verses="Daniel 8:13">Dan. 8:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64150" data-verses="Daniel 8:23-25">23-25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64151" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">9:27</span>). As soon as Antichrist sets up his image and forces people to worship it, he will begin to destroy all religious things. Furthermore, this idol will provoke the Lord’s anger, and He will come in to destroy Antichrist and his army.

The first time Jerusalem was destroyed was under Nebuchadnezzar with the Babylonian army. Later, in the second century B.C., after the rebuilding of the temple, the temple was polluted by Antiochus Epiphanes. Many Bible students realize that he was a type of Titus, who came to destroy Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Certain portions of Daniel refer both to Antiochus and Titus, and it is sometimes difficult to discern which verses refer to Antiochus and which to Titus. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64164" data-verses="Luke 21:1">Luke 21</span> indicates that the destruction of Jerusalem under Titus is connected to the destruction under Antichrist. For this reason, readers of the New Testament find it difficult to determine which verses refer to the destruction under Titus and which refer to the destruction under Antichrist. Thus, Antiochus Epiphanes was a type of Titus, and Titus was a type of Antichrist.</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiAKxK2S5M5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> We must be careful not to confuse the verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64165" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">Matthew 24</span> with those in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64166" data-verses="Luke 21:1">Luke 21</span>, for they do not refer to exactly the same thing.

The last week will be the last seven years of Israel’s history in this age. At the beginning of these seven years, the Jews will make a covenant with Antichrist. But at the middle of these seven years, Antichrist will change his mind and turn his back upon them. In his agreement with the Jews, Antichrist will allow them to worship God according to the Jewish religion. But at the end of the first three and one half years, Antichrist will begin to persecute every kind of religion, set up his image in the temple, and force people to worship him. That will be the beginning of the great tribulation, the end of this age, the last three and one half years. In God’s sovereignty and mercy, this time has been cut short. The tribulation under Antichrist will be so severe that no one will be able to bear it. If God had not cut it short, no flesh at all would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be limited to three and one half years.</p>

As the lightning flashes from the east to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faHKyug4KZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> The coming (parousia) of Christ has two aspects: one is the secret aspect toward His watchful believers; the other is the open aspect toward the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles. The lightning here signifies the open aspect after the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64182" data-verses="Matthew 24:29">v. 29</span>), whereas the thief’s coming in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64183" data-verses="Matthew 24:43">verse 43</span> signifies the secret aspect before the great tribulation. Lightning is concealed in a cloud, waiting for <span class="pg" data-page-id="728" id="728">[728]</span> an opportunity to flash forth. Christ will also be clothed with a cloud (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64184" data-verses="Revelation 10:1">Rev. 10:1</span>) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5grHa69Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> The Greek word <em>parousia</em> is a specific word used in the New Testament to describe the Lord’s coming. Parousia means the Lord’s presence. This presence of the Lord begins with His coming to the air. It is difficult to determine when He will come from heaven to the air. Between the two aspects of the Lord’s coming, His coming to the air and His coming to the earth, there is the parousia, the Lord’s presence. This is the reason the Lord’s coming has a secret aspect and an open aspect. His coming to the air is secret, but His coming to the earth is public. Twelve hundred sixty days after Antichrist sets up his image, Christ will come to earth. Thus, His open coming can be calculated, but His secret coming is not known by anyone. When He comes to the air, He will be enveloped in a cloud. But when He comes to the earth, He will be upon the cloud.</p>

In the context, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64186" data-verses="Matthew 24:15">verses 15</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64187" data-verses="Matthew 24:21">21</span> imply that at the end of this age Antichrist will be the cause of the great tribulation. It is he who needs to be judged and destroyed. As all people in Adam are dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64188" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:22">1 Cor. 15:22</span>), so in the eyes of the Lord the evil Antichrist with his evil army, who will war against the Lord at Armageddon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64189" data-verses="Revelation 19:17-21">Rev. 19:17-21</span>), is the stinking corpse, good for the vultures’ appetite. And as in the Scriptures both the Lord and those who trust in Him are likened to the eagle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64190" data-verses="Exodus 19:4">Exo. 19:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64191" data-verses="Deuteronomy 32:11">Deut. 32:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64192" data-verses="Isaiah 40:31">Isa. 40:31</span>), and the swift destroying armies are also likened to flying eagles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64193" data-verses="Deuteronomy 28:49">Deut. 28:49</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64194" data-verses="Hosea 8:1">Hos. 8:1</span>, NASV), so the vultures here, of the same raptorial kind as <span class="pg" data-page-id="729" id="729">[729]</span> the eagle, must refer to Christ and the overcomers, who will come as a swift-flying army to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them, thus executing God’s judgment upon them at Armageddon. This indicates not only that at His appearing to the earth Christ with His overcoming saints will be where Antichrist is with his armies, but also that Christ with the overcomers will appear swiftly from the air like the vultures. This corresponds with the lightning’s flash in the foregoing verse.</p>

When Antichrist sets up his image, we may begin to count twelve hundred sixty days until Christ descends publicly to the earth. But this does not mean that we can know the day of His secret coming. Never be so foolish as to try to find out this day. During the past century, a number of people have tried to do this. Some even bathed, put on clean garments, and went to a housetop to wait for His coming; however, nothing happened. To repeat, the Lord’s coming to the air is secret. He will come as a thief to steal you secretly. No one can give the day or the hour of this coming. But His coming to the earth will be open and the day is revealed: twelve hundred sixty days after the idol is set up. As we have pointed out, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64196" data-verses="Matthew 24:28">verse 28</span> indicates the place—the place where the armies of Antichrist are.

The Israelis and the Arabs are quarreling about the land west of the Jordan and about the Golan Heights. According to the Bible, the Golan Heights, close to Mount Hermon, and the land west <span class="pg" data-page-id="735" id="735">[735]</span> of the Jordan belong to the good land and will belong to Israel. The Lord is sovereign and He knows the situation between Israel and the Arabs. He realizes that the restoration of the nation of Israel is not yet in full. The restoration of the nation of Israel is becoming more and more full. At the time of the millennium, it will reach its fullness.</p>

The Lord’s coming (parousia) <span class="pg" data-page-id="736" id="736">[736]</span> will be as the <em>days</em> of Noah. This indicates that the Lord’s parousia will be a period of time. This period will be as the <em>days</em> of Noah; that is, the situation of the Lord’s parousia will be like that in the days of Noah.</p>

It is because in the days of Noah the following conditions existed: people were befuddled by eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage; and they did not know until the flood came and took them away. During the Lord’s parousia, people will be the same: befuddled by the necessities of this life and not knowing that God’s judgment (signified by the flood) will come upon them by the Lord’s coming. The believers, however, should be de-drugged and soberly know that Christ is coming to execute God’s judgment upon this corrupted world.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPPexzlOIGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> Eating, drinking, and marriage were originally ordained by God for man’s existence. But due to man’s lust, Satan utilizes these necessities of human life to occupy man and keep him from God’s interests. Toward the end of this age, this situation will be intensified and will reach its climax during the Lord’s parousia.</p>

This indicates that the people of those days were drugged by their fleshly, worldly enjoyment. The same thing is happening in society today. The enemy of God, Satan, utilizes the necessities of life to poison the people created by God. The entire human race has been poisoned. However, this does not mean that there is no need for us to eat, drink, or get married. All this is necessary for our existence. But we must not allow these things to drug us and to dull our senses. In human society today the senses of every <span class="pg" data-page-id="737" id="737">[737]</span> person, high or low, old or young, are numb, indicating that the people have been poisoned by the way of this age in eating, drinking, and giving in marriage.

<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuIdullqDkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> People today are studying and working for the purpose of enjoying good eating, good drinking, and a good marriage. They have no thought concerning the things of God. How prevailing is this lack of sense concerning God today! It is prevailing especially in the educational sphere and the commercial sphere. So many in the universities have been drugged by their pursuit of an education. Their education is merely for eating, drinking, and marriage. Those in the commercial field have also been drugged by the desire to make money, also for the purpose of having better eating, drinking, and marriage. This has caused many divorces. When a young man is poor, he may marry a certain woman. But when he makes more money, he may divorce his wife and marry another in his desire for a better wife. This situation will continue until it reaches the climax during the Lord’s parousia. During the days of Noah, this climax was reached a little before the flood which came in with the judgment of God. In a sense, the parousia of Christ will be like the flood coming with God’s judgment. The flood brought judgment upon the drugged people of Noah’s day. The parousia will bring God’s judgment upon this drugged world. Christ will descend to earth and execute God’s righteous judgment upon this drugged and rebellious world.</p>

To the befuddled people, this should be a sign of Christ’s coming.</p>

This is indicated by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64241" data-verses="Matthew 24:42">verse 42</span>, which tells us to watch because we do not know on what day our Lord comes. Both “watch therefore” and “your Lord” prove that the two men and the two women in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64242" data-verses="Matthew 24:40-41">verses 40 and 41</span> are believers. The Lord would not charge unsaved people to watch, nor is He the Lord of the unsaved.</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I8XY604Zx2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> To be taken means to be raptured before the great tribulation. This rapture is a sign of the Lord’s coming and a sign to the Jews. It is very interesting to see that the two men are working in the field and that the two women are grinding at the mill. Both working in the field and grinding are for eating. There is a difference between our eating and the eating of the worldly people. The worldly people study and work, and we also study and work. The worldly people, however, have been drugged. But we have not been drugged. Rather, we are simply fulfilling our duty to make a living. We are not for eating, drinking, and marriage; on the contrary, we maintain our existence in order to take the way of the cross to fulfill God’s purpose. Our concern is not for our education, employment, or business.</p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4PB6yZCP8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> When some of the young people hear this, they may say, “How glad we are to hear this word! Let’s not care any more for study or for work. Let us spend all our time praying and having fellowship with one another.” Such an attitude is wrong. Remember, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64243" data-verses="Matthew 24:40">verse 40</span> the brothers were farming, and according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64244" data-verses="Matthew 24:41">verse 41</span> the sisters were grinding. Grinding grain is very hard work. This indicates that we Christians should not take easy jobs. We need to work hard in order to make a living. The eating and drinking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64245" data-verses="Matthew 24:38">verse 38</span> is worldly, but the farming and grinding in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64246" data-verses="Matthew 24:40-41">verses 40 and 41</span> are holy. If the ones taken were not doing something holy, they could not have been raptured. <span class="pg" data-page-id="739" id="739">[739]</span> Do you realize that farming can be holy, but working as a pastor can be very worldly? A Bible teacher may be worldly; yet a sister who grinds grain may be holy. Many of the sisters who work at cooking the meals are holy sisters. It is not those who talk about holiness who are necessarily holy. Sometimes the more certain sisters talk about being holy, the less holy they are. It is better for such sisters to spend more time cooking to serve excellent food to their husbands, their children, and those to whom they give hospitality. The sisters who do this will be holy. Some sisters know how to have fellowship about being holy, but they do not know how to do a good job in their cooking. They always cook plain meals for their families, excusing themselves by saying that there is no need for them to waste time in cooking. But after a period of time, their husbands and children are discontent with such cooking. The more these sisters talk about being holy, the less holy their husbands and children become. They talk about holiness, but they do not take proper care of their families. We need more holy sisters to grind at the mill to produce fine flour. We are not drugged, but we do need to be properly nourished.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZTjudw9iy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> The principle is the same with the brothers in their jobs. A brother should not talk about holiness and neglect his job. If he does this, he will be fired. Notice, the rapture does not take place when the two brothers and the two sisters are praying, but when they are working. When I was young, I was told how wonderful it would be to be raptured while we were praying or reading the Bible. But the Lord Jesus does not speak this way. Instead, He says that two men were farming and that two women were grinding. They were not fasting, praying, or reading the Bible; they were doing their ordinary work.</p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS93a8dU-asIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> The Lord Jesus certainly spoke this word with a definite purpose. He wanted to show us that as we wait for His coming and expect to be raptured, we must be very faithful in our daily duties. We need to do the best farming and the best grinding. We need a properly balanced human life, <span class="pg" data-page-id="740" id="740">[740]</span> not the life of monks who devote themselves to spiritual things and expect others to take care of them. It is the brothers working in the field and the sisters grinding in the mill who will be raptured.</p>
<p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2wcKLE_Q0EzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> There used to be a proverb that anyone who becomes a preacher becomes useless. The reason for this proverb is that preachers do not need to work to earn a living. Rather, the burden for their living is placed upon others. It is a shame for us to be like this. We need to work diligently and do our duty in a proper way. When we are in the field or at the mill, we may be raptured. The sisters who are wives and mothers must do the best grinding and learn how to prepare the most healthy meals for their families. Sisters, if your husband and children are not healthy, you will be held responsible for this before the Lord. If you take care of this matter before the Lord, you will be truly holy. Do not spend your time in talking about holiness, but spend it in cooking healthy, digestible, delicious meals. You need to prepare good meals to preserve the life of your husband and to build up the health of your children. This matter is included in the Lord’s reference to grinding at the mill.</p>

<p data-content-id="KJEWVtLfOnw9Yxg9_3P5EL_t9p_AanTep0fB8fNd2CrXG7zPGzDylZTVqAClKS52d"> The brothers who are fathers and husbands also need to work diligently at their jobs to earn the money needed to take care of their families. Those who work simply to have a great deal of money in the bank are drugged. But we need to labor in order to provide the best things for our children. Otherwise, we are faithful neither to God nor to our children. As parents, we must do the best to educate our children. We should not have the attitude that it is good enough for them to graduate from high school and work in a menial job. To be in the field means that we care that our children are fed well and educated in the best way. We should not be those who love the world and work to make money for ourselves. But we should be those who work diligently to earn money for our family. As those with a fallen human nature, it is easy for us to excuse ourselves for not spending so much time in the field or at the grinding. If you do this, you will not be raptured. I repeat, you will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="741" id="741">[741]</span> raptured while you are working in the field or grinding out the grain.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19P_I3DGAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> Of the two men in the field, one is taken and the other is left; and of the two women grinding at the mill, one is taken and the other left. The reason for this is that there is a difference between them in the matter of life. I believe that the one taken is mature and that the one left is immature. The life makes the difference. The rapture of the overcomers, those who are mature in life, will be a sign to those who are left. Suppose you are working in the field with a brother and he is suddenly taken away to the heavens. That would certainly be a sign to you. Suppose two sisters are grinding at the mill, and one is taken away to the Lord. Surely that would be a sign to the sister who was left!</p>

A thief comes to steal precious things at an unknown time. The Lord will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him and will take them away as His treasures. Hence, we should watch. “Therefore,” as the Lord says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64249" data-verses="Matthew 24:44">verse 44</span>, “you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not.” This refers to the Lord’s secret coming to the watchful overcomers.</p>

To beat the fellow slaves is to mistreat the fellow believers, and to eat and drink with the drunken is to keep company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things.</p>

He does not like to live the kind of life that is prepared for the Lord’s coming. Therefore, when the Lord comes back, He will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. To cut him asunder means to cut him off. This signifies a separation from the Lord in His coming glory. This corresponds to being cast out into the outer darkness in the conclusion of the parable of the talents (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64261" data-verses="Matthew 25:14-30">25:14-30</span>), which is a completion to this section.

This is not to perish eternally, but to be chastened dispensationally. Who can say that the evil slave is not a genuine believer? If he were not a brother, how could his work have been assigned by the Lord? The Lord would not assign duties to a false believer. Certainly the evil slave is a saved one. In Matthew, the book of the kingdom, the issue is not salvation. The issue is the kingdom: whether we shall receive a reward to enter into the kingdom, or whether we shall lose the reward, miss the enjoyment of the kingdom, and suffer punishment and discipline where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

Watchfulness and readiness are related to our Christian life. We all need to be watchful and ready for the Lord’s coming. However, a proper Christian should take care not only of the aspect of life, but also of the aspect of service. For service, we need faithfulness and prudence. Thus, we need to be faithful toward the Lord and prudent toward our fellow believers. As we have seen, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64262" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> both aspects are covered. In life we need to be watchful and ready, and in service we need to be faithful and prudent.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvU2dguqPuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> Although both these aspects are covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64263" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>, they are not covered fully. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64264" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> there is the need of a complementary word for each aspect covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64265" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64266" data-verses="Matthew 25:1-30">Matthew 25:1-30</span> completes the section in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64267" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> concerning the believers. The parable of the virgins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64268" data-verses="Matthew 25:1-13">25:1-13</span>) completes the matter of watchfulness and readiness. How to watch and be ready is revealed in the parable of the virgins. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64269" data-verses="Matthew 25:13">Matthew 25:13</span>, the last verse of the parable of the virgins, says, “Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.” This word, very similar to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64270" data-verses="Matthew 24:42">24:42</span>, indicates that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64271" data-verses="Matthew 25:1-13">25:1-13</span> is a completion to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64272" data-verses="Matthew 24:40-44">24:40-44</span> concerning watchfulness for rapture.</p>

This indicates that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64279" data-verses="Matthew 25:14-30">25:14-30</span> is a completion to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64280" data-verses="Matthew 24:45-51">24:45-51</span>, which concerns faithfulness for the Lord’s work. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64281" data-verses="Matthew 24:45-51">Matthew 24:45-51</span> deals with the slave’s unfaithfulness in fulfilling the Lord’s commission. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64282" data-verses="Matthew 25:14-30">Matthew 25:14-30</span> is still needed to deal with the slave’s unfaithfulness in using the Lord’s talent. Although <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64283" data-verses="Matthew 24:45-51">24:45-51</span> tells us to be faithful and prudent, it does not show us how to be faithful and prudent.

<p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY9i_C3K8lV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> The way to be watchful is through the infilling of the Holy Spirit; it is by having the extra portion of oil. By ourselves we can be neither watchful nor ready. The only way to have the extra portion of oil is by the infilling of the Holy Spirit. This is the way for us to be watchful and ready. Likewise, the way to be faithful and prudent in the Lord’s service is through the spiritual gifts. Without the spiritual gifts, we do not have the ability to be faithful or prudent. Our faithfulness and prudence depend upon the gifts we have received of the Lord. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64284" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> we have both the infilling of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit. The Spirit affords us the infilling for life and also the gifts for service. It all depends upon the Spirit. How can we be watchful? Only by the infilling of the Holy Spirit. And how can we be faithful? Only by the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzhkttLdcsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> The two men in the field or the two women grinding at the mill represent the living believers. However, when the Lord’s parousia comes, the majority of the believers will have died. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64292" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span> we have the rapture of the living believers, but this chapter says nothing about the dead saints. This is covered by the parable of the virgins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64293" data-verses="Matthew 25:1-13">25:1-13</span>. The fact that the virgins “became drowsy and slept” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64294" data-verses="Matthew 25:5">v. 5</span>) indicates that they died. In the eyes of the Lord, when a saint dies, he goes to sleep. Therefore, the ten virgins, who all fell asleep, represent the dead saints.</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFGAFm27HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> In the Bible God’s people are of the number twelve, for this number represents the whole body of God’s people. In the Bible one way the number twelve is composed is of ten plus two. Ten denotes the majority of twelve, and two signifies the remainder. For example, two of the twelve apostles asked the Lord to let them sit on His right hand and on His left hand, whereas the other ten were indignant. In the Old Testament ten tribes rebelled against the house of David, whereas only two remained faithful. The principle is the same here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64295" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapters twenty-four</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64296" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span>.

When the ten and the two are put together, we have the whole body of believers. At the time of the Lord’s coming, the majority of the believers will have died.

Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins, bearing the Lord’s testimony (the lamp) in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord. For this they need not only the indwelling, but also the fullness of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p data-content-id="V_sVjQ5YFtBlI64zdrrEHtHpu7irHC5It5-_F32dAZddOnD1P8_dQXKatkAxm35ki"> We Christians firstly are virgins. Being a virgin is not a matter of work, service, or activity, but a matter of life. Moreover, we are not only virgins, but chaste, pure virgins. Being a virgin is not a matter of what we do or are able to do; it is absolutely a matter of what we are. Whether we are male or female, we are virgins. Although I am an old man, I conduct myself like a virgin. I would never sell my status as a virgin. Even before the enemy, I am a virgin.</p>

The believers shine with the light of the Spirit of God from within their spirit.

In one of his writings, D. M. Panton said that the world was just a pathway to him and at the end of this pathway there would be a grave. If the Lord delays His coming back, the world eventually will afford me only a resting place, a tomb in which to lie as I wait for the Lord’s coming. We are not settled in this world. We are going out of the world.</p>

It indicates that all believers bear responsibility to be filled with the Spirit of God.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5gqna795o1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> The Old Testament reveals clearly that five is the number of responsibility.

It is composed of four plus one. As we have pointed out, the number four signifies the creature and the number one the Creator. The creature plus the Creator gives the ability to bear responsibility. If we had just four fingers without a thumb, it would be difficult for us to do anything. This means that by ourselves, as the number four, we cannot bear responsibility. But when God is added to us, we are able to bear responsibility.</p>

Hence, vessels here signify the soul of the believers. The five prudent virgins not only have oil in their lamps, but also take oil in their vessels.

Within the lamp is the oil, the Holy Spirit. The New Testament <span class="pg" data-page-id="751" id="751">[751]</span> reveals that our spirit is the place the Holy Spirit indwells. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64326" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span>, we are vessels made by God. Our being, our personality, is in our soul. Therefore, the vessel in this verse signifies our soul. Through regeneration we have the Spirit of God in our spirit. This causes our lamp to burn. But the question is whether or not we have the extra portion of the Holy Spirit filling our soul. Although we have the oil in our lamp, we need the extra portion of the oil in our soul. This signifies that the Spirit must spread from within our spirit to every part of our soul. Then in our soul we shall have an extra amount of the Holy Spirit. If we have this extra portion, we are prudent. If we do not have it, we are foolish. In other words, if we are indifferent to the infilling of the Holy Spirit, we are foolish. If we are wise, we shall pray, “Lord, have mercy on me. I want to have Your Spirit not only in my spirit, but also in my soul. Lord, I need the infilling of the Spirit. I need the extra portion of the Holy Spirit to fill my entire being.” Without this extra portion of the Spirit, we cannot be watchful or ready. In order to be watchful and ready, we need the infilling of the Holy Spirit, the spreading of the Spirit Himself from our spirit to every part of our inward being.</p>

<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiALBKxApM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> Concerning the Christian life, the New Testament reveals that firstly we need to receive the Spirit of God into our spirit so that we may be regenerated. Following this, we need to grow. To grow is to be transformed, and to be transformed is mainly to be renewed in the spirit of the mind. Transformation and the renewing of the mind issue in the infilling of the Holy Spirit in our soul. Our mind is the leading part of our soul. To be renewed in the spirit of our mind is to have our mind filled and saturated with the Spirit. Then the Spirit that has saturated our mind will renew our whole being. Thus, our being, our soul, will be saturated with the infilling Spirit. This is the way to have the extra portion of oil in the vessel.</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0fFDRoEM_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> As we pointed out in the foregoing message, to be regenerated, to have the new birth, is to have the Spirit in our spirit, that is, to have the oil in our lamp. To have the Spirit in our soul means that we grow in life, are transformed, are renewed in our whole being, and have our soul saturated with the Holy Spirit of God. This is to have the oil in the vessel. This is the way to be watchful and to be ready for the Lord’s coming. It is also the way to be prepared to be raptured into the Lord’s presence.</p>

Parable for Faithfulness</h2><p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMktIrl6KCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> Having covered the parable for watchfulness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64358" data-verses="Matthew 25:1-13">25:1-13</span>), we proceed in this message to the parable for faithfulness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64359" data-verses="Matthew 25:14-30">25:14-30</span>). The parable of the virgins is for watchfulness, but the parable of the talents is for faithfulness.</p>
<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz4EYcAZBMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> When we were on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64360" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>, we pointed out <span class="pg" data-page-id="758" id="758">[758]</span> that concerning the believers, there are two aspects: the aspect of watchfulness and readiness and the aspect of faithfulness and prudence. The believers have these two aspects because they have a dual status. The first aspect of this dual status is related to life, and the second aspect is related to service. No Christian should neglect these two aspects; rather, we must pay the proper attention to both, becoming proper in life and in service. Regarding life, we are virgins; regarding service, we are slaves. This means that in watchfulness we are virgins. This relates to what we are. But in faithfulness we are slaves. This relates to what we do.</p>
<p data-content-id="Js1ew0_2bBKDqxAdzQvVFXm7m8NTUKftuMvcY3SK-oXd8DYEssiinjP2qWQ9IL-tp"> Although we may like the term “virgins,” we may not like hearing that we are slaves. Nevertheless, we are not only virgins, but also slaves. To the virgins, the Lord is the Bridegroom, but to the slaves, He is the Master. Thus, not only we have a dual status, but the Lord also has a dual status. On the one hand, He is our pleasant Bridegroom and, on the other, our strict Master. Sometimes He is very pleasant with us, but at other times He deals with us in a strict way.</p>
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OSj3PIvG0rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> The virgins need something inward—the inward filling of the oil in the vessel. The slaves, however, need something outward—the spiritual talent. The infilling of the Holy Spirit is inward, but the talent, the spiritual gift, is outward. As vessels we need the oil inwardly, and as slaves we need the talents outwardly.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKlwtwoR5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> The oil that fills the vessel reaches the very bottom of the vessel. It is from within that the renewing of our being takes place, and it is from within that transformation transpires. There is a great lack of this inward working among Christians today. Rather, many Christians are striving to improve their outward appearance in order to make a show. Religion is concerned with outward show, but God’s grace in the infilling of the Holy Spirit gets into us and transforms us from within. The inward oil is very different from outward makeup. Makeup changes our complexion immediately. But God’s way is that we drink of the Spirit and let the Spirit saturate our being. Then our <span class="pg" data-page-id="759" id="759">[759]</span> appearance will change from within. For example, I eat and drink well, and nourishing food saturates my being. This gives me a healthy complexion.</p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAXj0cW3szKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> The fact that we need to be renewed from within does not mean that we do not need outward activities. The one who received five talents traded with them diligently and gained another five talents. This indicates that we need both the inward renewing and the outward service, the inward growth and the outward actions. We need to be deeply impressed with this principle. Regarding the aspect of life, we need to be renewed from within, and regarding the aspect of service, we need to be very active outwardly. Sometimes we may be so active outwardly that we neglect the inward renewing. But at other times we may care so much for the inner life that we do not work adequately. To be like this is to be an unturned cake (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64361" data-verses="Hosea 7:8">Hosea 7:8</span>). On one side we are burned to charcoal, and on the other side we are raw. Neither side is good for eating. We need to be a turned cake. If we work too much, the Lord will tell us to rest. But if we rest too much, the Lord will tell us to work.</p>

For life we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His fullness, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord’s testimony; for service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift, that we may be equipped as a good slave for the accomplishment of the Lord’s work. The fullness of the Spirit in life is for us to use the spiritual gift in service, and the spiritual gift in service matches the fullness of the Spirit in life that we may be perfected as members of Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4PAayZAP8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64376" data-verses="Matthew 25:14">Verse 14</span> says that the man gave his slaves his possessions, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64377" data-verses="Matthew 25:15">verse 15</span> says that he gave them talents.

In other words, the Lord uses His possessions as talents for us. For example, the gospel is the Lord’s possession. But when it is given to us, it becomes our talent. Likewise, the truth is the Lord’s possession. But when the truth is given to us, it becomes a talent. In the same principle, all the believers are the Lord’s possessions. When the believers are given to us, they become our talents. Without all the believers, my talent would not be very big. Furthermore, the church is the Lord’s possession. When the church is given to us, it becomes our talent. The more of His possessions the Lord gives to us, the more talents we shall have. In like manner, the more the Lord burdens us, the more talents we shall have.</p>

However, they do not know that the source of the gifts is the Lord’s possessions. Today the Lord’s possessions primarily are the gospel, the truth, the believers, and the church. If you do not care for these things, you will not have any talents. The gospel needs to become our possession. The same is true of the truth, the believers, and the churches. My talents are not natural. Rather, they are the gospel, the truth, the believers, and the church. If you took all these things away from me, I would have nothing left. I have a strong talent because I have not only the gospel and the truth, but also thousands of believers and hundreds of churches. This is the reason this ministry has had impact.</p>

No, we must diligently seek the gospel and the truth. We should be eager to know the fall of man, redemption, regeneration, salvation, the cleansing of the blood, and the washing of the Spirit. All these are aspects of the full gospel. The more you receive of the gospel, the more talents you will have. We need to pray that the Lord would help us to know the truth and to experience it. We need to experience the truth concerning the church, God’s eternal purpose, and God’s economy. Eventually, these truths will become our talent. Then we shall be able to minister them to others. In this way, the Lord’s possessions become our talent. Furthermore, we need to pray, “Lord, I want to take care of the saints and bear their burdens. My heart is for them.” If we have a heart for the saints and are burdened for them, they, the Lord’s possession, will be given to us as a talent. How thankful I am that so many saints and churches have become my talent! My ministry is strongly backed up by all the saints and all the churches in the Far East. If the Lord sent me to another place, I would also have the support of the churches in the United States, for the churches here have become an addition to my talent.</p>
<p data-content-id="QVHrTl_ypSqw4x5Uyo2wcLrE-RUEzYnLcFSaTF_2EY5E-Uhd2f8LEkJCNUxHHSPRz"> If you want to receive more talents, you must have a heart to care for the saints. For example, when someone is unemployed, you need to pray for him and bear his burden. <span class="pg" data-page-id="762" id="762">[762]</span> This will be a proof that the Lord has given that one to you as a talent. However, not to bear the saints or care for them means that you forsake the Lord’s possession. Every dear saint is a precious part of the Lord’s possession. It is not a small matter to be concerned for the saints, for they are the Lord’s possession.</p>
<p data-content-id="KJEWVtLfOnw9Yxg9_3P5EKft8ofAanTep0fB8fNd2CrXG7zPGzDylZTVqAClKS52d"> When the Lord’s possessions are in His hand, they remain His possessions. But when they are delivered to us, they become our talent. Do not drop any burden that the Lord has given you. No matter how busy I am, I cannot drop any talent, for to do this is to drop the Lord’s possession. The Lord has a vast work in His recovery. For this work, He needs thousands of young brothers and sisters to be raised up to bear the responsibility.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19P-o3CGgOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> The talent is not something of your natural birth; rather, it is altogether related to your burden. If you take up a burden, you will receive a talent. If you take up a burden for one local church, you will receive one talent. But if you take up the burden for five churches, you will have five talents. During the past twenty-eight years, more than two hundred eighty churches have been built up under this ministry. Recently, when I was accused, criticized, and condemned, I asked the Lord whether or not this ministry was wrong. At that time He pointed out to me that the way to know the tree is by its fruit. He told me to look how many churches have been established and built up by this ministry. However, if we are ambitious for ourselves, this ambition will kill the talents.</p>

To Each according to His Ability</h2><p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCi5ituSw2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> Although the talents are not our ability, but the Lord’s possession, they are delivered to us according to our ability. Our ability is constituted by God’s creation and our learning. The capacity of our ability is based upon the willingness of our heart. If we do not have any willingness in our heart, then we shall not have the capacity to receive the talent. The capacity to receive the talent is measured by the willingness of our heart. <span class="pg" data-page-id="763" id="763">[763]</span> </p>

Those with Five Talents<br/>and Two Talents Trading with Them</h2><p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoLygK5_Vsw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64380" data-verses="Matthew 25:16-17">Verses 16 and 17</span> say, “Immediately, he who received the five talents went and traded with them and gained another five; similarly, he who received the two gained another two.” To trade with the talents signifies using the gift the Lord has given us, and to gain other talents signifies that the gift we received from the Lord has been used to the fullest extent, without any loss or waste.</p>
<p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCPudpmFb4qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64381" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapter twenty-four</span>, the slave is to supply food to those in the household. This refers to the ministering of the nourishing Word with the riches of Christ as the life supply to those in the Lord’s house. Here, however, it speaks of trading with the talents to cause the talents to multiply. Therefore, the result of our service has two aspects. The first aspect is that others are fed and given rich nourishment. The second aspect is that the Lord’s possessions are multiplied. For example, the more we preach the gospel, the richer the gospel becomes. It is the same with the truths. As we minister the truths to others, the truths multiply. This is also true of the saints and the churches. Both the believers and the churches will multiply. Thus, five talents are multiplied into ten, and two talents are multiplied into four.</p>

The Slave with One Talent<br/>Digging in the Earth and Hiding It</h2><p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePC2dgUSwGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64382" data-verses="Matthew 25:18">Verse 18</span> says, “But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth and hid his lord’s silver.” The main emphasis in this parable is on the one-talented one, the one who received the smallest gift. It is very easy for the least-gifted ones to fail to make the proper use of their gift.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvU2Ngr5vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> As the earth signifies the world, so to dig in the earth signifies getting into the world. Any association, any involvement with the world, even a little worldly talk, will bury the Lord’s gift to us. Hiding the Lord’s silver signifies rendering the Lord’s gift useless, letting it lie waste under the cloak of certain earthly excuses. Any excuse for not using the Lord’s gift is to hide it. This is always the danger <span class="pg" data-page-id="764" id="764">[764]</span> with the one-talented ones, those who consider their gift as the smallest.</p>
<p data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LRFLnB-_aKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP"> With the one-talented slave in this parable, there is no multiplication. For instance, in a certain area there may be one church. Ten years later, there is still just one church in that area. Some may think that the one-talented slave did well in not losing his talent and in returning to the Lord what was His. The one-talented slave seemed to say, “Lord, here is what is Yours. You gave me one talent, and I have been faithful to keep, guard, protect, and preserve it. By Your mercy and grace, I have kept it.” But the issue of our service must be the multiplication of our talents. It is not the Lord’s will for us simply to maintain what He has given us. If you are faithful merely to keep the gospel, the truth, and the church without any multiplication, the Lord will say that you are slothful. Furthermore, He will call you an evil slave. In the eyes of the Lord, it is evil to bury the talent and not to multiply it. The Lord does not care for our argument or excuses. He cares only that the one talent is multiplied into two. This is a serious matter. Our service must issue in the feeding and satisfaction of others and in the multiplication of the talent.</p>

Gaining another five talents is the result of the full use of the gift of the five talents.</p>
<p data-content-id="iVwfOYf8SL58g9JOPTRMkt4rsoqCB8Za_uz37kPNaHpUVGEwC8c3WckLHRdBKwfw9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64393" data-verses="Matthew 25:21">Verse 21</span> says, “His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.” The “few things” signify the Lord’s work in this age, <span class="pg" data-page-id="766" id="766">[766]</span> “over” signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and the “many things” signify the responsibilities in the coming kingdom. The joy of the Lord signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom. This is the inward satisfaction, not the outward position. To participate in the Lord’s joy is the greatest reward, better than the glory and position in the kingdom. Here we see two aspects of the reward given to the faithful slave: authority and enjoyment. The faithful will enter directly into the Lord’s presence in the manifestation of the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz4EocILxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> The same reward is given to the two-talented one as to the five-talented one. When the two-talented one came and said that he had gained another two talents, the Lord said the same thing to him that He had said to the five-talented one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64394" data-verses="Matthew 25:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>). Although the gift given to the twotalented one is smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord’s appraisal and reward to both are the same. This indicates that the Lord’s appraisal and reward are not related to the size and quantity of our work, but to our faithfulness in using His gift to the fullest extent. The same appraisal and reward would also have been given to the one-talented one if he had been as faithful.</p>

This proves that he is not only saved, but also raptured to the air. No unsaved person could be raptured and come to the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p data-content-id="TlNykpVx8vPkJrK0FoFCeboPZBmmu6VVWyqVfoiNX0091mu8B_6WxLE-BPJgV4jM5"> The one-talented one said that the Lord was a hard man, reaping where he did not sow and gathering where he did not scatter. Apparently the Lord is hard in His strictness, demanding that we use His gift to the fullest extent for His absolute work. It seems that the Lord’s work always <span class="pg" data-page-id="767" id="767">[767]</span> begins from zero. He seemingly demands us to work for Him with nothing. This should not be an excuse for the one-talented one to neglect the use of his gift. Rather, this should force him to exercise his faith to use his gift to the uttermost.</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_6YrHRtmhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64396" data-verses="Matthew 25:25">Verse 25</span> says, “And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours.” To be afraid is negative. We should rather be positive and aggressive in using the Lord’s gift. If we are faithful, we shall not be afraid of anything.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57cjmE3auTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> The one-talented slave went away and hid the talent in the earth. In doing this he was too passive. We should be active for the Lord’s work. Because he had buried his talent, he could only give it back to the Lord. Merely to keep the Lord’s gift and not lose it is not sufficient; we must gain a profit by using it. The one-talented one seemed to be saying, “Behold, Lord, here is what is Yours. I didn’t lose anything. I have been faithful to keep what You gave me.”</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faHLyui5KZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64397" data-verses="Matthew 25:26">Verse 26</span> says, “But his lord answered and said to him, Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter.” Here the Lord admits that He is strict in what He demands of His slaves for His work. In a sense, the Lord is such a hard man. He always reaps where He has not sown and gathers where He has not scattered. Consider the fact that the Lord’s recovery began from scratch, from nothing.</p>
<p data-content-id="sAHaGMzLy0llOmDbIQU5gqHa4-Zo1FV80FH_gvJTl-3CGWi7V21Rqsswa4m-v_ykK"> In a sense the slave’s word about the Lord’s gathering where He has not scattered and reaping where He has not sown is true. But in another sense it is not true. We should not say that the Lord has not scattered, for He has given each of us at least one talent. His giving the talent to us is the sowing and the scattering. Now the Lord sends us to gather where He has not scattered and to reap where He has not sown. None of us can say that the Lord has given us nothing. At least we have one talent. This talent is the seed for sowing and the possessions for scattering. Therefore, we need to reap where the Lord has not sown and gather where <span class="pg" data-page-id="768" id="768">[768]</span> He has not scattered. What the Lord has given you contains the producing element. Wherever you go with your talent, it will be productive. This productiveness, however, depends upon your practice, your exercise of the talent. If you use the talent, it will produce. But if you hide it, it will not produce anything.</p>
<p data-content-id="wnYGVQCuP5kaHdNSvqsn5eAbQzZz3p9H96rOf6zoBJqUxauivTkUjC0L4b-NFC4dx"> To hide the talent in the earth is to get involved with something earthly, with something other than the Spirit. Gossiping is an example of such an involvement. Some claim to have no time to visit the saints, but they have a great deal of time to gossip. If you look to the Lord for His mercy and grace to stop your gossiping, much time will be saved, and you will be able to use this time to care for the saints.</p>
<p data-content-id="L99pqVA7Dj0ri_MS8r2wO5Mev_vlzlTvi6eQ7dh-WalEdlMqlFm4p9KZx1GHzeKnD"> In the Lord’s recovery we do not have pastors to do the work of caring for the saints. This type of pastoring comes from fallen Christianity. In the Lord’s recovery every brother and sister must bear the burden to take care of others, especially the young ones and the new ones. After the meeting, many are accustomed to visit only with certain ones. Instead of doing this, they should take this opportunity to contact the new ones, the young ones, and even some backsliding ones for whom they have been praying. If we all did this, all the young ones and weak ones would be taken care of. Although you may be very busy, you can still take care of someone if you have the heart to do so and are willing to exercise your talent. By spending even ten minutes with someone, we can render him a great deal of edification. After someone has been built up in this way, he will feel warmed and know that he has been cared for. Then he will desire to receive more help. If we all practice this, no one will be neglected. There will be no need for the elders to do everything, for everyone will be functioning to take care of others.</p>
<p data-content-id="m9_ZbqRtdyk3jB1MZFrLaiReVCDfnnOkbzXR8kS9R2X9kERSX6e3OmxX_uG3PMvnV"> Many, however, consider that functioning is just a matter of speaking in the meetings. But the proper function of the members is to minister the life supply to others by taking care of them. The main aspect of the service is <span class="pg" data-page-id="769" id="769">[769]</span> not simply to clean the meeting hall or take care of the gardening. We are here for God’s possessions.</p>

<p data-content-id="ZeGCm8H7eKCTJAqPEA0iy58kjHM-hXa5aXVx_iCa2NejzfO2a6j3LzbGlF2IoX_ux"> Not everyone has the ability to speak in the meeting. I would like to say a word of comfort to those who were not born with the ability to speak well. There is no need for you to speak in the meetings. In order to make a show that everyone functions in the meetings, the elders sometimes try to make people function. The elders may say, “If you do not function, you are not in the flow. You are not up-to-date.” This kind of word frustrates those who cannot speak well from coming to the meetings. They will be afraid to come to the meetings because the elders might force them to function. An attitude has been created that it is a shame not to speak in the meetings, but that it is glorious to do so. Yes, a number of years ago I did say that we can all prophesy one by one. At that time, I was genuinely burdened to encourage everyone to speak. But since that time a misleading attitude has been created regarding functioning in the meetings. Although I do not wish to stop anyone from speaking, I want to point out that functioning in the church life is not merely a matter of speaking.</p>
<p data-content-id="AYt3GGxGF7i9WYjjGX_GoT1Ff8AsCV5mC3e1OX1vlGd9Zzb1Ha-XvTx6Drr3S4nlu"> We all need to learn to use our talent to multiply the Lord’s possessions. The Lord has given each of us part of His possessions as a talent, and our burden, duty, and responsibility are to see that this talent is multiplied. Do not make excuses for yourselves, and do not say that you have no time to take care of others. No matter how busy you are, it is still possible to use your function by taking care of others, even if you are able to come to only one meeting a week. Do not think that you are so weak. Perhaps you are weak; however, others are even weaker, and they need you. Even if you feel that you are the weakest one, there are some who are almost dead, and they need your help. The best way to use your talent is to take care of others, to become interested in others and concerned for them. This does not mean that you should become interested in the affairs of others. The Lord has employed you not for this purpose, but to take care of others. <span class="pg" data-page-id="770" id="770">[770]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrtrqH_q55GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> If you have received one talent, you need to use it. Before you come to a meeting, you need to pray, “Lord, I believe that I have a talent. I don’t want to bury my talent by getting involved with earthly things. Rather, I would like to use it to take care of others.” Show some love to those whose heart has grown cold. Go to see them or invite them to your home. As you spend time with the Lord and open to Him regarding whom you should take care of, He will burden you. As you contact others and have fellowship with them, you will spontaneously use your talent. Do not say, “Lord, You are a hard man, reaping where You have not sown and gathering where You have not scattered.” On the contrary, the Lord has sown and scattered a great deal. But there is much for you to reap and to gather. Oh, the harvest is vast, but the workers are few! There is no need for you to sow—simply go to reap. After every meeting there is time for you to reap and to gather. By doing this, we shall exercise our talent. In this way, the one talent will become two, the two talents will become four, and the five talents will become ten. The talents, God’s possessions which have been committed to us, will be multiplied. If we are all faithful to practice this, the Lord’s recovery will truly multiply.</p>

Interest signifies the profitable result we gain for the Lord’s work by using His gift.</p>
<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMmv-JEjTAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> In a sense, we may say that the bankers are all the new ones, weak ones, young ones, and backsliding ones. We need to deposit the Lord’s possession with these bankers. The bankers are not the leading brothers, but the weaker ones, those who have problems. Suppose a certain brother is dissenting and speaks negatively about the church. Those who speak negatively concerning the church will always have something negative to say about the elders. <span class="pg" data-page-id="771" id="771">[771]</span> Such a one must speak like this in order to vindicate himself. If the church is wrong, then he is right; but if the church is right, then he is wrong. If the elders in particular are wrong, then he is truly vindicated. Nevertheless, these dissenting ones are brothers, and they love the Lord. How good it would be for such a dissenting brother to be contacted, not by one of the elders, but by another brother in the church who loves him and cares for him! If a dissenting brother is contacted by a number of others, he will eventually come back to the church and praise the Lord for the church.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqBjRFI4f5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> If you use your talent in this way to take care of others, you will not only multiply the talent, but you yourself will be in the third heaven and will quickly grow and be transformed. You will be renewed in the spirit of the mind, and among us there will be a marvelous testimony of the Body to the whole universe. The universe will see that we are not a religious gathering, but a living Body. For this, we all need to use our talent, the Lord’s possession. The result will be multiplication. I can testify that the more we take care of the saints and the churches, the richer we become.</p>

The slothful, one-talented slave, however, is punished by being cast into outer darkness. To many Christian teachers, being cast into outer darkness denotes eternal perdition of a false believer. But the context proves that this is not an accurate understanding. This is not the punishment of false believers, but of genuine believers who are not faithful. It does not refer to eternal perdition, but to punishment during the coming kingdom age.</p>

Rather, they will be put into outer <span class="pg" data-page-id="773" id="773">[773]</span> darkness. I do not believe that there is darkness in the furnace of fire. Although there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth both for the ones who perish and for the defeated believers, the defeated believers will not be cast into the lake of fire, but into the outer darkness outside the glorious sphere of the Lord’s presence.</p>

However, the defeated believers, such as the sons of the kingdom in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64423" data-verses="Matthew 8:1">chapter eight</span>, those without the wedding garment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64424" data-verses="Matthew 22:1">chapter twenty-two</span>, and the unfaithful slave in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64425" data-verses="Matthew 24:1">chapters twenty-four</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64426" data-verses="Matthew 25:1">twenty-five</span>, will be cast out into the outer darkness. There, in the outer darkness, they will suffer weeping and gnashing of teeth. This does not refer to eternal perdition, but to dispensational punishment. In addition to salvation, there is still the matter of the reward and punishment that will be rendered during the coming kingdom age. If we are faithful to the Lord, we shall be rewarded during the next age. But if we are not faithful to Him, we shall receive punishment. This is very clear in God’s holy Word.</p>

For life we need the <span class="pg" data-page-id="774" id="774">[774]</span> infilling of the Holy Spirit, and for service we need the gifts of the Holy Spirit. In our life we need to be watchful, and in our service we need to be faithful. Our watchfulness in life is related to the early rapture, and our faithfulness in service is related to the reward. If we are watchful and faithful, then we shall be raptured early and we shall be rewarded when the Lord comes back. To be raptured early is to participate in the enjoyment of the wedding feast, and to be rewarded is to participate in the authority in the coming kingdom age.</p>

CONCERNING THE NATIONS</h2><p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5GhAGsaYU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> In the first two sections of the Lord’s prophecy of the kingdom, the Lord covered the Jews and the church. At the end of this age, the people on earth will be in three categories: the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles. The word “but” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64428" data-verses="Matthew 25:31">verse 31</span> indicates that what is spoken from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64429" data-verses="Matthew 25:31">verse 31</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64430" data-verses="Matthew 25:46">verse 46</span> is another section, the section concerning the Gentiles. When the Lord’s prophecy turned from the Jews to the church in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64431" data-verses="Matthew 24:32">24:32</span>, the word “but” was used to indicate this change. The same is true in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64432" data-verses="Matthew 25:31">25:31</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="WpIjOSTniNVnodys85ww1RWYuk42_5iFLnHfO0_sXqG1rMR71jP_O8sGzKaqzHchw"> If the Lord’s prophecy had covered only the Jews and the church, it would not be complete, for there would be nothing about the nations. In order to make His prophecy all-inclusive, the Lord had to say a word about what would happen to the nations at the close of this age. Many Christian teachers have mixed up the Lord’s word in the three sections of the prophecy of the kingdom, with some applying the verses concerning the Jews to the church. Both the word to the Jews and the word to the Gentiles have been applied to the believers. Many have taught that the judgment of the nations is the final judgment that the Lord will execute upon us all. In the past I heard certain Christian teachers warn us not to be goats. We were told to love the poor and suffering ones so that when the Lord Jesus came <span class="pg" data-page-id="776" id="776">[776]</span> back we might be regarded as the sheep. Otherwise, He will consider us the goats. Thank the Lord that in His prophecy He used the little word “but” in two crucial places, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64433" data-verses="Matthew 24:32">24:32</span> and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64434" data-verses="Matthew 25:31">25:31</span>. This word indicates that the prophecy turns from the Jews to the believers in the first case and then from the believers to the Gentiles.</p>

God’s economy is to recover the earth and to establish His kingdom in a full way on the earth. God is more interested in the earth than in the heavens. According to the Bible, God’s intention is to leave the heavens. He desires to come down from the heavens and set up His kingdom on the earth.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk5C-ZeKa1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> In the kingdom of God as the sphere of God’s administration, there is the need for three kinds of people: the priests, the kings, and the people or the citizens. The prophecy concerning the kingdom given by the Lord on the Mount of Olives concerns God’s economy to bring in His kingdom. This final word tells us the result of God’s activity on earth to establish His kingdom. The result is that God will obtain three peoples, the priests, the kings, and the citizens, with whom He will have a complete kingdom. The nation of Israel is like a woman in travail to deliver the remnant of Jews who will be the priests during the millennium. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64477" data-verses="Zechariah 8:1">Zechariah 8</span> reveals that the Jews will be the priests during the coming kingdom.

<p data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoLyAK4_1sw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R"> Very few Christians have seen that God judges people according to three things. Even the fundamental Christians believe that God judges people only according to two things—the law and the gospel. According to the law, every descendant of Adam is condemned to perish. But according to the gospel, every believer in Christ is saved. Thus, perdition is according to the law, and salvation is according to the gospel. However, there is yet a third thing according to which God will judge people. This is the eternal gospel.</p>

The Lord will then judge the nations, not according to the law of Moses nor according to the gospel of Christ, but according to the eternal gospel. This is a matter of God’s dispensation. Those who listen to that gospel and treat the suffering believers well will be blessed and reckoned as righteous (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64480" data-verses="Matthew 25:46">v. 46</span>) to inherit the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64481" data-verses="Matthew 25:34">v. 34</span>), but those who do not will be cursed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64482" data-verses="Matthew 25:41">v. 41</span>) and perish for eternity. The gospel of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64483" data-verses="Acts 20:24">Acts 20:24</span>) brings eternal life into the believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64484" data-verses="John 3:15-16">John 3:15-16</span>) that they may live by God’s life, whereas the eternal gospel brings the sheep into eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64485" data-verses="Matthew 25:46">v. 46</span>) that they may live in the sphere of God’s life.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rSHlsQhwrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> The eternal gospel will tell people to fear God and to worship Him. It will say nothing about repentance or believing. The gospel we have heard is absolutely different from the eternal gospel, for we were told to repent to God and to believe in the Lord Jesus. The gospel of grace says nothing about fear or worship; rather, it emphasizes repentance and believing. Furthermore, the center of the gospel of grace is Christ.</p>

Those who treat the least of His brothers in a good way will be “sheep” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64488" data-verses="Matthew 25:34-40">vv. 34-40</span>), but those who do not treat them well will be “goats” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64489" data-verses="Matthew 25:41-46">vv. 41-46</span>).</p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64495" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span>, during the great tribulation Antichrist will force God’s people to worship him. At that time an angel will preach the eternal gospel warning the people to fear God and not to mistreat His people. The Christians that will be mistreated by Antichrist will be considered by the Lord His little brothers. The bigger brothers will have been raptured, and the little ones will be left to pass through the tribulation. Antichrist will mistreat them, persecute them, and imprison them. Thus, they will be short of food and clothing, and many will be ill. But a voice from heaven will say something like this: “Fear God and worship Him, and don’t do anything to harm God’s people. Those who fear Antichrist instead of God will perish.”</p>

Then, after Christ has judged the <span class="pg" data-page-id="781" id="781">[781]</span> believers at the judgment seat in the air, He will come with the overcomers to destroy the armies of Antichrist, save the remnant of the Jews, and set up His throne of glory in Jerusalem. Then all the living Gentiles will be gathered before Him to be judged. By the judgment seat in the air, He will clear up the situation among the believers. By descending to the Mount of Olives He will clear up the situation among the Jews. Finally, at His throne of glory He will clear up the situation among the nations. He will judge them not according to the law or according to the gospel of grace, but according to the eternal gospel, according to how they have treated His little brothers during the great tribulation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64496" data-verses="Acts 10:42">Acts 10:42</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64497" data-verses="2Timothy 4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span> both say that Christ will be the Judge of the living and the dead. Christ will judge the dead at the white throne after the millennium. But He will judge the living at the throne of His glory before the millennium. The judgment according to the law for eternal perdition depends upon how one deals with God, the judgment according to the gospel for eternal salvation depends upon how the believer deals with Christ, and the judgment according to the eternal gospel for the “sheep” to inherit the millennial kingdom depends upon how they deal with the Lord’s little brothers.</p>

The portion of the sheep will be simply to enjoy what God has created from the foundation of the world. In the millennial kingdom there will be a heavenly part and an earthly part. The heavenly part will be the manifestation of the kingdom, the kingdom of the Father. The Jews will be in the center of the earthly part as the priests, and around the Jews there will be the sheep, the saved nations, as the people. We, the overcoming believers, will share in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ and in all the heavenly blessings. Our enjoyment will be heavenly, spiritual, and divine. But the enjoyment of the “sheep,” the restored nations, will not be heavenly or spiritual. Rather, it will be the blessing God gave men when He created the earth, the blessing lost by Adam’s fall. I am glad that we are in the best category, the category of the kings. The Jews will be in the earthly part, but we shall be in the heavenly part. Our portion will be to exercise authority over the nations. How I thank the Lord for giving us this clear view of the millennium!</p>

But the section concerning the believers, the church, is very much concerned with life. As we have pointed out, we need to be faithful, watchful, and ready, and we need to be wise and prudent. All these are indications that we must be full of life. Life is with us. Hallelujah, we are the life people!</p>

Many of us were taught that the Gospel of Matthew was simply a storybook. However, Matthew is not a storybook, but a book on the doctrine of the kingdom of the heavens. In order to touch the depths of this book, we need to apply this point to every chapter. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64504" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapters twenty-six through twenty-eight</span> we cannot find the term the kingdom of the heavens.

Immediately after giving this prophecy of the kingdom, the Lord told His disciples that in two days the Passover was coming and that the Son of Man was being delivered up to be crucified. The significance of the Lord’s word here is that His crucifixion is the fulfillment of the Passover. This Passover was to be the last. The Passover had been observed for more than fifteen centuries. But now <span class="pg" data-page-id="784" id="784">[784]</span> the Passover was to be terminated and, in a sense, replaced. By putting together the Passover and the crucifixion of the Son of Man, the Lord was implying that His crucifixion was the fulfillment of the Passover and that He Himself was the Passover Lamb.</p>
<p data-content-id="z1mQT_MChRHrKOVhpv7OSgnPO920rjVWD60Cn-PXaa1-mN8P3mECGVY0c4oULoOZ9"> The Passover was a type of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64510" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:7">1 Cor. 5:7</span>). Christ is the Lamb of God that God may pass over us, the sinners, as portrayed in typology by the Passover in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64511" data-verses="Exodus 12:1">Exodus 12</span>. Hence, Christ as the Passover Lamb had to be killed on the day of the Passover for its fulfillment.</p>
<p data-content-id="aI3n7dKqPsaqnSWAgjPKlz9whD5y7ZRskow3-r5_VZTHnwgg18jp50Msqll1eT961"> According to the type, the Passover Lamb had to be examined for its perfection during the four days preceding the day of the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64512" data-verses="Exodus 12:3-6">Exo. 12:3-6</span>). Before His crucifixion, Christ came to Jerusalem the last time, six days before the Passover (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64513" data-verses="John 12:1">John 12:1</span>), and was examined by the Jewish leaders for a few days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64514" data-verses="Matthew 21:23">Matt. 21:23—22:46</span>). There was no blemish found in Him, and He was proved to be perfect and qualified to be the Passover Lamb for us.</p>

This indicates that Christ’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="785" id="785">[785]</span> crucifixion was sovereignly under God’s hand to fulfill the Passover. By hating the Lord Jesus, the first class of people, the religionists, were exposed.</p>

Two of those who loved Him were Simon the leper and Mary, the woman who poured the oil upon His head. A leper signifies a sinner (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64519" data-verses="Matthew 8:2">8:2</span>). Simon, as a leper, must have been healed by the Lord. Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64520" data-verses="Matthew 8:7">v. 7</span>) in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence. A saved sinner would always do this. Simon must have known that the Lord was about to be killed. He probably realized that this was the last opportunity for him to express his love to the Lord. Therefore, he grasped the opportunity for a further intimate, loving contact with the Lord. He opened his home, spread a feast, and invited the Lord and all those who loved Him.</p>

But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste?” The disciples considered Mary’s love offering to the Lord a waste. Throughout the past twenty centuries, thousands of precious lives, heart treasures, high positions, and golden futures have been wasted upon the Lord Jesus. To such lovers He is altogether lovely and worthy of their offering. What they have poured upon Him is not a waste, but a fragrant testimony of His sweetness.</p>
<p data-content-id="Fg6tTgoHtC_G-QnQc6XrtoKH8qZ5GoJ0eS2_FiBYO4bwBcqEj_Dx7P4mjjC-Fiz_D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64522" data-verses="Matthew 26:11">verse 11</span> the Lord said to the indignant disciples, “For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me.” This indicates that we must love the Lord and grasp the opportunity to express our love to Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="Cbxvd4JbafRGawQxe_oviaTxwiARSNkiKHoKaKYSDIR2bIn8X2awiad7aJHVDtMuP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64523" data-verses="Matthew 26:12">Verse 12</span> says, “For in pouring out this ointment on My body, she has done it for My burial.” Mary received the revelation of the Lord’s death by the Lord’s words in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64524" data-verses="Matthew 16:21">16:21</span>; <span class="pg" data-page-id="786" id="786">[786]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64525" data-verses="Matthew 17:22-23">17:22-23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64526" data-verses="Matthew 20:18-19">20:18-19</span>; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64527" data-verses="Matthew 26:2">26:2</span>.

<p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMmseJHgzAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> Along with Simon, Mary also probably thought that this was her last chance to do something over the Lord’s body to anoint Him for burial. In a very real sense, Mary buried the Lord Jesus before He was crucified. What a contrast there is between the religionists who hated the Lord and wanted to kill Him and His lovers who took the opportunity to express their love for Him! I believe that the others like Peter, James, and John did not receive the Lord’s prophecy concerning His crucifixion properly. According to the Lord’s testimony, Mary certainly received His word regarding this, for the Lord testified that in pouring out the ointment, she had done it for His burial. This was a sign that Mary understood what the Lord had prophesied concerning His crucifixion.</p>

Hence, in this verse He called the gospel “this gospel,” referring to the gospel of His death, burial, and resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64529" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:1-4">1 Cor. 15:1-4</span>). The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of Mary is that she loved the Lord. We must preach both, the Lord loving us and us loving the Lord. One is for our salvation, and the other is for our consecration. The gospel tells us how the Lord loved us, but the loving story of Mary stirs us up to love the Lord. Thus, there needs to be a mutual love. This must accompany the preaching of the gospel.</p>

The word “Then” at the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64531" data-verses="Matthew 26:14">verse 14</span> indicates that while one of the Lord’s followers expressed her love to the Lord to the uttermost, <span class="pg" data-page-id="787" id="787">[787]</span> another was about to betray Him. One was treasuring the Lord, and at the same time another was delivering Him up. Not even a false believer should have been this evil. The Lord Jesus had never wronged Judas. Judas, however, was filled and possessed with Satan, the Devil. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64532" data-verses="John 6:70">John 6:70</span> and 71 the Lord Jesus referred to Judas as a devil.

After this, Judas left. He could not bear to stay there any longer. After Judas had gone, the Lord established the table. Thus, Judas participated in the Passover feast, but he did not partake of the Lord’s table. After the betrayer, the false believer, was exposed, the Lord established the table with the eleven real believers.</p>

By participating in this life we become the mystical Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64556" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:27">1 Cor. 12:27</span>), which is also signified by the bread of the table (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64557" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:17">1 Cor. 10:17</span>). Hence, by partaking of this bread, we have the fellowship of the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64558" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">1 Cor. 10:16</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="789" id="789">[789]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="bE6RhcwiL519I2F4h6UAXgkcU3szKhX5oV75TlDaapbLSN4u9vKttlTSdmbgsaeeZ"> At the Passover the people ate the meat of the Passover lamb. But after the Passover feast, the Lord Jesus did not take the flesh of the lamb, but He took bread and gave it to His disciples to eat. As we have pointed out, this bread signifies the Lord’s body to nourish us. However, we all have some kind of religious background that keeps us from comprehending this. Due to our religious background, we have some doctrinal impression regarding the Lord’s table. When Christians attend holy communion today, they do not have the realization that they are taking the Lord Jesus into them as their nourishment. Did you have this realization when you were in religion? I did not. Rather, we were told to examine ourselves; we were not told that we were taking the Lord’s body as our nourishment. But if someone came to the Lord’s table without any doctrinal concept, he would spontaneously realize that to eat the Lord’s body is to receive the Lord into us as nourishment.</p>
<p data-content-id="qLbeKL5gvaIHLKjOuaXPPcBzkPoGiU6cr3cEiW9thGivaddlRjlMa0sobl8kJcqGU"> Many pastors and preachers today charge people to remember Christ’s death as they participate in holy communion. Many endeavor to review the Lord’s suffering and death on the cross. However, the Lord did not tell us to remember His death, but to remember Him, for He said, “Do this unto the remembrance of Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64559" data-verses="Luke 22:19">Luke 22:19</span>). He told us to remember Him by eating the bread and drinking the cup. This is not just a remembrance, but also an enjoyment of the Lord. To partake of the Lord’s table in this way is to eat and drink of Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="yJ7FkQQ9-HQeOCV3G8jYIWVHqER6m96VkwXy1aPpanOt-nixEftJx1SAQDdbIJSKo"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64560" data-verses="Luke 22:19">Luke 22:19</span> says, “And having taken a loaf, when He had given thanks, He broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this unto the remembrance of Me.” According to this verse, we are to eat in remembrance of the Lord. Thus, the genuine remembrance is not to review the story of the Lord’s life, but to eat Him, to take Him in.</p>
<p data-content-id="8vB4ZFrHsWMCJkPfSyuuIfelkqjkJmO1aTPNfuHXjq1WSmeIa3CZmi4MN15Dhmtta"> For the symbol of His body, the Lord did not use a grain of wheat, but a loaf. A loaf signifies that many grains have passed through a long process to become bread. Firstly, the seed is sown into the field. Then it grows and produces many grains. After the wheat is harvested, the grains are <span class="pg" data-page-id="790" id="790">[790]</span> ground into fine flour that is blended into a lump and baked in an oven to make a loaf of bread. Only then do we have a loaf of bread to eat. As a grain of wheat (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64561" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>), the Lord Jesus passed through such a process until He eventually became the bread on the table for us to eat. Every time we come to the Lord’s table we should have this realization. We should be able to say, “Lord, today You are our bread because You have been processed for us. Now You are the bread on the table for us to eat.”</p>
<p data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsTf6r2cthgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg"> The bread on the table firstly signifies the Lord’s physical body that was crucified on the cross. But after His resurrection, this body became mysterious, for it was enlarged into His mystical Body. According to John <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64562" data-verses="John 2:1">chapter two</span>, the Jews killed His physical body, but it was resurrected in a mysterious way to become His mystical Body. The Lord’s mystical Body comprises all of us. Therefore, when we see the bread at the Lord’s table, we need to realize that it is a symbol both of the Lord’s physical body and His mystical Body. For this reason, when we break the bread and eat it, we have the fellowship of the Lord’s Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64563" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">1 Cor. 10:16</span>). All the members of Christ’s mystical Body are represented in the loaf. Therefore, at His table, we enjoy not only the Lord Jesus, but also the believers. In other words, we enjoy Christ and the church. Both Christ and the church are our enjoyment.</p>

It is to have the Body of Christ. Therefore, the bread as the symbol of the Body of Christ comes first. Nevertheless, we need to be reminded that as sinners we have the problem of sin and that the Lord Jesus shed His blood to cleanse us. His blood has made a complete redemption for us so that all our sins might be forgiven. <span class="pg" data-page-id="791" id="791">[791]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I8Vo6y6Zx2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> The Lord’s blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and back to God’s full blessing. Concerning the Lord’s table (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64565" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:21">1 Cor. 10:21</span>), the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God’s blessing. Hence, it is called the cup of blessing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64566" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">1 Cor. 10:16</span>). In this cup are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64567" data-verses="Psalms 16:5">Psa. 16:5</span>). In Adam our portion was the cup of God’s wrath (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64568" data-verses="Revelation 14:10">Rev. 14:10</span>). Christ has drunk that cup for us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64569" data-verses="John 18:11">John 18:11</span>), and His blood has constituted the cup of salvation for us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64570" data-verses="Psalms 116:13">Psa. 116:13</span>), the cup that runs over (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64571" data-verses="Psalms 23:5">Psa. 23:5</span>). By partaking of this cup we also have the fellowship of the blood of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64572" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">1 Cor. 10:16</span>).</p>

His blood was required by God’s righteousness for the forgiveness of our sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64575" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Heb. 9:22</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZThed39Cy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> Some manuscripts insert the word “new” before the word “covenant” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64576" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">verse 28</span>. The Lord’s blood, having satisfied God’s righteousness, enacted the new covenant. In this new covenant, God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings. When this new covenant is given to us, it is a cup (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64577" data-verses="Luke 22:20">Luke 22:20</span>), a portion for us. The Lord shed the blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion.

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="0NXPsAI1yayT7Esh64dsTfqr2P9hgEqcOazhhzeib5YqMbauJE8fczAczzgVMVNxg">PRESSED IN GETHSEMANE,<br/>ARRESTED BY THE JEWS,<br/>JUDGED BY THE SANHEDRIN,<br/>AND DENIED BY PETER</h1><p data-content-id="7B4Am8v9Adccmo1gIZMFa6ZKXVwD3NwcGPzgNJpCcSn30xnNlTArxscA_dYsVsJ34"> In this message we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64580" data-verses="Matthew 26:31-75">26:31-75</span>, a long section in the Gospel of Matthew that is also related to the kingdom. The verses in this chapter regarding the Lord’s table indicate that the Lord’s death and resurrection have a great deal to do with the kingdom of the heavens. In these verses, however, we cannot find the resurrection, although we do have a clear reference to the Lord’s death in the breaking of the bread, which signifies the breaking of the Lord’s body. The Lord’s word about the pouring out of His blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64581" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">v. 28</span>) is also an obvious reference to His death. Although there is no explicit mention of it, resurrection is implied by the fact that the bread signifies the Lord as our bread for our enjoyment. His death accomplished redemption for us, but He becomes our enjoyment through redemption in resurrection. When we come to the Lord’s table, we see on the table a symbol of the Lord’s death, but we remember Him, not in death, but in resurrection. In this remembrance we display His death. Both the Lord’s crucifixion and resurrection are for the kingdom. Apart from Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection, it is impossible for the kingdom to be established.</p>
<p data-content-id="_3YxGvttZOm0wHVNevgj0vK_3liNBzo4VlxZLbwKvcJIl4EKIyLxf1uiXON9vp2ja"> By our natural life it is not possible for us to be the kingdom people. This fact is made abundantly clear in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64582" data-verses="Matthew 26:31-75">26:31-75</span>. Here we have a picture of the arrest and judgment of Christ. This record reveals that no one can follow Christ on the pathway of the cross by the natural life. The King can take this pathway, but we in our natural life <span class="pg" data-page-id="794" id="794">[794]</span> cannot. Therefore, the Lord must die for us and enter into resurrection for us. Through His death our negative situation is settled, and by His resurrection He is able to be taken in by us and even become us.</p>
<p data-content-id="B6jatVJ-wPr8tvpe529I8V46wo5x2p--owyLHqkdIwqcQGRu8y-3D7Iw4khzbawxg"> Years ago, I could not understand why in the record of the Lord’s arrest and judgment Matthew includes a long story about Peter’s denial of the Lord. I used to think that a few verses would have been sufficient to describe how Peter denied the Lord three times. But Matthew presents this in detail. It is important for us to see the significance of Peter’s denial. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64583" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span> the Lord Jesus and Peter stand in absolute contrast to each other. In every respect Jesus was able to pass through the pathway of the cross. But in every respect Peter was defeated in taking this pathway. All the other disciples, of course, were the same as Peter. If we see this matter clearly, we shall pay careful attention to Peter’s denial as well as to Christ’s victory.</p>
<p data-content-id="xeZKNRpmL0ulkkX7gjr4PDaycS_8wZyOmLQTGYdKB41qhzplFrgpsFTqLxeEeD0jc"> What was Matthew’s main intention in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64584" data-verses="Matthew 26:31-75">26:31-75</span>—to unveil the victory of Christ or to expose the defeat of Peter? I believe that his intention was to present both—each in vivid contrast to the other. When we look at the Lord Jesus, we see complete success, but when we look at Peter, we see total defeat. For the establishment of the kingdom, Christ’s victory is necessary. He had to be victorious in every respect. At the same time, we must come to realize that we, as fallen human beings, are not able to be the kingdom people.</p>
<p data-content-id="ryuqMqfo5HXngUA_k7CZThOd7vCy7iqI8uIe_VL9ai2tiHoiKliRV2rZyRlM8aSfC"> Do not have any trust in yourself. Peter is our representative. As far as our natural life is concerned, we are all Peter. For the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there was the need of a man like Jesus. Throughout <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64585" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span>, the Lord Jesus stood in the position of a man, not in the position of the Son of God. In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, He stood as a man, a successful man, a victorious man, as a man that could withstand any hardship, defeat, opposition, and attack. <span class="pg" data-page-id="795" id="795">[795]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="d84S4rvmI4uQ5ke8H3rS9168XGOasIrVf7g0YJr94JlctsgEvAGPm2EVXWtuJe6BQ"> As we consider this picture of the Lord Jesus, we should receive the clear impression that in our human life it is impossible for us to be the kingdom people. The twelve disciples had been under the Lord’s teaching and training for three and a half years. During this period of time, they were with the Lord constantly. Peter, a fisherman, was called in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64586" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">chapter four</span>, and he began from that time onward to follow the Lord Jesus. The Lord took special care to train Peter in a particular way. Peter heard the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, and he heard all the mysteries concerning the kingdom. He was trained concerning Christ’s being the Son of God, concerning the building up of the church, and concerning the pathway of the cross. He was dealt with on the Mount of Transfiguration and corrected regarding the paying of the poll tax. Time and time again, Peter was adjusted. It is difficult to believe that such a qualified and trained person could take the lead in denying the Lord. If Peter could not succeed in following the Lord, then who can? If Peter had denied the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64587" data-verses="Matthew 4:1">chapter four</span>, I would not have been surprised. But it is hard for me to believe that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64588" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span>, after being with the Lord for three and a half years, Peter could deny Him.</p>
<p data-content-id="lALEQZ7Pc5kKCPfPGb19P9o3BHAOyHcUvvXxHzP9uo06emQopMdumI8ohcplcFH3G"> Not even Peter himself believed that he would do this. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64589" data-verses="Matthew 26:33">verse 33</span> Peter said boldly to the Lord, “If all shall be stumbled in You, I will never be stumbled,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64590" data-verses="Matthew 26:35">verse 35</span> he said, “Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You.” Peter was confident that he would follow the Lord to the uttermost. But, as this picture makes clear, all he could do was to deny the Lord to the uttermost. This proves that no human being can succeed in living the kingdom life. Perhaps after reading these messages, you have been stirred up for the kingdom and desire to be today’s kingdom people. But we must realize that none of us can make it. Therefore, we need to humble ourselves, bow down, and say, “Lord, I simply can’t make it. I am a Peter. If Peter could not make it, then who am I to think that I can make it?

WARNING THE DISCIPLES</h2><p data-content-id="4dnOmQ6dC-a7mL-mhWcCi6ittQQ2ICEgabU1CFr8nM4comYhnskx28bPjRH1igcN7"> In the light of the contrast between Christ’s victory and Peter’s failure, let us now consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64591" data-verses="Matthew 26:31-75">verses 31 through 75</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64592" data-verses="Matthew 26:31">Verse 31</span> says, “Then Jesus says to them, You will all be stumbled in Me this night, for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.” The Lord was the Shepherd, and the disciples were the sheep who were to be scattered. However, all the disciples said that they would not deny Him. All of them, especially Peter, had the assurance and the confidence that they would follow the Lord to the end, no matter what the pathway might be.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk5BeZdK61byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> In His warning the Lord promised that He would be raised up and go to meet with them in resurrection in Galilee (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64593" data-verses="Matthew 26:32">v. 32</span>). He also predicted that, on the night of His betrayal, Peter would deny Him three times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64594" data-verses="Matthew 26:34">v. 34</span>).</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3QbeLAasd74yKlGQFMOoLxgK7-Vsw0SOI7xkdT8fjYmph9Tdr1tw2bhhCiOOyJC-R">II. PRESSED IN GETHSEMANE</h2><p data-content-id="GhkDcEWmsUabp2Z59ofCPtdpkEb4qnMMa8BWB8Fc4Qo-Ik5K-kwp1bHT88odYavvQ"> After warning the disciples, the Lord went with them to Gethsemane (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64595" data-verses="Matthew 26:36">v. 36</span>). Gethsemane means the place of the oil press. The Lord was pressed there to flow out the oil, the Spirit. After taking Peter, James, and John, the Lord went to pray alone. When He returned from praying the first time, He found the disciples sleeping (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64596" data-verses="Matthew 26:40">v. 40</span>). The Lord Jesus had told them seriously that His soul was “exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,” and He had asked them to watch with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64597" data-verses="Matthew 26:38">v. 38</span>). But it seemed to them that nothing was going to happen and that everything was peaceful. Perhaps the disciples fell asleep because they had been tired out by the Lord’s presence. According to the other Gospels, Peter and John were the ones sent ahead to prepare the room for the Passover. Perhaps they were tired from all the events of the day. Peter might have said to himself, “I would like to stay away from Jesus for a little while. Since I cannot get away from Him, let me take a little sleep. The Lord may need to pray, but I need to sleep.” This was a full exposure of the fact that Peter was unable <span class="pg" data-page-id="797" id="797">[797]</span> to make it in following the Lord. It is also a portrait of our situation. We love the Lord, but like Peter we may get tired out from being in His presence. Although it is wonderful to have the Lord’s presence, sometimes we may get too weary to care for it.</p>

Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is ready, but the flesh is weak.” In spiritual things our spirit is often ready or willing, but our flesh is weak. Notice that the Lord Jesus spoke this word specifically to Peter, for Peter was the “nose,” the one who was the most prominent.</p>
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePC1dgWTwGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> When the Lord came back after praying the third time, the disciples were still sleeping. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64599" data-verses="Matthew 26:36-46">verses 36 through 46</span> we see a contrast between the life that is absolutely able for the kingdom and the life that is completely unable. We do not have the first life by our natural birth. The life we have by our natural birth is completely unable to be for the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvU1Ngp6vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> In the garden of Gethsemane, the Lord was pressed to be sorrowful and distressed, even unto death.

If it had been a stranger who had led the crowd to the Lord, it would not have been so painful to Him. But the one who led the crowd in arresting Him was one who had been so close to Him for three and a half years. Humanly speaking, this hurt the Lord Jesus. <span class="pg" data-page-id="798" id="798">[798]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIu4NE4J85SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> When the Lord was arrested, one of the disciples, Peter, reacted by drawing his sword, striking the slave of the high priest, and cutting off his ear (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64601" data-verses="Matthew 26:51">v. 51</span>). Instead of helping the Lord Jesus, this action merely caused trouble. In his Gospel, John gives Peter’s name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64602" data-verses="John 18:10">John 18:10</span>), and Luke mentions the fact that the Lord had to heal the ear (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64603" data-verses="Luke 22:51">Luke 22:51</span>). After telling Peter to put his sword into its place, the Lord said, “Do you think that I cannot beseech My Father and He will provide Me at once more than twelve legions of angels? How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64604" data-verses="Matthew 26:53-54">vv. 53-54</span>). The word “so” refers to His death on the cross, which was prophesied in the Scriptures and needed to be fulfilled.</p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzhn9tId8sSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> Once again we see here a contrast between two persons in the light of the kingdom. Peter resisted the Lord’s arrest, but the Lord was willing to accept it for the fulfillment of the Scriptures. Jesus’ life is more than able to be for the kingdom, but this is impossible for our life. Our life simply cannot withstand the events and environment related to the kingdom. We all must come to realize this. If we did not have this record of Peter’s failure, defeat, and denial, we might think that our natural life could succeed in being for the kingdom, and we would want to be bold like Peter. However, our natural life is not adequate. Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64605" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span> we see a natural Peter, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64606" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64607" data-verses="Acts 3:1">3</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64608" data-verses="Acts 4:1">4</span> we see a resurrected Peter.

JUDGED BY THE SANHEDRIN</h2><p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYCt-p3TWD97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64609" data-verses="Matthew 26:57-68">verses 57 through 68</span> the Lord was judged by the Sanhedrin. He was accused unjustly with false testimonies, but He did not say a word to vindicate Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64610" data-verses="Matthew 26:59-63">vv. 59-63</span>). The Lord, standing before the Sanhedrin like a sheep before its shearers, would not say a word to vindicate Himself. By remaining silent, He was fulfilling <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64611" data-verses="Isaiah 53:7">Isaiah 53:7</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUrXmDTrc0trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> Then the high priest said to Him, “I adjure you by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of <span class="pg" data-page-id="799" id="799">[799]</span> God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64612" data-verses="Matthew 26:63">v. 63</span>). This was the same question the Devil used in tempting the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64613" data-verses="Matthew 4:3">4:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64614" data-verses="Matthew 4:6">6</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64615" data-verses="Matthew 26:64">Verse 64</span> says, “Jesus says to him, You said it! Moreover, I say to you, Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered with “the Son of Man.” He answered the Devil in the same way in His temptation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64616" data-verses="Matthew 4:4">4:4</span>). The Lord is the Son of Man, not only on the earth before His crucifixion, but also in the heavens on the right hand of God after His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64617" data-verses="Acts 7:56">Acts 7:56</span>), and even at His coming back on the clouds. To accomplish God’s purpose and to establish the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord had to be a man. Without man, God’s purpose could not be carried out on earth and the kingdom of the heavens could not be constituted on earth.</p>
<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbY2uKEZYQZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> The Lord seemed to be saying to the high priest, “You asked Me whether or not I am the Son of God. I am the Son of Man. Even after you have crucified Me and I have been resurrected from the dead, I will be in the third heaven as a man. And when I come back on the clouds to take the earth, I will still be the Son of Man.”</p>
<p data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiAIBK2T5M5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX"> When the Devil in the wilderness tested the Lord regarding His being the Son of God, the Lord answered by saying, “Man.” The Lord seemed to say to the Devil, “I’m not here as the Son of God to be tempted by you. If I were the Son of God, I could not be tempted. I am standing here as a man.” The high priest, Caiaphas, was the same as the Devil, and his question was the same as the Devil’s temptation in the wilderness. The Lord also answered him in the same way.</p>
<p data-content-id="MpHQjC87VS5SHlyRhYt0fGDRsUs_7QYFIMRNsb49m1guU795l8gabs52JWkOaIDtC"> When the high priest heard the Lord’s answer, he tore his garments and said, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64618" data-verses="Matthew 26:65">v. 65</span>). After the others said that the Lord was liable to death, they spit in His face, beat Him with their fists, slapped Him, and mocked Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64619" data-verses="Matthew 26:67-68">vv. 67-68</span>). When the Lord was treated this way, He was victoriously silent. Thus, He was victorious not only before <span class="pg" data-page-id="800" id="800">[800]</span> the Sanhedrin, but also before Peter, who had followed Him afar off to the courthouse of the high priest and had sat down with the deputies to see the end (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64620" data-verses="Matthew 26:58">v. 58</span>). Again we see here that only the life of Jesus is good for the kingdom. Even the life of a man as strong and as bold as Peter is not fit for the kingdom.</p>

But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what you are saying!” Peter could not withstand even one fragile little female. Peter’s denial of the Lord was an exposure. It seems to me that this one test was sufficient to expose Peter. But under God’s sovereignty, the environment would not let Peter go until he was tested to the uttermost, that he might realize he was absolutely not trustworthy and should no longer have any confidence in himself. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64622" data-verses="Matthew 26:71-72">verses 71 and 72</span> say that another maid came to him and said, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene. And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!” Finally, those standing by said, “Surely you also are one of them, for your speech also makes you known” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64623" data-verses="Matthew 26:73">v. 73</span>). Then Peter “began to curse and to swear, I do not know the man!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64624" data-verses="Matthew 26:74">v. 74</span>). In his first denial, Peter said only the word; in his second denial, he replied with an oath; and in his third denial, he cursed and swore. After denying the Lord the third time and hearing the cock crow, Peter remembered the word of the Lord, and he went out and wept bitterly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64625" data-verses="Matthew 26:75">v. 75</span>). As the Lord was suffering an evil and unjust judgment, Peter denied Him. By denying Him, Peter was exposed to the uttermost.</p>

<p data-content-id="1tDgz3PlAWaEBWjqQsYz4HYcKLxMmEneRd0u3Q63wTlmnBAWTNk2ltp4Dp49vJGUB"> We should not read this account merely as a story about Peter, for it reveals that it is impossible for our natural life to enter into the kingdom. Because we all are the same as Peter, we should not try to follow the pathway into the kingdom by our natural life. No matter what kind of mind or will we may have, we cannot succeed. The test will come <span class="pg" data-page-id="801" id="801">[801]</span> that will fully expose us. Sooner or later, all of us on the pathway to the kingdom will face the same tests. Praise the Lord that there is still the way of repentance, weeping, and confessing that brings in the Lord’s forgiveness and His further visitation. For the kingdom, we must have another life and be another person. Only after we have passed through all the tests and have suffered all the defeats and failures will we realize our need for another life.</p>
<p data-content-id="9RI3Kmp54LS-OLojmxxCnW2KeLa8vkwRDcTWnQz5vYDDXNpbrp5k-FBKhetAsc8Oc"> Praise the Lord for the strong contrast presented in this chapter! In Peter we see the black, and in the Lord Jesus we see the white. All the way from the garden to the cross, Peter and the other disciples were defeated. Only one man, Jesus, was victorious. Actually, He was not even arrested; He handed Himself over to those who came for Him. Thus, His death was not a matter of compulsion, but a voluntary fulfillment of the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning His crucifixion. Truly, only the life of Jesus is good for the kingdom.</p>

Apparently, this chapter is not related to the kingdom of the heavens. Actually, it is very much related to it. If we do not read this chapter in the light of the kingdom of the heavens, we shall not be able to understand it adequately.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk4DOZZYq1byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> The first verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64627" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> begins with the word “Now.” This word indicates that one thing has been completed and that another is about to take place. We may think that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64628" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> is merely a continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64629" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span>. But in spiritual significance, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64630" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> is much different from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64631" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span>. The spiritual significance of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64632" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span> is that it reveals the life that can succeed in being for the kingdom and exposes the life that cannot succeed. The spiritual significance of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64633" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> is that it is related to righteousness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64634" data-verses="Matthew 27:19">27:19</span> Pilate’s wife referred to the Lord Jesus as a righteous man, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64635" data-verses="Matthew 27:24">verse 24</span> Pilate himself called Him a righteous man. In this chapter the Lord Jesus was treated in a very unrighteous manner.</p>

<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rTGVsayQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64636" data-verses="Matthew 27:1-2">Verses 1 and 2</span> reveal that it was the Jewish religious leaders who delivered the Lord Jesus to Pilate. Pilate was a Roman procurator, an agent of Caesar Tiberius in Judea (Palestine), A.D. 26-35. Not long after he unjustly delivered <span class="pg" data-page-id="804" id="804">[804]</span> the Lord Jesus up to be crucified, his government ended abruptly. He was banished and committed suicide. In their evil conspiracy, the Jewish religionists persuaded the heathen politician to collaborate with them to kill the Lord Jesus.</p>

The Destiny of Judas</h2><p data-content-id="PD5GiSWDvqrxJdMKj_iMnueJHizAChJzPHRnScSrFYNjLvHQQsg4X9XSFRD6s-e8z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64637" data-verses="Matthew 27:3-10">verses 3 through 10</span> we read of the destiny of Judas. When I was young, I was troubled by the fact that this record of Pilate’s judgment upon Christ speaks of the destiny of Judas. I could not see the relationship between these two things. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64638" data-verses="Matthew 27:1-2">Verses 1 and 2</span> speak of the delivering up of the Lord Jesus to Pilate by the religious leaders. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64639" data-verses="Matthew 27:3">verse 3</span> begins the account of Judas’ hanging himself. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64640" data-verses="Matthew 27:3-4">Verses 3 and 4</span> say that Judas “repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,” saying that he had “sinned in delivering up innocent blood.” Then Judas threw the pieces of silver into the temple, departed, and hanged himself. The chief priests took the pieces of silver and, knowing that it was not lawful to put them into the temple treasury because they were the price of blood, used them to buy a field as a burial place for strangers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64641" data-verses="Matthew 27:6-7">vv. 6-7</span>). They would not receive back the price of blood. Actually, what they did to the Lord Jesus was more evil than Judas’ deed. After giving us an account of all this, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64642" data-verses="Matthew 27:11">verse 11</span> Matthew resumes his record of the judgment of Christ by Pilate.</p>
<p data-content-id="-8SzSF8bK7b6c-PEbQtqAixFL5_5k8aWLBa_apAsOSCSg-wmel5lUh3Dlq4GFmV0v"> It is very meaningful that Matthew inserted the record of the destiny of Judas into his account of Pilate’s judgment of Christ. The record of Judas testifies of righteousness. Even the betrayer of the Lord Jesus eventually realized that He was a righteous man and that what had been done to Him was altogether unrighteous. In an attempt to be righteous, he threw away the thirty pieces of silver, for his conscience did not allow him to keep them. This is righteousness. When Judas returned the money, the religious leaders seemed to say, “We cannot keep this money, the price of blood, for the service of God. It is better <span class="pg" data-page-id="805" id="805">[805]</span> that we use it to buy a parcel of land for burying strangers.” This shows that even the religious leaders had a formal righteousness. Thus, the concept here was that of righteousness.</p>
<p data-content-id="pEnG63u4LKrgd-3XrYT-jVUzzxqgaeyy3iWk_rWI5fTuUJG-NezgHcdhOZRItOdgF"> The kingdom of the heavens is built upon righteousness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64643" data-verses="Matthew 5:10">5:10</span> the Lord said, “Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens,” and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64644" data-verses="Matthew 5:20">5:20</span> He said, “For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64645" data-verses="Matthew 6:33">6:33</span> the Lord said to seek first the kingdom and God’s righteousness. These verses reveal that righteousness is related to the kingdom and that the kingdom is built upon righteousness. We need to be clear about this if we are to get into the depth of chapter twentyseven.</p>
<p data-content-id="vlHE_9_2Abd-H0xe5xg5HgwGqIIU23oq-ng7ZbNob_aHLkVYyJzHJw1NveSNIonDE"> At the time Christ was crucified, the Jews had no legal right to judge Him or to sentence Him. Although they could spy on the Lord Jesus regarding certain things, they did not have the governmental position to judge anyone. They were simply a religious group, and government was not under their control. Therefore, the Jewish Sanhedrin had no governmental authority, and it could not pronounce judgment regarding justice or injustice, righteousness or unrighteousness. It could only express religious opinion. Hence, the actual judgment of the Lord Jesus did not take place in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64646" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span>, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64647" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span>.</p>

Jesus before Pilate</h2><p data-content-id="2jcbrCduFsEUUEHblTZy_p-K18nw370vJPRsldXBKLDeAuwSLjA1hTNINWxkIzb5K"> In Jesus’ answering Pilate, Jesus admitted that He was the King of the Jews (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64648" data-verses="Matthew 27:11">v. 11</span>). But to the accusation of the Jewish leaders He answered nothing.</p>
<p data-content-id="urHAAgrk9AOdxrcKsrGM8W18nLmElUa2GPVDT-55G95mNss2Jgyaf6RzB1qdN9C_d"> Pilate, the Roman governor, had the position to judge Christ. In principle, he should have judged Him according to righteousness. The kingdom of the heavens is based upon righteousness, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64649" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> reveals that <span class="pg" data-page-id="806" id="806">[806]</span> the kingdom of the world is absolutely unrighteous. This chapter affords a contrast between righteousness and unrighteousness. The earthly government, the kingdom of this world, is unrighteous, but the kingdom of the heavens is righteous. The Lord Jesus stood before Pilate as the uniquely righteous One, yet He was condemned to death by the unrighteous worldly government. Later we shall see that actually Christ was judged and killed by the righteous God. Apparently, He was sentenced to death by the unrighteous worldly government. This sentence was unrighteous. Actually, He was condemned to death by God. This sentence was righteous.</p>
<p data-content-id="fmJjtOiQEZedOJqRirfO33YTpa7ftku2476669acXJVqcoTVIPeKFfLov3FzK4w_Y"> The concept here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64650" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> is rather deep. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64651" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span> we saw a contrast between the life that can make it to be for the kingdom and the life that cannot make it. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64652" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> we have a contrast between righteousness and unrighteousness. The significance of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64653" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> is that it shows the contrast between the kingdom of the world and the kingdom of the heavens. On the side of the kingdom of the world, there is unrighteousness, but on the side of the kingdom of the heavens, there is righteousness. On the one hand, Jesus was sentenced and condemned to die on the cross in unrighteousness; on the other hand, He was sentenced to die in righteousness. Both rightly and wrongly, Jesus was crucified. He was wrongly sentenced by the unrighteous worldly government. He was righteous and innocent, as even His betrayer testified. Pilate also testified that Christ was a righteous man, even washing his hands to show that he did not want to get involved in any unrighteousness. As we shall see, the Lord was sentenced rightly because He was sentenced to die by the righteous God. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64654" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> is a chapter concerning unrighteousness and righteousness.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1ECWn9WlkCzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> This contrast implies that the kingdom of the world cannot stand. The reason it cannot stand is that it is not built upon righteousness. However, the kingdom of the heavens and of God is altogether righteous. God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="807" id="807">[807]</span> kingdom is built upon righteousness. Because of the unrighteousness of the government of the kingdom of this world, Christ was wrongly condemned to die. Nevertheless, actually He was rightly sentenced to death by the righteousness of God. Thus, this chapter exposes the unrighteousness of the worldly government, and it reveals the righteousness of God’s government.</p>

<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhknzpNQw69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> According to Roman law, the Sanhedrin acted illegally in arresting Christ. If Pilate had been just, he would have stopped the Sanhedrin from doing this. He would have said, “You have no right to do this because you are just a religious party. You cannot arrest people and judge them. This is illegal.” Pilate did not say this because he was unrighteous and fearful. Afraid of the Jewish religious leaders, Pilate acted against Roman law, which was very strong. The Roman Empire was famous for its law. But although the law was strong, the enforcement of the law was weak. Pilate was not even as righteous as Judas. If the betrayer of the Lord Jesus was able to say that he had sold innocent blood, the governor of the kingdom should have been even more righteous. Nevertheless, Pilate “washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64655" data-verses="Matthew 27:24">v. 24</span>). This was a timid and irresponsible withdrawal. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64656" data-verses="Matthew 27:26">Verse 26</span> says, “Then he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered Him up that He might be crucified.” This was an utmost exposure of dark, unjust politics. This injustice fulfilled <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64657" data-verses="Isaiah 53:5">Isaiah 53:5</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64658" data-verses="Isaiah 53:8">8</span>.</p>
<p data-content-id="Xrfm_0_wHtlK1HVoKjia-zcO5XMNx9Cw0kdxF7iwt4aGYrrICB0YkaHGfAxzlMrpi"> When Jesus was appearing before Pilate, Pilate’s wife “sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64659" data-verses="Matthew 27:19">v. 19</span>). This dream was sovereign of God. Pilate’s wife did not want him to get involved with this unrighteous matter. According to his conscience, Pilate also knew that Jesus was righteous and that the Jews were unrighteous in arresting Him. He also knew that he should have released this righteous man, but he was afraid to do this. Accustomed at the time of the feast to release to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="808" id="808">[808]</span> crowd one prisoner whom they wanted, Pilate asked, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you? And they said, Barabbas” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64660" data-verses="Matthew 27:21">v. 21</span>). Barabbas was a most sinful criminal. No doubt, Pilate intended to release Jesus and to keep Barabbas. But the people wanted him to release Barabbas and to crucify Jesus. Pilate seemed to be saying, “You ask me to release the most sinful criminal and to crucify the innocent one.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64661" data-verses="Matthew 27:23">Verse 23</span> says, “But he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified!” Pilate was subdued by the voices of the crowd. In order to appease his conscience, he “took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; you see to it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64662" data-verses="Matthew 27:24">v. 24</span>). Then the people answered and said, “His blood be on us and on our children!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64663" data-verses="Matthew 27:25">v. 25</span>). Thus, Pilate released Barabbas, but scourged Jesus and delivered Him up that He might be crucified. What a portrait this is of unrighteousness!</p>

The <span class="pg" data-page-id="813" id="813">[813]</span> words “from the top to the bottom” indicate that the rending of the veil was God’s doing from above. Because sin had been judged and the flesh of sin had been crucified, the separation between God and man was taken away. Now the way to enter into the presence of God is open for us. What a wonderful effect of the Lord’s death! His death was not martyrdom; it was an act of redemption.</p>

Because God’s righteousness was fully satisfied, Christ’s death could be so effective.</p>

In the crucifixion of Christ, man’s unrighteousness turns into God’s righteousness. We need to see this matter very clearly.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFHBVmyp3NHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ">MAN’S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYDv-pzA2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> As we pointed out in the previous message, the Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours. During the first three hours, He was dealt with by man, and during the second three hours, He was dealt with by God. Everything man did to the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64732" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> was unrighteous. Not only was Pilate unrighteous toward the Lord Jesus, but the Jewish leaders were also unrighteous toward Him. They arrested Christ in an unrighteous way, and they also judged and bound Him in an unrighteous way. Everything the religious leaders did to the Lord was unrighteous. Judas, of course, was also unrighteous in betraying the Lord Jesus. The Roman soldiers also treated Him unrighteously. Their mocking, spitting, and beating were unrighteous. Furthermore, they unrighteously forced Simon of Cyrene to bear the Lord’s cross. Thus, on man’s side, there was nothing righteous.</p>

Man could only go so far. He could <span class="pg" data-page-id="816" id="816">[816]</span> mistreat the Lord and put Him on the cross as the Passover Lamb. Everything man did to the Lord Jesus set the stage for God’s righteousness to come in. On man’s side, everything was black, but on God’s side, everything was white. On man’s side, everything was unrighteous, but on God’s side, everything was righteous. Man’s unrighteousness prepared the way for God’s righteousness to be fully manifested. In this way, man’s unrighteousness turned into God’s righteousness. In the crucifixion of Christ, man’s unrighteousness was fully exposed; yet it brought in God’s righteousness. Thus, the killing of Christ was the first way through which man’s unrighteousness brought in God’s righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UoLYY_pPGVH-445w1WeiBKBK9ApM5j3F5bC0cdcWxF7qbrTX8g4YBZbzYn6YspUhX">CHRIST EXPOSING<br/>MAN’S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p data-content-id="EIwiucq7YurPrnABthKvV3Ngp4vuQNRVrfQv7v7jIiTXsWSmnfWGmCsTSzRuL34sP"> However, this was not the basic way. The basic way in which man’s unrighteousness turned into God’s righteousness was through Christ. In turning man’s unrighteousness into God’s righteousness, Christ first exposed man’s unrighteousness to the uttermost. In all of human history there has not been a case in which man’s unrighteousness has been as totally exposed as in the crucifixion of Christ. As we all know, there is unrighteousness in the judicial branch of any earthly government. But no earthly court has seen as much unrighteousness as was exposed in the case of the trial and crucifixion of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus completely exposed human unrighteousness. We have seen that the Lord’s betrayal at the hands of Judas was unrighteous. The elders, the high priests, and the Sanhedrin all were unrighteous. Thus, the case of the crucifixion of Christ was unique in being filled with unrighteousness. Nearly everyone involved with His case was unrighteous. In every way and in every aspect, it was unrighteous. The very presence of Christ in this unrighteous situation was a full exposure of man’s unrighteousness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="817" id="817">[817]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DUyZ4Hs_AVZBfuuZSY0LQELnD__aKFChHN1nRovUNUeH2dzU8wxHlzr4Z4ZvElNYP">CHRIST BEARING<br/>MAN’S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p data-content-id="Sj9l0m9HrieAfAPUUFbY8jvC-Y8lV-2_a713Q3PrIMSnTs7gXLG1zGkM1xHcSYBsS"> Secondly, the Christ who exposed man’s unrighteousness to the uttermost also bore all the unrighteousness He had exposed. He firstly exposed man’s unrighteousness and then He bore it on the cross. This is like housecleaning. If you do not clean, you may not see the dust hidden under the furniture. In cleaning a room the dust is firstly exposed. Then it is swept into the dustpan. Likewise, on the day of the Passover, the Lord Jesus firstly exposed all the “dust,” all of man’s unrighteousness. Then He cleaned up the “dust” He had exposed. Oh, the very presence of the Lord Jesus exposed every particle of hidden “dust” in the whole universe. Eventually, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself became the “dustpan,” and all the “dust” was collected upon Him. During the first three hours He was on the cross, the time of man’s dealing with Him, all the sins, all the unrighteousness, all the universal “dust,” were put on Him. As He hung there on the cross, He was the universal “dustpan” into which all the “dust” in the universe had been gathered. Thus, after all man’s unrighteousness had been exposed, it was borne by Christ on the cross. This made everything ready for the righteous God to come in to judge the unrighteous ones and all their unrighteousness.</p>
<p data-content-id="g_vaqvgwdCS0vabyh9cIv6NE7Jc5SemdpDULp-6PBOjituywOwJWwxXiNp7FQN8zF"> Without the black, the white could not be clearly manifest. Because all the “dust,” all man’s unrighteousness, was put on the cross, the stage was prepared for God’s righteousness to be revealed. If there had not been so much unrighteousness, it would not have been possible for so much righteousness to be manifested. The complete unrighteousness of mankind was heaped upon the Lord on the cross so that God’s righteousness could be manifested. The righteous God came in to exercise His righteousness by judging all this unrighteousness. This is the reason that through Christ man’s unrighteousness eventually turned into God’s righteousness. By this we have been saved. <span class="pg" data-page-id="818" id="818">[818]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzgl9tLccsSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> Christ was the turning point. Man’s unrighteousness turned into God’s righteousness through Christ. Firstly, Christ exposed man’s unrighteousness, and then for judgment by God’s righteousness He bore upon Himself all of man’s unrighteousness that He had exposed. Today are you still in man’s unrighteousness, or are you now under God’s righteousness? Hallelujah, we, the saved ones, are under God’s righteousness!</p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFHBVm26HNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ">GOD’S RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE GOSPEL</h2><p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYDv-p0T2D97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> This matter of righteousness is a crucial aspect of the truth of the gospel. This is very basic, for it is our ground and basis for being saved. Our salvation rests upon the solid rock of God’s righteousness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64733" data-verses="Romans 1:16-17">Romans 1:16 and 17</span> say, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek. For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith.” Because of God’s righteousness, the gospel is powerful to save everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus. The gospel of Christ is so powerful not because of God’s love nor because of God’s grace, but because of God’s righteousness.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUqVmDQr80trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> Legally speaking, both love and grace can fluctuate, but righteousness, especially God’s righteousness, cannot. Madame Guyon once said that even if God wanted to change His mind regarding her salvation, He could not do it because He had already judged her on the cross. Through Christ our substitute, we have already been judged according to righteousness on the cross. Therefore, God must save us. God is a just God. Because He has already righteously dealt with us judicially, He is now obligated to save us. We can boldly say to Him, “God, I do not speak now of Your love or of Your grace, but of Your righteousness. I appeal to You regarding Your righteousness. According to Your righteousness, You must save me. If You do not save me, it means that You are unrighteous.” If we say this to God, He will reply, “I surely must save you.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="819" id="819">[819]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="hpi-TF1tPp-hPkHeYQbY3sKEabwZRB7-1OS2V56p89RUelRacE8C831pUjoe11ehi"> Nothing binds God as much as His righteousness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64734" data-verses="Psalms 89:14">Psalm 89:14</span> says, “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne” (A.S.V.). If God’s righteousness could be taken away, His throne would be cast down. We can say, “Praise the Lord! Even if God wants to change His mind, He cannot do it because He is a just God!” How meaningful this is!</p>

Love, on the contrary, is a matter of the emotion. If I love you, I may choose to pay attention to you. But if I do not love you, I may simply forget about you. Many Christians like to quote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64735" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>, the verse that says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. Yes, God has so loved the world, but His love is not as firm as His righteousness. God, of course, will not change in His love. But suppose His love did change. God has the right to change in His love, but He does not have the right to change in His righteousness. Whether God loves us or gives us up, He is not wrong. He also would not be wrong in showing grace to us or in not showing grace to us. Grace is a matter of God’s wish. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64736" data-verses="Matthew 20:1">Matthew 20</span> the Lord told Peter that He wanted to give the same reward to the last as to the first. This is a matter of the Lord’s wish, and there is nothing wrong with it. But righteousness is a matter neither of emotion nor of wish; it is a judicial matter. A judicial matter is related to the execution of the law, to legislation. God’s gospel is altogether a judicial matter, a matter of divine legislation. God has saved us judicially. Of course, God’s salvation is initiated by His love and accomplished through His grace. Eventually, however, it issues in His righteousness. Therefore, the salvation we have received today is not merely a matter of love or of grace, but also a judicial matter of God’s righteousness. Our salvation has been sealed and confirmed by God’s righteousness. Now not even God Himself can change our salvation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="820" id="820">[820]</span> </p>

Have you seen the contrast between man’s unrighteousness and God’s righteousness, between man’s kingdom and God’s kingdom? Man’s kingdom is not built upon righteousness. This fact was fully exposed in the way Pilate, the Roman governor, dealt with the Lord Jesus. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64737" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span> Matthew fully exposed the weakness of Peter’s natural life, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64738" data-verses="Matthew 27:1">chapter twenty-seven</span> he exposed man’s unrighteousness. Man’s unrighteousness is even seen after the burial of Christ. The chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate and said to him, “Sir, we remembered that that deceiver said, while he was still living, After three days I will arise. Command therefore that the grave be secured until the third day, lest the disciples come and steal him away and say to the people, He was raised from the dead; and the last deception will be worse than the first” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64739" data-verses="Matthew 27:63-64">27:63-64</span>). Pilate replied, “You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64740" data-verses="Matthew 27:65">v. 65</span>). Pilate’s answer to the chief priests and Pharisees was unrighteous. Later, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64741" data-verses="Matthew 28:11-15">28:11-15</span>, the chief priests and the elders bribed the soldiers, paying them to lie about the resurrection of Christ. This shows that the Roman soldiers also were unrighteous. Thus, regarding man’s government, the record is filled with unrighteousness. This exposes the fact that man’s government is built upon unrighteousness. But God’s government is built upon righteousness. Righteousness is the solid foundation of God’s kingdom. We are saved under God’s righteousness. Therefore, the foundation of our salvation is solid.</p>

Praise the Lord that eventually man’s unrighteousness turned into God’s righteousness! We used to be in man’s unrighteousness, but now we are under God’s righteousness and in God’s kingdom. God’s kingdom is the kingdom of righteousness, and we are the righteous people in His kingdom.</p>

Have you ever considered the resurrection of Christ in this light? God was righteous to come in to judge Christ as our substitute on the cross. This judgment of Christ on the cross was just and righteous. By being judged by God, Christ fulfilled all the requirements of God’s righteousness. He bore our sins on the cross to fully meet all the righteous requirements of God. Thus, through Christ’s death on the cross, God’s righteousness has been wholly satisfied. In other words, the righteous God was judicially satisfied with Christ’s death on the cross. Therefore, Christ was buried in a new tomb that belonged to a rich man. This indicates that immediately after Christ’s judicial death and immediately after the satisfaction of God’s righteous requirements, Christ rested as the fulfillment of the prophecy of the Scriptures.</p>
<p data-content-id="nFiBNrrjBY2KdkVPrZq_7ZrHX-WhqeraNgvaFyxQ44xk7lROkqtozTkOrU047Q1Mt"> After Christ was buried, God was held responsible in His righteousness to release Christ from among the dead. Not many Christians realize this. Most think that the resurrection of Christ was only a matter of the divine power of God’s life. Few realize that the resurrection of Christ was not only a matter of power, but also a matter of righteousness. If God had not raised Christ up after His death on the <span class="pg" data-page-id="822" id="822">[822]</span> cross to satisfy all the requirements of God’s righteousness, God would have not been righteous. It was righteous for God to release Christ from death. According to His righteousness, God had to judge Christ on the cross because Christ was bearing all our unrighteousness. But after God had judged Christ in full, God’s righteousness held Him responsible to release Christ from death and to raise Him up from among the dead.</p>
<p data-content-id="6i3WqqlzlYO7TDrgx-57dimE-JuTKhOmYwY2GpgeChC0Wu-I7K18sT42p6pdA39St"> In the Gospel of John there is the concept that Christ was resurrected by the power of an endless life. But this is not the concept of Christ’s resurrection in the Gospel of Matthew. The concept in Matthew regarding Christ’s resurrection is that it is related to God’s righteousness. John is a book on life, and life is a matter of power. But Matthew is a book on the kingdom, and the kingdom is a matter of righteousness. Therefore, according to Matthew, for Christ to be raised from the dead meant that God released Him according to His righteousness. Thus, Christ was both righteously judged and put to death and righteously raised up from the dead.</p>
<p data-content-id="RfZB62-hDo68OhcWs9faGKyuqqaZKrPwYQpEaT7PCqT5CXOhXYlKmMOXckOKf_D7g"> Eventually, Christ became not only the powerful King, but also the righteous King. If you read the prophecies concerning Christ’s kingship, you will see that His kingship is not very much related to power, but that it is closely related to righteousness and justice. Kingship is not a matter of power; it is a matter of righteousness. The heavenly Savior-King was righteously judged by God on the cross, and He was righteously raised up from the dead by Him to become the righteous King. He is altogether righteous. He is the righteous King for God’s righteous kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="Io9l88EY1Di8j6CZeF1ECWH9WnkCzP3HZol1GCKy6VIFFRaexr57oK7rJlmQO9Kma"> We need to have this concept as we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64747" data-verses="Matthew 28:1">Matthew 28</span>. In this chapter we cannot find a hint that the resurrection of Christ is related to power. However, if we read carefully, we can find that it is related to righteousness. Perhaps you have wondered why in this chapter, a chapter concerned with Christ’s resurrection, Matthew includes the account of the bribery of the Roman soldiers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64748" data-verses="Matthew 28:11-15">vv. 11-15</span>). This is <span class="pg" data-page-id="823" id="823">[823]</span> mentioned for the purpose of exposing man’s unrighteousness. The opposite of unrighteousness is not power, but righteousness. Because of His righteousness, God was held responsible to raise Christ up from the dead. Therefore, Christ’s resurrection was according to God’s righteousness. This was the reason that Matthew inserted the historical account of the bribery of the soldiers. No other Gospel mentions this. Matthew includes it to show that Christ’s resurrection was related to God’s righteousness, which is versus man’s unrighteousness. Again I say that it is difficult to find in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64749" data-verses="Matthew 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> any hint that Christ’s resurrection was related to power or to life.</p>
<p data-content-id="HW8WTQ2X-_23Yh5U78fhknTpNSw69_lw8A-r6aOew5p9Af7EREI7YQE10WeRiKzRF"> At this point we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64750" data-verses="Romans 4:25">Romans 4:25</span>. This verse says, “Who was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification.” This verse links resurrection with righteousness. The Bible makes resurrection not only a matter of power, but also a matter of righteousness. Not only was God’s righteousness manifested in raising Christ from the dead, but we were justified because of Christ’s resurrection. Therefore, Christ’s resurrection is a proof both of God’s righteousness and of our justification. Hallelujah, in Christ’s resurrection God is the righteous God, and we are the justified people!</p>
<p data-content-id="Xrfm_0_wHtlK1HVoKjia-z8O6XsNx9Cw0kdxF7iwt4aGYrrICB0YkaHGfAxzlMrpi"> We have seen that resurrection is very closely related to God’s righteousness. The kingdom of the heavens is built and established upon God’s righteousness, which held God responsible to raise up the righteous Redeemer and to make us righteous. Hence, Christ’s resurrection is a realm of righteousness. In the sphere of Christ’s resurrection, God is the righteous God, and we are the justified people of God. Here we have the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="kk8pa1cD5KmrHBVkZNuavKNTplDi_gMaXaRK-m-vALIwVbvUZhq-a14zPPmiajr-R"> Many Christians today know only the kingdom of love or the kingdom of grace. In other words, they are familiar only with the realm of love and grace. They have no understanding of the realm of God’s righteousness. But God’s righteousness, not His love or grace, is the foundation of God’s kingdom. The kingdom of the heavens is built not upon God’s love or grace, but upon His righteousness. How <span class="pg" data-page-id="824" id="824">[824]</span> precious, necessary, and vital the righteousness of God is! It is absolutely necessary for the kingdom life. If we realize this, the churches in the Lord’s recovery will be greatly strengthened. Hallelujah, our kingly Savior has been resurrected through the righteousness of God!</p>

The angel came to confirm the Lord’s resurrection by rolling away the stone that was sealed and to explain the resurrection to His seekers. The coming of the angel, which terrified the guards, indicates the power of the heavens.

This strongly indicated that the resurrected King had fully abandoned Judaism and initiated a new era for God’s economy of the New Testament.</p>

However, in His humanity as the Son of Man to be the King of the heavenly kingdom, all authority in heaven and on earth was given to Him after His resurrection.</p>
<p data-content-id="ocLgniqB8KwjF6ot99Nk4DuZfK61byrAp_EQB01bMrhPR9RU9KFEABZFvuuqSWwc4"> Matthew’s account of the resurrection is very different from John’s. According to John’s record, after His resurrection the Lord met with His disciples in a room where the doors had been shut (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64771" data-verses="John 20:19">John 20:19</span>). The disciples were frightened, being afraid of the Jews. Because they needed to be strengthened by life, the Lord came to them as life, breathed upon them, and told them to receive the holy breath (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64772" data-verses="John 20:22">John 20:22</span>). How different is Matthew’s account! According to Matthew, the Lord charged the disciples to go to a mountain in Galilee. Surely He met with them on that mountain during the day, not during the night. Furthermore, when He met with them on the mountain, He did not breathe upon them and tell them to receive the holy breath. Instead, He said, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.” In Matthew it is not a matter of breath, but a matter of authority. John’s concern was for life, and life requires breath. But Matthew’s concern was for the kingdom, and the kingdom requires authority. The Gospel of John reveals that we need life to care for the little lambs and to feed the Lord’s flock. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64773" data-verses="Matthew 28:1">Matthew 28</span> there is no word about feeding the lambs. In Matthew the Lord commands the disciples to disciple all the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64774" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">v. 19</span>) to make all the nations part of the kingdom. This requires authority. Therefore, in John resurrection is a matter of life, power, breath, and shepherding. However, in Matthew it is a matter of righteousness, authority, and discipling the nations.</p>

They go with His authority. To disciple the nations is to cause the heathen to become the kingdom people for the establishment of His kingdom, which is the church, even today on this earth.</p>
<p data-content-id="c75rc-NqeTTVwukdJ29rTG1sRhQrVThjBnOptZEKg90vyNqubwW8_HfVVlfeYoUBF"> Notice that the Lord did not charge the disciples to preach the gospel, but to disciple the nations. The difference between preaching the gospel and discipling the nations is that to preach the gospel is simply to bring sinners to salvation, but to disciple the nations is to cause the Gentiles to become the kingdom people. We have been sent by the Lord not only to bring people to salvation, but also to disciple the nations. This is a matter of the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="YPkAFrGZxUnKdHlwycePD3tgUTwGJekYLCeNKoCkP2IAo7z25qNcpAs1bvHZjOzEO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64776" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">verse 19</span> the Lord speaks of baptizing the nations into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Baptism is to bring the repentant people out of their old state into a new one, by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ, that they may become the kingdom people. John the Baptist’s recommending ministry began with the preliminary baptism by water only. Now, after the heavenly King accomplished His ministry on earth, passed through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64777" data-verses="Acts 2:38">Acts 2:38</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64778" data-verses="Acts 2:41">41</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64779" data-verses="Acts 10:44-48">10:44-48</span>). The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect; whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible aspect by the Spirit, the visible aspect by water is vain; and without the visible aspect by water, the invisible aspect by the Spirit is abstract and impractical. Both are needed. Not long after the Lord charged the disciples with this baptism, He baptized them and the entire church in the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64780" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Cor. 12:13</span>) on the day of Pentecost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64781" data-verses="Acts 1:5">Acts 1:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64782" data-verses="Acts 2:4">2:4</span>) and in the house of Cornelius (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64783" data-verses="Acts 11:15-17">Acts 11:15-17</span>). Then, based upon this, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="829" id="829">[829]</span> disciples baptized the new converts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64784" data-verses="Acts 2:38">Acts 2:38</span>), not only visibly into water, but also invisibly into the death of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64785" data-verses="Romans 6:3-4">Rom. 6:3-4</span>), into Christ Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64786" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>), into the Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64787" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>), and into the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64788" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Cor. 12:13</span>). The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered as a tomb to terminate the old history of the baptized ones. Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, since Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God, and since the Triune God is one with the Body of Christ, so to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do just one thing: on the negative side to terminate their old life, and on the positive side to germinate them with a new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ. Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord here is to baptize people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ, as the last Adam, had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into the realm of resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples, in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection, to charge them to cause the heathen to become the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the Person, the reality, of the Trinity. Later, in the Acts and the Epistles, it is disclosed that to baptize people into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit is to baptize them into the name of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64813" data-verses="Acts 8:16">Acts 8:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64814" data-verses="Acts 19:5">19:5</span>, Gk.), and that to baptize them into the name of Christ is to baptize them into Christ the Person (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64815" data-verses="Galatians 3:27">Gal. 3:27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64816" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Rom. 6:3</span>), for Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and He, as the life-giving Spirit, is available any time and any place for people to be baptized into Him. Such a baptism into the reality of the Father, Son, and Spirit, according to Matthew, is for the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. The heavenly kingdom cannot be organized with human beings of flesh and blood (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64817" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:50">1 Cor. 15:50</span>) as an earthly society; it can only be constituted with people who are immersed into the union with the Triune God and who are established and built up with the Triune God who is wrought into them. <span class="pg" data-page-id="831" id="831">[831]</span> </p>

Promising to Be with the Disciples<br/>All the Days until the Consummation of the Age</h2><p data-content-id="eDozFYQVQlXuQ5suhxOzglNtOd8sSmCEbYhXSl-epQqdLFBa7HF_LdaGKqPeZm5um"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64818" data-verses="Matthew 28:20">verse 20</span> the Lord told His disciples, “Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.” The heavenly King is Emmanuel, God with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64819" data-verses="Matthew 1:23">1:23</span>). Here He promised to be with us in His resurrection with all authority all the days until the consummation of the age, that is, until the end of this age. Hence, wherever we are gathered into His name, He is in our midst (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="64820" data-verses="Matthew 18:20">18:20</span>).</p>
<p data-content-id="5k6wgfN9LXLbJGWVPJnFHBlmz7nNHvkCYBfPffqJtcDJ8oa621aS-QT3amue2zlQQ"> In the four Gospels, the Lord’s ascension is recorded only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64821" data-verses="Mark 16:19">Mark (16:19</span>) and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="64822" data-verses="Luke 24:51">Luke (24:51</span>). John testifies that the Lord, as the Son of God, even God Himself, is life to His believers. As such, He can never leave them and would never leave them. Matthew proves that He, as Emmanuel, is the heavenly King who is with His people continually until He comes back. Hence, in both John and Matthew, the Lord’s ascension is not mentioned.</p>
<p data-content-id="NUitON694oBtS6O8EUWYDvOpxTWD97Nund-5oq0cYSQHwAK-OKGmBuv2CPWdAAX_k"> As the King in the kingdom with the kingdom people, the Lord is with us all the days until the consummation of the age. Today is included in all the days. The Lord is with us today, and He will be with us tomorrow. Not one day will be an exception. He will be with us until the consummation of the age. This refers to the end of this age, which will be the time of the Lord’s parousia, the Lord’s coming. The consummation of the age, the end of the age, will be the great tribulation. We do not want to be here during that time. Rather, we prefer to be raptured into the Lord’s parousia, into His presence. This is a matter of the kingdom.</p>
<p data-content-id="t5xc02saEdT4JIN13sAUqVWDVrc0trdCUtOIKjBQr0gwbQRK9rzI8igkWOgplvZT5"> In the Lord’s resurrection with His righteousness the kingdom is present, and we have the authority, commission, and position, to disciple the nations. In this way the kingdom is spreading.</p>
