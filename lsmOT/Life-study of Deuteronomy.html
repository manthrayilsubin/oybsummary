THE CONCLUDING BOOK OF THE PENTATEUCH</h2><p data-content-id="bdj2gqF4PGk_dJln8yM8t7OkNdCTlw15v7BBqJLx_5mzbE1Yfsb3tnZUyiTIjk3HP"> Deuteronomy is the concluding book of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible. These five books were written by Moses. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIesvEgTts9UBkE-38Dk5lBHcSRB921TH_bxSR30TN69-XOYfu12baR6NuWRNSSyE"> The book of Deuteronomy is a book primarily of plain words. This means that, generally speaking, it is not a book of types, figures, and shadows, and neither is it deep in the matter of prophecies. Nearly all the chapters of this book consist of plain words. </p>
<p data-content-id="yqFCdIWEeZEzn6z64enYMG47A05cOHFiHi3mtTV5o9f1HyUDnwmJRcONNm1W8J6V7"> We may think that plain words are easier to understand than types and figures. Actually, the plain words in the Bible are more difficult to understand than the pictures shown in the types and figures. </p>
<p data-content-id="7Mq2kh9sNErSqhMRMew6nXej_9b43PMO2up44PmU6KvZqEoKGsLDGirG6fRoo4kIs"> What does the word <em>Deuteronomy</em> mean? Literally, Deuteronomy means “second law” and thus signifies a respeaking, a repeated speaking, a speaking again. The book of Deuteronomy is a respeaking, not of ordinary words, but of the divine law. </p>
<p data-content-id="_S_J193KzzpWp3dULvJ1s9B1SAmzOGA7krFM6EtaRDoJwA_i0w5FI1IdPBSHLMTWC"> The law was given through Moses the first time when he was eighty. Forty years later, after the first generation, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua, had died out, the law was again related to the children of Israel. At that time, Moses was facing those of the younger generation, most of whom had not been present to hear the giving of the Ten Commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances. Therefore, <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> God burdened Moses to relate the law again, to rehearse it, to respeak it. This repeating of the law was surely meaningful and significant. </p>
<p data-content-id="BoSFG94NQpQ3j4WsWfaVgo5nRC0sN7ISsKkXoeulDhIeWgk_uVRmbLj68nzVHefEH"> We should not think that only Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Bible, is a deuteronomy, a respeaking. Actually, the entire Bible is a deuteronomy. We should therefore regard the whole Bible of sixty-six books as a deuteronomy. The writing of the Bible was completed nineteen hundred years ago, but when we read the Bible today, we experience a respeaking. The word in the Bible has already been spoken, but it is respoken to us day by day. This means that every day we may have a deuteronomy. For example, the book of Romans was written nearly two thousand years ago, but when we read Romans today, the word in this epistle is spoken to us again. This means that in our reading of Romans we have a deuteronomy. </p>
<p data-content-id="xLIymt5TfDx4T4fWSZu2ADx5i8RwsYZ9eoBf631Wrt-G7vwunwhRWAKYTR3rapCMb"> To say that we may have a respeaking of the Bible does not mean that anything can be added to the Bible. The claim of Joseph Smith to have had a revelation in addition to what is in the Bible is nonsensical and heretical. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42003" data-verses="Revelation 22:18-19">Revelation 22:18 and 19</span> indicate that the entire revelation of God has been completed and that no one should add anything or take away anything. Therefore, we should not think that we can receive a new revelation in addition to what is recorded in the sixty-six books of the Bible. What we can have today is a deuteronomy, a respeaking of the word in the Scriptures. The word has already been spoken, but it can now be respoken to us; that is, it can become to us a deuteronomy. </p>
<p data-content-id="r3j8GZpjT_XtkBRgyejlrweN5Xlc3HsG9JtDwTzsyHuvknJjd_LAmYLudPgo7VdMu"> The book of Deuteronomy is a conclusion to the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. Apart from Deuteronomy, these four books would not have a conclusion. Do you think Moses’ writing could have concluded with Genesis? Genesis ends with a man in a coffin in Egypt. Surely the divine revelation could not conclude in such a way. For a proper conclusion, the book of Deuteronomy is needed. Deuteronomy is an all-inclusive conclusion of the four preceding books, for Deuteronomy is a totality of the thought of these books. Therefore, if we would understand the thought <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, we need to come to Deuteronomy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="dbzF1Z-0kPtilRgbiq7B_8i43qcazLDGGhcgWXnFRDHy7lXQsLX6Pt9EzLa4oOL4W">A. A Concluding Word of the Law</h2><p data-content-id="QfLqOeamc21tPQYaJpo1UPn9fPfdzqfdPqStKQ4ocgqQs84upm40VyJnyW-GDKaPt"> Deuteronomy is not only a conclusion of the Pentateuch; it is also a concluding word of the law. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="KaPp4ZfWpHg0v7Y1Qb8kCxbqDOKFszFFy1tOnWAiiuOJw9pt8SkBURHfo8rEPsy9m">B. Considering the Law as the Living<br/>Word of God—the Breathing of God</h2><p data-content-id="lv9QiwyubS3pAzuAkD7P6WwucQU2rh51Nk_QshgmMh1Zz6ZH3s9Ne8zbAIfXXLpAM"> What is the law in its nature? The law is God’s breathing. I do not say that the law is God’s breath, but I do say that it is God’s breathing. When God was giving the law, He was breathing out the law. This was the reason Paul said, “All Scripture is God-breathed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42004" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16a</span>). Here Paul does not say merely that all Scripture is inspired by God—he says that all Scripture is God-breathed. The law, therefore, is God’s breathing. </p>
<p data-content-id="O_zWsz1z_HTP4vqX5zZIjK5pSXxwhFhpsZyXK7kFx_QSEW2PV2DsWExpd1JZ4Eanb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42005" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:3">Deuteronomy 8:3</span> Moses, speaking for God, said that man lives not by bread alone but by “everything proceeding from Jehovah’s mouth.” Notice that this verse does not speak of every word but of everything. The words written in the Pentateuch, of which Deuteronomy is the conclusion, are things which have proceeded out of the mouth of God. These things are God’s breathing. While Moses was with God on Mount Sinai, many things were breathed out by God. The Ten Commandments, for example, are items of the basic law. Nevertheless, even the Ten Commandments are God’s breathing. If we read these commandments with an open heart and with a seeking and exercised spirit, we will sense that the commandments are not merely legalities but also something living, something full of life to supply us and full of light to enlighten us. </p>
<p data-content-id="4o_adcdx4MchGHKq-TB0DTB2MwgaweKzFHjOe7Ynup1Gsj7oUAlM-uG37dOywWjc-"> The psalmists, who appraised the law very highly, had this kind of experience in relation to the law. Thus the writer of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42006" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> could say, “How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42007" data-verses="Psalms 119:103">v. 103</span>). For the psalmist, whatever came out of God’s mouth was not only something legal but something sweet to his taste. <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="o32d_B9yYf_rls_I7-3ejjp4EEapN2b2zJToriTF6vKyAeF-BAm80vbbc64O6F8eo"> Because all Scripture is God-breathed, even verses such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42008" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42009" data-verses="Revelation 20:2-3">Revelation 20:2 and 3</span> can supply, nourish, strengthen, and enlighten us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42010" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3:1</span> says that the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42011" data-verses="Revelation 20:2-3">Revelation 20:2 and 3</span> speak of the devil’s being bound and cast into the abyss. These verses are God’s breathing, and if we pray-read them, we will be nourished by them. From this we see that we can be nourished and enlightened by any verse in the Bible, including the genealogy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42012" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span>. The point we would emphasize here is that Deuteronomy, the concluding word of the law, considers the law as the living word of God, as the breathing of God. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42016" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:11">Deuteronomy 30:11</span> Moses says that the commandment “is not too difficult for you, nor is it distant.” The Hebrew word translated “difficult” can also be rendered “extraordinary” or “wonderful.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42017" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:12-13">verses 12 and 13</span> Moses goes on to say, “It is not in heaven that you should say, Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it? Nor is it across the sea that you should say, Who will go across the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it?” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42018" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:14">verse 14</span> Moses says, “The word is very near to you, even in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.” This word is quoted and interpreted by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42019" data-verses="Romans 10:1">Romans 10</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42020" data-verses="Romans 10:6-7">verses 6 and 7</span> Paul says, “The righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? That is, to bring Christ down. Or, Who will descend into the abyss? That is, to bring Christ up from among the dead.” Here in his interpretation Paul applies the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42021" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:11-13">Deuteronomy 30:11-13</span> to Christ, and he interprets the sea as the abyss. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42022" data-verses="Romans 10:8">verse 8</span> Paul continues, “But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart: that is, the word of the faith which we preach.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42023" data-verses="Romans 10:6-7">verses 6 and 7</span> Paul speaks about Christ, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42024" data-verses="Romans 10:8">verse 8</span> Christ becomes <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> the word. The object of Paul’s speaking here is Christ, and he eventually indicates that Christ is the word. </p>

Nor is it across the sea that you should say, Who will go across the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it?” The pronoun <em>it</em> in these verses refers to the commandment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42056" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:11">verse 11</span>. This commandment is the word which, as the breath, proceeds out of the mouth of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="QfLqOeamc21tPQYaJpo1UPn9fPfRzoLtPqStKQ4ocgqQs84upm40VyJnyW-GDKaPt"> If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42058" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:11-14">30:11-14</span> without Paul’s interpretation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42059" data-verses="Romans 10:1">Romans 10</span>, we would not apply these verses to Christ as the Word, much less to Christ as the One who came down from the heavens in incarnation and who, after His death, came out of Hades in His resurrection. In order to have such an understanding of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42060" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:11-14">30:11-14</span>, we need to study Paul’s quotation and interpretation of these verses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42061" data-verses="Romans 10:6-8">Romans 10:6-8</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="KaPp4ZfWpHg0v7Y1Qb8kCxbqDOKJsxBxy1tOnWAiiuOJw9pt8SkBURHfo8rEPsy9m"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42062" data-verses="Romans 10:6">Romans 10:6</span> says, “The righteousness which is out of <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? That is, to bring Christ down.” This is Paul’s interpretation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42063" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:12">Deuteronomy 30:12</span>. Seemingly, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42064" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:12">30:12</span> does not speak of bringing Christ down. However, if we consider this verse carefully, we will see that it does refer to Christ. We have pointed out that the “it” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42065" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:12">verse 12</span> refers to the commandment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42066" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:11">verse 11</span>. What is the commandment of God? The commandment of God is the word. The Bible as a whole reveals that the word is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42067" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>). Christ is the unique word in the universe; He is the real word. The speaking of any other word is a lie. In Paul’s understanding, to bring it (the word) down is to bring Christ down. According to his view of the deeper denotation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42068" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:12">Deuteronomy 30:12</span>, the “it” in this verse denotes the word, the word is the word of God, and the word of God is Christ. Hence, to bring the word down is to bring Christ down. </p>
<p data-content-id="siuEb1E4hdXDA5XnmXLkCVLY257fY6xCEtwz3vAYtntAi-fvxRCT9cMH2C7hoXlbE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42069" data-verses="Romans 10:7">Romans 10:7</span> Paul continues, “Or, Who will descend into the abyss? That is, to bring Christ up from among the dead.” Whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42070" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:13">Deuteronomy 30:13</span> speaks of the sea, Paul in this verse speaks of the abyss. The sea is actually the mouth of the abyss. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42071" data-verses="Revelation 9:1">Revelation 9</span> indicates that Antichrist will come out of the abyss, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42072" data-verses="Revelation 13:1">Revelation 13</span> tells us that Antichrist will come out of the sea. Surely Antichrist will not come from two different places. His coming out of the sea will be his coming out of the abyss. The sea, therefore, is the mouth of the abyss. Paul’s point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42073" data-verses="Romans 10:7">Romans 10:7</span> is that in His resurrection Christ came up from the abyss, came up from among the dead. The words “from among the dead” indicate that to go to the abyss is to die. After Christ died on the cross, He went to the abyss, to the region of death and of the satanic power of darkness. This means that He went to Hades, from which He came forth in His resurrection. </p>

In this picture we see that Christ was incarnated, that He was crucified and buried, that He went to the abyss, that He arose from among the dead, and that in His resurrection He became the breath, the life-giving Spirit. Since Christ is now the breath, He, like the air, is everywhere. When we speak to unbelievers about Christ, we can tell them that Christ is in their mouth and in their heart. </p>

Now we see that these verses show us the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ who has become the life-giving Spirit. Today He is the very breath breathed out by the speaking God. I am happy to tell people that Christ is God incarnated to be a man named Jesus, that He died on the cross for our redemption, that He was buried and that He descended into the abyss, that He was resurrected from Hades, and that in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit as the divine breath. This is the Christ who is now the word of God for us to receive as our life. Furthermore, as the Lord’s quotation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42081" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:3">Deuteronomy 8:3</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42082" data-verses="Matthew 4:4">Matthew 4:4</span> indicates, Christ is also our food.

Christ is the repeated speaking of God; He is God’s respeaking. The whole Bible is a deuteronomy, and the entire Bible is in the book of Deuteronomy. </p>
<p data-content-id="FChdDG-78IE6rFdbn2_0MC9l2mbWLkcg-ySYDFsrKmohTs-o8yAc4uiJQmJFaidm6"> Let us now go on to consider the nine crucial points in this book. <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CRN2Rr3uT4WwQN4_rx_GWaxucRN7iVt30f4bFsRKFjmQxxiPHntbhD4l1B13VcMQy">I. MOSES<br/>AS THE SPOKESMAN OF GOD<br/>WAS LIKE AN AGED, LOVING FATHER<br/>SPEAKING TO HIS CHILDREN<br/>WITH MUCH LOVE AND CONCERN</h2><p data-content-id="P0J_pn6-GENeIJlRSjEf8TUa2k0Hrj537E_ky7Gn5vpJDtrIXB4W5iD70sX9XCz8l"> The first crucial point in Deuteronomy is that Moses as the spokesman of God was like an aged, loving father speaking to his children with much love and concern. This book contains God’s word more than any other book of the Bible—the words of God spoken through this one spokesman. </p>
<p data-content-id="-VrGtVJOlJ_zi6m8_RpxIGu9NUxHBRmrsYjyvDgdos4COJkJShQ_Cct-4GEKFOcPL"> Some may think that there is more of God’s word in Job than in Deuteronomy. This view, however, is not correct. The book of Job does contain God’s word, but it also contains the word of Job and his three friends, who spoke according to human opinion, logic, philosophy, and psychology. Eventually, the young man Elihu spoke what was on God’s heart. In the book of Job God’s word is not as abundant as in the book of Deuteronomy. </p>
<p data-content-id="ps92s5UU-tUZ6sZtqhdpHMiCOCL8-52iRGnmuOV7yiNffdHhpEnje6B3PAz82njth"> Every word spoken by Moses in Deuteronomy was God’s word. Moses might have expressed something of his own feeling, but even this became the word of God. His speaking in Deuteronomy was like Paul’s speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42085" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:1">1 Corinthians 7</span>. In that chapter Paul said, “I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42086" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:25">v. 25</span>). Later, after expressing his opinion, he said, “I think that I also have the Spirit of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42087" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:40">v. 40</span>). Eventually, because Paul was a man constituted with God, his opinion became a part of God’s word as the divine revelation in the New Testament. In his speaking he was one with God; therefore, what he spoke was God’s speaking. The principle is the same with Moses’ speaking in Deuteronomy. Moses spoke for God for forty years, from the age of eighty to the age of one hundred twenty. He was a person not only soaked and saturated with the thought of God but also constituted with the speaking God Himself. So the word that proceeded out of his mouth was the word of God spoken through this one spokesman. <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> </p>

Moses was exercised in love and experienced in God’s governmental administration. </p>

<p data-content-id="cq9xM3YXZ1xSEsXf-aBP_Nl9oniWSkWOkCmfMBL3cafNsBbL--OOKjl-hXBJ5OU6d"> The nine crucial points in the book of Deuteronomy covered in the foregoing message reveal three persons: God, man, and Christ as the word. In these nine points God is manifested, man is exposed, and Christ is presented. </p>
<p data-content-id="YMSJIrSjDE6zdBgUhOqi4UMMuRdXyjpDw0-as5CKmpQ01qt3SZFZud7iRcdsB859W"> According to this book, with God there are love, righteousness, faithfulness, and blessing. God has a heart, hands, a mouth, and eyes. God’s heart is loving, His hands are righteous, and His mouth is faithful. Whatever proceeds out of the mouth of God will be fulfilled. God’s eyes are either for blessing or for cursing. This is the God revealed not only in Deuteronomy but throughout the entire Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="EMIqJsoujbPUp-ABYSxUzW5wYdsj351CJe3rkyqy-QGxuNqdD3aUSko-R1zSJZtYz"> Concerning man, Deuteronomy reveals that man is nothing. We are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing. How, then, could the loving, righteous, faithful, and blessing God expect that we could do something for Him? God does not have such an expectation. As the wise God, He knows that we love ourselves and that we are righteous in our own careless way and for our own benefit. If we think something is for us, we may practice it. This is our kind of righteousness. Furthermore, if we are faithful, we are faithful only in our own interests. Finally, instead of blessing others or giving to others, we like to receive. Therefore, it would be ridiculous to think that this kind of person can carry out God’s eternal purpose or fulfill His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="DEcW6QjZTnEqv6032F-Jj6KMX-Fx1tPMoz_CDVlFmW8rIqxxYvvaPSZAwKWbWAcjC"> The crucial points of the book of Deuteronomy are also the crucial points of Paul’s epistles. Paul’s writings also manifest God as the One who is loving, righteous, and faithful and as <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> the God of blessing. Moreover, Paul’s writings reveal that in ourselves we are nothing. </p>
<p data-content-id="lv9QiwyubS3pAzuAkD7P6WwucQU-rh5VNk_QshgmMh1Zz6ZH3s9Ne8zbAIfXXLpAM"> If Deuteronomy only revealed God as the loving, righteous, faithful, and blessing One and us as those who are nothing, have nothing, and can do nothing, our situation would be hopeless. Deuteronomy, however, also reveals Christ as the word. We cannot do anything for God, but we can receive the word as our life and life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="O_zWsz1z_HTP4vqX5zZIjK5pSXx4hFhJsZyXK7kFx_QSEW2PV2DsWExpd1JZ4Eanb"> The loving, righteous, faithful, and blessing God does not want us to do something for Him. He knows that we are nothing, that we have nothing, and that we can do nothing. His economy, His way, is not to allow us to do something by ourselves but to have us do everything with Christ, by Christ, through Christ, and in Christ. Christ is our life and life supply; therefore, daily we need to feed on Him. Christ is also our faithfulness and the body, the substance, of all our necessities (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42091" data-verses="Colossians 2:17">Col. 2:17</span>). For our supply, Christ is the word, and continually we need to contact Him in the Word and by the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="4o_adcdx4MchGHKq-TB0DTB2MwgSwe67FHjOe7Ynup1Gsj7oUAlM-uG37dOywWjc-"> Do you know what the Bible is? The Bible is not merely a book of history, stories, and teachings. The Bible is the embodiment of Christ. Whatever Christ is and has and whatever Christ has done, is doing, will do, and can do are embodied in the Bible. To read the Bible, therefore, is to participate in Christ. Since the Bible is God’s breath, God’s exhaling, the best way to study the Bible is to breathe it, to inhale it. Let us learn to inhale the breath of the Triune God in the holy Word! </p>
<p data-content-id="o32d_B9yYf_rls_I7-3ejjp4EEahN2r-zJToriTF6vKyAeF-BAm80vbbc64O6F8eo"> We should not think that the word is distant, and we should not ask who will ascend to heaven to bring the word down or who will go across the sea to bring the word to us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42092" data-verses="Deuteronomy 30:11-13">Deut. 30:11-13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42093" data-verses="Romans 10:6-7">Rom. 10:6-7</span>).

<p data-content-id="3LrF5606VsCY9gf-3N1_x6cVl3Vo4dzfHwt1sw7tKWvdNZKrX0E8RjgQOfnrHkEiS"> Christ as the word has already come down in His incarnation, and He has already come out of the abyss, out of Hades, in His resurrection. In resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42096" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>) as the breath for us to breathe. This means that He is not only the word but also the Spirit. When we receive His word, we receive the Spirit, for the words He speaks to us are spirit and life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42097" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="GmeFhSIVaVkDd-zcbE2K7UYKLAg3PnpuxwzEqnoLKPnfduHna8dZKH42UuXxF5m5F"> Learn to inhale the breath of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. If we breathe the processed Triune God, the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit will be with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42098" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="cq9xM3YXZ1xSEsXf-aBP_Nl9oniWSli-kCmfMBL3cafNsBbL--OOKjl-hXBJ5OU6d"> When we take the word by inhaling the Bible, we will be able to do in Christ what we cannot do in ourselves. Consider what Paul says in the book of Philippians, which is a deuteronomy, a respeaking, of Moses’ words. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42099" data-verses="Philippians 4:13">Philippians 4:13</span> Paul could declare, “I can do all things in Him who empowers me.” These “things” are itemized in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42100" data-verses="Philippians 4:8">verse 8</span>, where Paul says, “Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.” Before Paul was in Christ, he could not do any of these things. But in Christ, the One who empowered him, he could do them all. This can also be our experience today. If we would have this experience, we need to enjoy the Divine Trinity by inhaling the Bible, the embodiment of Christ. </p>

Otherwise, we will simply have a kind of retrospection, and this will not be helpful. If we view our past in the presence of the Lord, He may give us new light and new revelation according to what we were in the past. </p>

<p data-content-id="hKkP6IQWsBOJxAVthbTPqT5zuPzaYqYS21Oo3-qkEjOWgRYNKAksKvvbkxpaAdZlY"> From Genesis to Revelation, the entire Bible does three things: it manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ. Before considering further the matter of a review of the past, I would like to give an additional word on these three functions of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="UE-Enm948ehnKiHu7Ph-zsN19IZBZhwjrgWIyvtHI-7Kb7ZpkrQ3Ofx0huwRSmUwh"> First, the Bible shows us what kind of God we have. In the Bible God is manifested as the loving, righteous, and faithful God. Further, in the Bible we see that God is a God who blesses. God’s heart is loving, His hand is righteous, His mouth is faithful, and His eyes are mainly for blessing. This is our God. </p>
<p data-content-id="MADsDIVJ4hJRyWSWp175xIvQXKFIFOJHAxpZOLLTE3SBcJCeXoHVNEpyStSOf3wQj"> Second, the Bible exposes man. The Bible is the only book which shows us man’s real condition. When we come to the Bible, we see ourselves. The Bible exposes us and shows us that we are nothing, that we have nothing, and that we can do nothing. In other words, we are a zero. Actually, this is what God wants, for He does not want us to be anything in ourselves. This is the reason Paul tells us that he has been crucified with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42132" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). In His economy, in His plan and divine arrangement, God wants us to be crucified. This means that He wants us to be nullified, to become a zero. </p>
<p data-content-id="VkY7zigbRwvNbUP94sMJzLcYUICgrFVk8R0BIJn7sSclRjVjS3xqNeYsBJlFc0YuL"> Third, the Bible unveils Christ. Christ is hidden, mysterious, and abstract; no one can know Him. But the Bible unveils Him to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="P0J_pn6-GENeIJlRSjEf8TUa2k0frj5X7E_ky7Gn5vpJDtrIXB4W5iD70sX9XCz8l"> We have pointed out that the entire Bible is implied in the book of Deuteronomy. We may also say that Deuteronomy is an extract of the Bible. The Bible as a whole manifests God, <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> exposes man, and unveils Christ, and the book of Deuteronomy, as an extract of the Bible, also manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="WKFHpf-LfHesebjyjHSgI9rTHCXo33GtYoKp4gXVD-6b0pMFcfGt9JpAkH-ViPVF7"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42133" data-verses="Deuteronomy 2:1-23">Deuteronomy 2:1-23</span> speaks of the wandering from Kadesh- barnea to the crossing over of the brook Zered. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42134" data-verses="Deuteronomy 2:14">Verse 14a</span> says, “The time that we spent in going from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years.” Although Kadesh-barnea was the entry into the good land, God commanded the children of Israel to leave that place and to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2acUbifAqkou12chGKhOehxvf4ZdhnwU1cPDxFhTw7KUxb4JwlIrF4LiRtMpb6vxe">B.

In ourselves we are nothing but flesh and unbelief, which causes us to depart from God. Our flesh and unbelief need to be consumed. It is easy to speak about this, but it takes many years to experience it. For the children of Israel, this took thirty-eight years. On the one hand, these were wasted years; on the other hand, these years were useful in consuming their flesh and unbelief. </p>
<p data-content-id="ffi7UzH07-xYlEI0WESGnbKzKJAnWg-XqxBFYV9dfzkrpfdNfHW5DmFars7tO-FuE"> In these years God’s mercy and blessing were manifested. During the thirty-eight years of wandering in the wilderness, God was very exercised concerning His people. Even though they were unbelieving, He extended His love to them. How did God do this? He did it by showing mercy to them and by blessing them. In the years of wandering, God had mercy on His people and blessed them, even though they were fleshly and full of unbelief. </p>

God’s mercy extends farther than His grace. We may say that mercy is God’s grace reaching farther than grace itself can reach. In other words, when God’s grace extends so far that it reaches us where we are, it becomes mercy. Since His mercy has reached us and since we are now under His mercy, God can bless us. If we realize how pitiful our situation is and how great is the distance between us and God, we will pray like this: “Lord, we need Your mercy because our situation is far away from Your grace. Thank You, Lord, that Your mercy can reach us where we are.” As those who are now under God’s mercy, we should also pray for God’s blessing, saying, “Lord, we do not trust in what we can do. Neither do we trust in our labor. Our trust, Lord, is in Your blessing.” </p>

First, this book shows us Christ as the goal, the aim, prepared for us by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42168" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:7-10">8:7-10</span>). As this goal, Christ is the all- inclusive good land. The good land, the land of Canaan, is a type of the all-inclusive Christ, the Christ who is everything to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="siuEb1E4hdXDA5XnmXLkCVLY257DY4lqEtwz3vAYtntAi-fvxRCT9cMH2C7hoXlbE"> The good land provided whatever the children of Israel needed: water, wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive trees, animals, milk, honey, stones, iron, copper. All these items, most of which are mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42169" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:7-10">8:7-10</span>, are types of Christ. Christ is the water flowing forth in valleys and mountains. He is the wheat, which signifies the incarnated and crucified Christ, and the barley, which signifies the resurrected Christ. The vine typifies Christ as the sacrificing One who cheers God and man; the fig tree, the sweetness and satisfaction of Christ as our life supply; the pomegranate, the abundance and beauty of the life of Christ; the olive tree, Christ as the man filled with the Spirit and anointed with the Spirit as the oil of exultant joy; the animal life, Christ with His redeeming life; milk and honey, Christ in His richness <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> and sweetness; stones, iron, and copper, Christ as the materials for building and fighting. This all-inclusive Christ, the Christ typified by the good land, is our goal. </p>
<p data-content-id="wBybI7rsr0_rbBwia6x6f0DeEsKvgoN9Ofxec0kUIysFXbGRqplaZvkcG3hSb6VIb"> Second, the book of Deuteronomy unveils Christ as the life with the strength and ability to reach the God-appointed goal. Therefore, Christ is both our goal and the way, the life, the strength, and the ability for us to reach the goal. </p>

It is rather easy to realize that the Bible manifests God to us, showing us that God is loving, righteous, and faithful and that He is a blessing God. Since the Bible fully exposes us, when we come to the Bible, it is also easy for us to see what we are and where we are. However, it is not easy for us to realize that the Bible unveils Christ. Many readers of the Bible can see that it manifests God and exposes man but do not see that it unveils Christ. Many Christians, therefore, can apply the manifestation of God and the exposure of man in the Bible, but few can apply the unveiling of Christ in the Word. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ecdzyde5wozVxBzaEEw4w5aNsp4WBp9TYlCAoQi4ypGKrPqTkasXXJy8PzHUhtVzg">To Have Himself Expressed through Man</h2><p data-content-id="58ksnApfX6SredPAN8oDwIVtR217SSi80__CVU5God8y9g-VT2qHWQ74UvqhBtox-"> In His eternal economy God has planned to have Himself expressed, manifested, through man. In order to have such an expression, He created man in His own image. For God to create man in His image means that He created man according to His attributes, especially according to His attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Because human beings were created according to God’s attributes, even though we have become fallen and ruined by sin, we may still have the tendency to love others, to be in the light, to do what is good, to be righteous, and to be excelling. <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> </p>

What is God’s way to do this? God’s way to annul us is to crucify us in Christ and with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42170" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="MADsDIVJ4hJRyWSWp175xIvQXKFMFMtvAxpZOLLTE3SBcJCeXoHVNEpyStSOf3wQj">To Have Man Fulfill His Requirements<br/>by Being One with Christ</h2><p data-content-id="VkY7zigbRwvNbUP94sMJzLcYUICkrHhI8R0BIJn7sSclRjVjS3xqNeYsBJlFc0YuL"> Finally, in His economy God has planned that man should do everything God requires of him. However, God does not want man to do all this by himself; He wants man to do this by Christ, in Christ, with Christ, through Christ, and by being one with Christ. This means that we need to have a spiritual union, an organic union, with Christ. In order that we may enter into such a union with Christ, God wants us not only to believe in Christ but to believe into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42171" data-verses="John 3:15">John 3:15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42172" data-verses="John 3:16">16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42173" data-verses="John 3:18">18</span>). To believe into Christ is to have an organic union with Christ, becoming one spirit with Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42174" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17b</span>). In this union we are joined to Christ, we are one with Him, and we are in Him. Now as those who are one with Him and in Him, we need to do all that God requires by Christ and through Christ. No longer should we live by ourselves and do things by ourselves, but we should live by Christ and do everything by Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="i1u8qFsIrq7JmGSWciiD9KEFi4QGEHAvgefID_l1ORATQAeB6mwG3nAuc08Af5d_m"> Because Paul had a thorough realization of this, he could declare, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” Here Paul was saying, “I have died in Christ through His death, but now He lives in me through His resurrection. His living in me is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit.” For Paul this was a reality, but for many Christians it is not a reality. We all need to have the reality of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42175" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>, realizing that God does not want us to live for Him by ourselves but to live for Him by Christ, in Christ, with Christ, through Christ, and by being one with Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1_zCfLKPRlGnfH9GW7Lhr6U9zsO7urMz4X5FzoV9CIovX2QQEoZnPzmUMp4oGxsTJ">TAKING CHRIST BY INHALING HIM</h2><p data-content-id="90CR_WLqcGLgTqCZs3zA-hhFhptic2Bh_Hc2D_THBZUjiJSnAcwPkJjGmt1KBZ-Ak"> The book of Deuteronomy surely manifests God and exposes us. This book manifests God as a God who is loving in His heart, righteous in His hand, and faithful in His mouth. Furthermore, this book manifests God as the One who blesses us through His eyes. This is the God manifested in Deuteronomy. As we read this book today, we need to realize that it concerns not only the people of Israel but also concerns us. This book exposes us, for it is a photograph of the kind of person we are. The more we are exposed, the more we will realize that we are a hopeless case, that we are nothing and can do nothing, and that it is impossible to fulfill the requirements of the holy, righteous, and faithful God. </p>
<p data-content-id="j1kyDu7e0_p6AyMd0SxBF7RvWVG4ZjbiNQW-KlGI1UoG_I96ycnDgWeMIn_Pb09EK"> After we have been exposed in this way, what should we do? Where can we go for help? Our help is in Christ as the word. In Deuteronomy expressions such as <em>law</em>, <em>commandments</em>, <em>statutes</em>, <em>ordinances</em>, and <em>judgments</em> are synonyms of Christ. Out of God’s mouth have proceeded the law, the commandments, the statutes, the ordinances, and the judgments, and all of these are Christ. Christ is our law and our commandments; He is our statutes, our ordinances, and our judgments. We should simply take Him, keep Him, and hold fast to Him. If we do this, we will enjoy Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="TsD2Zw6QP3h9dQ8LQ-7ufmdUB5OSvk2W3gqhKgrBkBOrOCrNEEhMGJrzPqyP4Y-Xq"> Where is the Christ whom we should take, keep, hold fast, and enjoy? He is in the Bible, for He is God’s unique word. The law, the commandments, the statutes, the ordinances, the judgments—all these are God’s word. This is proved by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42176" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>, which clearly indicates that these expressions are different terms for God’s word. They have all been spoken by God and thus are things which have proceeded out of God’s mouth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42177" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:3">Deut. 8:3</span>). Now we need to see that the words which proceed out of the mouth of God are Christ. Christ is the totality, the aggregate, of God’s word. This is the reason that He is even called the Word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42178" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42179" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, the Word was incarnated, and this incarnated Word is Jesus Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="-VrGtVJOlJ_zi6m8_RpxIGu9NUxXBQCnsYjyvDgdos4COJkJShQ_Cct-4GEKFOcPL"> Concerning the Divine Trinity, there is in the Bible an important principle. This principle is that anything related to the Father, who is the source, is onefold; anything related to the Son, who is the course, is twofold; and anything related to the Spirit, who is the flow, the consummation, the totality, of the Triune God, is threefold. When God’s salvation or any of His attributes reaches us, it reaches us in a threefold way because this reaching involves the three of the Divine Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="ps92s5UU-tUZ6sZtqhdpHMiCOCLs-7SKRGnmuOV7yiNffdHhpEnje6B3PAz82njth"> To understand this principle we need to consider how the Triune God reaches us. The Father reaches us in the Son as the Spirit. The Father is in the Son, and the Son reaches us as the Spirit. This means that when the Spirit reaches us, the Father and the Son also reach us. The Gospel of John reveals that when the Father sent the Son, the Son did not come by Himself but came with the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42187" data-verses="John 8:29">John 8:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42188" data-verses="John 16:32">16:32b</span>). Furthermore, when the Son sent the Spirit, He sent the Spirit as Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42189" data-verses="John 15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42190" data-verses="John 14:26">14:26</span>). Thus, when the Spirit comes, the Father and the Son also come. This is the Triune God reaching us as the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="vW4R0UTrM-FvSTxFY9sTSQ4ofAo6r9KPV6snJnAGmqlGAdeppbhtbNKGPELULO-E-"> Any attribute is onefold with the Father, twofold with the Son, and threefold with the Spirit. Love is God’s greatest attribute. With the Father love is onefold, with the Son it is twofold, and with the Spirit it is threefold. We see this threefoldness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42191" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>, which says, “The grace <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” Love is the source of grace, and grace is the coming forth, the expression, of love. The fellowship is the transmission of the grace which is the embodiment of love. The love of God is in the grace of Christ, and the grace of Christ with the love of God is transmitted in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. From this we see that when something of the Triune God reaches us, it comes to us in a threefold way. </p>
<p data-content-id="IFJP7KvjivPXVzTqHGGVq1blp5I1f2CElXHxPjRnFe25_vI2eXCg28fxNi290DLw0"> Although the book of Deuteronomy often uses the expression “Jehovah your God,” it does not explicitly mention Christ or the Spirit. However, in this book there are synonyms of Christ. These synonyms are the word, the law, the commandments, the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments (the ordinances). Because all these are things spoken by God, in totality they are the word. The law, the commandments, the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments are all the word, and the word is Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42192" data-verses="Romans 10:1">Romans 10</span> Paul interprets the word in Deuteronomy as Christ, referring in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42193" data-verses="Romans 10:8">verse 8</span> to “the word of the faith.” We may think that the word in Deuteronomy is the word of the law, but Paul regards it as the word of the faith. The commandments, the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments are the word, and the word is the word of faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="HKG88Knb6l1ilINwmzTP2HsDHuEubdpN_yKGyn-CQdyIKlGozFDnuUfiDY_X-u5hw"> Since all these are synonyms of Christ, as we are reading Deuteronomy we may want to replace them with the word <em>Christ</em>. To keep the law is to keep Christ. To love the commandment is to love Christ. To receive the testimonies and judgments is to receive Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZoqLZSiJ4X6PMjvu1mAgZ6qIOcWC2zzZU8vKedo3orUBbbngBjgE2iH4WGwc6jGL"> We have pointed out that Deuteronomy does not speak of the Spirit. However, Paul’s interpretation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42194" data-verses="Romans 10:1">Romans 10</span> implies the Spirit; it implies that the Christ whom he is describing is the Spirit. Paul says, “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42195" data-verses="Romans 10:8">v. 8</span>). To be in our mouth and in our heart, this word, which is Christ, must be the Spirit. </p>

Christ is the One <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> who came down from the heavens in incarnation; thus, there is no need for anyone to ascend to the heavens to bring Him down. Christ is also the One who came out of the abyss, out of Hades, in resurrection; thus, there is no need for anyone to descend into the abyss to bring Him up. Where is the Christ who came down from the heavens in incarnation and who came up from the abyss in resurrection, and what kind of Christ is He today? This Christ is in our mouth and in our heart, for He is now the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42197" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). This is the biblical Christ, the Christ unveiled in the interpretation of Deuteronomy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42198" data-verses="Romans 10:1">Romans 10</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jtf7wW0Ddz66MCLgYTyQ5p0XD_6FKH02vgZZXIpncEBLidnfSOk0crQwtZ72KFf7n"> The Christ unveiled in Deuteronomy and Romans is the very God who became incarnated as a man. This One was crucified and resurrected, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, who is the air for us to breathe by calling upon Him. He is everywhere, waiting for people to call upon Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42199" data-verses="Romans 10:12">Romans 10:12</span> tells us that He is “rich to all who call upon Him.” When we first call, we receive Him as life.

This is according to the biblical principle that the children are always included in the father. This is the reason that the covenant made at Horeb included even those Israelites who had not yet been born at that time. In the sight of God, the covenant made at Horeb was actually made with the present new generation of Israel. </p>

They were not to make a covenant with these nations, show them any favor, or make marriage alliances with them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42229" data-verses="Deuteronomy 7:2-3">vv. 2b-3</span>). The nations were to be utterly destroyed without mercy. However, some who read the Bible according to their natural, human thought may not agree with God’s requirement that the nations in the promised land be destroyed.

If all the Canaanites were slain immediately, the beasts of the field would multiply against God’s people. For this reason, the Canaanites, who were useful in keeping the beasts from multiplying, were to be cleared away little by little. </p>
<p data-content-id="TsD2Zw6QP3h9dQ8LQ-7ufmdUB5OavkGu3gqhKgrBkBOrOCrNEEhMGJrzPqyP4Y-Xq"> Moses also charged the people to burn with fire the idols of the nations’ gods, not desiring the silver or gold upon the idols, nor taking it for themselves, lest they be ensnared by it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42238" data-verses="Deuteronomy 7:25">v. 25</span>). Likewise, they were not to bring an abomination into their house, lest they become a cursed thing like it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42239" data-verses="Deuteronomy 7:26">v. 26</span>).

All these are the words that have proceeded out of God’s mouth as God’s breathing, and they all refer to Christ. Therefore, to live by every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God is to live by Christ. </p>

That was His loving discipline. Because He loved the children of Israel, He disciplined them. </p>

<p data-content-id="Z5zttoAdv_D0G8U81HQ8r6zIrKaRvbXnKC6bnlujOUd6UautZ7dPotfVX99EeCyJ2"> The children of Israel were to keep God’s commandments, <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> walk in His ways, and fear Him, for He was bringing them to a good land, a land of waterbrooks, of springs and of fountains, flowing forth in valleys and in mountains, a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive trees with oil, and honey, a land in which they would eat bread without scarcity and in which they would not lack anything, a land whose stones were iron and from whose mountains they could mine copper (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42246" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:7-9">vv. 7-9</span>). The first aspect of the good land mentioned here is its water. Concerning this water, first there were the fountains, which were the source, and then the springs and the brooks, the outflow. The water in the good land flowed forth “in valleys and in mountains.” This indicates that Christ flows in different environments. We have our ups and downs, but Christ flows both in the ups and in the downs. </p>

Moses Charging the Children of Israel<br/>That They Should Know That Jehovah<br/>Their God as a Consuming Fire Would Destroy<br/>the Nations and Drive Them Out from before Them</h2><p data-content-id="BoSFG94NQpQ3j4WsWfaVgo5nRC0IN5cysKkXoeulDhIeWgk_uVRmbLj68nzVHefEH"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42256" data-verses="Deuteronomy 9:3">9:3</span> Moses charged the children of Israel, saying, “Know therefore today that Jehovah your God is the One crossing over before you as a consuming fire; it is He who will destroy them and it is He who will subdue them before you, so that you may dispossess them and destroy them quickly, as Jehovah has said to you.” Although Jehovah is a loving God, here He is revealed as a consuming fire that will destroy the nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="xLIymt5TfDx4T4fWSZu2ADx5i8RUsadZeoBf631Wrt-G7vwunwhRWAKYTR3rapCMb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42257" data-verses="Deuteronomy 9:4-6">verses 4 through 6</span> we see that God would dispossess the nations, not because the children of Israel were righteous but because the nations were wicked. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42258" data-verses="Deuteronomy 9:4">verse 4</span> Moses continued his charge: “Do not say in your heart when Jehovah your God drives them out from before you, Because of my righteousness, Jehovah has brought me in to possess this land. Rather, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah is about to dispossess them from before you.” Therefore, God’s dispossessing the nations was not due to the uprightness of the heart of His people; it was due to the wickedness of the nations. This indicates that even the wickedness of the nations serves God’s purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIesvEgTts9UBkE-38Dk5lBHcSRl90h7H_bxSR30TN69-XOYfu12baR6NuWRNSSyE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42259" data-verses="Deuteronomy 9:7">verse 7</span> Moses went on to say, “Remember, do not forget, <span class="pg" data-page-id="60" id="60">[60]</span> that you made Jehovah your God furious in the wilderness; from the day that you came forth from the land of Egypt up until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Jehovah.” Here Moses reminded the people that their history was a history of rebellion. From the time they came out of Egypt, they had been rebellious continually. The forty years in the wilderness were years of rebellion. </p>
<p data-content-id="yqFCdIWEeZEzn6z64enYMG47A054OFBOHi3mtTV5o9f1HyUDnwmJRcONNm1W8J6V7"> Suppose some among the new generation of the children of Israel said, “This rebellion was not our fault—it was the mistake of our fathers. They were the ones who rebelled and died in the wilderness. That rebellion had nothing to do with us. We are different.” To any who might have spoken in this way, Moses might have replied, “Do not say that you are different from your fathers. You are sons of rebels, and rebels can only bring forth rebels. Just as a serpent cannot bring forth a lamb, so a rebel cannot bring forth one who is obedient. You need to realize that, as sons of rebels, you also are rebels.” </p>

At the very time the Ten Commandments were being given, the rebellious children of Israel were violating the second commandment—the commandment concerning not making an idol and bowing down to it. They made an idol, bowed down to it, and served it. In order to give them an illustration of their history of rebellion, Moses reminded them of what they did at the mount of God. </p>

Let us consider these matters one by one. </p>
<p data-content-id="BoSFG94NQpQ3j4WsWfaVgo5nRC0IN7ICsKkXoeulDhIeWgk_uVRmbLj68nzVHefEH"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42262" data-verses="Deuteronomy 10:12">Verse 12</span> says, “Now, O Israel, what does Jehovah your God ask of you except that you fear Jehovah your God so that you would walk in all His ways and love Him and serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.” First, Moses speaks here of fearing God. We all must have a proper fear of God. However, it seems that today many people, claiming that they are free, do not fear anything or anyone, including God. This lack of fear is terrible; it is the source of all kinds of lawlessness. The young people should recognize that, according to God’s ordination, there is authority in the family, in society, and in the church. In whatever we do, say, and think, we all need to fear God. He is observing us and knows where we are and what we are doing. Eventually, we will reap a harvest from what we sow, and we will eat the fruit of this harvest. </p>
<p data-content-id="xLIymt5TfDx4T4fWSZu2ADx5i8RUsYZteoBf631Wrt-G7vwunwhRWAKYTR3rapCMb"> When we fear God, we will walk in His ways. God’s ways are actually what God is. This means that whatever God is, is a way to us. God is love, and this love is a way in which we should walk. God “loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. Therefore, love the sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42263" data-verses="Deuteronomy 10:18-19">vv. 18b-19</span>). One of God’s ways is to love sojourners, and we should walk in this way of God. Many sojourners are poor, lacking food and clothing. We need to love them and give them what they need. God is also holy, and His holiness is another way for our walk. Furthermore, God “does not regard persons and does not take bribes” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42264" data-verses="Deuteronomy 10:17">v. 17b</span>), and we should take this as a way, not regarding persons and not receiving bribes. God also “executes justice for the orphan and the widow” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42265" data-verses="Deuteronomy 10:18">v. 18a</span>), and we should walk in the way of His justice. </p>
<p data-content-id="r3j8GZpjT_XtkBRgyejlrweN5Xl43Hs29JtDwTzsyHuvknJjd_LAmYLudPgo7VdMu"> The Lord Jesus said, “I am the way” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42266" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>). Since the Lord Jesus is the very God, this word indicates that God Himself is the way. To take what God is as our ways and to walk in these ways is to live God. When we take Christ as our way, we live Him in what He is. He is humble, and we should live in the way of humility. He is the One who always takes <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> the cross, and we should walk in the way of the cross. To take Christ as our way is to live Him, and to live Him is to express Him, to manifest Him, and even to magnify Him. Hence, to walk in God’s ways is to live God, express God, manifest God, and magnify God. We should take God as our way and thus act as He acts. </p>
<p data-content-id="dbzF1Z-0kPtilRgbiq7B_8i43qc-zLD2GhcgWXnFRDHy7lXQsLX6Pt9EzLa4oOL4W"> The vision of the New Jerusalem reveals that we should take God as our unique way. In the New Jerusalem there is just one street, which is of pure gold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42267" data-verses="Revelation 21:21">Rev. 21:21</span>), signifying that the nature of God is our way. The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb and flows in the midst of the street (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42268" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Rev. 22:1</span>). This indicates that God is both our life and our way. We take God as our life, and His life with His nature then becomes the way in which we walk. Today we all should fear God and walk in His ways. </p>
<p data-content-id="QfLqOeamc21tPQYaJpo1UPn9fPf5zqvFPqStKQ4ocgqQs84upm40VyJnyW-GDKaPt"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42269" data-verses="Deuteronomy 10:12">Deuteronomy 10:12</span> Moses also charged the people to love God. This word <em>love</em> implies a great deal. For instance, it implies the matter of affection, which is something very tender. God Himself has set an example of loving by setting His affection on His people. Moses refers to this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42270" data-verses="Deuteronomy 10:14-15">verses 14 and 15</span>. “Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to Jehovah your God, the earth and all that is in it. But on your fathers Jehovah set His affection to love them and to choose their seed after them, that is, you above all the peoples, as it is this day.” Now we should love God by setting our affection on Him. </p>

If the children of Israel would keep the commandment, they would receive the blessing of being strong and of going in to possess the promised land. If we today keep Christ and hold fast to Christ, we will be strengthened and encouraged to go on to possess Christ. In Paul’s words, we will be strengthened to “gain Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42280" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">Phil. 3:8</span>). To possess Christ is to gain Him. The more we contact the Lord and enjoy Him, the more we are strengthened and encouraged to press on to gain Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="RIqag1CUh3igQFjEhVOs6F5M6zBHw-FeM7t6lXhUEaGGbxZcvNb6VnnEDQdXs4Su9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42282" data-verses="Deuteronomy 11:12">Deuteronomy 11:12</span> says, “It is a land which Jehovah your God cares for; always the eyes of Jehovah your God are upon it, from the beginning of the year unto the end of the year.” Literally, the Hebrew word translated “cares for” means “seeks after” (i.e., with interest and care). This verse speaks not merely of God’s affection but of His care. For God’s eyes to be upon us means that we are the object of His care. The reason that God puts His eyes upon us is so that we will hold fast to Christ and enjoy Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="siuEb1E4hdXDA5XnmXLkCVLY257zY6xSEtwz3vAYtntAi-fvxRCT9cMH2C7hoXlbE"> First, God sets His affection upon us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42283" data-verses="Deuteronomy 7:7">7:7</span>), and then He puts His eyes upon us.

Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42284" data-verses="Deuteronomy 11:14-15">verses 14 and 15</span> say, “I will give rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the late rain, so that you may gather your grain and your new wine and your fresh oil. And I will put grass in your field for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.” Because of the rain, they would have a harvest of grain, new wine, and fresh oil. For us as believers in Christ today, the rain is the Spirit. Under the heavenly watering of the Spirit, we are not dry. <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> </p>

And the anger of Jehovah burns against you and He shuts up heaven, so that there is no rain and the earth does not yield its produce and you perish quickly from off the good land which Jehovah is giving to you.” If the children of Israel turned away to other gods, they would no longer be under God’s care. Instead, His anger would burn against them, heaven would be closed to them, and there would be no rain. We need to apply this warning to ourselves today. We should be careful lest our hearts are deceived, and we turn aside to other gods, such as education, success in business, or having our own preferences. If we turn aside from God and serve other gods, we will no longer enjoy the heavenly watering. </p>

They were to do these things that their days, as well as the days of their children, might be multiplied upon the promised land, as long as the days of heaven are above the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42287" data-verses="Deuteronomy 11:21">v. 21</span>). We today should lay Christ on our heart and on our soul. We should bind Christ on our hand as a sign or symbol; that is, we should bind Christ to everything related to us and to everything that is an expression of us. We should also wear Christ as a frontlet between our eyes and teach Christ to others, speaking of Christ wherever we may be. This means that all the time and everywhere we should be occupied with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="FChdDG-78IE6rFdbn2_0MC9l2mb6Lks4-ySYDFsrKmohTs-o8yAc4uiJQmJFaidm6"> The blessing in these verses is the blessing of loving God. The blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42288" data-verses="Deuteronomy 11:14-17">verses 14 through 17</span> is the blessing of rain, which comes to us from God.

We should love Him just as a woman loves the man to whom she is engaged to be married. In Deuteronomy, God was actually “courting” His people, loving them and setting His affection upon them. His people should then love Him in return. Today we need to love the Lord by laying Christ as the word on our heart and on our soul and by binding this word to everything related to us. </p>

These blessings include being strengthened and encouraged to possess the promised land, extending our days in the land under God’s care and in His presence, receiving the heavenly watering, loving the Lord, and holding fast to Him. It is surely a blessing to hold fast to the Lord and to walk in His ways. The greatest of these blessings is the blessing of God’s presence. <span class="pg" data-page-id="69" id="69">[69]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="ecdzyde5wozVxBzaEEw4w5aNspoCBoJrYlCAoQi4ypGKrPqTkasXXJy8PzHUhtVzg"> Thus far, the rehearsal of the law has been somewhat general. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42297" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">Deuteronomy 12</span> we have a very particular matter—the center for the worship of God. This chapter strongly stresses that we must worship God at a definite center, at the place of His choice. We do not have the right to select a place according to our preference. Going to a place of our own choosing is altogether prohibited by God’s word. God’s people must come to the place which God has chosen, the place where He has put His name. Only that place where God puts His name can be the worship center of His people. Furthermore, the proper place of worship is the place of God’s habitation. This means that in the place of His choice God will put His name and He Himself will dwell there. God’s people must go to this place—the place where God dwells and where God’s name is. </p>
<p data-content-id="58ksnApfX6SredPAN8oDwIVtR2lvSTGA0__CVU5God8y9g-VT2qHWQ74UvqhBtox-"> The place chosen by God as a worship center keeps God’s people from being divided.

And you shall tear down their altars and crush their pillars; and their Asherim you shall burn with fire, and the idols of their gods you shall cut down; and you shall destroy their name from that place.” Nothing that was practiced by the nations was to be brought into the worship of God. This principle still applies today. Nevertheless, Catholicism has brought in many of the things practiced by the nations, many things related to the worship of idols. This was the reason that the church in Thyatira, which prefigures the Roman Catholic Church, was very much condemned by the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42301" data-verses="Revelation 2:18-29">Revelation 2:18-29</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="QfLqOeamc21tPQYaJpo1UPn9fPPZzqfNPqStKQ4ocgqQs84upm40VyJnyW-GDKaPt"> In the church life today, we should give up all the ways and practices of the nations.

Here we have three things: the place, the name, and the altar. To the place chosen by God they were to bring their burnt offerings and all their other offerings, and there they were to eat before Jehovah their God, and they, their households, and the Levites who lived with them <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> were to rejoice in all their undertakings, in which Jehovah their God had blessed them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42303" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:6-7">vv. 6-7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42304" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:10-12">10-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42305" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:14-15">14-15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42306" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:17-19">17-19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42307" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:26-28">26-28</span>). They were not to do according to all that they had done before they entered the good land, each man doing what was right in his own eyes; and they were to be careful not to offer up their burnt offerings in every place that they saw (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42308" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42309" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:13">13</span>). To fulfill these requirements was to have a center of worship, as Jerusalem would be later, for the keeping of the oneness among God’s people, avoiding the division caused by man’s preferences. This was good and right in the sight of God. </p>

That was an abomination to God, which He hated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42313" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:31">v. 31</span>). After giving this charge, Moses concluded by saying, “The whole thing that I am commanding you, you shall be certain to do; you shall not add to it, nor shall you take away from it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42314" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:32">v. 32</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="GmeFhSIVaVkDd-zcbE2K7UYKLAw7PnpexwzEqnoLKPnfduHna8dZKH42UuXxF5m5F"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42315" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">Chapter twelve</span> of Deuteronomy corresponds in at least four ways to the revelation in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="cq9xM3YXZ1xSEsXf-aBP_Nl9onyaSlSmkCmfMBL3cafNsBbL--OOKjl-hXBJ5OU6d"> First, both in this chapter and in the New Testament we see that the people of God should always be one. In order to preserve the oneness of the children of Israel, God did not allow each of the twelve tribes to have its own worship center. If each tribe had had its own center for the worship of God, there would have been twelve divisions among God’s people, <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> for each center would have been the ground and the base of a division. In His wisdom, God did not allow His people to have their own choice or preference but required them to take His choice and to come three times a year to the unique worship center, even though travel to that place was inconvenient for many of them. </p>
<p data-content-id="YMSJIrSjDE6zdBgUhOqi4UMMuRNbyi9vw0-as5CKmpQ01qt3SZFZud7iRcdsB859W"> The principle is the same in the New Testament. Regardless of their number, God’s children, the believers in Christ, must be one and have the same center for the worship of God. However, the actual situation among Christians today is division. There are many worship centers, and this has led to divisions. </p>
<p data-content-id="EMIqJsoujbPUp-ABYSxUzW5wYd8v37RiJe3rkyqy-QGxuNqdD3aUSko-R1zSJZtYz"> The divisions among God’s people are the result of having different preferences. Many prefer to have their own way instead of God’s way. Whenever the believers have their own way and their own preference, there will be division. All denominations are according to man’s preferences. The situation in the Lord’s recovery is altogether different. The Lord’s recovery is a matter of coming back to God’s way according to God’s preference. </p>
<p data-content-id="DEcW6QjZTnEqv6032F-Jj6KMX-V91v7ooz_CDVlFmW8rIqxxYvvaPSZAwKWbWAcjC"> Second, both in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42316" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">Deuteronomy 12</span> and in the New Testament, God’s way to keep the oneness of His people is to have a place with His name, the unique name. The name in which we gather for the worship of God is a matter of great importance. We should never think that it is insignificant. Today Christians should be gathered together into only one name, the name of the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42317" data-verses="Matthew 18:20">Matt. 18:20</span>). However, Christians are accustomed to being gathered into other names, such as Baptist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Methodist. To be gathered into these different names is to be divided, because these names are the base of divisions. </p>
<p data-content-id="S0a4xIXIcxogk4t4tVLOKY67z_TEMfuHX4jE-4LvYvklCc8fkITEIANsvjELxuZdV"> According to the type in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42318" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">Deuteronomy 12</span>, it is a serious matter to be gathered into a name other than the unique name of the Lord. To have other names for our worship is an abomination; it is spiritual fornication. We are Christ’s counterpart, His wife. Since we are His counterpart, we should not have a name other than His name. To take another name is to take another person. Just as a wife should bear the name of her husband, not the name of any other man, so we, the believers in Christ, should bear only His name and not any other name. <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> This means that we should not bear any denominational names, such as Baptist or Presbyterian. Rather, like the church in Philadelphia, we should not deny the Lord’s name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42319" data-verses="Revelation 3:8">Rev. 3:8</span>); that is, we should abandon all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ. Not designating ourselves by any title or name, we should simply be gathered together into the name of the Lord. </p>

This chapter emphasizes the requirement that we take God’s choice in the matter of a worship center. Again and again we are told to come to “the place which Jehovah your God will choose” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42327" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:5">vv. 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42328" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42329" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:14">14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42330" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:18">18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42331" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:21">21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42332" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:26">26</span>).

Moses was definite in this matter because it was related to the keeping of the oneness of God’s people. If there had not been such a definite ground for the worship of God, the children of Israel would have been divided. Suppose each of the twelve tribes had had the freedom to choose a place of worship. Surely each tribe would have chosen a place within its own territory, and spontaneously there would have been twelve divisions. This was the reason that the children of Israel were strictly forbidden from making their own choice concerning the place for the worship of God. Moses told them repeatedly that they had to come to the place which God had chosen and worship Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> there. “Unto the place which Jehovah your God will choose out of all your tribes to put His name, unto His habitation, shall you seek, and there shall you go. And there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42334" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Z5zttoAdv_D0G8U81HQ8r6zIrKKJvbn_KC6bnlujOUd6UautZ7dPotfVX99EeCyJ2"> The children of Israel had to come to the place which God had chosen, even though, for many of the tribes, the journey was long and difficult. Three times a year the Israelites had to come with their families to the place of God’s choice. Furthermore, they had to bring their tithes and offerings, including livestock. According to the record in the Old Testament, the unity among the children of Israel was preserved by the act of coming to the worship center chosen by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ab39gx748pUHezRPW4j5tXARUoCNQ19KzvFT078mG4pWQNl-sHNs6yX0HqIPqoPnk"> This keeping of the unity is spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42335" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span>. This psalm is one of the songs of ascent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42336" data-verses="Psalms 120:1">Psa. 120—134</span>), songs that were sung by the children of Israel as they ascended Mount Zion to worship God. As they were making the ascent, they sang, “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42337" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">133:1</span>). This oneness is likened to “the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42338" data-verses="Psalms 133:2">v. 2</span>). This oneness is also likened to “the dew of Hermon” which “descended upon the mountains of Zion” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42339" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">v. 3</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42340" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span> we have a beautiful picture of the oneness of God’s people, the oneness they were to keep by coming to worship God at the place of His choice. </p>

This means that in the Old Testament the chosen ground was an actual physical place. When some hear this, they may ask, “How are we to apply this type to our situation today? Are all the believers supposed to gather in a certain place three times a year?” In answering these questions, we need to realize that the fulfillment of the type in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42342" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">Deuteronomy 12</span> is not a matter of a geographical place—it is a matter of our spirit. <span class="pg" data-page-id="79" id="79">[79]</span> This is proved by putting <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42343" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span> together with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42344" data-verses="John 4:21-23">John 4:21-23</span>.

He said to her, “An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father....An hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit...” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42347" data-verses="John 4:21">vv. 21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42348" data-verses="John 4:23">23</span>).

As long as we are in our spirit, we are in the right place for the worship of God. </p>

We may say that we had an international prayer meeting. Nobody gave a word about the subject of our prayer or about how we should pray. Nevertheless, we prayed in one accord. We could be one in such a way because, in spite of geographical separation, we all meet in the same place—in the Lord’s name, in our spirit, and with the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="vW4R0UTrM-FvSTxFY9sTSQ4ofA4mr_O7V6snJnAGmqlGAdeppbhtbNKGPELULO-E-"> The situation with most Christians today is very different from this. They meet not in oneness but in many different denominations. Even if Christians from various denominations meet together, they may have difficulty praying together. Each may pray in his own denominational tone. If the believers in Christ are to be one, they must give up all denominational <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> things and simply come together in the name of the Lord Jesus, in the spirit, and with the cross. This is the oneness, and this is the proper ground for the worship of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WKFHpf-LfHesebjyjHSgI9rTHCH833GdYoKp4gXVD-6b0pMFcfGt9JpAkH-ViPVF7"> Many Christians are divided by their preferences. Even though they may live in the same city, they will not meet together because they want to have their own preference. In the Lord’s recovery, we care not for our preference but for the Lord’s presence. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42349" data-verses="Matthew 18:20">Matthew 18:20</span> the Lord Jesus said, “Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.” Wherever we may be, in Anaheim or Taipei, in London or Tokyo, we should be gathered into the Lord’s name, and we should meet in our spirit and with the cross. If we all do this, we all will meet in the same place, although we meet in different localities. This one place is the ground of the unique oneness. </p>
<p data-content-id="2acUbifAqkou12chGKhOehxvf4JJhnwk1cPDxFhTw7KUxb4JwlIrF4LiRtMpb6vxe"> In the Lord’s recovery, we have one name and one Spirit. We all meet in the name of Jesus Christ, and we all meet in the mingled spirit—in the regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit. We gather together in this spirit, not in our concept, desire, preference, or choice. Furthermore, in our meeting we should not leave the cross, which is typified by the altar in front of the tabernacle. At the entrance of the church there is the cross, and in order to meet as the church we must experience the cross. The flesh, the self, and the natural man cannot be in the church; they must be crucified. Therefore, we meet in the name of the Lord Jesus, in the mingled spirit, and with the cross. This is the place where we meet, and here we have the oneness which we endeavor to keep in the unique name of the Lord. </p>

<p data-content-id="Z5zttoAdv_D0G8U81HQ8r6zIrKKFvaTXKC6bnlujOUd6UautZ7dPotfVX99EeCyJ2"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42351" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">Deuteronomy 12</span> we have a definite word on keeping the oneness of God’s people. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42352" data-verses="Deuteronomy 13:1">chapter thirteen</span>, which we will consider in this message, we have an even more definite word—a word concerning apostasy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Ab39gx748pUHezRPW4j5tXARUoCBQ0ZmzvFT078mG4pWQNl-sHNs6yX0HqIPqoPnk">R. Moses Charging<br/>the Children of Israel concerning Apostasy</h2><p data-content-id="FChdDG-78IE6rFdbn2_0MC9l2mLWLmIQ-ySYDFsrKmohTs-o8yAc4uiJQmJFaidm6"> What does the word <em>apostasy</em> denote? In the Old Testament, apostasy denotes the giving up of God and the turning away from God to idols. In the New Testament, apostasy denotes the denial of Christ’s deity; it refers to not believing that Christ is God incarnated to be a man. </p>
<p data-content-id="CRN2Rr3uT4WwQN4_rx_GWaxucRd7iXpD0f4bFsRKFjmQxxiPHntbhD4l1B13VcMQy"> The existence of God is a mystery, and the incarnation of God to become a man named Jesus is an even greater mystery. For this reason it is more difficult for people to believe that God became a man than it is for them to believe that there is a God. As we contact people in our preaching of the gospel, we must first make it clear to them that there is a God. We may use the book of Romans to show them that there is a God. Then we need to tell them that this very God was incarnated to become a man. </p>
<p data-content-id="3LrF5606VsCY9gf-3N1_x6cVl3Fs4dzPHwt1sw7tKWvdNZKrX0E8RjgQOfnrHkEiS"> Certain so-called Christians—the Modernists—do not believe that Jesus Christ is God. Instead, they believe that the Lord Jesus was merely a man, that He was a teacher, and that He died as a martyr, not to accomplish redemption. They do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42353" data-verses="1John 4:2-3">1 John 4:2-3</span>). Their belief regarding Christ is heretical, and, by <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> denying that Jesus Christ is both the complete God and a perfect man, they have taken the way of apostasy. </p>
<p data-content-id="GmeFhSIVaVkDd-zcbE2K7UYKLAwzPnp-xwzEqnoLKPnfduHna8dZKH42UuXxF5m5F"> The New Testament deals very strictly with division and with the denial of the teaching that Christ is God incarnated to become a man. “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice! For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42354" data-verses="2John 1:10-11">2 John 10-11</span>). The teaching which the Apostle John refers to here is the teaching that God came through incarnation to be a man. In his gospel this same John says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42355" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42356" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). In his second epistle John shows us that, even at his time, some so-called believers did not confess that Jesus Christ the Lord had come in the flesh. John goes on to tell us that we should not receive nor even greet those who do not bring the teaching that Jesus Christ is God incarnated to be a man. Instead of speaking to those who do not bring this teaching, we should turn away from them. </p>
<p data-content-id="cq9xM3YXZ1xSEsXf-aBP_Nl9onySSliukCmfMBL3cafNsBbL--OOKjl-hXBJ5OU6d"> We need to be clear regarding the difference between teaching apostasy and being wrong in doctrine. Someone may not be correct in his teaching about a certain doctrine, but this does not mean that he is apostate. For example, suppose a brother in the Lord, a genuine believer in Christ, is somewhat mistaken in his teaching regarding the rapture. We may say that he is wrong in doctrine, but we should not say that he is heretical or that he teaches apostasy, for he believes in the divine person of Christ and in His redemptive work. He believes that Jesus Christ is the very God, that He was incarnated to become a man, that He died on the cross for our sins, that He resurrected from among the dead, and that He ascended to the heavens. According to the New Testament, someone becomes apostate, not by teaching incorrectly about the rapture but by giving up the faith that Jesus Christ is God and that He came in the flesh to be a man. Those who do not believe this are apostate. </p>
<p data-content-id="YMSJIrSjDE6zdBgUhOqi4UMMuRNTyiNnw0-as5CKmpQ01qt3SZFZud7iRcdsB859W"> I believe that John and Paul learned a great deal from Moses’ writings, including the definite word in chapters <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> twelve and thirteen of Deuteronomy. Whereas John was definite concerning apostasy, Paul was definite concerning division. </p>
<p data-content-id="EMIqJsoujbPUp-ABYSxUzW5wYd8n37h6Je3rkyqy-QGxuNqdD3aUSko-R1zSJZtYz"> The book of Romans presents a complete picture of God’s salvation, a picture that comprises both the Christian and the church life. The last three chapters of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42357" data-verses="Romans 14:1">Romans, chapters fourteen through sixteen</span>, are on the local church life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42358" data-verses="Romans 14:1">chapters fourteen and fifteen</span> Paul speaks concerning receiving the believers. “Now him who is weak in faith receive, not with a view to passing judgment on reasonings” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42359" data-verses="Romans 14:1">14:1</span>). For a believer to be weak in faith does not mean that he has no faith; it means that, although he has faith, he is weak in faith. Those who are weak in faith we should receive without passing judgment on reasonings. We should receive them without reasoning with them. The one who is weak in faith may eat only vegetables and may judge one day above another (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42360" data-verses="Romans 14:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42361" data-verses="Romans 14:5">5</span>), whereas the one who is strong in faith may believe that he may eat all things and may judge every day alike. Instead of judging the believers with respect to such matters, we should receive them in love, for God has received them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42362" data-verses="Romans 14:3">v. 3</span>). Furthermore, Paul says, “We who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak, and not to please ourselves” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42363" data-verses="Romans 15:1">15:1</span>). Then Paul goes on to say, “Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42364" data-verses="Romans 15:7">v. 7</span>). We should receive the believers not according to the way of eating or the keeping of days but according to Christ, who is the unique center and the all-embracing One. We must receive all kinds of genuine believers, whether they eat herbs or eat meat, whether they keep certain days or consider every day alike. Moreover, we must receive all genuine believers according to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="DEcW6QjZTnEqv6032F-Jj6KMX-V11vLwoz_CDVlFmW8rIqxxYvvaPSZAwKWbWAcjC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42365" data-verses="Romans 14:1-2">Romans 14 and 15</span> Paul is generous, broad-minded, and all-embracing, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42366" data-verses="Romans 16:17">Romans 16:17</span> he is very narrow and strict. “I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.” On the one hand, we need to receive all kinds of genuine believers; on the other hand, we need to be narrow and strict in dealing with divisive ones. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42367" data-verses="Romans 16:17">16:17</span> Paul does not say, “These divisive <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> ones are brothers. We need to receive them and love them.” No, he tells us to keep a watchful eye on them and to turn away from them. To turn away from those who make divisions and causes of falling is to quarantine them. </p>
<p data-content-id="S0a4xIXIcxogk4t4tVLOKY67z_TMMfePX4jE-4LvYvklCc8fkITEIANsvjELxuZdV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42368" data-verses="Romans 16:20">Romans 16:20a</span> Paul says, “Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.” It is significant that this word comes after the word concerning the strict dealing with the divisive ones. If we do not have any discernment but instead love blindly, and if we do not quarantine those who make divisions and causes of falling, Satan will be above us, not under us. But if we quarantine the divisive ones, Satan will be crushed under our feet. </p>

<p data-content-id="58ksnApfX6SredPAN8oDwIVtR2lnSSiM0__CVU5God8y9g-VT2qHWQ74UvqhBtox-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42371" data-verses="Deuteronomy 13:4">verse 4</span> Moses continued, “You shall follow Jehovah your God; and you shall fear Him, keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and hold fast to Him.” Instead of using the expression “hold fast to Him,” we today may speak of laying hold on Christ. We all need to lay hold of, to hold on to, Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="uWFsMCod8S2urRS2PE_j1Xvu6Cr7pqHBoFVssNg95YO_3KXTY4cx6JLXHXOJcvLqO"> The general advices and warnings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42381" data-verses="Deuteronomy 5:32">Deuteronomy 5:32</span>—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42382" data-verses="Deuteronomy 5:32">11:32</span> are rather general, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42383" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">chapters twelve and thirteen</span> they are very specific and definite. According to Moses’ word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42384" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1-2">Deuteronomy 12 and 13</span>, we must avoid division and reject apostasy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42385" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">chapter twelve</span> he charges us to keep the ground of oneness among God’s people, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42386" data-verses="Deuteronomy 13:1">chapter thirteen</span> he is very definite in the condemnation of apostasy. The children of Israel were not allowed to tolerate apostasy even in someone as close as a brother, son, daughter, or wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42387" data-verses="Deuteronomy 13:6-9">13:6-9</span>). Instead of loving the apostates, they were to deal with them severely. God does not tolerate apostasy, and they likewise were not to tolerate it. God hates apostasy and He condemns division. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ffi7UzH07-xYlEI0WESGnbKzKJQ7WhajqxBFYV9dfzkrpfdNfHW5DmFars7tO-FuE">HERESY DAMAGING THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="IFJP7KvjivPXVzTqHGGVq1blp5Yhf0WslXHxPjRnFe25_vI2eXCg28fxNi290DLw0"> Regarding apostasy and division, the Old Testament and the New Testament are the same. The New Testament term for apostasy is <em>heresy</em>. Apostasy and heresy are an insult to the person of God. In the Old Testament the apostates turned away from God and followed idols. That was an insult to God, and He could not tolerate it. In the New Testament the heretics denied that Jesus Christ is God incarnated to become a man. Such a denial is heresy, New Testament apostasy. This heresy damages the person of Christ. In both the Old <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> Testament and the New Testament, God does not tolerate apostasy or heresy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HKG88Knb6l1ilINwmzTP2HsDHuU6bfth_yKGyn-CQdyIKlGozFDnuUfiDY_X-u5hw">DIVISION DAMAGING THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="WKFHpf-LfHesebjyjHSgI9rTHCH033G9YoKp4gXVD-6b0pMFcfGt9JpAkH-ViPVF7"> The Lord also will not tolerate division. The Lord hates division because it destroys His people as His expression. In the Old Testament the children of Israel were God’s people for His corporate expression. In the New Testament the corporate expression of the Lord is the Body of Christ. Whereas heresy insults and damages the person of Christ, division damages the Body of Christ. Division kills the Body of Christ and cuts it into pieces. Because heresy damages the Head and because division kills the Body, the Lord, in both the New Testament and the Old Testament, will never tolerate heresy and division. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2acUbifAqkou12chGKhOehxvf4JBhnwE1cPDxFhTw7KUxb4JwlIrF4LiRtMpb6vxe">TURNING AWAY FROM THE DIVISIVE ONES</h2><p data-content-id="uWFsMCod8S2urRS2PE_j1Xvu6Cr7przhoFVssNg95YO_3KXTY4cx6JLXHXOJcvLqO"> Some saints may feel that instead of rejecting the divisive ones, we should receive them and love them. Being kindhearted, these saints may say, “Yes, this brother is wrong, and he is divisive. But why should we reject him? Should we not cover him with love?” However, the crucial matter here is that we should not tolerate what the Lord does not tolerate. </p>
<p data-content-id="ffi7UzH07-xYlEI0WESGnbKzKJQ7Wg-HqxBFYV9dfzkrpfdNfHW5DmFars7tO-FuE"> Concerning the divisive ones, we need to consider Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42388" data-verses="Romans 16:17">Romans 16:17</span>. “I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42389" data-verses="Romans 14:1-2">Romans 14 and 15</span> indicate that in the matter of receiving the believers Paul is generous, broad-minded, and all-embracing. But after greeting so many saints in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42390" data-verses="Romans 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, he suddenly gives a word of warning about divisive ones, telling us to keep a watchful eye on them and turn away from them. Paul does not tell us to love these ones or to sympathize with them. Instead of sympathizing with those who make divisions and causes of falling, we are charged by Paul to turn away from them. The reason we must turn away from those who cause divisions is <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> that division is extremely serious—it destroys the Body of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="IFJP7KvjivPXVzTqHGGVq1blp5Yhf2CUlXHxPjRnFe25_vI2eXCg28fxNi290DLw0">APOSTASY AND DIVISION DAMAGING GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="HKG88Knb6l1ilINwmzTP2HsDHuU6bdpd_yKGyn-CQdyIKlGozFDnuUfiDY_X-u5hw"> If we get into the depth of the Word, we will understand why Moses speaks a word concerning apostasy immediately after he gives a charge concerning division. It is very significant that Moses deals with division in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42391" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">Deuteronomy 12</span> and with apostasy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42392" data-verses="Deuteronomy 13:1">Deuteronomy 13</span>. These two matters—division and apostasy—go together. Apostasy, or heresy, insults God Himself and damages the person of Christ, and division damages God’s people as His corporate expression. This means that apostasy and division damage the entire economy of God. Because the apostasy and division are so damaging, they must be dealt with. </p>
<p data-content-id="XZoqLZSiJ4X6PMjvu1mAgZ6qIOMCC2zjZU8vKedo3orUBbbngBjgE2iH4WGwc6jGL"> We ourselves may not have anything to do with either division or apostasy, but this does not mean there will not be any problem among the saints regarding these matters. There may be a problem, especially with division. The ones who make divisions are very aggressive in contacting the saints. Furthermore, they may put on a “mask” and try to entice you by appearing to be nice, humble, and loving. Certain divisive ones have been practicing this among us. Suppose someone comes to you in a “humble” manner, saying, “I would like to have some fellowship with you. I have not seen you for a long time, and I miss you very much. How have you been doing?” If someone approaches you in this way, you need to be careful. The apparent kindness, love, and humility of such a person may actually be a mask to hide his divisive intent. We need to beware of the masks of the divisive ones. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ktDpVRWTdq_zO_6vliSWIdRxso8ylKgjfajdxjYlMoR8NGOKQDS3fBxh6czAlGYz1">DISCERNING WHETHER OR NOT<br/>ONE IS SPREADING THE GERMS OF DIVISION</h2><p data-content-id="Jtf7wW0Ddz66MCLgYTyQ5p0XD_qRKH0GvgZZXIpncEBLidnfSOk0crQwtZ72KFf7n"> When some hear this word, they may say, “How can we tell who is divisive and who is not divisive? How can we discern who is wearing a mask and who is not wearing one? Besides, among the divisive ones are there not some who are innocent? Perhaps the one contacting us is innocent.” The <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> person contacting you may be innocent, but, even though he is not knowledgeable, he may nevertheless be carrying the “germs” of division. You may then be infected with these germs, which can multiply very quickly. An innocent one may be full of germs, and, through his contact with you, these germs can be transferred to you and cause you to be infected unconsciously. </p>
<p data-content-id="zxRZG2cJuKKTHaKdh46MdhnyCJiNM0KIAEI8_ho2Kt8oDDc4WfMk2YLltaza-CC7f"> How can you discern whether or not the person contacting you is transmitting to you the germs of division? You need to be very careful in your listening. If the one speaking with you is living and full of life, without any germs of death, the more you talk with him, the more living you will become. The divine life within you will rise higher and higher. However, if the one contacting you is spreading the germs of death, the more you talk with him, the more you will be deadened. The life within you will go down. As long as your contact with this person causes you to be deadened, this is an indication that this one is spreading the germs of death. Such a brother or sister may speak to you in a nice, intimate, loving, and humble way, but as you listen, you inwardly sense that you are going down. By this you can discern whether or not the one contacting you is spreading the germs of death and division. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGn9jyys-FHLkaR1mONVZpP-Uv6u9oLnjzy-iDG1_UQL-_hXwGni1fUNkN8r4agI_"> Furthermore, if you continue to listen to the speaking of such a divisive one, you may find that questions are rising up within you. Questions are often Satan’s way of tempting us. In tempting Eve the serpent said to her, “Hath God said?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42393" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Gen. 3:1</span>). As I pointed out in the Life-study of Genesis, a question mark is shaped like a serpent standing up and asking, “Hath God said?” After talking with a divisive one, you may be filled with questions—questions about the church and about the Lord’s recovery. These questions may cause you to become cold toward the church life. First, you may stop coming to the meetings of the church. Eventually you may stop praying and reading the Word. Instead of being revived by the Lord each morning, you are killed. </p>

This indicates that in order to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="91" id="91">[91]</span> kept away from the germs of death and division, we need to have a proper spiritual diet. Therefore, as we will see in the next message, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42394" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:1">Deuteronomy 14</span> Moses turns from the matters of division and apostasy to the matter of the holy diet. </p>

The mother’s milk is for nourishing, but boiling a kid equals killing. This indicates that in the eyes of God, any living cattle that were not properly killed were not clean for eating, that is, for contacting. </p>
<p data-content-id="MADsDIVJ4hJRyWSWp175xIvQXKVIFMd3AxpZOLLTE3SBcJCeXoHVNEpyStSOf3wQj"> The milk in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42406" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:21">verse 21b</span> typifies the milk of the word of God (the life supply of Christ) used to nourish new believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42407" data-verses="1Peter 2:2">1 Pet. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42408" data-verses="Hebrews 5:12-13">Heb. 5:12-13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42409" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:2">1 Cor. 3:2</span>). Not boiling a kid in its mother’s milk typifies that the milk of the word of God should not be used to kill new believers in Christ. We should use the milk of the word, Christ as the life supply, to nourish newborn Christians, not to kill them. However, many Christian teachers have used the word of God for “boiling” others instead of for feeding them. This is what the divisive ones are doing today. The divisive ones use verses from the Bible to boil, to kill, the new ones. They are boiling the kids in their mothers’ milk. In practicing the new way, we should use Bible verses to nourish the new believers. The word of Christ which produces milk should be used always to nourish the babes in Christ, never to kill them. </p>

<p data-content-id="nrxldDgpSxc2HdKmohxontaOj2opkZ469EbME2etBZFW-57wLk9E3nd77kqlOcx-z"> The statute concerning aid to the needy ones has many items. First, there was to be the aid by the tithes at the end of every three years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42420" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:28-29">14:28-29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42421" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:12-15">26:12-15</span>). God charged the children of Israel to offer Him the tithes yearly. Every year a tithe of their produce was to be offered to God. In addition, there was a further command regarding tithes in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42422" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:28">14:28</span>. “At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your produce for that year and lay it within your gates.” Every three years they were to lay aside another tithe within their gates as a surplus to show the fullness of the rich produce of the good land. <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="6HcZas2R5EDq1gin0ryF9F5xUEPmqU38mJKxZEWSqTtng_-dWlxu8UW1rrlROe9rG">b. To Take Care of the Need of the Levites,<br/>the Sojourners, the Orphans, and the Widows,<br/>That Jehovah Their God Might Bless Them More</h2><p data-content-id="RIqag1CUh3igQFjEhVOs6F5M6zRzw-1GM7t6lXhUEaGGbxZcvNb6VnnEDQdXs4Su9"> What was laid within their gates was to be for the needy. “And the Levite shall come—for he has no portion nor inheritance with you—as well as the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow who are within your gates; and they shall eat and be satisfied, so that Jehovah your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42423" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:29">14:29</span>). The Levites, who had no job or other source of income but who lived on God, serving Him full-time, were to be taken care of in this way. There was also to be provision for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow. Today we should also care for the needy ones among us. Under the Lord’s covering, I can testify that I cannot bear to see that any saints are lacking what they need to live properly; I have the feeling that I must do something to meet their need. In the Lord’s recovery, we need to care for the full-timers and the other needy ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="siuEb1E4hdXDA5XnmXLkCVLY25rHY6BaEtwz3vAYtntAi-fvxRCT9cMH2C7hoXlbE"> Those who gave the tithes of their produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, could say before Jehovah their God, “I have removed what is holy from out of my house, and I have also given it to the Levite and the sojourner, to the orphan and the widow, according to Your whole commandment, which You have commanded me; I have not transgressed any of Your commandments and I have not forgotten them. I have not eaten any of it in my sorrow, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor have I given any of it to the dead. I have listened to the voice of Jehovah my God; I have done according to all that You have commanded me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42424" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:13-14">26:13-14</span>). Even if the one who gave the tithe was in sorrow or had suffering, he did not eat for his happiness what was reserved for the needy. Thus, the giving one could go on to pray, “Look down from Your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel, and the ground which You have given to us, as You swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42425" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:15">v. 15</span>). This indicates that if we, for the sake of God, take care of the needy ones, God will surely bless our labor and undertakings. This blessing will be a return to us <span class="pg" data-page-id="97" id="97">[97]</span> from God. Apparently we are giving; actually we are receiving. Nevertheless, to give is much more blessed than to receive. </p>

The reason a Hebrew servant was to be set free after six years of service is that God is a God of rest. After doing the work of creation for six days, He rested on the seventh day (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42449" data-verses="Genesis 2:2">Gen. 2:2</span>). The people created by God were also to work for six days and rest on the seventh day. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42450" data-verses="Deuteronomy 15:12">Deuteronomy 15:12</span>, the principle of resting after a period of work is applied to a Hebrew servant.

This is an excellent type of us as slaves of the Lord Jesus. We love Him, we love His family, and, not wanting to leave Him, we tell Him that we want to remain in His service forever. Whenever we make such a free-will offering to the Lord Jesus, He will never reject it but will always accept it. Then He will run an “awl” through our “ear,” representing us, and into the “door,” representing God. The ear thus becomes one with the door, and there is much traffic between the ear and the door. From that time onward, our relationship with the Lord is one in which we have a listening ear. We are at the door, waiting to hear the voice of the Master and to serve Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="yqFCdIWEeZEzn6z64enYMG47A0pMOFBeHi3mtTV5o9f1HyUDnwmJRcONNm1W8J6V7"> All the full-timers have had their ears “awled” by the Lord. We may say that they have had their ears “nailed” to the doorpost. Now there is a hole in their ear. This hole is not for an earring (something for beautification) but for service, which requires a hearing ear. If we have a hearing ear, nothing will keep us away from our Master. </p>
<p data-content-id="8NM0lN8hD4vu0iaRhL4MYDa2JYkP4_FC5InsnOLYBQ5dOJQ_V4BaxScrZMJYNU0m_"> As the Slave of God, the Lord Jesus had His ear run through with an awl (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42453" data-verses="Isaiah 50:5">Isa. 50:5</span>). On His ear there was a hole, so between Him and God the Father, whom He served, there <span class="pg" data-page-id="103" id="103">[103]</span> was a thorough traffic.

<p data-content-id="0H_aLtQ9PYo7ZZkSDEI3cJvBs0tm9FeBqKH0ZJVhI04pU36vT2G0S4v6wW4IKGZbS"> For a Hebrew servant to be his master’s servant forever meant that he gave up his liberty and no longer had any freedom. At the end of six years, the servant was free to go, but once he decided to stay and had his ear run through with an awl, he would never again have the freedom to leave. I can testify that, as a servant of the Lord, I consider myself as having no freedom and no future. In a very real sense, I am “finished,” for my ear has been nailed to the doorpost of my God. I hope that the young ones will have this kind of feeling about themselves and that they will say, “I belong to the Lord Jesus forever.

The masters might have felt that they had lost both the cost of buying the servant and the servant himself, and this could have caused them to be sorrowful. Therefore, Moses, an old man who surely knew human nature, charged the masters not to view the release of a servant as a hardship. They were not to be greedy or sad but happy, realizing that the servant had saved them much in wages and that Jehovah their God would bless them. </p>

Contrary to what we might think, God did not allow an Israelite to send an <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> escaped slave back to his master. Rather, the one to whom the slave escaped was to help the slave. </p>

It seems that, according to God’s arrangement, a slave had a right to escape and then to dwell in the place of his choice. This reveals what kind of heart our God has. God’s heart is always willing to forgive and to release, not to condemn. This indicates that we should have the heart to forgive our brothers in the Lord. </p>

An Israelite could make a foreigner pay interest but was not to make a brother do so, in order that Jehovah his God might bless him in all his undertakings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42459" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:20">v. 20</span>). This was a matter involving not only an Israelite and his brother but also God, who is above all and sees everything. </p>

The Hebrew word for “livelihood” here is <em>nephesh,</em> which means soul, life. In this verse we see that an Israelite was not allowed to take one’s handmill or upper millstone as a pledge, for that would be to take one’s livelihood as a pledge. God would not tolerate this. Even if a borrower had nothing other than a handmill or upper millstone to give as a pledge, the lender was not to take such a pledge. Instead, he was to make the loan without a pledge. This statute reveals that God is loving and full of care. <span class="pg" data-page-id="105" id="105">[105]</span> </p>

They had to give God one-tenth of their income from the field or from their cattle. </p>

Here we see that the children of Israel did not have the right to offer their tithes at any place of their choice. Rather, they were to bring the tithes to the place where Jehovah would choose to set His name and to have His habitation. This means that the tithes were to be offered at the unique center for the worship of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> </p>

This means that the tithes were to be enjoyed with God. To eat “before Jehovah” is to eat with Him. The children of Israel offered the tithes to God and then they enjoyed before God and with God what they had offered to God. This indicates that God wants us to enjoy His Christ with Him at His chosen place. Whenever we come together in the Lord’s name, in the spirit, and with the cross (the altar), we meet with God through Christ. We come together to enjoy Christ with God. </p>

This verse shows us that God does not forget the Levites, those who serve Him full-time and who, not having inheritance and employment, live on Him. Therefore, in offering the tithes to God and in enjoying the tithes with God, God’s people were to include the Levites. They were to enjoy the tithes with the Levites who lived with them. </p>

Suppose an Israelite had said, “There is no need for me to bring this one-tenth to the place God has chosen. I can enjoy it at home with the Levites in my town.” To have such an attitude is to offend God and not to fear Him. The people had to give their tithes exactly according to God’s regulations. If they did this, they would learn to fear God always. </p>

Here we see that the children of Israel could not use for their own purpose the firstborn of the herd and of the flock, which were to be sanctified to God. Because the firstborn of the ox belonged to God, it could not be used for work. Likewise, because the firstborn of the sheep belonged to God, it could not be shorn. The people had no right to use what had been sanctified to God. </p>

Such animals could be eaten, except for the blood, in the place where the people lived (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42494" data-verses="Deuteronomy 15:22-23">15:22-23</span>).

These <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> festivals respectively signify the feasts of the redemption of Christ, the producing of the church, and the coming kingdom.

An Asherah was an image of a female deity, and the altar signifies the cross. Catholicism has brought in certain pagan things and added them to the cross to produce a mixture.

The worldly people, although created by God, have forgotten Him and have given Him up. They are busy in the world taking care of themselves and their own interests, leaving God hungry and thirsty, with hardly anyone willing to serve Him full-time. God is eager for the people created by Him to come back to Him. He is happy when some who have returned to Him promise to serve Him full-time. God is waiting for more of His people to do this. </p>

The portions of Deuteronomy which deal with the divine government are the word of God, not merely the word of Moses. We need to study all these portions in order to know God’s mind and to know what He is thinking. God knows man and man’s need, condition, and situation. Therefore, whatever God speaks regarding man is the final word. </p>

Theocracy is government by God according to what He is. In the church life today, we exercise neither autocracy, which is a kind of dictatorship, nor democracy, which is according to the opinion of the people. Instead, we honor God’s authority as our government, and thus the government in the church is a theocracy. </p>

Any government that does not practice justice will not last. A strong government is one that is established upon justice. In such a government everything is fair, just, and righteous. </p>

To keep justice is to pursue righteousness. By pursuing righteousness the children of Israel would be able to live long on the land God had given them. Without keeping justice and pursuing righteousness, they could not have lived longer in the good land. </p>

First, the priest investigated the case by going to God and staying with God. Second, in the presence of God, the priest would consider God’s holy word. Third, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42539" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:8">33:8</span> indicates, the Levitical priests had the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim, which provided instant enlightenment. (For the details regarding the Urim and Thummim, please see the life-study on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42540" data-verses="Exodus 28:15-21">Exodus 28:15-21</span>.) Eventually, through the presence of God, the word of God, and the Urim and Thummim, the priest would gain a clear understanding of the divine judgment and then pass on this judgment to the presiding judge. The judge would then make a judgment according to what the priest had received from God and passed on to him. The judgment of the case, therefore, came through man, but it was of God and according to God. It was truly a matter of theocracy. </p>
<p data-content-id="GmeFhSIVaVkDd-zcbE2K7UYKLAwnPnZ2xwzEqnoLKPnfduHna8dZKH42UuXxF5m5F"> The government in the church should be neither autocratic nor democratic but theocratic. It should be like the government in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42541" data-verses="Deuteronomy 17:8-9">17:8 and 9</span>. All the saints are priests, but the elders are the leading priests. As such priests, they should stay in the Lord’s presence with God’s holy word and with today’s breastplate—the mingled spirit with Christ and the church. As they remain in the Lord’s presence with the word and the mingled spirit for the church, they will receive an understanding that is according to the Lord’s thought, and this will become a decision as a kind of judgment. The elders should then administrate according to this divine judgment. Thus the elders function first as the leading priests and then as the administrators. </p>

Actually, God does not like to see that there is a king among His people. He Himself is the King; therefore, for His people to want a king means that they want someone to replace God. But God as our King should not be replaced and cannot be replaced. Yet, according to our fallen human nature, we like to have a king. This was the situation during the time of Samuel. The people wanted a king, even though this was offensive to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42546" data-verses="1Samuel 8:4-22">1 Sam. 8:4-22</span>). Because of their insistence, God gave them a king—Saul. Saul was not a good king, for he was not a king who was according to God’s heart. Later God exercised His own choice and raised up David to replace Saul. David was a king not according to God’s preference but according to God’s heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42547" data-verses="1Samuel 13:14">1 Sam. 13:14</span>). In the sight of God David was the most pleasant king. </p>

Have you ever heard anyone attribute longevity to being fair, righteous, and just? In this verse living long upon the land is clearly related to having full and righteous weights and measures. </p>
<p data-content-id="i1u8qFsIrq7JmGSWciiD9KEFi4A2EHQngefID_l1ORATQAeB6mwG3nAuc08Af5d_m"> Those who have differing weights and measures actually <span class="pg" data-page-id="135" id="135">[135]</span> have differing scales. In the church life today, we may have differing scales—one scale for measuring others and a different scale for measuring ourselves. Having differing scales, we may condemn a certain thing in others but justify the same thing in ourselves. Certain saints may use one scale to weigh the actions of the elders and the co-workers but a different scale in weighing their own actions. Because they weigh the elders and co-workers in one scale and themselves in a different scale, they find fault with the elders and co-workers but vindicate themselves. </p>

Those who did these things were an abomination to Jehovah, and on account of these abominations, Jehovah God dispossessed the nations from before the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42651" data-verses="Deuteronomy 18:12">v. 12</span>). Jehovah did not allow the children of Israel to practice these abominations. </p>
<p data-content-id="zxRZG2cJuKKTHaKdh46MdhnyCJSBM06gAEI8_ho2Kt8oDDc4WfMk2YLltaza-CC7f"> Among the children of Israel, the performing of divinations was prohibited. Divination is the attempt to learn something about the future in a supernatural way. People try to learn of the future in this way because they are concerned about their security. God created us in His own image with the intention that we would express Him. He even entrusted us with the authority to rule over all other creatures. Therefore, as those created by God, we were given a very high position. Having such a position, Adam was not worried about security. However, human beings have become fallen, and now all fallen people are worried about their security. Fallen human beings are also concerned about such matters as longevity, peace, and well-being. Everyone wants to have a peaceful life, a life without trouble. Those who seek security, longevity, peace, and well-being may engage in the performing of divinations in order to learn something about the future. Such people may seek to contact the enemy’s evil kingdom, which is full of demons and evil spirits. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGn9jyys-FHLkaR1mONVZpP-UvKi9oL3jzy-iDG1_UQL-_hXwGni1fUNkN8r4agI_"> Divination is actually a false foretelling of the future by demons and evil spirits. Those who are worried about their future, especially about their security, and who turn to the practice of divination are usually deceived by false promises <span class="pg" data-page-id="140" id="140">[140]</span> made by demons and evil spirits. The demons and the evil spirits, who often hide behind the desire for security, longevity, peace, and well-being, may give to those who practice divination false information regarding the future. </p>
<p data-content-id="bdj2gqF4PGk_dJln8yM8t7OkNdiXlxhFv7BBqJLx_5mzbE1Yfsb3tnZUyiTIjk3HP"> The practicing of soothsaying was also prohibited. Soothsaying, like divination, is a matter of foretelling future events. Those who practice soothsaying may speak pleasing words of comfort, consolation, and encouragement. The ones who want to hear this kind of speaking about their future may go to one who practices soothsaying. </p>
<p data-content-id="qIesvEgTts9UBkE-38Dk5lBHcSxF90RjH_bxSR30TN69-XOYfu12baR6NuWRNSSyE"> The children of Israel were not allowed to interpret omens. An omen is a sign. Someone who was worried about his business might consult a person who could give him an omen or a sign to indicate that in the coming year his business would flourish. This interpreting of omens was prohibited. </p>
<p data-content-id="yqFCdIWEeZEzn6z64enYMG47A0ZYOFxWHi3mtTV5o9f1HyUDnwmJRcONNm1W8J6V7"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42652" data-verses="Deuteronomy 18:10-11">verses 10 and 11</span>, the employing of sorcery and the casting of spells were also prohibited. Sorcery is a kind of witchcraft used to deceive people. The casting of spells is a matter of having a curse put on someone. </p>
<p data-content-id="8NM0lN8hD4vu0iaRhL4MYDa2JYUb4_165InsnOLYBQ5dOJQ_V4BaxScrZMJYNU0m_"> Finally, there was not to be found among the children of Israel anyone who consulted a spirit of the dead or a familiar spirit or who inquired of the dead.

This indicates that Christ as the coming Prophet would be human as well as divine, that He would be God incarnated to <span class="pg" data-page-id="141" id="141">[141]</span> be a man, the God-man. As God, Christ could not be from among the Jews as a brother, but as the incarnated One, the One who has put on human nature and who was a Jew, Christ was from among His brothers. </p>

They had told Moses that they could not bear to hear God’s voice. They wanted a middleman, one who could hear God’s word and pass it on to them. Because they wanted a prophet, Moses promised that God would fulfill their desire for a prophet. </p>

We should not only pray but also fight. Actually, we are not the ones fighting, for God goes with us and fights for us.

Literally, the Hebrew rendered “is forfeited to the sanctuary” means “be sanctified.” Darby’s note on this verse says, “Lit. ‘hallowed,’ or ‘set apart to God,’ i.e. appropriated to the sanctuary as a forfeit.” If an Israelite sowed two kinds of seed in his vineyard, neither the produce of that seed nor the increase of the vineyard would be his. He was not allowed to keep them for himself. Instead, this produce and increase, having been forfeited, would be God’s. This means that his labor in sowing his vineyard with two kinds of seed would be in vain. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42726" data-verses="Leviticus 11:1">Leviticus 11</span>, an ox is a clean animal, but a donkey is unclean. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42727" data-verses="Deuteronomy 22:10">Deuteronomy 22:10</span> an ox typifies a believer and a donkey typifies an unbeliever. Believers and unbelievers are diverse peoples. They should not be yoked together because of the believers’ divine nature and holy standing. This should be applied to all manner of intimate relationships between believers and unbelievers, including marriage and business. If a brother marries an unbelieving woman or if a sister marries an unbelieving man, there will be an unequal yoking of a believer and an unbeliever, and it will be difficult for them to live together. If a believer has an unbeliever as a business partner, the believer may have problems. For instance, the unbeliever may want to do certain things that are dishonest. As believers, we should not be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for this is a mixture, and every kind of mixture is abominable in the eyes of God. </p>

An Israelite Coming Upon a Bird’s Nest<br/>and Not Taking the Mother with the Young</h2><p data-content-id="cq9xM3YXZ1xSEsXf-aBP_Nl9onCSSlC-kCmfMBL3cafNsBbL--OOKjl-hXBJ5OU6d"> If an Israelite came upon a bird’s nest in the way, in any tree or on the ground, and the mother was sitting upon the young birds or eggs, he was not to take the mother with the young (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42733" data-verses="Deuteronomy 22:6">22:6</span>). He had to let the mother go, but the young he could take for himself, that it might go well with him and that he might extend his days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42734" data-verses="Deuteronomy 22:7">v. 7</span>). This indicates that he was to spare the producing animal. Even a matter such as this is related to blessing, indicated by the words “it may go well with you,” and longevity, indicated by the words “that you may extend your days.” If an Israelite wanted a blessed, healthy, and long life, he had to fulfill the requirement concerning the sparing of a producing animal. Some brothers and sisters are like mother birds, and we need to take care of them. </p>

It would not have been fair for an ox to be muzzled and thus unable to eat while it was working. Certain brothers are like producing oxen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42736" data-verses="1Corinthians 9:9">1 Cor. 9:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42737" data-verses="1Timothy 5:18">1 Tim. 5:18</span>). If a brother produces something for us, we must not “muzzle” him. In relation to the brothers and sisters today, we should keep the statute concerning sparing the producing animals. </p>

Concerning Keeping the Camp Clean</h2><p data-content-id="hKkP6IQWsBOJxAVthbTPqT5zuPTGYp4S21Oo3-qkEjOWgRYNKAksKvvbkxpaAdZlY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42756" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:9-14">Deuteronomy 23:9-14</span> speaks concerning keeping the camp clean. When the children of Israel as a camp went forth against their enemies, they were to keep themselves from every evil thing, especially from the discharges of their physical bodies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42757" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:9-13">vv. 9-13</span>). Jehovah their God walked in the midst of their camp to rescue them and deliver up their enemies before them; therefore their camp was to be holy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42758" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:14">v. 14</span>). This indicates that in the church as God’s fighting camp today everything must be clean. </p>
<p data-content-id="UE-Enm948ehnKiHu7Ph-zsN19I5dZiQjrgWIyvtHI-7Kb7ZpkrQ3Ofx0huwRSmUwh"> A camp is a group of people who have been formed into an army for fighting. If the camp is not clean and orderly, how can the army fight? Whether or not an army can fight depends on how those in the army take care of the camp. A clean, orderly camp is a sign of a strong, disciplined army. As the army of God today, we must keep our camp clean and in a good order. This is our training and our discipline, which enable us to fight. </p>

The payment for a harlot and the price for a dog were not to be brought into the house of Jehovah for a <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> vow, for both of them were an abomination to Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42760" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:18">v. 18</span>). Here the term <em>dog</em> refers to a male prostitute or sodomite. </p>

If they had put grapes into a vessel, they would have been greedy. Likewise, when they went into their neighbor’s standing grain, they could pluck some ears with their hand, but they were not to wield a sickle upon their neighbor’s standing grain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42762" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:25">v. 25</span>). Wielding a sickle would also have been a sign that they were greedy. These verses indicate that we should care only for our need and should not be greedy. We need to learn to be restricted in any kind of seeking. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="i1u8qFsIrq7JmGSWciiD9KEFi4weEHw3gefID_l1ORATQAeB6mwG3nAuc08Af5d_m">U. Concerning a Man Taking a New Wife</h2><p data-content-id="1_zCfLKPRlGnfH9GW7Lhr6U9zsujur8r4X5FzoV9CIovX2QQEoZnPzmUMp4oGxsTJ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42763" data-verses="Deuteronomy 24:5">24:5</span> we have a word concerning a man taking a new wife. When a man took a new wife, he was not to go out with the army, nor was he to be charged with any duty. He was to be free at home for one year, and he was to make his wife happy. The concern shown here is very human. </p>
<p data-content-id="90CR_WLqcGLgTqCZs3zA-hhFhpN6c2xp_Hc2D_THBZUjiJSnAcwPkJjGmt1KBZ-Ak"> God likes to see a male and a female come together in marriage for reproduction. Marriage is for human existence and human reproduction. Therefore, we must honor marriage and not damage it. God encourages us to get married, and any way in which we might damage marriage is hateful to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="j1kyDu7e0_p6AyMd0SxBF7RvWVmgZjrqNQW-KlGI1UoG_I96ycnDgWeMIn_Pb09EK"> God is happy to see the young people coming together in marriage, and He is even more happy to see them reproduce. Immediately after God created man, He charged man to be “fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42764" data-verses="Genesis 1:28">Gen. 1:28</span>), that is, to fill the earth with human beings. This indicates that we need to be married properly according to God’s purpose and for God’s purpose. God’s purpose in marriage is to use us to maintain the existence of mankind on earth. Even today, at the end of the age, God still needs more people. Some married couples do not want to have children because they do not want to be bothered. It is not according to God’s way for a <span class="pg" data-page-id="163" id="163">[163]</span> married couple not to have children. God’s way is that human beings get married and then reproduce. </p>
<p data-content-id="TsD2Zw6QP3h9dQ8LQ-7ufmdUB5uKvkGu3gqhKgrBkBOrOCrNEEhMGJrzPqyP4Y-Xq"> God also wants us to be reproductive in the church life through the preaching of the gospel that sinners might be saved and regenerated. If we are spiritually barren, this is a shame in the sight of God. God hates barrenness and fruitlessness. But He is happy to see us becoming spiritually productive and fruitful. </p>

Concerning a Case of Leprosy</h2><p data-content-id="6HcZas2R5EDq1gin0ryF9F5xUE_6qU3smJKxZEWSqTtng_-dWlxu8UW1rrlROe9rG"> Concerning a case of leprosy, the people were to carefully keep what the Levitical priests instructed them, as God commanded the priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42765" data-verses="Deuteronomy 24:8">Deut. 24:8</span>). The children of Israel were to remember what Jehovah their God did to Miriam on the way when they came out of Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42766" data-verses="Deuteronomy 24:9">v. 9</span>). (For details regarding the case of Miriam, please see the life-study on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42767" data-verses="Numbers 12:1">Numbers 12</span>.) </p>

Not Forgetting to Blot Out<br/>the Memory of Amalek</h2><p data-content-id="siuEb1E4hdXDA5XnmXLkCVLY25bbY6BKEtwz3vAYtntAi-fvxRCT9cMH2C7hoXlbE"> The children of Israel were to remember what Amalek did to them on the way when they came out of Egypt, striking all their worn-out ones who were at the rear, when they were faint and weary (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42768" data-verses="Deuteronomy 25:17-18">Deut. 25:17-18</span>). Amalek did not fear God and was the greatest enemy of God’s people, frustrating them in taking God’s way and attacking the younger and weaker ones and those who were worn-out and unable to go further on the journey. Therefore, when Jehovah their God gave the children of Israel rest from all their enemies and gave to them the God-promised land as an inheritance, they were to blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven, and they were not to forget this (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42769" data-verses="Deuteronomy 25:19">v. 19</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="wBybI7rsr0_rbBwia6x6f0DeEsq3gq5ZOfxec0kUIysFXbGRqplaZvkcG3hSb6VIb"> Amalek typifies our flesh. The thing that is most opposed to God’s way is our flesh. Therefore, the flesh must be dealt with thoroughly. This is the spiritual significance of the requirement to blot out the memory of Amalek. </p>

A Concluding Word of This Section<br/>to the Children of Israel</h2><p data-content-id="mgCP-c2b1uB9xk3EJB6q3lF0RfHNz5JQjeC1Ix7xtzjforWGXt3_iLRaKhehXXjpx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42770" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:16-19">26:16-19</span> we have a concluding word of this section to <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> the children of Israel. Moses used thirteen chapters, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42771" data-verses="Deuteronomy 14:1">chapter fourteen</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42772" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span>, to cover the rehearsal of the law with certain developments. That day—the day Moses had finished the rehearsal of the law—Jehovah their God was commanding the children of Israel to do these statutes and judgments, and they were to keep them and do them with all their heart and with all their soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42773" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:16">v. 16</span>). On that day they had declared Jehovah to be their God and had also declared that they would walk in His ways and keep His statutes, His commandments, and His judgments and listen to His voice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42774" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:17">v. 17</span>). That declaration was actually a vow. Furthermore, on that day Jehovah had declared them to be a people for His personal treasure, even as He promised them, and had declared that they would keep all His commandments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42775" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:18">v. 18</span>). Here we see that the condition for being God’s personal treasure is that the people keep all His commandments. God also declared that He would set the children of Israel high above all the nations, for praise, for a name, and for honor, and that they would be a holy people to Jehovah their God as He had spoken (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42776" data-verses="Deuteronomy 26:19">v. 19</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Z5zttoAdv_D0G8U81HQ8r6zIrK6BvbXnKC6bnlujOUd6UautZ7dPotfVX99EeCyJ2">Y. The Governing Principles<br/>of One’s Behavior Implied in This Section</h2><p data-content-id="Ab39gx748pUHezRPW4j5tXARUoyFQ1NSzvFT078mG4pWQNl-sHNs6yX0HqIPqoPnk"> In this section on the rehearsal of the law, five governing principles of our behavior are implied: (1) toward God, to be sanctified and fearing; (2) toward oneself, to be righteous and pure; (3) toward others, to be kind and generous; (4) toward animals, to be sparing and sympathetic; and (5) toward the devil, to be rejecting and separated. </p>
<p data-content-id="FChdDG-78IE6rFdbn2_0MC9l2m7SLksY-ySYDFsrKmohTs-o8yAc4uiJQmJFaidm6"> These five principles govern our behavior in five directions—toward God, toward ourselves, toward others, toward animals, and toward the devil. Toward God we should always be sanctified and fearing. We should fear God and want to be separated, sanctified, unto Him as a holy people. Toward ourselves we should be righteous and pure. This means that we should be just and strict, not having any looseness. Whereas we should be strict with ourselves, toward others we should be kind and generous, always willing to give. Toward animals we should be sparing and sympathetic. If we can <span class="pg" data-page-id="165" id="165">[165]</span> sympathize with animals, we can, and will, sympathize with people. We may have the assurance that those who are kind to animals will also be kind to us. However, some people hate animals and mistreat them. When such people meet a dog or a cat, they may treat it in a very mean way. I will always stay away from this kind of person, for I realize that one who can mistreat animals can also mistreat people. Finally, toward the devil we should be rejecting and separated. We must reject the enemy, Satan, and separate ourselves from him. I believe that if we practice these principles by the divine life, we will become a different kind of person. </p>

The stones were to be coated with plaster (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42783" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:2">v. 2b</span>), and upon them the people were to write very clearly “all the words of this law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42784" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:3">vv. 3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42785" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:8">8</span>).

Building to Jehovah Their God<br/>an Altar of Stones and Offering Up<br/>Burnt Offerings upon It to Him,<br/>Sacrificing Peace Offerings,<br/>Eating There, and Rejoicing before Him</h2><p data-content-id="8NM0lN8hD4vu0iaRhL4MYDa2JYUL4_FS5InsnOLYBQ5dOJQ_V4BaxScrZMJYNU0m_"> In the God-given land, the children of Israel were to build to Jehovah their God an altar of stones not touched by an iron tool (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42786" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:5-6">vv. 5-6a</span>). It is significant that when the blessings and the curses were about to be released, Moses charged the people to build an altar. This altar implies grace. Before the people took care of either the blessing or cursing, they built an altar. The building of an altar is a great matter, for, after man’s fall, what we first need with respect to God is an altar—the cross of Christ. We thank God that, before He dealt with us regarding blessing or cursing, He accomplished salvation through Christ’s redemption on the cross. Praise the Lord that an altar has been built! </p>
<p data-content-id="0H_aLtQ9PYo7ZZkSDEI3cJvBs0di9FeRqKH0ZJVhI04pU36vT2G0S4v6wW4IKGZbS"> Upon the altar, which signifies the cross of Christ, the children of Israel were to offer up burnt offerings (Christ) to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42787" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:6">v. 6b</span>). The people were also to sacrifice peace offerings (Christ) and eat there and rejoice before Jehovah their God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42788" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:7">v. 7</span>). On the cross, Christ offered Himself to God as a burnt offering for God’s satisfaction. He also offered Himself to God as a peace offering for us so that we could be satisfied. Now in the presence of God, we can enjoy Christ as the peace offering for our fellowship with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="7Mq2kh9sNErSqhMRMew6nXej_97s3PMe2up44PmU6KvZqEoKGsLDGirG6fRoo4kIs"> The burnt offering and the peace offering in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42789" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:6-7">verses 6 and 7</span> indicate that the one who wants to keep the commandments of God must offer himself as a burnt offering to God for His satisfaction, so that he can offer a peace offering to God for his enjoyment with God in fellowship. This means that if we intend to do something before God, we must first offer Christ to God as a burnt offering for God’s satisfaction. Then, mainly for our own need and our satisfaction, we must also offer Christ as a peace offering.

We should not think that God’s severe chastisement of the children of Israel means that He has given them up. On the contrary, God’s chastisement indicates that He will not give them up. The principle is the same with us today. God’s chastisement of the believers indicates not that He has forsaken them but that He will not let them go. </p>
<p data-content-id="xLIymt5TfDx4T4fWSZu2ADx5i8xgsZJleoBf631Wrt-G7vwunwhRWAKYTR3rapCMb"> In keeping with prophecy, the children of Israel have returned to their fatherland in their iniquity. The nation of <span class="pg" data-page-id="178" id="178">[178]</span> Israel today is filled with sinfulness and iniquity. The people trust in education, in technology, and in their army, all of which are idols in the sight of God. The day is coming when God will chastise them further and even more severely. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ffi7UzH07-xYlEI0WESGnbKzKJgvWh6jqxBFYV9dfzkrpfdNfHW5DmFars7tO-FuE">A BOOK ON CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="IFJP7KvjivPXVzTqHGGVq1blp5o1f32slXHxPjRnFe25_vI2eXCg28fxNi290DLw0"> Before we come in the next message to the matter of the enactment of the covenant, I would like in this message to give a brief word concerning the Christ revealed in Deuteronomy. The book of Deuteronomy is a book on Christ. The focus of this book, including <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42844" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:1">chapters twenty-seven and twenty-eight</span>, is not the law but Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HKG88Knb6l1ilINwmzTP2HsDHukubcNh_yKGyn-CQdyIKlGozFDnuUfiDY_X-u5hw">THE MONUMENT WITH GOD’S REQUIREMENTS</h2><p data-content-id="XZoqLZSiJ4X6PMjvu1mAgZ6qIO8WC0nTZU8vKedo3orUBbbngBjgE2iH4WGwc6jGL"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42845" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:1-7">27:1-7</span> Moses gave commandments to the children of Israel regarding erecting large stones, building an altar, and offering burnt offerings and peace offerings on this altar. In the day they crossed over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah was giving to them, at the entry of the good land, they were to erect large stones, coat them with plaster, and write upon them the Ten Commandments. These stones may be considered a monument. Beside this monument, they were to build an altar. Thus, two things were set up—a monument and an altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="ktDpVRWTdq_zO_6vliSWIdRxsoMmlIkXfajdxjYlMoR8NGOKQDS3fBxh6czAlGYz1"> The Ten Commandments, which were written on the monument, were God’s requirements. As God’s requirements, the Ten Commandments are an expression of God Himself; they are a portrait of what God is. In particular, the Ten Commandments reveal that God is love and light and that He is holy and righteous. Thus, the monument at the entry to the land was actually the very God Himself. God was standing <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> there, revealing Himself to the children of Israel and making His requirements known to them. God, according to what He is, had His requirements, and the people had to satisfy these requirements. </p>
<p data-content-id="r3j8GZpjT_XtkBRgyejlrweN5XFA3HsW9JtDwTzsyHuvknJjd_LAmYLudPgo7VdMu"> At this point, I would emphasize once again that, since Deuteronomy is a book on Christ, in our reading of this book we should change the words <em>law</em> and <em>commandment</em> to <em>Christ</em>. The stone monument was also Christ. We have seen that this monument was God. Now we need to see that this God is embodied in Christ. This means that the One who stood before the people at the entry to the land was Christ as the embodiment of God. As Christ stood before them, He showed them what He is, and based on what He is, He made requirements of them. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dbzF1Z-0kPtilRgbiq7B_8i43q8GzLDWGhcgWXnFRDHy7lXQsLX6Pt9EzLa4oOL4W">THE ALTAR BESIDE THE MONUMENT</h2><p data-content-id="QfLqOeamc21tPQYaJpo1UPn9fP_BzqfNPqStKQ4ocgqQs84upm40VyJnyW-GDKaPt"> Why was an altar built up next to the monument? We need an altar because we cannot measure up to the requirements of what is written on the monument. This indicates that it is impossible for us to match Christ. Christ, the very God, is holy and righteous, and He is full of love and light. We cannot match Him. Therefore, we need an altar—we need the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="KaPp4ZfWpHg0v7Y1Qb8kCxbqDOqZszFVy1tOnWAiiuOJw9pt8SkBURHfo8rEPsy9m"> I would not say that the altar was a monument, for it was the place where the offerings were burned as sacrifices to the God who made requirements of the people and who placed demands upon them. The burning of the sacrifices satisfied the requiring God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lv9QiwyubS3pAzuAkD7P6WwucQ0qrh5FNk_QshgmMh1Zz6ZH3s9Ne8zbAIfXXLpAM">THE OFFERINGS FULFILLING GOD’S REQUIREMENTS</h2><p data-content-id="O_zWsz1z_HTP4vqX5zZIjK5pSXRshFhZsZyXK7kFx_QSEW2PV2DsWExpd1JZ4Eanb"> The offerings burned on the altar as sacrifices for God’s satisfaction signify Christ. On the one hand, Christ is the One who makes the requirements; on the other hand, Christ is the One who meets and satisfies these requirements. We cannot meet His requirements, but He Himself has come to be our Substitute to replace us and to fulfill what He requires of us. This reveals that He is both the requiring One and the fulfilling One. <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> </p>

As we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42846" data-verses="Deuteronomy 27:1">Deuteronomy 27</span> and consider the monument, the altar, and the offerings, we can see this wonderful scene. First, in this scene we see Christ as the embodiment of God standing before us with His demands and requirements according to what He is. Second, we see the altar, which signifies the cross of Christ. Because we cannot fulfill His requirements, He came to be our Redeemer, to be the One cursed for us on the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42847" data-verses="Galatians 3:13">Gal. 3:13</span>). The requiring One is thus the fulfilling One. When this One was crucified, He was consumed by fire as the sacrifice to satisfy God and to fulfill His requirements. </p>
<p data-content-id="3LrF5606VsCY9gf-3N1_x6cVl3184dzvHwt1sw7tKWvdNZKrX0E8RjgQOfnrHkEiS"> This wonderful scene is unique in the entire universe. In this scene we have the monument and the altar, that is, the requiring One and the fulfilling and satisfying One. The requiring God came in incarnation to be our Redeemer as the satisfying One. Having put on flesh through incarnation, He went to the cross in the flesh and with the flesh to die there for the fulfillment of His requirements (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42848" data-verses="Romans 8:3-4">Rom. 8:3-4</span>). Now we can see the monument, but we can also see the altar with the offerings burned upon it to fulfill what is written on the monument. This means that in this wonderful scene we see the requiring God and also the Redeemer, who is nothing less than the requiring God Himself. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GmeFhSIVaVkDd-zcbE2K7UYKLAAjPnpexwzEqnoLKPnfduHna8dZKH42UuXxF5m5F">THE ENTRY INTO THE GOOD LAND</h2><p data-content-id="cq9xM3YXZ1xSEsXf-aBP_Nl9onCCSlSmkCmfMBL3cafNsBbL--OOKjl-hXBJ5OU6d"> This wonderful scene, with the monument, the altar, and the offerings, is our entry into the good land. This scene reveals that it is through the monument, the altar, and the offerings—through the requiring God, the cross of Christ, and Christ Himself as the offerings—that we enter into the good land. It is also through the monument, the altar, and the offerings that we receive all the blessings which God would give us in Christ. All these blessings are actually the processed Triune God Himself embodied in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="YMSJIrSjDE6zdBgUhOqi4UMMuR9Dyi9vw0-as5CKmpQ01qt3SZFZud7iRcdsB859W"> I hope that all the saints will see this marvelous view. We all need to see that the One who stands before us with His <span class="pg" data-page-id="184" id="184">[184]</span> requirements is the Triune God in Christ, that the altar is the cross of Christ, and that, as signified by the offerings, Christ is our Redeemer. He, the fulfilling One, was “burned” on the cross as the sacrifice to satisfy the requiring One. May we all see this wonderful scene with the monument, the altar, and the offerings. If we have this vision, we will surely say, “Hallelujah for God, for the cross of Christ, and for Christ, our Redeemer and Substitute!” </p>

The answer would be that because the children of Israel forsook the covenant of Jehovah and went and served other gods, the anger of Jehovah burned against that land, bringing upon it all the curses; and Jehovah plucked them out of their land in anger and in great indignation and sent them to another land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42876" data-verses="Deuteronomy 29:25-28">vv. 25-28</span>). </p>

They were to gather the people, the men, the women, the little ones, and the strangers with them, that they might hear, learn, and fear Jehovah their God and do all the words of this law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42915" data-verses="Deuteronomy 31:12">v. 12</span>). They were to do this so that their children, who had not known these things, might hear and learn to fear Jehovah all the days that they would live upon the land into which they were crossing and which they would possess (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42916" data-verses="Deuteronomy 31:13">v. 13</span>). </p>

Moses gave this charge because he knew the rebelliousness of the children of Israel <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> and their stiff neck (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42918" data-verses="Deuteronomy 31:27">v. 27a</span>). While he was yet alive with them, they had been rebelling against Jehovah. How much more would they rebel after his death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42919" data-verses="Deuteronomy 31:27">v. 27b</span>)! Moses’ speaking here was according to his deep concern for God’s people. </p>

He knew that after his death the children of Israel would utterly spoil themselves and turn away from the way that he had commanded them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42921" data-verses="Deuteronomy 31:29">v. 29a</span>). As a result, evil would come upon them in the latter days, for they would do what was evil in the sight of Jehovah so as to anger Him by their undertakings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42922" data-verses="Deuteronomy 31:29">v. 29b</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="6HcZas2R5EDq1gin0ryF9F5xUE_WqUnkmJKxZEWSqTtng_-dWlxu8UW1rrlROe9rG"> As Moses was about to depart, his heart was set on the children of Israel, but he was not at peace. Knowing that Israel would rebel against God, Moses repeated his charge again and again. He seemed to be saying to the people, “I do not have peace regarding you, and I do not have any trust in you. You rebelled many times while I was alive, and I am concerned that after I leave, you will rebel even more.” Eventually, what Moses felt regarding the children of Israel became the fact, for, not too long afterward, they rebelled once again. Therefore, Moses, the elderly father, was right in his concern. </p>
<p data-content-id="RIqag1CUh3igQFjEhVOs6F5M6zhDw-leM7t6lXhUEaGGbxZcvNb6VnnEDQdXs4Su9"> We should not think that Moses’ concern was excessive. He knew that the children of Israel were rebellious in nature, that the element of rebellion was part of their very being. Because they had a rebellious nature, they would eventually rebel even more against God. No matter how much teaching the people received through Moses, the judges, and the priests, they still went after other gods and worshipped idols. They went so far as to set up idols in the temple. It seems that the children of Israel became more pagan than the pagans. <span class="pg" data-page-id="197" id="197">[197]</span> Despite the fact that they received so much training, they remained the same and continued to rebel. </p>
<p data-content-id="siuEb1E4hdXDA5XnmXLkCVLY25b3Y6RSEtwz3vAYtntAi-fvxRCT9cMH2C7hoXlbE"> We need to remember that what is portrayed regarding Israel is a picture of us today. This picture shows us what we are. Since we are the same in nature as the children of Israel, their exposure is also our exposure. Many of us have been in the church life for years; we have heard messages and have read the Recovery Version. However, we should not have any trust in ourselves, because we have a rebellious nature, a rebellious being. We are a constitution of rebellion. Therefore, we surely need the Lord’s mercy and grace. </p>

This indicates that Moses realized that whatever he spoke, either a blessing or a curse, was like rain and dew.

But if we exercise our spirit as well as our mind, we will sense that Moses’ words are like dropping rain and distilling dew. </p>

Jehovah is a God of greatness. He is the Rock, whose work is perfect and whose ways are justice. He is a God of faithfulness and without injustice; He is righteous and upright. </p>
<p data-content-id="7Mq2kh9sNErSqhMRMew6nXej_97Y3P8W2up44PmU6KvZqEoKGsLDGirG6fRoo4kIs"> Moses’ word here was actually his vindication of God. Quite often during the forty years in the wilderness, the children of Israel complained against God, saying that He was wrong in bringing them out of Egypt and into the wilderness. Thus, Moses vindicated the very God whom he served, declaring that He is the Rock and that His ways are not only just but justice itself. He is righteous and upright, and He is right in whatever He does. </p>

All the children of Israel were supposed to be God’s sons, but in their living they did not behave like God’s sons. Instead, they were twisted and crooked.

Jehovah considered Israel as His portion, His inheritance. He encircled them, cared for them, and guarded them like the pupil of His eye. As an eagle He bore them up upon His pinions, and He made them ride on the high places of the earth and enjoy the fruit of the field and the produce of the cattle.

No matter how evil the children of Israel might be and no matter how much God might be provoked in His anger toward them, the result, the issue, will be good. Instead of forsaking His people, God will eventually come in to vindicate them. This is true concerning Israel and also concerning the believers in Christ. </p>

But Moses was merciful and prayed that Reuben would live and not die and that his men would not be few (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42969" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:6">v. 6</span>).

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42971" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:7">verse 7</span> Moses went on to say that with his hands Judah contended for his people. Those who contended in this way have included Caleb and David. Finally, Moses prayed that Jehovah would be a help against Judah’s adversaries. Enemies come from the outside, but adversaries arise from within. For example, Absalom became an adversary to David. </p>

Levi had said of his father and mother, “I do not regard him,” and his brothers he did not acknowledge, and his children he did not recognize. Levi had thus kept Jehovah’s speaking and had guarded His covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42973" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>).

He would dwell securely by God, who would “cover over him all the day.” Furthermore, He would dwell between Benjamin’s shoulders. According to geography, Benjamin is shaped like two shoulders, and Jerusalem is located between them. Hence, the Lord would dwell between the shoulders of Benjamin. </p>

The expression “Him who dwelt in the bush” refers to God, who in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42980" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> appeared to Moses from within a burning bush.

The fact that they are mentioned here indicates that the tribe of Joseph would eventually receive a double portion, which is part of the birthright of the firstborn son. Reuben lost the birthright, but a part of it—the double portion of the land—went to Joseph. The kingship went to Judah, and the priesthood, to Levi. </p>

Most of the apostles, who were sent forth to disciple the nations, were produced from Zebulun, which was in the region of Galilee. </p>
<p data-content-id="-VrGtVJOlJ_zi6m8_RpxIGu9NUBPBRGbsYjyvDgdos4COJkJShQ_Cct-4GEKFOcPL"> Zebulun and Issachar would call peoples to the mountain. There these tribes would offer sacrifices of righteousness; for they would suck the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42987" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:19">v. 19</span>). This indicates that Zebulun and Issachar would be close to the sea. </p>

Because Gad was rather small, Moses said, “Blessed be He who enlarges Gad” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42989" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:20">v. 20a</span>). God is the One who would enlarge <span class="pg" data-page-id="209" id="209">[209]</span> this tribe, which would be strong in fighting. This is indicated by the words, “He dwells as a lioness, /And tears off the arm, yea, even the top of the head” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42990" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:20">v. 20b</span>). </p>

Moreover, he came with the heads of the people and executed the righteousness of Jehovah and His judgments with Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="42992" data-verses="Deuteronomy 33:21">v. 21b</span>). This indicates that some among the people of Gad had the knowledge of God’s law and His judgments. </p>

Naphtali would possess the sea (the west) and the south. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42995" data-verses="Matthew 4:13-16">Matthew 4:13-16</span>, the Lord Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="42996" data-verses="Isaiah 9:1-2">Isaiah 9:1-2</span>, came to the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali, beside the sea. Eventually, through the preaching of the gospel, those of Naphtali possessed the Mediterranean Sea. If you study church history, you will see that much was gained for the Lord in the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. </p>
