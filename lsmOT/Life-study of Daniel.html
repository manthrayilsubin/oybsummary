<h1 class="title" data-content-id="g-4JIWI5lbj9-HlbZSjVm8POPJrgGGStYnYYjwi9wnIUn6sq1SzMTmE5q9vlsDmEd">AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</h1><p class="scripture" data-content-id="e4MMHiTiM5N4Hjb5VsU88dY4GGM2kvfjKpaiQjNJaYMmJGQNByqDAu-5xaYm4uzMJ">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58552" data-verses="Daniel 1:1-2">Dan. 1:1-2</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="5V_J_CSDB3yIpMuS8IUk8Q2D6EvuDU6YpuUnWB_Jm_6yRHYwJ5PXJ3YEDMx9oR0in"> Among the many books of the prophets, four books are mysterious: Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah. We thank the Lord that, through the years, He has opened these books to us. In this introductory message to the life-study of Daniel, we will consider the subject, the contents, the central thought, and the sections of the book of Daniel. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NbNuKyCGs8wbr7VEU5DLnT4M3Bq4O0PgF1LASzOfRqDz673owBzZKIH2Wl2y5oEWd">I. THE SUBJECT</h2><p data-content-id="t48tRBEBa6kpOxV4so-VQ0Amc146wCtepMBAjciGP_y0G9UxCCMI80eNPKEUXPKPQ"> The subject of the book of Daniel is the destiny of Israel apportioned out by God, the contents of the seventy weeks (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58553" data-verses="Daniel 9:24-27">Dan. 9:24-27</span>). The seventy weeks are the destiny apportioned out by God to Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="hRp9zNy7LmbXn6KlOMvBFVywfQb6XMHEZR8l0dnnpX_v1tzGmefaHwjOexoeelGGs"> This book not only covers the destiny of Israel but also covers the Gentile government and Christ. The large human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58554" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span> signifies all of human government from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58555" data-verses="Genesis 10:1">Genesis 10</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58556" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span>. Our understanding of the history of the Jewish people and of the Gentile government would be inadequate without this book. The book of Daniel shows us that Israel and human government are for Christ. Christ is the centrality and the universality of God’s move, and this move is intrinsically involved with Israel and the Gentile government. </p>
<p data-content-id="UV2SfXMCO5eKND7fxrKLS-Iok3GhLTMBXEgRB1xFL6r2IXYKseSJTldn2ZbBkHWHT"> The book of Daniel reveals five particular points concerning Christ. The first point is the death of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58557" data-verses="Daniel 9:25-26">Daniel 9:25 and 26</span> say, “From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of Messiah the Prince will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks....And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off.” This word about Messiah being “cut off” is the clearest word in the Old Testament <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> concerning the crucifixion of Christ. The crucifixion of Christ is the landmark of the ages. It is the landmark where the old creation was terminated for the germination of the new creation in Christ’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="3o_LUomGqul5DgiPEdENJcw9AD717EqHLE3f9UA4StLCdSevvNBGwchFfjzq2Pg4-"> Christ died an all-inclusive death. When He died, we and the entire old creation died with Him. Therefore, His death was an all-inclusive termination. The terminating death of Christ ushered in the resurrection, and in the resurrection the germination of God’s new creation began. </p>
<p data-content-id="G8JUoSDmwVMPtciP6jLFTq-vXyJvbqJOUbVJAIU2q4tJMWmLpelzLwHNdKIDLk-Xo"> The second point is the upcoming appearing of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58558" data-verses="Daniel 2:34-35">2:34-35</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58559" data-verses="Daniel 2:45">45</span>). He will appear as a stone cut out without hands to strike the great image (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58560" data-verses="Daniel 2:31-45">vv. 31-45</span>) at its feet of iron and clay. The entire image, which represents all human government, will be crushed, not from the head to the toes but from the toes upward to the head. This smashing of the image from the toes to the head will occur at the coming of Christ, and it is something only God Himself can do. At Christ’s coming, all human government, from Nimrod in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58561" data-verses="Genesis 10:1">Genesis 10</span> to Antichrist, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58562" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span>, will be crushed and become like chaff blown away by the wind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58563" data-verses="Daniel 2:35">Dan. 2:35</span>). The coming of Christ will also be the opening of the eternal kingdom of God. Hence, Christ’s coming will be the landmark which closes human government and brings in the eternal kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="cetkagMYx-vn93bnprrERlbS8nP2nyTk-eYJ6APd2CI1KdjQDdamAKMyajw4LNgR5"> The third point is Christ as the Son of Man who comes to the throne of God to receive dominion and a kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58564" data-verses="Daniel 7:13-14">7:13-14</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58565" data-verses="Luke 19:1">Luke 19</span> Christ is portrayed as a certain man of noble birth who went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and then to return (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58566" data-verses="Luke 19:12">v. 12</span>). Christ’s coming to the throne of God to receive the kingdom from the God of the heavens takes place in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58567" data-verses="Daniel 7:1">Daniel 7</span>. After Christ receives the kingdom, He will come back. </p>
<p data-content-id="YddNSurrogCrcYqG0Rv0D6Js1McrJeVJBwkGwNBBZjM-4QCG5U6X05-kCHxyV3hOa"> The fourth point is the excellency of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58568" data-verses="Daniel 10:1">Daniel 10</span>. Before Daniel spoke in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58569" data-verses="Daniel 10:1">chapters ten through twelve</span> about the destiny of Israel, he received a revelation of Christ in His excellency. Every part of Christ is excellent and precious (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58570" data-verses="Daniel 10:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). We need to see and know this excellent Christ before we can know the destiny of God’s people. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="E0BI6JwemZBnJyywfzV_mHTG3DaqCglCbqC7bHSkOrMUnV2RmYOSofkOpxsFWIGM3"> The last point is Christ as the companion of the suffering witnesses of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58571" data-verses="Daniel 3:1">chapter three</span>, Nebuchadnezzar had Daniel’s three companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace of fire because they would not bow down and worship the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58572" data-verses="Daniel 3:13-23">vv. 13-23</span>). Three were thrown into the furnace, but to his astonishment, Nebuchadnezzar saw another person within the furnace. The fourth person was “like a son of the gods” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58573" data-verses="Daniel 3:25">v. 25</span>). This One is the excellent Christ, who goes through the same kind of blazing fire as His suffering overcomers. Whenever we are witnesses for God, testifying something for God, we may suffer. Yet, in our suffering, Christ as the Son of Man—the One who is qualified and capable of sympathizing with us in everything—comes to be our companion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DPz72M8koxy7aVJx5nepYxegFmLR_t3nKTRVnORTOpuez1RcHSbauorTSbdX7hDrm">II. THE CONTENTS</h2><p data-content-id="SxLl_Fcrgldpe266mp3SXygCODt21ZMHb9WaWqGGUcOgWcZAuRWihXjGoWE6IDsLZ"> The contents of the book of Daniel are the seventy weeks apportioned out by God for Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58574" data-verses="Daniel 9:24-27">9:24-27</span>). One week equals seven years. We use the word <em>apportioned</em> to indicate that God cuts the ages into portions. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="g-4JIWI5lbj9-HlbZSjVm8PHCJrgGGStYnYYjwi9wnIUn6sq1SzMTmE5q9vlsDmEd">A. The First Seven Weeks of Forty-nine Years</h2><p data-content-id="e4MMHiTiM5N4Hjb5VsU88dYtEGM2kvfjKpaiQjNJaYMmJGQNByqDAu-5xaYm4uzMJ"> These seventy weeks are divided into three parts. The first part is seven weeks of forty-nine years, from the issuing of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the completion of the rebuilding. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="5V_J_CSDB3yIpMuS8IUk8Q2S5EvuDU6YpuUnWB_Jm_6yRHYwJ5PXJ3YEDMx9oR0in">B. The Sixty-two Weeks<br/>of Four Hundred Thirty-four Years</h2><p data-content-id="NbNuKyCGs8wbr7VEU5DLnT4d9Bq4O0PgF1LASzOfRqDz673owBzZKIH2Wl2y5oEWd"> The second part is sixty-two weeks of four hundred thirty-four years, from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off of Messiah (the crucifixion of Christ). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="t48tRBEBa6kpOxV4so-VQ0AzX146wCtepMBAjciGP_y0G9UxCCMI80eNPKEUXPKPQ">C. The Last Week of Seven Years</h2><p data-content-id="hRp9zNy7LmbXn6KlOMvBFVyZXQb6XMHEZR8l0dnnpX_v1tzGmefaHwjOexoeelGGs"> The third part will be the last week of seven years, the time of Antichrist’s covenant with Israel, the last seven years of the present age of grace, divided into two halves. The first half will not be that crucial, but the last half, of three and a <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> half years, will be very important, for that will be the time of the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58575" data-verses="Matthew 24:21">Matt. 24:21</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="UV2SfXMCO5eKND7fxrKLS-IFt3GhLTMBXEgRB1xFL6r2IXYKseSJTldn2ZbBkHWHT">D. The Insertion of Israel’s History<br/>between the First Sixty-nine Weeks<br/>and the Last Week</h2><p data-content-id="M3fk4VYyoq5uDKXE4WW_fjsAc2CnHqxB8Zl9E8jYBBlYbLqmstKpbSsJyN8cOT-1G"> There is an insertion of Israel’s history between the first sixty-nine weeks and the last week, in the age of the church. This insertion may be called the age of mystery, the age of grace, or the age of the church. This age includes many mysterious things, such as the resurrection of Christ, regeneration, Christ living in us, and the life-giving Spirit. The history of Israel is physical, with nothing of a mysterious nature, but the church’s history is altogether mysterious. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vx3ZVTUoJHEeCQZ-G33wxjD6WxpERdGc1qyL74UKyYsalIDaJEFMLyAy3IyLUkJd4"> The first part of seven weeks and the second part of sixty-two weeks have already been fulfilled. A decree was given to rebuild Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58576" data-verses="Daniel 9:25">Dan. 9:25</span>), and Jerusalem was rebuilt. The Messiah was cut off sixty-two weeks from the rebuilding of Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58577" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">v. 26</span>). Hence, these two parts of the seventy weeks, which were prophecies, have become history. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="icWOHOCyl0hlb4CaWdI9mKw90_vTv6uAfJhBzWg1_64UIW6ELHJ846Z8xen9D7wYb">III. THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</h2><p data-content-id="1zfMgUfM5b7JsjQY0HY1hf8Pgrx48Mxruqvwj-E3f-fnaPFO6aKtRPb-NUbD_Mpgj"> The central thought of Daniel is that the ruling of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58578" data-verses="Daniel 4:26">4:26</span>) by the God of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58579" data-verses="Daniel 2:37">2:37</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58580" data-verses="Daniel 2:44">44</span>) over all the human government on earth matches God’s eternal economy for Christ to terminate the old creation for the germination of the new creation and to smash and crush the aggregate of human government and establish the eternal kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="9tqsZI_sayG1qnSLvn_rdoF0-gSWGmBu9EX0GzJsFy1TQdEG6UIBh-pThfuTeef3N"> The God of the heavens rules over all human government. Human government began with Nimrod in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58581" data-verses="Genesis 10:1">Genesis 10</span>. Prior to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58582" data-verses="Genesis 10:1">Genesis 10</span> there were no human nations; instead, there was only mankind as a whole without established nations. Nations began to be established by Nimrod, who built Babel, a prefigure of Babylon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58583" data-verses="Genesis 10:8-10">Gen. 10:8-10</span>). Human government will conclude with the coming Antichrist, who will be the last Caesar of the Roman Empire. All human government from <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> Nimrod to Antichrist has been and will continue to be under the ruling of the heavens by the God of the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="jYlpmBeDJb4gCOPk3n0KL7KUyjQLxLTQHusB-6xPo95JQs-0Af13SdMvgBYc_OfPy"> In God’s economy, Christ has terminated the old creation for the germination of the new creation in His resurrection through His death. This was achieved in His first coming. In God’s economy, Christ, by His upcoming appearing, will also smash and crush the aggregate of human government throughout the history of mankind and will establish the eternal kingdom of God. All of these matters have been and will be intrinsically involved with Israel, either positively or negatively. </p>
<p data-content-id="T9tunLPby9CvJNXqmJQeUr7BPIrz_4NlOGi1J4BWrNxl5olrgKrqqTjhbks2dPLzC"> The entire world situation is under the rule of the heavens by the God of the heavens, to match His economy for Christ. Today the world situation, especially in Europe and the countries around the Mediterranean Sea, has been balanced and brought into a condition which is ready for Christ’s return. He is at the door and the time is near. As we see this situation, we must wake up and realize that the world is not for us. We are for Christ, and every day we must prepare ourselves to meet Him. Then we will receive a reward from Him. </p>

The origin of Babylon was Babel in the land of Shinar—Chaldea—Babylon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58605" data-verses="Genesis 11:2">Gen. 11:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58606" data-verses="Genesis 11:9">9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58607" data-verses="Genesis 10:10">10:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58608" data-verses="Genesis 11:28">11:28</span>). Abraham was called by God out of Chaldea to Canaan to worship God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58609" data-verses="Genesis 11:31">Gen. 11:31</span>). By this, the worship of the unique God, which had been lost through Adam’s fall, was resumed. </p>

The history of Israel began with Abraham, the first Hebrew. Under the leadership of Moses, Abraham’s descendants made their exodus from Egypt, and forty years later they entered the land of Canaan. Eventually, God’s people were taken back to the original place of the worship of idols, the very place out of which their forefather Abraham had been called. </p>

Among such sons of Israel were some young overcomers whom God used to gain the victory over Satan’s devices. Satan might have thought that God had been defeated and that on earth there no longer was the worship of God. The elect of God had been defeated, and God’s purpose on earth had suffered loss. However, God was not disappointed, for He still had some overcomers—Daniel and his <span class="pg" data-page-id="9" id="9">[9]</span> companions. In His sovereignty He had arranged for these young people to be taken to Babylon, where they were His overcomers. If God had not had these overcomers in Babylon, He would have been totally defeated. But because of their presence in Babylon, He was not defeated and could boast to Satan that even in Babylon He had His overcomers. </p>

In principle, all the temptations that come to us are related to eating. Nebuchadnezzar’s devilish temptation was first to seduce Daniel and his three companions, the four brilliant young descendants of God’s defeated elect, to be defiled in partaking of his unclean food, food offered to idols. Nebuchadnezzar provided Daniel and his three companions with the choice food to eat. To Daniel, that choice food was actually the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. That tree is something attached to Satan and even one with Satan, but the tree of life is something attached to God and one with God. To eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is to become attached to Satan; to eat of the tree of life is to become attached to God. When Daniel and his companions refused to eat Nebuchadnezzar’s unclean food and chose instead to eat vegetables, they were actually rejecting the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and taking the tree of life. Thus, even in Nebuchadnezzar’s palace there were the two trees. </p>
<p data-content-id="yNJFPY2CTWMZhd_JKx02-J9vCt0BgEYkBolCbSE_0lbcERr4a6fDqox7bdCjZb7HP"> The choice food was defiling, not clean, for it had been offered to Nebuchadnezzar’s gods. For Daniel and his companions to eat that food would have been to take in the defilement, to take in the idols, and thus to become one with Satan. If they had done this, God would have been finished and would have had nothing on earth for Himself and His <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> interest. Then Satan could have boasted and said, “God, You have been completely defeated. You have nothing on earth to represent You and to be one with You.” God had been defeated in His elect. Now if their descendants in the captivity, the younger generation, had followed in the steps of their fathers, God would have been fully defeated. But Daniel and his companions were for God. They were attached to God, they cleaved to God, and they were one with God because they took God in. </p>
<p data-content-id="8YeJ9BQw3FIPTq5wiafQgO48rfljqYhoYLunbUUJ0F4vK32Ic_tqxTArHTOahVFDN"> To eat Nebuchadnezzar’s choice food is to take Satan as our supply and to become one with Satan. I am concerned that you may be eating the choice food provided for you by today’s Nebuchadnezzar. If we are careless in our eating, in our shopping, in where we go, and in what we do, we may take in something related to idols, something demonic. We are what we eat. If we eat godly food—that is, if we eat God-food, God as our food—we will be one with God. </p>

The name of Daniel, which means “God is the Judge,” or “God is my Judge,” was changed to Belteshazzar—“the prince of Bel,” or “the favorite of Bel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58614" data-verses="Isaiah 46:1">Isa. 46:1</span>). The name of Hananiah, which means “Jehovah is kind,” or “the favorite of Jehovah,” was changed to Shadrach—“enlightened by the sun god.” The name of Mishael means “Who can be like God?” but his name was changed to Meshach—“Who can be like the goddess Shach?” The name of Azariah, which means “Jehovah is my help,” was changed to Abed-nego—“the faithful servant of the fire god Nego.” </p>

The elect were defeated, but the young overcomers were victorious. Their victory was God’s victory. Because of this victory God could boast and tell Satan that in the midst of Babylon, Satan’s territory, God still had some overcomers, four young ones who were victorious over Satan’s devices. </p>

In the sight of God, therefore, all of human government throughout human history is composed of four empires: the Babylonian Empire, the Medo-Persian Empire, the Macedonian-Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire. According to the human point of view, the Grecian Empire ended with the death of Alexander the Great. However, according to God’s viewpoint, this empire continued with Alexander’s successors—his four generals who divided the empire into four sections—and it lasted until the beginning of the Roman Empire. Apparently the Roman Empire has also been terminated. Actually the Roman Empire continues to exist. According to the books of Daniel and Revelation, the Roman Empire will have as its last Caesar the Antichrist, with the ten kings signified by the ten toes of the great image. The Roman Empire, which began approximately thirty years before the birth of Christ, will last until the very end of the three and a half years of the great tribulation. The aggregate of human empires that began with Nimrod at Babel will consummate with the last Caesar of the Roman Empire with his ten kings. Thus, according to the Bible, we are still in the Roman Empire today. </p>

What began with Nimrod will conclude with Antichrist. The Babylonian, Medo-Persian, and Macedonian-Grecian Empires have vanished, but their culture remains. The Medo-Persian Empire adopted aspects of Babylonian culture, and the Macedonian-Grecian <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> Empire adopted aspects of Medo-Persian culture. In the same principle, the Roman Empire adopted many elements of Greek culture and of the cultures that preceded it. Today we are still under the influence of Roman culture, especially in the matters of law, politics, and government. In this sense, the Roman Empire continues to exist, and we are still in this empire. </p>

Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed all at once, and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found.” This signifies the complete destruction of all human government from Nimrod to Antichrist. Human government will therefore be terminated by Christ at His appearing as the God-cut stone. </p>

<p data-content-id="XakuGwykFNh03RU6Y36Q0WTVtQ2mfufFDKwGyaT3L_nndjbT4VZyTP0QftdbDSkj3"> The Bible reveals that the human image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58686" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span> actually did not begin with Nebuchadnezzar but with Nimrod, who founded the city of Babel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58687" data-verses="Genesis 10:9-10">Gen. 10:9-10</span>). The building of Babel by Nimrod was the beginning of Babylon. Babylon has since continued through the Medo-Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire. It will eventually include the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, Antichrist, with his ten kings, signified by the toes of the great image (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58688" data-verses="Daniel 2:41-44">Dan. 2:41-44</span>). The book of Revelation tells us that under Antichrist, the last Caesar, the Roman Empire will be both political and religious Babylon. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58689" data-verses="Revelation 18:1">Revelation 18</span> refers to the empire of Antichrist as the political and physical Babylon, that is, “Babylon the Great” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58690" data-verses="Revelation 18:2">v. 2</span>). Furthermore, through Constantine the Great, who accepted Christianity as the state religion, the nature of Christianity was changed to become the Catholic Church, which in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58691" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17</span> is called “MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58692" data-verses="Revelation 17:5">v. 5</span>). This is the religious Babylon. Therefore, from the Bible we see that not <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> only Babylon itself is Babylon, but even the Roman Empire is Babylon. </p>

But in the eyes of God, the entire human government from Nimrod to Antichrist is Babylon. This human government—Babylon—has always done three things: rebel against God, exalt man, and worship idols (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58693" data-verses="Genesis 11:4">Gen. 11:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58694" data-verses="Genesis 11:9">9</span>). To worship idols is actually to worship the devil who is behind the idols. Wherever we may go, we will see that human government rebels against God, exalts man, and worships idols. </p>

In His word to the Pharisees in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58698" data-verses="Matthew 21:1">Matthew 21</span>, the Lord Jesus indicated to them that He is a stone. First, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58699" data-verses="Matthew 21:42">verse 42</span> He asked them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?” Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58700" data-verses="Matthew 21:44">verse 44</span> He went on to say, “He who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.” Here we see that Christ is the smiting stone. What will be smitten by Him and scattered as chaff? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58701" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>, it is the aggregate of human government, whose name is Babylon, which will be smashed and crushed into pieces by Christ as the stone cut out without hands. </p>

As the result of studying the Bible and the world situation for over sixty years, I believe that today we are at the feet of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> image, very close to the ten toes.

<p data-content-id="7QkjYuAkEFfOUZrpmdm2CeA83Y4CfD4mgsGQcwTKjTZyWkcvqCHT12Ih1_wNHxGnn"> The four empires in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58706" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span> correspond to the four beasts in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58707" data-verses="Daniel 7:1">Daniel 7</span>.

The four main parts of the image in Nebuchadnezzar’s vision correspond to the four beasts in Daniel’s vision. The head of gold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58710" data-verses="Daniel 2:37-38">2:37-38</span>), signifying Nebuchadnezzar, corresponds to the first beast, which “was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58711" data-verses="Daniel 7:3-4">7:3-4</span>). The breast and arms of silver (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58712" data-verses="Daniel 2:32">2:32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58713" data-verses="Daniel 2:39">39a</span>), signifying Medo-Persia, correspond to the second beast, which resembled a bear (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58714" data-verses="Daniel 7:5">7:5</span>). The abdomen and thighs of bronze (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58715" data-verses="Daniel 2:32">2:32</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58716" data-verses="Daniel 2:39">39b</span>), signifying Greece, correspond to the third beast, which was like a leopard (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58717" data-verses="Daniel 7:6">7:6</span>). The legs of iron and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58718" data-verses="Daniel 2:40-43">2:40-43</span>), signifying the Roman Empire and its last ten kings, correspond to the fourth beast, which, being different from the other beasts, had large iron teeth and ten horns (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58719" data-verses="Daniel 7:7-8">7:7-8</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="_NJhH9Vj7SW0ifuvQO472v5U6XguC_eaMYAuMJUQZ3EnGPFPy6EOh-7bIUyrdO9NE"> Further details concerning these empires are found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58720" data-verses="Daniel 8:1">chapters eight</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58721" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">eleven</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58722" data-verses="Daniel 8:1">chapter eight</span> we see that the second part of the great human image—Medo-Persia—signified by a ram (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58723" data-verses="Daniel 8:3-4">8:3-4</span>) was defeated by the third part —Greece—<span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> signified by a goat with a conspicuous horn (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58724" data-verses="Daniel 8:5-8">vv. 5-8</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58725" data-verses="Daniel 8:8">Verse 8</span> says, “The male goat became very great. But once he became strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.” These four horns signify the successors of Alexander the Great. For details concerning these four horns, we need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58726" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">chapter eleven</span>, which has much to say about the king of the south (Egypt) and the king of the north (Syria). In particular this chapter speaks about Antiochus Epiphanes, a notorious descendant of Alexander’s successor in Syria. </p>

The first type of Antichrist was Nimrod in Genesis; the second was Antiochus Epiphanes in Daniel; and the third was Titus, the prince of Rome who destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Thus, if we want a full picture of Antichrist, we need to study not only the book of Revelation but also these three types of Antichrist. With Nimrod, Antiochus Epiphanes, and Titus we have the picture, and in the book of Revelation we have the definition. When we put together the picture and the definition, we have a full view concerning Antichrist. </p>

In the eyes of human beings, there are different kinds of governments, some good and others bad. But in the eyes of God, every human government is a beast. Babylon, Persia, Greece, the Roman Empire—all are beasts. I can testify that this view has preserved me from the world for more than sixty years. We all need such a view, such a vision. If, as God’s people, we see this controlling vision, we will be kept from the world and prepared for Christ’s coming as the smiting stone which will crush the aggregate of human government and become a great mountain—the eternal kingdom of God—filling the whole earth. </p>

THE YOUNG OVERCOMERS<br/>COMING OUT OF THE FIRE</h2><p data-content-id="C85LY8JSHLzmQE1cibF6ROPtm3kBhWjYWp4DmXqF7BHFaNjuDplBK75kuuvQQfy0W"> Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the blazing furnace of fire and said to the young overcomers, “Servants of the Most High God, come out and come here” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58742" data-verses="Daniel 3:26">v. 26</span>). Then the young overcomers came out of the fire, and all the high officials and the king’s counselors saw concerning these young overcomers that the fire had no effect on their bodies and that the hair of their heads was not singed, nor had their clothes been affected, nor had the smell of fire come upon them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58743" data-verses="Daniel 3:27">v. 27</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PXzTCIcXCukQSKqalS3h4cOzYN1w8ipY7XnpOlm-fpB8YVmg9IEAlbm-udtHvyX5y">IX. NEBUCHADNEZZAR BLESSING THE GOD<br/>OF SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABED-NEGO</h2><p data-content-id="-GKj3_2hTIv2BPN9iTtzzaYLqSteY0NazwjFEGiluDg3CVEk0pIxsBR-Gy8eqDEJs"> Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him and changed the king’s word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58744" data-verses="Daniel 3:28">v. 28</span>). The three young overcomers did not simply frustrate the king’s word—they changed it. Instead of caring for Nebuchadnezzar’s word, they changed it in nature and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god other than their own God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ptgSVBTjZdYQxOVn8syqAu0vNjFOV0dLQ-CNUHP_-Gqpr2042rR_tqC2VusHND_EA"> Nebuchadnezzar went on to make a decree that any people, nation, or language that spoke something offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego should be cut into pieces and their houses should be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58745" data-verses="Daniel 3:29">v. 29</span>). Then the king caused the three young overcomers to prosper in the province of Babylon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58746" data-verses="Daniel 3:30">v. 30</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="v7x-pegtmuRmGo-NOlRZM7lQ15B3Ebtlg2KWwpPeuFRm-3IVlgqq0Fg0PXSzSKPlh"> The three young overcomers gained the victory over the seduction of idol worship. The whole universe saw their rejection of that devilish worship. Thus, God could boast to Satan that even in his territory, He had a people worshipping Him. They did not care for Satan. Today, in this dark age, everything seems to be discouraging. But there is still a group of overcomers to stand against the tide and to carry out God’s worship, testimony, and interest on earth. </p>

<p data-content-id="OiEyFt5PJNnftyobK4oM2pIe82rXnbPSi6gLch4U9ODDWbroAsKHlL-R7rgPidNHU"> Daniel is a book of the divine revelation concerning God’s economy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58748" data-verses="Daniel 1:1">chapters one through six</span>, this book does not present God’s economy in theology or in teaching but in a series of cases. There are at least six cases recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58749" data-verses="Daniel 1:1">Daniel 1—6</span> which show us what God’s economy is and how God’s economy can be carried out. These six cases are illustrations. </p>
<p data-content-id="4wzTLryZ8ZZc_v_Yhh2VJgHQg8k8IxLH2skHe_4DIiVE_a2b_thLw6LltOW_9uIQG"> Apparently the cases in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58750" data-verses="Daniel 1:1">chapters one through six</span> stand alone and have nothing to do with each other. Actually these cases are all connected. For example, to find the crucial point of the second case, the great human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58751" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">chapter two</span>, we must go back to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58752" data-verses="Daniel 1:1">chapter one</span>. The secret of understanding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58753" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">chapter two</span> is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58754" data-verses="Daniel 1:1">chapter one</span>. Likewise, the secret of understanding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58755" data-verses="Daniel 3:1">chapter three</span> is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58756" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">chapter two</span>, and so forth. The case in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58757" data-verses="Daniel 6:1">chapter six</span> is a conclusion to the five foregoing cases. </p>
<p data-content-id="ovZ3C0LSV7EJP1J2t-Nk6gvf-8u2IWWkJ6lwoFdIj9-jxz0VFvqkIXzJyeCTO5K9I"> In order to describe the first case, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58758" data-verses="Daniel 1:1">chapter one</span>, we must paint a portrait. First, we must portray the figure of a fighting, overcoming general, Nebuchadnezzar, who has just returned from Jerusalem to Babylon with many captives following behind him. Second, we see four brilliant young men among the captives. Third, these young men are specially chosen from among the captives and then presented with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> king’s choice food. Fourth, they set their hearts to keep themselves for God, and they reject the royal food and eat vegetables only. Nevertheless, the four become very pleasant, happy, and healthy. Then as a result, God’s presence, wisdom, and insight are with them, and they can understand things ten times better than all the others in Nebuchadnezzar’s realm. </p>
<p data-content-id="7QkjYuAkEFfOUZrpmdm2AeA8_Y4CfD4mgsGQcwTKjTZyWkcvqCHT12Ih1_wNHxGnn"> The second case is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58759" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">chapter two</span>. That great, victorious general dreamed a dream that he could not understand. Because he was blinded by worldly glory and power, he could not understand the dream and eventually forgot it. However, there was a person named Daniel who did not care for worldly glory and power, who had a heart for God, and who had the ability and the capacity to understand this dream. He had not only the right position and the right angle to understand but also an intrinsic capacity in his being to understand. Thus, when such an unknown matter was brought to him, he had the insight. He saw through the worldly glory and majesty related to human government. Then he gave the king a vision to open his eyes. But Nebuchadnezzar was void of the capacity to know God inwardly. Although outwardly he was helped by Daniel to see that God is the Most High God, nothing within him was touched. Regarding Daniel as a hero, this great, overcoming general worshipped him and offered him an oblation with incense. This is the scene at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58760" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">chapter two</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="_NJhH9Vj7SW0ifuvQO470v5UyXguC_eaMYAuMJUQZ3EnGPFPy6EOh-7bIUyrdO9NE"> In his interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, Daniel said, “You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of the heavens has given kingship, power, and strength and glory....You are the head of gold” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58761" data-verses="Daniel 2:37-38">2:37-38</span>). As Nebuchadnezzar thought about Daniel’s interpretation, he might have considered himself to be someone great. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58762" data-verses="Daniel 3:1">chapter three</span> he erected a large golden image, possibly signifying himself, for people to worship. It not only had a head of gold, but the entire image was of gold. </p>
<p data-content-id="BbLc16r7rEKs0vIH07tKQ7MTDm6RcuF1WoIP4s013OhTXMoD4wUYNo5fuoJycqoZd"> Daniel was a prefect ruling over the largest province of Babylon. He realized that the great image was being set up for people to worship, and he anticipated its dedication. Since he is not mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58763" data-verses="Daniel 3:1">chapter three</span>, it is likely that he went away and prayed for God’s victory. God had received much worship in the temple in Jerusalem, but that was destroyed, <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> and the utensils for worshipping God were brought to Babylon. God’s interests on this earth were lost. Nevertheless, there were some overcomers in Babylon, and Daniel was one of them. I believe that Daniel stayed away from the dedication of the image in order to pray for his three companions. In his prayer he might have said, “God, You must preserve us and keep Your worship on earth. Your worship should not be cut off, frustrated, violated, or changed by anyone.” </p>
<p data-content-id="xMGgD859Kng8l5KPMNsLHXwWVvzlMtqvGK6p4T9MM3_OnpfKaJvryZFiQRRNcYpqs"> Daniel’s three companions answered Nebuchadnezzar boldly, saying, “There is no need for us to give you an answer in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace of fire, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image that you have set up” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58764" data-verses="Daniel 3:16-18">3:16-18</span>). They were thrown into the furnace of fire, but the fire had no effect on them. Therefore, at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58765" data-verses="Daniel 3:1">chapter three</span>, the king admitted in a good spirit that these three young men had changed his word and were not afraid to yield their bodies to be killed. “Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him and changed the king’s word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58766" data-verses="Daniel 3:28">v. 28</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rVmOioFt4Q7ikDjiJmfKfNf3775gFAtStvJa_DkMkHt6Sf1IlTzucyyybFe7WvPJh"> At the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58767" data-verses="Daniel 4:1">chapter four</span>, Nebuchadnezzar again offered praise concerning God. As we will see, in this chapter Nebuchadnezzar, who continued to walk in pride, was abased by God. God exposed him and showed him that he was not a gentleman but a beast. </p>

Daniel regarded what happened to Nebuchadnezzar as a lesson not only for Nebuchadnezzar but <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> also for all his descendants. For this reason, Daniel referred Belshazzar to his forefather’s lesson in a rebuking tone. Nebuchadnezzar had been severely disciplined by God and, after he had learned the lesson, offered praise to God. Belshazzar should have learned something from this lesson, but he did not care about it at all. Thus, Daniel said to him, “You his descendant, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this; but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens....The God in whose hand is your breath and to whom all your ways belong, you have not honored. Then that part of the hand was sent from before Him, and this writing was inscribed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58811" data-verses="Daniel 5:22-24">vv. 22-24</span>). Belshazzar was not expecting such a rebuke. </p>

This is Daniel’s interpretation of the matter: MENE—God has numbered Belshazzar’s kingdom and brought it to an end; TEKEL—he has been weighed in the scales and found to be lacking; and PERES—his kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58814" data-verses="Daniel 5:26-28">vv. 26-28</span>). </p>

Soon after Daniel interpreted the writing, the Median army entered the city and the palace and killed Belshazzar. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58818" data-verses="Daniel 5:31">verse 31</span> concludes, “Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two.” That ended the Babylonian Empire. </p>
<p data-content-id="xMGgD859Kng8l5KPMNsLGXwCXvzlMtqvGK6p4T9MM3_OnpfKaJvryZFiQRRNcYpqs"> In the first five chapters of Daniel, there are a number of lessons for us to learn. For instance, the lesson in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58819" data-verses="Daniel 1:1">chapter one</span> is that we should not care for the worldly choice and the worldly taste but set our heart on God and have a taste only for vegetables, that is, for simple food. We should receive only simple things. If we do this, we will be one with God and will become wise. </p>
<p data-content-id="rVmOioFt4Q7ikDjiJmfKeNfj975gFAtStvJa_DkMkHt6Sf1IlTzucyyybFe7WvPJh"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58820" data-verses="Daniel 5:1">chapter five</span> concerning the case of Belshazzar, we see the importance of being serious with God and not disregarding any spiritual lesson. Belshazzar did not benefit from the lesson learned by his forefather Nebuchadnezzar in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58821" data-verses="Daniel 4:1">chapter four</span>. The case of Nebuchadnezzar teaches us that we need to be careful and not consider what we have achieved. The palace built by Nebuchadnezzar was vast. When he took a walk on the roof of that palace, he became proud and said, “Is this not Babylon the great, which I have built up as a royal house by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58822" data-verses="Daniel 4:30">4:30</span>). This should warn us that our achievement may make us proud, and this may usher in God’s judgment. God’s judgment upon Nebuchadnezzar reduced him to nothing. This was the reason he could say of the Lord, “All the inhabitants of earth are considered as nothing, / But He does according to His will in the army of heaven / And among the inhabitants of the earth; / And there is no one who can resist His hand / Or say to Him, What are You doing?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58823" data-verses="Daniel 4:35">4:35</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58824" data-verses="Daniel 4:37">4:37</span> concerning the Lord, Nebuchadnezzar went on to say, “He is able to abase those who walk in pride.” Belshazzar should have learned the lesson from Nebuchadnezzar’s experience; however, he did not learn the lesson and suffered as a result. <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> </p>

God desires to carry out His economy, but man is needed to pray for His economy on earth. God carries out His economy on the earth through His faithful channels of prayer. Satan’s strategy is to frustrate the prayer which is for God’s move. Thus, the center of this chapter is man’s prayer for the carrying out of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="9tqsZI_sayG1qnSLvn_rUoFd8gSWGmBu9EX0GzJsFy1TQdEG6UIBh-pThfuTeef3N"> God’s move is like a train which must have rails for its move.

Daniel replied, “My God has sent His angel and has shut the lions’ mouth, and they have not hurt me, inasmuch as before Him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58850" data-verses="Daniel 6:22">v. 22</span>). Just as the Lord did not quench the fire for Daniel’s three companions, He also did not slay the lions for Daniel’s sake. Instead, He shut the lions’ mouth, making their teeth of no effect. The king was very pleased concerning Daniel, and he commanded that Daniel be taken out of the den. Thus, Daniel was removed from the den, and he was found completely unhurt, because he had trusted in his God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58851" data-verses="Daniel 6:23">v. 23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="hRp9zNy7LmbXn6KlOMvBMVyZTQb6XMHEZR8l0dnnpX_v1tzGmefaHwjOexoeelGGs"> After Daniel was taken out of the den, the king gave commandment concerning the opposers.

They had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58852" data-verses="Daniel 6:24">v. 24</span>). </p>

The second section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="58864" data-verses="Daniel 7:1">chs. 7—12</span>) records the visions of the overcoming Daniel.

Although Nebuchadnezzar saw these visions, Daniel was needed to interpret them. The big tree in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58867" data-verses="Daniel 4:1">chapter four</span> corresponds to the head of the human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58868" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">chapter two</span>: both signify Nebuchadnezzar.

However, what Daniel saw in the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58871" data-verses="Daniel 7:1">chapter seven</span> was very different. Instead of four different metals, he saw four cruel beasts. We need to study carefully the description of these four beasts. </p>

The Medo-Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire were on the three continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe. At the intersection of these three continents is Israel. Throughout the ages Israel has suffered a great deal because of the fighting between these empires on these three continents, of which Israel is the center. Israel has often been the battleground. Due to the trouble and damage caused by this fighting, it has been difficult for Israel, God’s elect, to be something truly according to God’s eternal economy. This is the reason that God came in to show Daniel vision after vision concerning the world situation. Whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58970" data-verses="Daniel 9:1">chapters nine</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58971" data-verses="Daniel 12:1">twelve</span> are concerned with Israel directly, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58972" data-verses="Daniel 8:1">chapter eight</span> with its vision regarding Medo-Persia and Greece and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="58973" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">chapter eleven</span> with its vision regarding the successors of Alexander the Great are concerned with Israel indirectly. <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> </p>

But above, behind, and within all these things, there is something else, and this is God’s economy. Of course, the expression <em>God’s economy</em> is not found in Daniel; neither is it found anywhere else in the Old Testament. Nevertheless, God’s economy is revealed in this book. We all need to see God’s economy in the book of Daniel. If we see this vision of God’s economy, our whole being will be changed. </p>

This is what we must see in our reading of the book of Daniel. The various spiritual lessons and the historical details covered in this book are very good, but they are secondary. What is primary is that in His economy, in His plan with His arrangement, God desires to make Christ the centrality and universality of His move on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="QY6HARLc6-ap_Lxi7vVZaSVS6ue9woq0-7xGq4fD8K_qIut2bizhVRh6efwU31UdS"> Concerning such a Christ, the book of Daniel covers five main points: the death of Christ, the upcoming appearing of Christ, Christ as the Son of Man who comes to the throne of God to receive dominion and a kingdom, Christ as the Companion of the suffering witnesses of God, and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> excellency of Christ.

Regarding this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59036" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">9:26</span> says, “After the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing.” This word is simple, but it is rich in its implications. </p>
<p data-content-id="UV2SfXMCO5eKND7fxrKPR-IJv3GhLTMBXEgRB1xFL6r2IXYKseSJTldn2ZbBkHWHT"> The death of Christ was all-inclusive, comprising every item in the universe. The main item terminated by the death of Christ was the old creation. After God’s work in creation, Satan came in to corrupt, poison, devastate, and ruin God’s creation. As a result, the entire old creation became not only corrupt but corruption. Yet God still uses that corrupted creation in producing a new creation through Christ’s death and resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="M3fk4VYyoq5uDKXE4WW7cjsMa2CnHqxB8Zl9E8jYBBlYbLqmstKpbSsJyN8cOT-1G"> Christ’s greatest achievement in His first appearing was to terminate the whole creation by His death. In this termination, however, there is something rising up, that is, Christ’s resurrection. In His resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59037" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>) to enliven, to germinate, to regenerate, some of those in the old creation to be the new creation. This new creation begins with the believers as God’s sons and Christ’s members as the constituents of His Body. This Body will grow and eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59038" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Rev. 21—22</span>), the total aggregate and consummation of God’s new creation. This is all involved in Christ’s first coming with His death and resurrection. </p>

Hence, there is the need for Christ’s second coming to clear up the entire universe physically and materially.

In His coming as such a stone, He will crush Antichrist with the ten toes. However, He will not come by Himself; He will come with His bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59041" data-verses="Revelation 19:11">Rev. 19:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59042" data-verses="Revelation 19:14">14</span>). Before His coming He will have a wedding, uniting His overcomers to Himself as one entity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59043" data-verses="Revelation 19:7-9">vv. 7-9</span>). Whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59044" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span> speaks of Christ coming as a stone cut out without hands, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59045" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span> speaks of Christ coming as the One who has His bride as His army. </p>
<p data-content-id="jYlpmBeDJb4gCOPk3n0OI7KY8jQLxLTQHusB-6xPo95JQs-0Af13SdMvgBYc_OfPy"> Christ is God coming down to fight against rebellious mankind, and mankind is represented by one man who is one with Satan—Antichrist. The very God is embodied in Christ; Christ is with His bride, the overcomers; and Antichrist is one with Satan and one with the ten kings and their armies. These two parties—Christ and Antichrist—will fight. Man will fight against God directly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59046" data-verses="Revelation 19:19-21">Rev. 19:19-21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59047" data-verses="Revelation 17:14">17:14</span>). The most evil persons on earth will be gathered by Antichrist to one place; that is, the grapes will be gathered together into the winepress (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59048" data-verses="Revelation 19:15">19:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59049" data-verses="Revelation 14:19-20">14:19-20</span>). Then Christ will come not only to crush the ten toes but also to tread the winepress. This will be Christ’s crushing of the human government. </p>
<p data-content-id="T9tunLPby9CvJNXqmJQaXr7JHIrz_4NlOGi1J4BWrNxl5olrgKrqqTjhbks2dPLzC"> After crushing the human government, God will have cleared up the entire universe. The old creation will be gone, and the human government will become chaff blown away by the wind. Then the corporate Christ, Christ with His overcomers, will become a great mountain to fill the whole earth, making the whole earth God’s kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59050" data-verses="Daniel 2:35">Dan. 2:35</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59051" data-verses="Daniel 2:44">44</span>).

Through the nations as the environment, in the coming days God will eventually make Christ the centrality and universality of Israel. The principle is the same with us today. In this present age of mystery, which is not revealed in Daniel, God is using the environment to make Christ the centrality and universality to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="AR-IBymFsr9M1WrYmIVSy3dauiTwUaA7AlfSrHlchFVZ3jG-mTUSgw_eS0mnMoGJA"> We are not simple. On the one hand, we, the believers in Christ, are God’s elect; on the other hand, we are parts of the old creation, including such negative things as the beasts described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59055" data-verses="Daniel 7:1">Daniel 7</span>. As God’s elect, we need Christ to be wrought into us as our centrality and universality. However, the old creation in us is sometimes a beast and at other times a Nebuchadnezzar or an Antichrist seeking to defeat, capture, possess, and utilize God’s elect. Since we are complicated in this way, we also need to be a Daniel and open our windows toward Jerusalem and pray that Christ will come in to cut off, to terminate, everything in us that is natural and part of the old creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fn5qgXckmMbBpLpBSOEwgA6_8jIf4Dwx_lYdW1ZdxDJHs5pSl-xH5SKJieHdSzz9y"> Christ becomes our centrality and universality by His appearing in two aspects. First, He has come to terminate us as the old creation and then to germinate us as the new <span class="pg" data-page-id="77" id="77">[77]</span> creation. Second, He will come to clear away all the beasts. Depending on our culture and nationality, we all have our own beasts. Those from one part of the world have one kind of beast, and those from another part have a different kind of beast. We need Christ to receive the kingdom from God and come to crush all the beasts and then to become a great mountain that comprises us and that fills the whole earth to be the kingdom of God. By terminating and germinating us and by crushing all the beasts in us, Christ is wrought into our being to become our centrality and universality. </p>

In His economy God administrates the universe in order to fulfill His purpose. His purpose is to give Christ the preeminence in all things. God’s intention, therefore, is that Christ should be preeminent. For Christ to be the preeminent One, God needs a people. Apart from God’s having a people, there is no way for Christ to be made preeminent. </p>

To see that Daniel prayed three times a day does not require enlightenment, but to see God’s economy in the book of Daniel requires vision, revelation, and enlightenment. Because we need vision, revelation, and enlightenment, Paul prayed that the Father would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59063" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17">Eph. 1:17</span>).

But with the ten toes there is a great problem, for when human government reaches the stage of the ten toes—the stage of Antichrist and his ten kings—it <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> will fight against God directly. Thus, human government not only rebels against God, exalts man, and worships idols but also fights against God directly.

It is in the new creation that Christ prepares a bride for Himself to marry.

<p data-content-id="K4ZZAZWBvl1YH7fJhM0YX2HFvCRDXat0oNlm4FTZp_U9olIvYQu6JWYgN55gJ1Awk"> I want to stress the fact that the bride requires maturity. Christ will not marry a bride who is immature. Only when we have reached maturity will He take us to be His bride. We must admit that in the Lord’s recovery we have not yet reached maturity; we are still too young to be presented to Christ as His bride. Thus, there is the urgent need for maturity. When Christ, the Bridegroom, sees that we have reached maturity, He will marry the bride and then come with her as His army to crush the human government. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lPtjHu2p3HK5FGWxjZMLsiTnPDH9aTbjC7zGgT70Lk2_cbuak5IRyFHc8XHnVsn6n">CHRIST AS THE CENTRALITY<br/>AND UNIVERSALITY IN GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="OiEyFt5PJNnftyobK4oIzpIL12rXnbPSi6gLch4U9ODDWbroAsKHlL-R7rgPidNHU"> After Christ has married His bride, He will come as the stone cut out without hands and will crush the great human image from the toes to the head, destroying the human government which fights against God directly. Through this crushing the whole earth will be cleared up. The problem of the human government in the old creation will be solved. Then Christ will increase from a stone to a great mountain that fills the whole earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59068" data-verses="Daniel 2:35">Dan. 2:35</span>). In this way Christ will be the centrality and the universality in God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="4wzTLryZ8ZZc_v_Yhh2RMgH5u8k8IxLH2skHe_4DIiVE_a2b_thLw6LltOW_9uIQG"> The stone refers to Christ as the centrality, and the mountain refers to Him as the universality. As the stone He is the center, the centrality; as the mountain He is the circumference, the universality. Today Christ must be the centrality and universality in our church life, family life, and daily life. If Christ is our centrality and universality in this way, He will also be the centrality and universality in God’s economy and in God’s move. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2Ll0loY69fMKOgVPHiL4FuaKZ24CuHEFr8YTqVWUJM-yAQKe7H3FKGBGDaURRpBoz">B. The Purpose</h2><p data-content-id="u8gkUDlc52JdHAoMLckA3wR3U6MaYuGgWoOEMYqJkAeTnYNuc_p7rHPUOduegeA55"> The purpose of the seventy weeks is to close the transgression, to make an end of sins, to make propitiation for iniquity, to bring in the righteousness of the ages, to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59096" data-verses="Daniel 9:24">v. 24b</span>). Today in the old creation under human government, transgression, sins, <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> and iniquity are prevailing. When Christ comes to crush human government, at the time appointed, the transgression will be closed, sins will be ended, and iniquity will be propitiated. </p>
<p data-content-id="f3Hlq81vQAw13Hs5SMnlsblQgq3j_R89r18fM_HQoAyRt-Os4O3xf3v7CdvVAi83A"> Then the righteousness of the ages will be brought in. The expression <em>of the ages</em> is a Hebrew idiom which means “eternity” or “eternal.” Hence, the righteousness of the ages is an eternal righteousness. The coming kingdom age will be an age of divine righteousness, and in the new heaven and new earth, there will be eternal righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59097" data-verses="2Peter 3:13">2 Pet. 3:13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="I3J1n8A-ozM0bUwxYPEWlNhuMtg66Yuk4IGYoeQD_fdJBeuJM4s21J5nju2NT0L9C"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59098" data-verses="Daniel 9:24">Daniel 9:24b</span> also speaks of the sealing up of vision and prophet. The vision and prophet will be sealed because everything will be fulfilled. There will, therefore, be no need of visions or prophets. In the kingdom age, there will be kings and priests but no prophets. </p>
<p data-content-id="HV6ZOsfqCmL78HngkufZYawduXJRb4NFRO7FzmJxaPTxWetuaTT6XsFo6RvHNvaqv"> The last aspect of the purpose of the seventy weeks is to anoint the holy of holies. At the time of Daniel’s prayer, the holy of holies was contaminated, defiled, and devastated. But when the apportioned time comes, the holy of holies will be properly anointed. This means that the service to God will be recovered. What a blessing! </p>

This refers to the crucifixion of Christ. The cutting off of Messiah—<span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> the crucifixion of Christ—was the termination of the old creation with the human government in the old creation and the germination through the resurrection of Christ of God’s new creation with God’s eternal kingdom as the divine administration in God’s new creation. Thus, the cross of Christ is the centrality and universality of God’s work. </p>
<p data-content-id="qtFjYT5b4xrj_Br7N9R2xKjiv3SoFY__-r3PpqJw-V2B72eFo6SqFDLHO8IgN_cCU"> This word concerning Messiah’s being cut off is not bad news but good news. Through His death on the cross, Christ terminated the old creation. Then in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59103" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>) to germinate those whom God has chosen and make them a new creation. If we see this, we will realize that the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59104" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">Daniel 9:26</span> about the death of Christ is good news. </p>
<p data-content-id="yNJFPY2CTWMZhd_JKx0y4J9rIt0BgEYkBolCbSE_0lbcERr4a6fDqox7bdCjZb7HP"> Whereas the first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59105" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">verse 26</span> speaks of the death of Christ, the remainder of this verse speaks of another matter. “The people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59106" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">v. 26b</span>). This reveals that the prince of the Roman Empire, Titus, would come with his army to destroy the city and the sanctuary—the temple. The Lord Jesus also prophesied concerning this destruction in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59107" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">Matthew 24:2</span>. This destruction took place in A.D. 70. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59108" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">Daniel 9:26c</span> goes on to say, the end of it would be with a flood, and even to the end there would be war. The desolations have been determined. </p>

In this gap the church is being secretly and mysteriously built by Christ in His resurrection to be the Body of Christ and bride of Christ. Also, in this gap Israel has been suffering, having lost their fathers’ homeland and having been scattered. Nevertheless, God has not forgotten His people Israel but continues to grant them some degree of mercy. Eventually, the last week of seven years will come. <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> </p>

The covenant he makes with them will be a peace agreement. However, in the middle of the seventieth week, Antichrist will change his mind, fight against God, and cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59110" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">v. 27b</span>). This will be the beginning of the great tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59111" data-verses="Matthew 24:21">Matt. 24:21</span>), which will last for three and a half years. During the great tribulation, both the faithful Jews and the Christians still on earth will suffer Antichrist’s persecution. </p>

<p data-content-id="K4ZZAZWBvl1YH7fJhM0YQ2HdnCRDXat0oNlm4FTZp_U9olIvYQu6JWYgN55gJ1Awk"> What Daniel received regarding the seventy weeks was not only a vision but also a report. Daniel understood the seventy weeks, but because we are near the end of the gap, I believe that we understand this matter even better than Daniel did. By studying the vision of seventy weeks in relation to God’s economy, we will be helped to know where we are, what we should be, and what we should be doing today. </p>

<p data-content-id="wQ_uY7xt5Sgi22e9s7ciH7fibcOVKfHYgfW91jDmuw3zDCJBQCS5EFu_ejmF_dRwy"> What we see outwardly is the physical world, but behind the physical world is the spiritual. In the spiritual world Christ is the preeminent One. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59119" data-verses="Daniel 10:1">chapter ten</span> He is mentioned first (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59120" data-verses="Daniel 10:4-9">vv. 4-9</span>). He is described as wearing a linen robe, being girded with a golden girdle, and having a body like beryl (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59121" data-verses="Daniel 10:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="rVmOioFt4Q7ikDjiJmfOcNf3_75gFAtStvJa_DkMkHt6Sf1IlTzucyyybFe7WvPJh"> After this vision of Christ, an angelic messenger came to tell Daniel about the things behind the physical world. He told Daniel that he himself was fighting against the prince of the kingdom of Persia, a rebellious evil spirit. Then Daniel was told that there was another evil spirit, the prince of Greece (Javan). There was also the archangel Michael, who was a prince fighting for Israel. At least four spirits are covered here. </p>
<p data-content-id="dTT1WBtWDnDYztMEWfoFNiRoFe_h9o086G-6g_2ltV2Mb0F11XaFgQ1lCr9WLDKem"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59122" data-verses="Daniel 5:1">chapter five</span> we saw how Belshazzar was indulging in debauchery and how in the same night Darius the Mede came <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> to defeat him and kill him. We did not see that there was a spirit fighting for Darius. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59123" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">Daniel 11:1</span> says, “I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, stood up to support and strengthen him.” Darius was strong even as an old man because this heavenly messenger stood up to support him and strengthen him. The angelic messenger strengthened Darius to defeat the Babylonians because the Babylonian Empire’s commission from God had been completed. With the death of Belshazzar, the Babylonian Empire became the empire of Medo-Persia to carry out another commission for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="QY6HARLc6-ap_Lxi7vVZdSV3yue9woq0-7xGq4fD8K_qIut2bizhVRh6efwU31UdS"> Darius the Mede was the first one to conquer the Babylonian Empire. However, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59124" data-verses="Daniel 8:1">Daniel 8</span> a ram, signifying Persia, was seen with two horns. The second horn was higher than the first, referring to Cyrus the Persian who assumed power two years later in 536 B.C. In the first year of his reign, Cyrus issued a decree to release all the captives of Israel back to the land of their forefathers and to rebuild the temple. Because Cyrus supported them, supplied them, and protected them, Isaiah said that Cyrus was a shepherd of God to take care of God’s people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59125" data-verses="Isaiah 44:28">Isa. 44:28</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="K4ZZAZWBvl1YH7fJhM0YR2HJtCRDXat0oNlm4FTZp_U9olIvYQu6JWYgN55gJ1Awk"> Apparently, all of these struggles are merely the activities of human governments represented by the great human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59126" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>. Actually, God was behind the physical world managing the entire situation. This is what we need to see as we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59127" data-verses="Daniel 10:1">chapter ten</span> of Daniel and the vision of Israel’s destiny in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59128" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. </p>

The Hebrew word translated <em>distress</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59130" data-verses="Daniel 10:1">10:1b</span> denotes trial, distress, conflict, warfare, or an army. Here it refers to a great distress suffered by God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> people. That distress came upon Israel from a war between the king of the south and the king of the north, referring to Egypt and Syria respectively. When Syria and Egypt fought each other, they waged war on Israel’s land because it was used as a thoroughfare for the two kings to invade each other. These wars were a distress, a trial, to the children of Israel. This was especially true of the war that was waged by a descendant of one of the four successors of Alexander the Great who was at that time the king of Syria. This descendant, Antiochus Epiphanes, a full type of Antichrist, was a real trial sent by God to His chosen people, because they had become corrupt after their return from captivity. </p>

The excellent Christ, the centrality and universality of God’s move on the earth, appeared to Daniel for his appreciation, consolation, encouragement, expectation, and stabilization. </p>
<p data-content-id="SxLl_Fcrgldpe266mp3WTygOMDt21ZMHb9WaWqGGUcOgWcZAuRWihXjGoWE6IDsLZ"> Before showing Daniel the great distress, God revealed to him the excellent man described in these verses.

His priesthood is signified by the linen robe. He appeared to Daniel not wearing armor for fighting but dressed in a linen robe, the Old Testament priestly garment. In typology, linen signifies humanity. The fact that Christ is clothed in linen signifies that His humanity is His priestly robe. At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59138" data-verses="Daniel 10:1">Daniel 10</span>, Christ Himself, God’s centrality and universality, was a Priest taking care of the children of Israel in captivity.

Christ’s kingship is signified not by linen but by gold. His priesthood is human, whereas His kingship is divine. </p>

The Hebrew word for <em>beryl</em> here is not easily translated. Darby uses the term <em>chrysolite.</em> The Hebrew word could refer to a bluish-green or yellow precious stone. <span class="pg" data-page-id="95" id="95">[95]</span> This signifies that Christ in His embodiment is divine (yellow), full of life (green), and heavenly (blue). </p>

His gleam in His work and moves is signified by His arms and His feet being like the gleam of polished bronze (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59143" data-verses="Daniel 10:6">v. 6d</span>). In typology, bronze signifies God’s judgment, which makes people bright. God’s judgment is a kind of trial.

<p data-content-id="AR-IBymFsr9M1WrYmIVS23dWoiTwUaA7AlfSrHlchFVZ3jG-mTUSgw_eS0mnMoGJA"> The vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59154" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">chapter eleven</span> covers the details of the Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire to its very end under Antichrist. As we will see, shortly after defeating the kingdom of Persia, Alexander the Great died, and his kingdom was divided into four kingdoms under his four generals. Two of these kingdoms, Egypt and Syria, fought wars back and forth through the land of Israel. Eventually, this chapter stresses the kingdoms and evils of two kings: Antiochus Epiphanes, one of the kings of the north (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59155" data-verses="Daniel 11:21-35">vv. 21-35</span>), and Antichrist, the king of the restored Roman Empire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59156" data-verses="Daniel 11:36-45">vv. 36-45</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Fn5qgXckmMbBpLpBSOEwkA6z2jIf4Dwx_lYdW1ZdxDJHs5pSl-xH5SKJieHdSzz9y"> I would emphasize once again that the great human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59157" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span> is the controlling factor of the entire prophecy of this book. This means that the principle of Daniel’s prophecy <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> is to cover the entire human image from the head (Babylon) to the toes (Antichrist with the ten kings). We may say that the first five chapters of Daniel give us a full definition and description of the Babylonian Empire. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59158" data-verses="Daniel 6:1">Chapter six</span> begins to speak concerning the Persian Empire. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59159" data-verses="Daniel 7:1">chapter seven</span> we have a sketch of the four beasts, which from another angle portray the empires signified by the various parts of the great image. The ram in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59160" data-verses="Daniel 8:1">chapter eight</span> refers to the Persian Empire, and the goat, to the Grecian Empire. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59161" data-verses="Daniel 9:1">chapter nine</span> Daniel received the vision of the seventy weeks, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59162" data-verses="Daniel 10:1">chapter ten</span>, the vision concerning the excellent Christ, the One who is the centrality and universality of God’s move. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59163" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">Chapter eleven</span> provides further details regarding the Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the restored Roman Empire under Antichrist during the last three and a half years of this age. From this we see that the book of Daniel covers the entire human government from the Babylonian Empire to the Roman Empire. In keeping with this principle, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59164" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">chapter eleven</span> does not stop with the Grecian Empire but includes a word about Antichrist, the king of the restored Roman Empire. </p>
<p data-content-id="C85LY8JSHLzmQE1cibF-SOPhg3kBhWjYWp4DmXqF7BHFaNjuDplBK75kuuvQQfy0W"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59165" data-verses="Daniel 11:1">Daniel 11</span> speaks first of the type, Antiochus Epiphanes, and then of the fulfillment of that type, Antichrist. This is according to the principle found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59166" data-verses="Daniel 9:26-27">9:26-27</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59167" data-verses="Daniel 9:26">Verse 26a</span> speaks of Christ’s crucifixion. Then the rest of the verse refers to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by Titus and his army in A.D. 70. However, the next verse refers not to Titus but to Antichrist, the one who makes “a firm covenant with the many for one week.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59168" data-verses="Daniel 9:26-27">9:26-27</span> first the type is revealed, then the fulfillment.

The first time was by the head, Nebuchadnezzar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59219" data-verses="Daniel 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>); the second was by Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of one of the four generals of Alexander the Great’s Grecian Empire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59220" data-verses="Daniel 8:9-14">8:9-14</span>); the third was by Titus, a prince of the Roman Empire (70 A.D.); the fourth will be by Antichrist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59221" data-verses="Daniel 12:7">12:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59222" data-verses="Daniel 12:11">11</span>), part of the ten toes of the restored Roman Empire.
