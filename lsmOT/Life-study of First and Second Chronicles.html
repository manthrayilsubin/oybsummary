<p data-content-id="1jJr-vV-0tBwJ8gug9IRWRJvbmABWLXzxCi2QUhPZxLsiMTTS-llB7XWgwsHr4RpO"> There are twelve historical books in the Old Testament. The first three are Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, and the last three are Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther. In between these two groups of three books, there are three pairs of books: 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles. With this message we begin the life-study of 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther. The burden of the life-study of these books can be expressed in the following four statements: </p>
<p data-content-id="9vbo7xbYi8rrEJnN0hvem77ScrKyx0lB8S6xHJSd_l_zHR1a5Ko0vGc29g2iZHPYi"> 1. In the eternal economy of God, the Father has allotted the Son, the all-inclusive Christ typified by the good land, to the believers as their eternal portion and has transferred them into Him that they may partake of Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46478" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Col. 1:12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46479" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46480" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="joE-FeHqPyEHmd5nXY0wsPfZLKrT-mgm9MZMihcBCGGJhccYrgtgU5Gur7qqnb7KH"> 2. The enjoyment of Christ differs in degrees according to the believers’ pursuing of Christ and their faithfulness to Him, and the highest attainment of pursuing Christ is to reign with Christ in His divine life through His abounding grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46481" data-verses="Philippians 3:13-14">Phil. 3:13-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46482" data-verses="Romans 5:17">Rom. 5:17b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46483" data-verses="Romans 5:21">21b</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Tjlyl65rqVRwA6jqmI22vN6LZtKMyF93ny7I4BWGW16nPPaB5CNvX-P0gHp5ZYWoI"> 3. The captivity of the believers by the enemy is the top failure of the believers in the enjoyment of Christ by not knowing the power of Christ’s resurrection nor living by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46484" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46485" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19b</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="nbwluagkK-hO6RYjvcKQ7mKsLHlpgrdLa9kySWvNnCW8t_x3Y6uwZAEw01zVF5iDB"> 4. The omnipresent and omnipotent Triune God became the hiding God in taking care of His chosen people in the dispersion of their captivity, in the most wise secrecy of His highest sovereignty (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46486" data-verses="Esther 1:1">Esth. 1—10</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="sOaCwCnsVRiz45oHrh5IyP-yf1v8Mq2nzKzg569c_p4QeURt2b6Xeewi1YfRNweDc"> The Bible actually tells us only one thing—God’s eternal economy according to the good pleasure of His heart’s desire. Our God is exceedingly great, and surely He must have a good pleasure. Based upon His good pleasure He made an eternal economy. The reality, the center, and the goal of God’s economy is the all-inclusive and excellent Christ. The entire Bible is for this one thing, not for anything else. </p>
<p data-content-id="wshxshmeYT9cBQjeEiN8lFPHGPpykBoUr2Pkc3w8lRVhllQilqPZENK2DLhQOsHsN"> The Bible is arranged in two sections. The first section, the Old Testament, is the section of pictures. God is surely the best writer, and He uses pictures in the first thirty-nine books of His writing in the Bible. These books are therefore full of pictures accompanied by prophecies. The pictures are the types, figures, and shadows in the Old Testament. For instance, Adam is “a type of Him who was to come” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46487" data-verses="Romans 5:14">Rom. 5:14</span>). Some types are also prophecies. These prophecies are not in plain words but in pictures. The greatest type in the Old Testament is the history of the people of Israel, who typify God’s people on earth today. Thus, the history of Israel in the Old Testament is a big type signifying things to come. </p>
<p data-content-id="LhK-3CxjzlGC641GDiya6yYtPaIwhDQUp3I7zT3Lmmd9MB8kJPg_curHNZQJkiI3y"> When we come to the twelve books of history in the Old Testament, we should not be distracted by the history presented in these books. Why, then, should we pay attention to the books of history? To answer this question we need to realize that the entire Bible is for God’s economy with Christ as the reality, the center, and the goal. In our reading of the books of history, we need to pray and seek the proper interpretation of all the types and prophecies in these books. In particular, we need to find and know the intrinsic significance of all the types. We should focus our attention on the center of these types, which is Christ as the center of God’s economy. Therefore, as we are seeking to know the intrinsic significance of what is recorded in the books of history in the Old Testament, we must endeavor to link the history books to God’s economy. This is what we are doing in this life-study. </p>

Regarding this matter, we should compare <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46488" data-verses="2Chronicles 36:22-23">2 Chronicles 36:22-23</span> with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46489" data-verses="Ezra 1:1-3">Ezra 1:1-3a</span>. The repetition in these two portions might be a proof that 1 and 2 Chronicles were written by Ezra, the writer of the book of Ezra. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CJmdIm1ZKnPFg86u5aAUo1sSUK3vH1lB_inZbfpHBTwEVeS7cuj90mbQNUHdlKNzr">III. THE TIME</h2><p data-content-id="P2KC5iFbifxxPGgzdbjrYSJ_qHjnD-K5k4gR_YCLGp1wplZLBGt3ailKYLwONjlAv"> The first book covers about 41 years, from 1056 to 1015 B.C., not including the forefathers’ genealogy. The second book covers about 479 years, from 1015 to 536 B.C. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-IJ30908lzavrclfCTxwcQu0cMoDwDwZ419EBTYjXPOEyFp7sxDoGbhfTkMAFf0QB">IV. THE PLACE</h2><p data-content-id="p2naf9824QHE73OEZfvRAy4b0HaTQnLK6zo9TC3f3mIyObta1XfUyg8OZKSluMXgo"> These two books might have been written in Jerusalem after Ezra’s coming back from the captivity. </p>

THE CONTENT</h2><p data-content-id="WxsMS_ZC2khYZTJoTFTyt06eRdEDfRD54BqNEu9m0-TNrjGVAbK5FeyGSimo4X0gt"> The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles cover the genealogy of mankind from Adam to Abraham and the genealogy of God’s elect from Abraham to the family of Saul, and the history of Israel from Saul the king to Israel’s return from their captivity. From this we see that 1 and 2 Chronicles cover three kinds of history: the history from Adam to Abraham, which concerns the whole world; the history from Abraham to Saul, which concerns the forefathers of the race of Israel, before they were formed into a nation; and the history of the kingdom of Israel, from the time of Saul to the coming back from their captivity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="24Uuy-GVy16oDkN2aJPV54X19XKo9skwAQhFSJ92pl424HGJCzrAKLMYXDRRVD5Qo">VI. THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</h2><p data-content-id="ugyWgE8NNFHtYVRrwwlOo33-CXG8MPnEc4eouXm3kgFUIN6wKk8BDb6tL6rudfto8"> The matter of the central thought of 1 and 2 Chronicles is very crucial. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="f50e0RkOiPJ8WKPM6WdG0hz8vAEXcRtCZl3LZKk9AtwOE6IUofWBVyUm6DKtF0XtZ">A. To Give a Full Chronology<br/>of God’s Move in Man’s History</h2><p data-content-id="IUNHJv111Av58IhcC8lf-Agxu9d8SLLcoU5PLVfav0y5CNfVHGzhYSd4s1SN9-BQp"> The central thought is, first, to give us a full chronology of God’s move in man’s history by including the genealogy from Adam to Samuel, indicating that God’s move in man’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> history to prepare the way for God to carry out His eternal economy in humanity by becoming a man that man may become God is not a matter that concerns only the history of God’s elect but a matter that concerns the history of the entire race of mankind. The central point of view in 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings is the chosen people of God, but in 1 and 2 Chronicles it is the entire race of mankind. This needs a lineage not from Samuel but from Adam to Christ, which corresponds to the genealogy of Christ as recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46490" data-verses="Luke 3:1">Luke 3</span>, not as presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46491" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span>. The view in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46492" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> is narrow and is limited to Israel. The view in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46493" data-verses="Luke 3:1">Luke 3</span> is broad and includes all of mankind. This is a strong evidence that the coming Christ as the embodiment of God is not only for the one race chosen by God but for the entire human race created by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="HwIpdkEUTjCH-CI6LadlzIzqTXz039KT2pSCYglyoJOHFSiBF3pbtiaOn5Zed17SV"> We need to see that God’s move is in man’s history. Have you ever heard such a phrase as “God’s move in man’s history”? Do you believe that in today’s tumultuous world situation God is still moving in man’s history? We need to believe that God has been moving and is still moving in and through man’s history. In Adam’s history God moved, and in Abel’s history God also moved. This was a move on the positive side. But God moved even in Cain’s history. This was a move on the negative side. </p>
<p data-content-id="XkMQ9x-DXZ45OVFXU8Xz5K-s6K3knibRwVc1busxNQK-NURLRBHDVK4AAo8jahOQJ"> I can testify from my observation of the world situation since 1918 and from my study of the prophecies in the Bible that God surely moves in man’s history. Let us consider, for example, the dispute over Palestine, that is, over the good land, that has been going on for hundreds of years. Who is the landlord, the rightful owner, of the good land—Israel or the Arabs? The Jews say that Palestine is the land of their forefathers, and the Arabs claim that it is the land of their forefathers. This issue has not been settled but is still on the negotiating table. The statesmen involved in these negotiations are foolish men, for they do not know God or the Word of God, the Bible, yet they are talking about God’s affairs. God is the landlord of Palestine, and only He can solve the problem concerning this land. I believe that while the statesmen are negotiating over the ownership of the good <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> land, the Lord is in the heavens laughing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46494" data-verses="Psalms 2:4">Psa. 2:4</span>). The decision regarding the good land will not be made by statesmen; it will be made by the One who is in the heavens. Soon the Lord Jesus may come back and settle this matter. When He comes He may say to the statesmen of the world, “This is not your business—it is My business.” </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZMvrMR9onfKGxpWhQbwANRYvrEnA9Q_EnGJ_bcNdsVqrqaw_e5FDboN0gDyVv8QrD">MAN CREATED<br/>ACCORDING TO GOD’S KIND</h2><p data-content-id="AneIxrUFdbtZjwaLlpWmhbMVt3DX9vA6qKOcIdwuePagF7F5PLgVj0AXLwJYTEcwo"> After God created the heavens and the earth, one of the angels rebelled and became God’s enemy, Satan. This ruined God’s original creation. Eventually, God came in to repair, remodel, and restore the universe. In this restoration God created billions of living creatures, including all kinds of birds and animals. Although God created so many living creatures, not one of these creatures was like Him. So God made man in His image and according to His likeness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46517" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). Therefore, man was not created according to his own kind but according to God’s kind. God did not create mankind; He created man according to God’s kind. </p>
<p data-content-id="FfIl0ughVGuGeVgFBw0M0fjpl0xhChQ3NmtMjzXrkJV-_QZ-wsaU17r6mWyk-d0aF"> After God finished the creation of Adam and his wife, He looked upon everything that He had made. As He looked upon the earth and everything in it, only Adam and Eve were His delight, His “hobby.” Only they could make God happy because only they were His kind. When God looked at Adam, He might have said, “I am pleased to see man. This is My hobby; this is My kind.” However, God’s hobby was far from complete because at that time man had only God’s image and God’s likeness but not God’s life and God’s nature. Man had God’s image, but he did not have God Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> </p>

God is almighty and omnipotent, but He never does things in a fast way. We may have an idea and then act upon it immediately. God is not like this. He is very slow and full of patience. He made an economy in eternity past. Then He created the heavens and the earth. Later He repaired and restored the ruined creation, and as the last work in His restoration and further creation, God created man, His hobby. Yet that was not God’s real hobby. God’s real hobby is that God Himself would become a man. </p>
<p data-content-id="OemLBEnR6G3SgHme6Gn3vbxD8TVK8T7RO0_8g_thwCX7CJALjFqr1rASxUDjZfgjZ"> After Adam’s fall and after promising Eve that He would come as the seed of the woman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46518" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Gen. 3:15</span>), God waited thousands of years before becoming a man. If I had been His companion, I would have said, “God, since the desire of Your heart is that You become a man, why would You not do this right now? You told the fallen man that You would come as the seed of the woman. Why would You not come as this seed today?” If God had been asked such questions, He might have said, “I am not small like you are. I am great, and with Me a thousand years are as one day.” </p>
<p data-content-id="4Remt-VzqMEfjzW5RFAL3K5o4l1kz__DF3kWhG05zKKaMosr3_DIs20kMgwpGL-7L"> Approximately two thousand years after making the promise in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46519" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>, God promised Abraham a seed that would be a blessing to all the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46520" data-verses="Genesis 22:18">22:18</span>). God seemed to be saying, “Abraham, you will have a seed. This seed will be I Myself becoming a man to be the blessing to all the earth.” Unable to be patient, Abraham followed Sarah’s suggestion that he have a child by her handmaid, Hagar. Instead of producing the promised seed, Abraham produced a wrong one, Ishmael. God, however, continued to wait before becoming a man. </p>
<p data-content-id="opkoyapd4hroYE46YzvT3Tzpec9GrB27976vfSpeaTFb9EgKY3swDkW5nQZfCuBVQ"> After another thousand years, up to David’s time, God still had not come as a man.

God prophesied to David concerning this seed, but He still did not come as a man. </p>

These many grains are actually many gods as the reproduction of God. The first grain—the first God-man—was a prototype, and the many grains—the many God-men—produced by this one grain through death and resurrection are the mass reproduction. This is the reproduction of God. When some hear that God has been reproduced, they may be shocked and say that such a word is nonsensical. Nevertheless, this is what is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46525" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHQHT3uefGzNRAi4T48qZiYX4w0b9Zz-4h4261G312QWPtsYe8exoJt9bNU_XU3qB"> God’s real hobby is to have His reproduction in many nations around the globe. Such a reproduction makes God happy because His reproduction looks like Him, speaks like Him, and lives like Him.

Some do live by God’s life, but they do not live by His life continually. Perhaps in the morning they live by God’s life, but later in the day they may lose their temper and live like a scorpion. This means that in the morning they are gods, but later they are “scorpions.” In the evening they may become even worse, living like the devil, Satan. It is not too much to say that a believer in Christ can live like Satan. One day the Lord Jesus turned to Peter, someone who loved Him, and said to him, “Get behind Me, Satan!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46526" data-verses="Matthew 16:23">Matt. 16:23a</span>).

You have spoken that the believers have become God in life and in nature, yet what are you now? Are you God or are you something else?” My answer has been to repent and ask for the Lord’s forgiveness because at least some of the things I did were not in Him or according to Him. This realization has revolutionized me. </p>

On the other hand, God has a recovery on earth, and His recovery has been under His leading for seventy-two years. During these years He has released thousands of printed messages, and these messages are in thousands of homes. These messages have been received in many countries around the world. On a regular basis I receive letters of appreciation. Recently someone wrote to me saying that he had been listening to lies about us, but when he read the <em>Life-study of Galatians,</em> his eyes were <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> opened and he could see the truth.

<p data-content-id="8j-GYe7SyHFX-EKbf3MQ7eU7tHS9DQvwIL4mhCRsmOFvG7yWKV8yV6nDObQbgdRIY"> God made man after His kind. This means that before the fall of man there was no mankind, only God’s kind. Contrary to the definitions given in Webster’s dictionary, from God’s point of view the word <em>mankind</em> is a negative term, for there should be no mankind, only the man created by God as God’s kind. However, after the fall man separated himself from God and became mankind. Through this fall Satan came in to cause trouble, and the whole world was thrown into confusion. </p>

This God-man, through His death and resurrection, has made a mass reproduction of Himself. He as the one grain became many grains (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46591" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>).

Among us there is no difference in nationality, race, or social rank (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46594" data-verses="Colossians 3:11">Col. 3:11</span>). We are a new kind, “God-man kind.” </p>

In Christ God and man have become one entity, the God-man. In God’s creation there was no mankind; there was only man as God’s kind. It was through man’s fall that mankind came into existence. Eventually God became a man to have a mass reproduction of Himself and thereby to produce a new kind. This new kind is neither God’s kind nor mankind—it is God-man kind. Today as believers in Christ, we are God-man kind; we are God-men. </p>

How could we be blended into one Body? This is now possible because of the great changes that have taken place on earth during the past fifty years. Through the modern means of transportation and communication, people from all over the earth can be blended. In our semi-annual trainings saints come together from as many as fifty nations. The globe today has become a small earth-ball, making <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> it possible for me to speak the holy Word to people from so many different nations. </p>

I answered her, saying that I did not have any burden to go to the United States. But she told me that I should keep the checks and that sooner or later the Lord would send me to the United States. Twenty years later I visited this country, and eventually I became a citizen. This was the Lord’s doing. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46595" data-verses="Acts 5:31">Acts 5:31</span> tells us that in His ascension the Lord Jesus is the Leader and the Savior.

From fallen mankind God chose Abraham to be the father of another people, and then two thousand years later God became a man and lived on earth as a God-man.

Actually, what God wants is not merely Christians or even believers in Christ; He wants a big group of God-men.

However, after the fifth century the truth concerning this last mystery was gradually lost. Using the Nicene Creed, today’s Christianity affirms the first two mysteries—the mystery of the Divine Trinity and the mystery of Christ’s person—but much of Christianity does not see anything about the third mystery—the mystery of God becoming man that man may become God in life and in nature. There is no teaching regarding this among most Christians today. But I feel strongly the Lord is going to recover this truth. As far as the truth is concerned, this may be the last item that the Lord needs to recover. </p>

Those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts to seek Jehovah came with the Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice (that is, to offer their offerings) to the God of their fathers, thus strengthening the kingdom of Judah and supporting Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46664" data-verses="2Chronicles 11:13-17">vv. 13-17</span>). Taking the proper ground and keeping the fundamental faith attracted the seekers of God, and they went to Jerusalem to join Rehoboam for the kingdom of God. However, actually he was not for the kingdom of God; he was for his own monarchy. </p>

God’s dealing with His people in the details of their living is for His people to enjoy the good land, Christ, in a very proper way. To enjoy the good land, the kings had to stand on the proper ground and they had to be fundamental, keeping the faith given by God through Moses. </p>
<p data-content-id="i-H-R0n9uUo7SerJsqpzhP9H2imce_Rmtfeww7ex8NFea5K0xFmSLVhrVW-zE4RUo"> It is the same with us today. The church ground is quite important, and to keep all the truths, to be fundamental, is also important. Today’s Christians claim to be fundamental, but they are fundamental only in part. They are not fundamental in full. Through the years we have been trying our best, by God’s mercy and grace, to be perfectly fundamental, that is, to be fundamental not just in part but in full. </p>

The hundreds of missionaries who came to China from Europe and America were faithful in a sense, but they did not make clear to the Chinese Christians the basic truth of the assurance of salvation. The missionaries translated the Bible, preached from the Bible, and taught the Bible, but they did not point out that the believers in Christ could have and should have the assurance of their salvation. After Brother Nee was raised up by the Lord, he preached and taught the truth concerning the assurance of salvation, and I followed him to do this. Wherever we went we asked people if they knew whether or not they were saved. When we would ask this question, the pastors and preachers would laugh at us and tell us that we were proud for saying that we knew that we were saved. In this situation Brother Nee fought the battle for the truth concerning the assurance of salvation. Today millions of Chinese Christians everywhere believe in the assurance of salvation. They know that as long as they believe in the Lord Jesus, they are saved and may have the assurance that they have been saved. The situation now is very different from the situation when Brother Nee began to fight for this basic truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="yclPiusGkjtPRpqWwUmj6gTnmbIjymhelYSkebPZoZ1VUokvQvAxG8T_CHy5_N1hY"> Brother Nee continued to fight for the truth, and eventually he released the truth regarding Christ as our life and our taking Christ as life. This was another truth which the missionaries in China did not make clear to the believers. Once the believers have the assurance of their salvation, they need to see that they have Christ in them as their life and that they should take Christ as their life and live by Christ. </p>

In particular, the Lord has recovered the truth concerning the New Jerusalem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46708" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span>. Many expositors of the Bible do not have the proper understanding of what the New Jerusalem is. Very few Bible teachers have written anything about the spiritual significance of the New Jerusalem. Among these few are a German teacher from long ago named Tersteegen and our dear friend T. Austin-Sparks, whom I <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> regard as the last of the inner-life teachers. Like Tersteegen, T. Austin-Sparks saw that the New Jerusalem is not a physical city but a sign with a spiritual significance. Brother Sparks pointed out that the spiritual things concerning God, Christ, and the church are mysterious and that God uses signs to reveal the truth regarding such spiritual things. We took his word and still hold to it. </p>
<p data-content-id="7N8Nr3rD_hmSmhHxCATV-Nh-5F224gvGv2fmI4AIaAik2hVQ5XHmp-O3FSzOu7twM"> The book of Revelation opens with a word about signs: “The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John.” This indicates that the revelation in this book is composed of signs, that is, symbols with a spiritual significance, such as the seven lampstands, signifying the seven churches, and the Lamb, signifying Christ the Redeemer as the unique sacrifice to accomplish God’s eternal redemption. Even the New Jerusalem is a sign, the last and consummate sign, signifying the ultimate consummation of God’s economy. In the last fifty years, the truth concerning the New Jerusalem has become more and more clear to us. As a result, in our hymnal there are a number of hymns on the New Jerusalem. </p>

Among the many truths there are three great mysteries which were discovered by the church fathers in the second century: the mystery of the Divine Trinity, the mystery of Christ’s person, and the mystery of man’s deification—that God became a man that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. Although Christians hold the truth concerning the Triune God and the truth concerning the person of Christ, after the first five centuries the truth concerning deification was gradually lost. In February of this year, I became burdened to release messages on this truth. </p>

Furthermore, another brother told me about a book, written in Arabic by a Catholic priest, which says the same thing about man becoming God. In order to be perfectly fundamental, we need to be clear concerning this great truth—the truth that God became a man that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. </p>

God’s people in the Old Testament received of God through Moses a set of books called the <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> law. Today God is dealing with us not according to the law but according to the compound, life-giving, indwelling, consummated Spirit. In the Old Testament time, God’s people were required to behave themselves according to the law.

God’s choosing of this ground according to His ordination is clearly <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46726" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:1">Deuteronomy 12</span>, a chapter that we need to study carefully. </p>
<p data-content-id="LhK-3CxjzlGC641GDiya6yYtPaIwhDQUp3I7zT3LvmdYEB8kJPg_curHNZQJkiI3y"> Jerusalem is the place chosen by God to be His worship center for the whole earth. Today statesmen and world leaders are debating about who the rightful owner of Jerusalem is. This debate is foolish, and those who are debating do not know what they are talking about, for they do not know that God is the owner of Jerusalem. Jerusalem, the center of God’s worship, belongs to the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="mZjDXmNlJOsTesDMwsN-Hk_lalxq-89VO8zUPesjJi83fBM5erkozVRezYbvM0FFl"> We may say that God’s choice of Jerusalem as the worship center began with His word to Abraham in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46727" data-verses="Genesis 22:2">Genesis 22:2</span>. God told Abraham to go to the land of Moriah and to offer Isaac (a type of Christ) upon one of the mountains of which God would tell him. The place—Mount Moriah—where Abraham offered Isaac was also the site—Mount Zion—selected by God for the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46728" data-verses="2Chronicles 3:1">2 Chron. 3:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46729" data-verses="2Samuel 24:25">2 Sam. 24:25</span>). Zion is actually a peak of Mount Moriah. When Solomon was about to build the temple, there was no need for him to select a place because the place had already been selected by God and made known to David. I believe that this site was the very spot where Isaac was offered to God by his father. The choice of this place was God’s ordination. </p>
<p data-content-id="Tjlyl65rqVRwA6jqmI22vN6LZtKMyF93ny7I4BWGf16CFPaB5CNvX-P0gHp5ZYWoI"> The kings of Judah remained on the proper ground, Jerusalem, chosen by God, but the kings of Israel abandoned the God-ordained ground. Jeroboam even set up other worship centers in Bethel and Dan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46730" data-verses="1Kings 12:29-30">1 Kings 12:29-30</span>). This action was an abomination in the eyes of the Lord. The kings of Judah were right with respect to the ground. The proper ground, the unique ground, the ground chosen, ordained, and established by God, signifies the ground on which we should practice the church life today. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="nbwluagkK-hO6RYjvcKQ7mKsLHlpgrdLa9kySWvNuCWdm_x3Y6uwZAEw01zVF5iDB">THE KINGS OF JUDAH KEEPING<br/>THEIR FUNDAMENTAL FAITH IN GOD’S WORD</h2><p data-content-id="6PuEjiXPN3FPM8A_ilTvpKP6xaBxY_unNp4NAY2D3_99_lLOiVENn0QAI6ix41qPW"> The kings of Judah also kept their belief in the Word of God given by Moses. Therefore, regarding their faith they were fundamental. Thus the kings of Judah were right in two things: remaining on the proper ground and keeping the fundamental faith in God’s Word. <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> </p>

During the reign of Rehoboam, the Levites abandoned their pasture lands and their property and went to Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46731" data-verses="2Chronicles 11:13-14">2 Chron. 11:13-14</span>). Moreover, “those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came after them to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah, the God of their fathers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46732" data-verses="2Chronicles 11:16">v. 16</span>). Not only the priests and Levites but all those who sought Jehovah in other tribes gave up their property and came to the worship center in Jerusalem. Later, during the reign of Asa, “many from Israel threw in their lot with him when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46733" data-verses="2Chronicles 15:9">15:9</span>). They were attracted to Jerusalem because the kings of Judah stood on the proper ground and kept the fundamental faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="wshxshmeYT9cBQjeEiN8lFPHGPpykBoUr2Pkc3w8sRVhhlQilqPZENK2DLhQOsHsN"> However, this is not all that we should have. We have seen that the kings of Judah were on the proper ground of Jerusalem and that they kept the fundamental faith, but now we need to consider how they behaved themselves. </p>

The correct interpretation of the pictures in the history of the kings of Judah recorded in the books of Chronicles is that these kings are examples showing us that it is not sufficient for us who love God and seek Christ only to stand on the right ground and keep the fundamental truth. We also need to take care of who we are, how we behave, and how we conduct ourselves. We must also pay attention to our interest, our intention, our purpose, our goal, our attitude, and our way of speaking. For example, we should pay attention to the tone of our voice. Sometimes our tone of voice may be like that of a roaring lion, not like that of a God-man. <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="ZMvrMR9onfKGxpWhQbwANRYvrEnA9Q_EnGJ_bcNdmVq2oaw_e5FDboN0gDyVv8QrD"> The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles give us many examples of how the kings of Judah conducted themselves in the good land. These examples show how they were, how they behaved themselves, how they did things, how they faced different situations, what their intentions were, what their interests were, and what their goals were as kings in the good land. These examples refer to the way we conduct ourselves in the details of our daily living. </p>
<p data-content-id="AneIxrUFdbtZjwaLlpWmhbMVt3DX9vA6qKOcIdwuUPa5G7F5PLgVj0AXLwJYTEcwo"> Consider the daily situation in your married life. You are on the proper ground of the church and you keep the fundamental faith, but how do you speak to your spouse? How do you treat your spouse? What is your attitude toward your wife or husband? In your married life do you walk according to the spirit or according to something else? Do you live the life of a God-man with your husband or wife? </p>
<p data-content-id="FfIl0ughVGuGeVgFBw0M0fjpl0xhChQ3NmtMjzXruJVX1QZ-wsaU17r6mWyk-d0aF"> In order to live the life of a God-man, we must be crucified. We must be dying to live. If we live a crucified life in our married life, then in our married life we will have the living of a God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="CJmdIm1ZKnPFg86u5aAUo1sSUK3vH1lB_inZbfpHITwITeS7cuj90mbQNUHdlKNzr"> Many saints are very good in the church meetings and in the church service, but at home they may live the life not of a God-man but of a “scorpion-man,” exchanging words or quarreling. A certain couple may love the Lord and His recovery. However, at dinner the husband may criticize his wife for her attitude, and she may condemn him for his way of speaking. Then after dinner they attend the meeting of their vital group. But how can these two “scorpions” be vital? Because of such a daily situation, in this country it is very difficult to find a genuine vital group. According to my observation, in the vital groups I have seen only deadness, not vitality. All the vital members should be God-men, crucified in their natural life to live a God-man life by the divine life within them. </p>

Burning the incense was the duty of the priests, not of the kings. Uzziah, however, was proud and did not care for anyone other than himself. Therefore, he went into the temple to do the service of a priest. Azariah the priest, with eighty priests of valor, withstood him to stop him from burning incense to God. Uzziah became angry with the priests, and leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests. Because of the uncleanness of his leprosy, the priests rushed him out of the temple of God and put him in a separate house as a leper until the day of his <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46766" data-verses="2Chronicles 26:17-21">vv. 17-21a</span>).

God also needed a land for His people that He might form a nation to set up His testimony. This testimony was set up according to the law of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="reAF4ghdhwq6b6NAmxqQboROZ2LKtPGweOYvNbv_Xv-Rneo61S8q78bX1W_rl95v-"> We need to know what the law of God is. Some fundamental Christians may say the law of God consists mainly of the Ten Commandments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46834" data-verses="Exodus 20:1-17">Exo. 20:1-17</span>), that is, the moral law. However, the Ten Commandments with their statutes and ordinances occupy only a few chapters, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46835" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20—24</span>. However, the law of God occupies not only these chapters but all the chapters from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46836" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20</span> to the end of Leviticus. Then what is the rest of God’s law? The rest of God’s law is the ceremonial law. From this we see that the law of God comprises the moral law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46837" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exo. 20—24</span>) and the ceremonial law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46838" data-verses="Exodus 25:1">Exo. 25</span>—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46839" data-verses="Leviticus 27:1">Lev. 27</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d7W3--oAGw8jD27cn7JWnMqZu3vsx5nzoulzeJPwey6K74FWcVSIwz6cORlJq5MvC">THE MORAL LAW</h2><p data-content-id="3vHPi00GaWJDde7UceoYKBoVBsAlGeHk53axv5wHQhFDkpwkMX4ZQ6IYu4bdKTovg"> The moral law includes the Ten Commandments with their statutes and ordinances. The first five commandments deal with our relationship with God and with our parents. The first three commandments are directly concerned with God; the fourth concerns God’s Sabbath day; and the fifth <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> concerns our parents. Then the last five of the Ten Commandments deal with our relationship with one another. These are the commandments not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to bear false witness against others, and not to covet. These commandments, or laws, are brief, but they cover almost everything concerning our relationship with one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="G4QWglc8LJWm5NVgG1Zk20S0FhGxxSGCADuAcsCZlhFwXcmPSDGzUAgjWAw6mOf-w"> Eventually, the moral law, the Ten Commandments, became the base of the civil law of many nations. For instance, Roman law, which has been copied around the world, was based on the last five of the Ten Commandments. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46840" data-verses="Philippians 3:6">Philippians 3:6</span> Paul says that as to the righteousness which is in the law, he was blameless. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46841" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> he admitted that he was unable to keep the commandment regarding coveting. “Neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, ‘You shall not covet.’ But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46842" data-verses="Romans 7:7-8">vv. 7b-8a</span>). Paul could keep the commandments about murder, adultery, stealing, and bearing false witness, for these four things are matters of outward conduct. The commandment about coveting, however, deals with an inward matter, and Paul could not keep himself from coveting. </p>
<p data-content-id="EofxRjlFmC0_qrUVz0SuOJe0Qsgjt8nzercYD4_GWSJ6cng73MQkytAZcVtTSjaSG"> Can you say that you have never coveted anything? When you were a student, you might have seen someone with a nice pen, and immediately you coveted that pen, desiring to have it. Even in our family life we may covet certain things. Suppose the members of a large family are having dessert after dinner. Each of the children is given a piece of cheesecake. One of the children may look at the cheesecake given to others and then complain that his piece is too small and ask why he was not given a bigger piece. This is coveting. None of us can say that we have never coveted anything. </p>

As the testimony of God the Ten Commandments are a picture, a portrait, of God. We may say that the law is a photograph of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="gM7QgJegZsHlSbDHGKzgMlmTmyhRBACVevy66N5YNSgHx4zbDlceo0eVsqBfZHFGW"> A particular law is always a portrait of the person who makes that law. For example, if bank robbers could make laws, they surely would set up laws to make it legal to rob banks. Likewise, if evil people are elected to the United States Senate, they will make evil, sinful laws. The evil laws they make would be a portrait of the evil persons they are. On the contrary, good people establish good laws. </p>
<p data-content-id="elXE5ZQRaOAmBjUSGCSfWKFXhh9PiGwAil1ZHhHiIPHb1BnEa9vR5q6KgqyFbbTEZ"> The law of God is a portrait of God. After a careful study of the last five of the Ten Commandments, we have seen that these five commandments are based on four of God’s divine attributes: love, light, holiness, and righteousness. These attributes are the base upon which God’s law was established. The more we consider the law of God, the more we realize that this lawmaker, this legislator, must be One who is full of love and light, One who is holy and righteous. </p>
<p data-content-id="5dsi1IgC7t188ozEQNF50CXK8y0YZVJubVa-ElfPaOCfxuXacRoceHZlILhLFuJ9d"> Because the law is God’s portrait, God’s image, it is called God’s testimony. The ark in which the law was placed was called the ark of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46844" data-verses="Exodus 25:22">Exo. 25:22</span>). </p>

How can the law be a type of Christ? The law is a type of Christ because Christ is God’s portrait, God’s picture, God’s image (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46845" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Col. 1:15</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hiwtdjCiNoQC7M-Z8g8a8H8rhchYe8PvJ618cJD5_ELidaFG0tGdrDj5f5q3qVWwk">THE LAW BEING LINKED TO GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="UAoMidchqALu5g7HifuzOINE-IWROIrH0E1HFSH19UZAyaboxe0dip5nZn9yks8y7"> Now we need to see how the law is linked to God’s economy. In studying the books of history in the Old Testament, we need to learn how to link these books to God’s economy. In His economy God chose Israel, established them as a people, formed them as a nation, and gave them the law. How can we link this with God’s economy? God’s economy is God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature (but not in the Godhead) to produce the organic Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Christ is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="76" id="76">[76]</span> center, the reality, and the goal of God’s economy. The law seems to have nothing to do with such an economy. How, then, can the law be linked to God’s economy? The law is linked to God’s economy because the law was given as God’s portrait, God’s picture, God’s image, and God’s testimony. As God’s testimony the law is a type of Christ, who, being the image of God, is God’s portrait, God’s picture, God’s testimony. </p>

In typology, to keep the law means to express God. Keeping the law by not killing, not committing adultery, not stealing, not lying, and not coveting is the living of a God-man. Those who have the living of a God-man bear the image of God. They are a portrait of God and even a duplication of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="i-H-R0n9uUo7SerJsqpzhP9H2imce_Rmtfeww7e16NF3W5K0xFmSLVhrVW-zE4RUo"> The situation of today’s world is utterly different from this. In the world we see not the life of a God-man but murder, adultery, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting. Who tells the truth today? It is common for people to lie in a court of law in order to get money and then to boast about their lying. Many compete with others in business or at school because of their coveting. All the competitive ones are covetous. Some will even kill to get what they covet. Therefore, instead of being full of God-men, the earth is full of “scorpions.” </p>

We all are believers. We believe in the Lord Jesus. We have repented and come back to the Lord, and we have been saved, even dynamically saved.

<p data-content-id="joE-FeHqPyEHmd5nXY0wsPfZLKrT-mgm9MZMihcFCGGciccYrgtgU5Gur7qqnb7KH"> We have pointed out that for the children of Israel to keep the law was to live God and express God. However, they did not keep the law, and therefore they did not live God and express God. The situation is the same with us today. For the most part, we do not express God in our daily living. </p>
