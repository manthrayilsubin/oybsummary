<p data-content-id="ATAqzg1lrtCwC0RXMz-8A8j76CLcAM4aGE62QhJ8DfWznrpgQ33IpjsPd45z0tW5K"> In studying the histories and prophecies of the Old Testament, we need the full scope, the full view, of the entire Scriptures concerning God’s eternal economy for Christ and the church, which consummates in the New Jerusalem. This will render us not only a broader view but also the deeper, intrinsic significance of God’s purpose in presenting to us the histories and giving us the prophecies of the Old Testament. The scope, the center, and the intrinsic significance of all the histories and the prophecies of the Old Testament must be Christ and His Body, which will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem for God’s eternal economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="FAziNMknEpNQmIfgOfil7aHc6blg_H_aaIjsS8WFW1pHrIxulEasIBjKP9pJN_Lnd"> For God to accomplish such an eternal economy of His, <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> He needed to create the heavens for the earth, and the earth for man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43044" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zech. 12:1</span>). God created man in His own image and after His likeness with a spirit for man to contact Him, receive Him, keep Him, and take Him as man’s life and content. It was very sad that this man got fallen from God and from God’s purpose for His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmVRmh0-5eJ9jDxQOz5vLilCNoGpvtgz_SX5ivmarG90DJXpS7fDr2u45pSE4rEYz"> However, out of fallen humankind God chose a man by the name of Abraham and his descendants and made them a particular people as His dear elect among all the nations (the Gentiles). It took God over four hundred years to produce, constitute, and form such an elect to replace the Adamic race for the fulfilling of His eternal economy. God brought such an elect of His through trials, sufferings, both in Egypt and in the wilderness that they might be trained, disciplined, and qualified to coordinate with Him in taking His promised land for Christ on this earth and in providing the proper persons to bring forth Christ into the human race. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCbU-9uGEHhpJPwUoOy4MwfA3squO8UWZguFVKJ6cU4zRZqH2xcAgJ8797KoE39tJ"> To take possession of God’s promised land for Christ and to provide the proper persons to bring forth Christ into the human race are the two major points of the section of the history in the Old Testament in the three books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. These two main points, to take the land for Christ and to provide the bona fide ancestors for Christ, are the spirit of the history from Joshua to Ruth. They are the intrinsic significance of this section of the Old Testament history. We have to have a clear vision concerning this. Otherwise, our life-study on these three books will be in vain, just like the studies of so many historians, Bible students, and Scripture teachers, either Jewish or Christian. </p>
<p data-content-id="-yanJrEgyoloK6qMZKhh4c0YWe4y4B9o44jFBl1lEqrv19Rxqy-aZPQH9l0wzEm9e"> If by the Lord’s mercy we see such a vision, this section of the history in the Old Testament will benefit us the same as the New Testament does. Such a vision will help us to see that the history of God’s people on earth is actually the history of the working God energizing among His chosen people in the Old Testament and even the history of the operating God energizing in His redeemed people and having them energize themselves together with Him for the accomplishment of His eternal economy concerning Christ and His increase, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="p987g_W1AWQtL-PX12sUbXa-6IwiRfHAhMUf4OLQKPtEDViln5bFGW9ws3ZfiQ55e"> I hope that through the life-study of these three books we all will see and realize that our living, our daily walk, our schooling, our job, and our business must be a part of God’s history in His marvelous and excellent move on the earth today. To be a normal Christian, to be today’s overcomers, to answer the Lord’s present calling, and to meet the Lord’s present need in His recovery, it is altogether not sufficient simply to be a so-called good brother or good sister, attending the church meetings regularly, behaving rightly, and living a life which is somewhat perfect in the eyes of men. We need to be one with God in His history, moving and energizing in His loving overcomers; that is, we need to be one with God in life, in living, and in our entire doing today on this earth! We need to write God’s today’s history! We need to march on as one with the energizing God! In Him! With Him! By Him! And for Him! We need to be vital, living, and active! We need to be today’s Joshuas and Calebs to take possession of the God-promised land for Christ that we may become His possession. We need to be today’s Ruths to turn to God’s economy, to enter into the land of Immanuel, and to marry ourselves to Christ that we may bring forth Christ to meet the need of men today. This should be the intrinsic life-study of these three books—Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. The issue of this life-study should be the gaining of the God-promised land for Christ and the bringing forth of the excellent Christ to meet today’s need of both God and men. </p>

Following this, the land was allotted, apportioned, to each tribe in a particular way. Then they enjoyed the land. </p>

<p data-content-id="rfCCuiyqO0r5_ipBWJIB78ayDcG-ad5QtAnFwkRiKTKfrpWaCHrQi1k-oap2s6d6z"> When I was young, I was taught many things concerning the three books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, but I was not told that this section of the history in the Old Testament is in line with God’s economy. The Bible presents a full picture of God’s economy from His creation of the universe to the consummation of the New Jerusalem. The first two chapters of the Bible are on God’s creation with man, created in God’s image and according to His likeness, as the center. In the last two chapters we have the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem, the corporate expression and manifestation of the Triune God mingled with His redeemed people for eternity. Many things occur between these two ends, but all are linked to God’s economy—mainly concerning Christ and His counterpart, the church. The church as Christ’s Body will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the millennium for those believers who become mature and in the new heaven and new earth for all the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="dP4J6o_BM_PFqTGWwbz7qbVB0I_4r-YxWFqZ8y8yCvVu1Sa4I2oJk9H42LXqJjVLd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43079" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:1">Ezekiel 1</span> God’s economy is likened to a great wheel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43080" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:15-21">vv. 15-21</span>). The hub of this great wheel signifies Christ as the center of God’s economy, and the rim signifies Christ’s counterpart, the church, which consummates in the New Jerusalem. The many believers as the members of Christ are the spokes of the hub spreading to the rim, to the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem. This great wheel is not just the economy of God but also the moving of the economy of God. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43081" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> until the present, this wheel has been continually moving. The move of God’s economy has never stopped, and today this great wheel has reached us. When I moved from mainland China to the island <span class="pg" data-page-id="8" id="8">[8]</span> of Taiwan with about three hundred fifty to five hundred others more than forty years ago, there were few Christians on that island who knew what God’s economy was. But because of the moving of the great wheel of the divine economy, within five years the number in the churches increased to fifty thousand. Eventually, the Lord, the Motivator, burdened me to come to this country. This also was part of the moving of this great wheel. In every age and in every generation, this great wheel has been moving, and today we all are a part of the move of this great wheel on earth. Sometimes the move of this wheel is quite slow, but at other times it is so fast that we can hardly keep up with it. </p>
<p data-content-id="QNBdCr3M51MIbCuK-uap-QfKEbbkKGx6R_vGKkAsPUZHEWxfejHu4430Di28ZkbBQ"> According to the record in the Old Testament, God’s move, which began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43082" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, continued through Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43083" data-verses="Joshua 1:1">chapter one</span> of Joshua, God’s move had reached a certain situation. At that time the entire earth was full of idols and demons. In a sense, God had been chased away from the earth, which He had created for Himself, and did not have a way to be the Lord of the earth as well as of the heavens. However, among all the nations and peoples, God had separated Israel, His elect, for the carrying out of His economy. They had nothing to do with any idols or demons. On the contrary, they were occupied with the God of the heavens and the earth. After being formed, constituted, disciplined, trained, and qualified, God’s people had come to the plains of Moab where they were waiting to enter into the good land, to take it, and to possess it. </p>
<p data-content-id="KW14aVNgzhpECQjvKKoMC7B1C0SmUlygEh73WtOKi0rbhfNXa9tmciSqmJO9J7dRp"> One day, as the people were ready and waiting for God’s instruction, God came in to call Joshua and to tell him to take the lead so that he and the children of Israel could enter into the good land and possess it. Joshua took the word from Jehovah and charged the children of Israel to perform God’s commission (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43084" data-verses="Joshua 1:1-15">vv. 1-15</span>). The land-takers had to prepare themselves to move with God in His move. In order to take the good land, they had to enter into a full coordination with God in His move. If the children of Israel had looked at themselves, they would have said that there was no possibility. But their possibility was the unique God, who needed His elect people to cooperate with Him in His move to carry out His economy, in His desire <span class="pg" data-page-id="9" id="9">[9]</span> to move in His economy as the great wheel. Here God seemed to be saying, “Israel, My elect, you must know that there is no need for you to do anything. Simply cooperate with Me. I am motivating the wheel to run. You need to be one with Me. Go in to possess the land, and I will slaughter the idol worshippers through you. Without you I cannot do anything.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lP3-PmOBr-l-bpcGMKvkfrUjAISX_XckH5UuqL8Qc8L4jfeMKbBEniotpitBebLb9"> This is the principle of incarnation. In particular, this is the principle of incarnation for the destruction of the satanic power in its usurpation of the earth. This means that in order for God to regain the earth from the usurping hand of the enemy, we need to be in full cooperation and coordination with Him in the principle of incarnation. We need to be one with God in His heart’s desire and in His move on earth.

The Bible begins with God’s creation, and it ends with Christ as the hub of the great wheel and with the New Jerusalem as the rim to manifest the Triune God for eternity. God’s eternal economy, therefore, consists mainly of two things—Christ and His counterpart for the enlargement, the increase, and the spreading of Christ. This counterpart of Christ will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem as the full expression of the Triune God for eternity. The intrinsic significance of the book of Joshua is the taking of the land, which typifies our gaining of Christ, plus the gaining of the proper persons to bring forth Christ that Christ might be spread and increased. </p>

For the gaining of Christ, we need to be today’s Joshua, fighting the battle, taking the land, and enjoying Christ as our inheritance. For the spreading of Christ, we need to be today’s Rahab. Thus, we need to be both a Joshua and a Rahab. </p>
<p data-content-id="DlXoHuuugJ5Arsa8NWSyZZ3SnsW0LorQFEmhdLt58cvymujm9NDKg0fp1v4eG4RLH"> A number of Bible teachers have pointed out that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43116" data-verses="Joshua 1:1">chapter one</span> of Joshua typifies <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43117" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">chapter one</span> of Ephesians. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43118" data-verses="Joshua 1:1">Joshua 1</span> shows us that everything was ready. Israel had been prepared <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> through God’s dealing with them for several hundred years in Egypt and for forty years in the wilderness. Israel had become a corporate Joshua, chosen, called, redeemed, saved, trained, prepared, and qualified by God. There in the plains of Moab they did not have any land or inheritance. They were ready to go on with God as one to take the land of Canaan, which typifies the rich, all-inclusive Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Shb4BvSvW8fxFXXhQuENzDTzvjVo36_SEtmS7v8cR3w-mohCj7-VqJnxkNqZ3NenX"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43119" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span>, which is typified by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43120" data-verses="Joshua 1:1">Joshua 1</span>, we can see that everything has been finished and completed and that every blessing in Christ is there in the heavenlies, waiting for God’s chosen, redeemed, and perfected people to take and enjoy as their inheritance. According to this chapter, we have been chosen by God to partake of His holy nature and we have been predestinated by God to have His life in order to become His sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43121" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>). Furthermore, Christ’s redemption has brought us into Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God to be the realm in which and the element by which we can be made God’s inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43122" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">vv. 7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43123" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">11</span>). Having been redeemed and having been put into Christ as the realm and the element, we are daily being reconstituted and transformed by this element to be a treasure for God’s inheritance. As we take Christ and enjoy Him as our inheritance, we become God’s inheritance. In addition, we have the sealing and the pledging of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43124" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>). The Spirit’s sealing is the Spirit’s soaking and saturating of us in order to transform us. The Spirit’s pledging is the guarantee that God is our inheritance. On the one hand, we are God’s inheritance, sealed by His Spirit; on the other hand, God is our inheritance, guaranteed by the pledging of the Spirit. </p>

Christ is in the highest layer, the third heaven, to be our everything as our good land. But there is a lower layer of the heavenlies—the air, where Satan as the ruler of the authority of the air is frustrating the people on earth from contacting God and from receiving Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43126" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">v. 2</span>). This is typified by the Canaanites, who were frustrating Israel from entering into the good land. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43130" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> we see Joshua, the believers in Christ receiving all the blessings in Christ. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43131" data-verses="Ephesians 2:1">Ephesians 2</span> we see Rahab, all the sinners who were wicked, evil, and dead. Nevertheless, God can perform His dynamic salvation through the redemption of Christ to save such sinners, to make such Rahabs the enjoyers of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="f08Ag6mIMlFUO8k7hePqhAa8kEx126O0PBznnSInN15ahd8Wrsx6bhiQkDszMfJFc"> How could Rahab, a Gentile harlot who had sold herself to sin to the uttermost, become a member of the chosen people of God? How could she receive Christ and then bring forth Christ to others for His increase? There was no other way but through faith. Faith comes from the hearing of the gospel. Today people need to hear the good news concerning what God has done through the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. People need to hear that everything has been finished and completed and that the all-inclusive Christ is in the heavens for them to receive. However, Satan and his powers in the air try to frustrate them from receiving Christ. The only way this situation can be overcome is by faith. This was Rahab’s experience. She heard what God had done for Israel in Egypt and in the wilderness, and she heard how God had defeated Sihon and Og, two strong kings who were the gate guards of Canaan. She heard the good news, and then she believed in the very God of Israel, wanting to be one among His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="IOtA-lB7FSEmM9_rQZBQ06V2USvLvXHjwPTb65fAymVl4nNnGIRumCyHLx8hoY7bA"> When the two spies came to Jericho, Rahab contacted them and hid them from those who were seeking them. There must have been a good communication between the spies and Rahab, and through this communication she became harmonious with them for God’s economy. When she asked them to deal kindly with her father’s house and deliver their lives from death, the spies told her to tie a line of scarlet thread in the window. According to the spies’ word, she hung the scarlet thread from her window as a sign for the salvation of herself and her entire household, typifying the household salvation of Christ through His redemption by His blood. This is a strong indication that the history in the book of Joshua is related to God’s eternal economy concerning Christ in His salvation through redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="HE1VbQqcz8OJAkI-K1_WyGLbJirDYtjl-zLE7fjIEVFfRsEKYvG-sSnojq1RAYWh1"> Eventually Rahab the harlot became one of the excellent, <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> prominent ancestors of Christ. This Canaanite woman married Salmon, a leader of the tribe of Judah, and through her union with this Jewish leader she became a part of Israel and brought forth Boaz, the great-grandfather of David. What an honor it is that Rahab’s name is included in the genealogy of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43132" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span>! This is a strong sign that the history recorded in Joshua is in line with God’s eternal economy concerning Christ. </p>

The people of Israel were ready to enter into the good land and to take it as their possession. However, in their old man they could not gain the victory. Their old man had to be buried so that they could become a new man. This corresponds to the New Testament economy of God. The children of Israel were buried in the death of Christ and then they were resurrected in the resurrection of Christ. This indicates that even in the Old Testament time the children of Israel were identified with Christ and were one with Him. Because they were one with Christ, passing through Christ’s experiences, His history became their history. In particular, they passed through Christ’s death to bury their old man and to become a new man in Christ for the fighting of the spiritual warfare. </p>

God’s intention is to join us to Christ to have an organic union between us and Christ, making us one with Christ, that His history might become our history. His history is our story, and our story is His history. We have been identified with Christ to experience what He has gone through. In union with Christ, His experiences become ours.

The ark was a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. When the ark of God went with the children of Israel, the Triune God went with them, taking the lead and thus being the first to step into the water. Yet the ark was on the shoulders of the bearing priests. This indicates that the priests bearing the ark became one entity with the Triune God; they were one corporate person. God walked in their walking, and they walked in God’s walking. The spread of the Lord’s recovery today is through Christ’s move together with His bearing priests. We and He walk together as a corporate man. </p>

<p data-content-id="6CVEZhIT-HJa9HolEQ3mPUb-R024qVSUe5hakZ9D1h5iJXItholkL_8CsGgE023SA"> In this message we will consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43197" data-verses="Joshua 5:1">chapter five</span> of Joshua. This chapter reveals that all the kings were afraid because of the miraculous crossing of the river Jordan. Before the children of Israel attacked, the Canaanites were already defeated. Their spirit was gone. Although the Israelites had been disciplined, trained, and qualified, after crossing the Jordan they still needed further preparation before the attack. </p>
<p data-content-id="RhR4z9jI4RcF9NY-xNqT59RPHY3VgtBGknEIcLmxlZJztNYpfeXmg3E3tacIbm1yY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43198" data-verses="Joshua 5:1">Joshua 5</span> covers four matters of intrinsic significance. The first item is circumcision. Circumcision is a continuation of the burial in the death of Christ. By crossing the river Jordan, Israel’s old man was buried and they came out to become the new man. This was an objective work done by God. Israel still needed to apply it to their flesh. Therefore, they prepared knives of flint to cut off their foreskins. This cutting was their application of what God had done in the crossing of the river Jordan. By cutting off their flesh to roll away the reproach of Egypt, they were buried and resurrected, both actually and practically. </p>
<p data-content-id="srpPagj0d9HxkU9Ux9nRRcZjLSYDCNvAzUJFgVy3LXpoK8y6KrzVF3eI1KFGkrtPV"> In the New Testament circumcision means the constant application of the Lord’s death to our flesh. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43199" data-verses="Romans 6:3-4">Romans 6:3-4</span> says that we have been baptized into the death of Christ and buried with Him, but <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43200" data-verses="Romans 8:13">Romans 8:13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43201" data-verses="Galatians 5:24">Galatians 5:24</span> tell us that we should apply the circumcision of the cross to our flesh by the Spirit. In fact, our flesh has already been crucified, but in practicality we need to crucify the flesh day by day. This is the reality and practicality of remaining in the death and burial of Christ, and this is the significance of circumcision. </p>
<p data-content-id="wZGVrmpjmMhhQXKjJL8yP41PtKUl00_CtZELdnseB4qDEjUeA-leWJKVlZ5-RRyDv"> The second item of intrinsic significance in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43202" data-verses="Joshua 5:1">Joshua 5</span> is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> Passover. The feast of the Passover was held to remember Israel’s redemption from the death judgment on the firstborn sons and their salvation from Egypt and from the tyranny of Pharaoh. This is a type of the Lord’s table. At the Lord’s table we remember Him as the Redeemer and as the Savior. Our portion today is not death but the partaking and enjoying of Christ at His table. </p>
<p data-content-id="LHJL_zcvC1sbRAnF16bp-YoaWoAS4iRZqGrEeioVYMkR7QaTSHNj9GSiFfHwHN6tY"> The third item of intrinsic significance is the eating of the produce of the good land. For forty years the children of Israel had been eating manna without any labor on their part. But when the manna ceased, their food could be produced only by cooperating with God. The produce of the land of Canaan came out of farming. This means that it was the result of man’s labor and cooperation with God. This is in keeping with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43203" data-verses="Genesis 2:5">Genesis 2:5</span>, which says that God sends the rain and man tills the ground. This refers to the cooperation of man and God. </p>
<p data-content-id="zhCwBp7GDQwFvxBW0iXihjW14tMnBQTxDYau7Evx7IF3eRaoH-vxbkGCt-U5rGiJl"> Both the manna and the produce of the good land typify Christ. Christ in the stage typified by the produce of the good land is different from Christ in the stage typified by manna. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43204" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span>, which is not a deep chapter, speaks of Christ as the manna who came down from heaven to feed us. In the Epistles Christ is no longer just manna; He is the produce of the good land, prepared through our laboring cooperation with God. This brings in more Christ for ourselves and others and provides a surplus to God as our offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="a6u1EAWIB8Y1TXiK5nF2RvIi40YSjWAhTbAx6EZPLELoiLxj8LRZcMKQqqR9_k-zR"> The fourth item of intrinsic significance concerns the Captain of Jehovah’s army. The children of Israel were ready. They had been circumcised, they had enjoyed the Passover, and they had enjoyed the produce of the good land. However, they still needed a Captain. Then Joshua saw a vision in which Christ was unveiled as the Captain of Jehovah’s army. Joshua was the visible commander, but Christ was the invisible One. Before the children of Israel attacked the Canaanites, they were fully prepared and qualified with Christ, the embodiment of God, as their Captain. When they attacked Jericho, they did this under the commanding of the Captain typified by the ark. The ark, a type of Christ, who was their Commander-in-chief, took the lead to attack the enemies. <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="btg8P2rlTgJCtG654_nPHHD29OpwPnFRaufFNk-19YklgmJD2JqaHEd9Yfgspo9_2"> To prepare to possess the good land, we need to enter into these four items. We need to deal with the flesh, enjoy the Lord’s table, enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the produce of the good land, and see a vision of Christ, the embodiment of God, as our Captain. </p>
<p data-content-id="qvKPTSmtJZDL1pjSif9fiRTx7uHnoujZh_RqI_YxOC8Ox0zDZNvK9v-9uzQTnKzow"> Now that we have seen the items of intrinsic significance in this chapter, let us consider some of the details concerning the preparation before the attack. </p>

Our taking possession of the God-promised good land is for Christ, and Christ’s making us His possession is for us. What does it mean to say that we possess the good land for Christ and that He, for our sake, makes us His possession? My burden in this message is to try to make these two puzzling matters clear. </p>

These two main points—to take the land for Christ and to provide the bona fide ancestors for Christ—are the spirit of the history from Joshua to Ruth. Since the God-promised land is a type of Christ, to gain the land for Christ means to gain Christ for Christ. </p>

More than four hundred years later, God sent Moses to deliver Israel out of Egypt, telling him that He was sending him to bring the people into <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> the good land. It was a fact that God had given the land to Israel, but this fact was not yet practical. Rather, it was a promise that still needed to be fulfilled. Not even at the time when Israel came to the plains of Moab under the leadership of Joshua was the giving of the good land to Israel a practical fact, for the land had not yet become Israel’s possession. Only after Israel had gained the good land and had taken possession of it did the land actually become theirs as a practical fact. </p>

God, the Giver, had done everything, but there was still the need for Israel, the receiver, to do something to take possession of what God had given. </p>
<p data-content-id="jbfx2uhYPTnsBAVLgAU3m8ZDp-Vs6-_nKIWu-C5CqcZEO0oxfqR8Ao9tXj8xa8I7P"> The principle is the same with the preaching of the gospel today. God’s salvation has been promised, prepared, and completed in Christ and with Christ. Everything is ready for this salvation to be given to sinners. God wants to give salvation to sinners, but they need to respond to Him by receiving His gift of salvation. To respond to God by receiving His salvation is to do something helpful for God. Actually, to receive God’s salvation is to do God a favor. If you know the heart of God, you will realize that whenever a sinner repents and receives Christ, that sinner is doing God a favor. </p>
<p data-content-id="TLwCShOFDcklJD0GUAcJAKElLLuoTvpJc7sufjsL7h1vpdVR8UHEocV_sD8J5dU8m"> At the beginning of the book of Joshua, Israel was ready to go forward, to take the good land, to possess it, and to enjoy it. For Israel to do this meant that they were doing something for Christ, who is typified by the good land. Otherwise, the good land would have lain there idle. Today, Christ as the good land is ready to be taken and possessed by His believers. However, where are those who are ready to take Him, possess Him, and enjoy Him as the all-inclusive good land? Many sinners are not willing to respond to Christ, and even many of His believers are not willing to respond to Him by taking Him, possessing Him, and enjoying Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nOrmH8KYLM2rxNX6myeBfbjF11wubmtjSHEMQohvNIh0-YFYMjStOHoVnRpbLVqFE">Gaining Christ for Christ</h2><p data-content-id="6CVEZhIT-HJa9HolEQ3mMUbve024qVSUe5hakZ9D1h5iJXItholkL_8CsGgE023SA"> In light of this, let us now consider what it means to gain Christ for Christ. Christ today is the good land given to us by God in a very rich way. Nevertheless, all the riches of Christ, all that Christ is, remain separate from most Christians. As the One on the throne in the heavens, Christ is strong and powerful, but we are weak. He is rich, but we are poor. Whereas Christ is strong, powerful, and rich, we are weak, impotent, and poor. The reason for this situation is that we have not endeavored to gain Christ. However, when we gain Christ, He becomes our experience. Then Christ becomes in us what He should be. This means that our gaining Christ is not only for our enjoyment but also for Christ to be what He should be. </p>
<p data-content-id="RhR4z9jI4RcF9NY-xNqT69RSLY3VgtBGknEIcLmxlZJztNYpfeXmg3E3tacIbm1yY"> According to the New Testament revelation, Christ is perfect, complete, rich, and powerful. Furthermore, it is a fact that God has given such a Christ to us. Although He is wonderful, we are pitiful. If we see this, we will realize that there is a need for us to do something that will make Christ real to us and even to the unbelievers so that He will be what He should be. How can Christ be what He should be? Christ can be what He should be only by our gaining Him. If we gain Christ and experience Christ, Christ will become real to us. This is not only for us—it is also for Christ. This is to gain Christ for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="srpPagj0d9HxkU9Ux9nRScZ6GSYDCNvAzUJFgVy3LXpoK8y6KrzVF3eI1KFGkrtPV"> Our need today is to gain more of Christ, to possess more of Christ, and to experience more of Christ. Our gaining, possessing, and experiencing Christ will make Him real to us. This is not only for our enjoyment but also for Christ to be what He should be. At present, the Christ among us is much less than the Christ in the heavens. The Christ among us is different from the Christ in the heavens. This means that among us Christ is not yet what He should be. In order for Christ to be what He should be among us, we need to gain Him. The more we gain Christ, possess Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ, the more He becomes among us what He should be. In this way our gaining of Christ is for Christ. We gain Christ for Christ so that He may have His <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> corporate expression. This is to make the good land the land of Immanuel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43231" data-verses="Isaiah 8:8">Isa. 8:8</span>). </p>

However, very few of today’s Christians, including us, are like Paul. We may be seeking Christians, but we may pursue Christ only to a certain extent, being content with a routine church life and routine work and service for Christ. Following such a routine does not enable us to endeavor to gain Christ. Because so many Christians do not pursue Christ in order to gain Him, God needs the overcomers. </p>
<p data-content-id="mwZC1abhGL0Is3OlnEvDukVaVx6a679uE4Rr7UGKZlxGfd-I-JkbxdnABfEXdqNyb"> The Bible shows us that, first, God tried to work with the race of Adam, but the Adamic race was a failure. Then God had a new start with another race, with Israel, the race of Abraham. Eventually, Israel also failed God. Then God went to another people—the church. However, although God has been working with the church for nearly two thousand years, God has not yet gained what He desires. Thus, as early as the first century, the Lord came in to call for overcomers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43234" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Rev. 2:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43235" data-verses="Revelation 2:11">11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43236" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43237" data-verses="Revelation 2:26-28">26-28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43238" data-verses="Revelation 3:5">3:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43239" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43240" data-verses="Revelation 3:20-21">20-21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43241" data-verses="Revelation 21:7">21:7</span>), and today He is still sounding out the call for the overcomers. Nevertheless, even among devoted Christians it is hard to find some overcomers, some who are pursuing Christ in order to gain Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zr54OIkCh6pZYcoBPbruL8ckFz01q6X10ZaBYOcBRwhHm0k1zV3pNulTPMSh2_cKr"> At the time of Joshua, there were two or three million Israelites, but there were not many Joshuas and Calebs. There were not many endeavoring ones, genuine pursuers of God. Without such ones both the good land and the Giver of the land would have been idle. Both the land and the Giver of the land needed certain ones to take the land, possess the land, and enjoy the land. Those who possessed the land did a favor to the One who gave them the land. </p>

In order for the children of Israel to gain the good land, they had to defeat the enemy and drive out the evil forces. Nevertheless, the children of Israel actually did not need to fight. When they crossed the Jordan, God did everything. In the same principle, God’s people did not need to do anything to destroy Jericho. They only needed to believe and trust in God, to listen to the instruction from the Captain of the army of Israel, and to exalt Christ by bearing the ark. From this we see that in the spiritual warfare the first thing we should do is exalt Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="k8n9GXVUwH-Qit_XmyBAjSc6PMpYMy9xX_cDzF-2lJQCa58oX1VD4Y8elhDfcOXpm"> Jericho was strongly fortified. But when the king heard what Jehovah had done for His people, his heart melted and he lost his spirit, his boldness. Not knowing what to do, he shut the gates of the city and used the walls to protect himself and his people. There was no traffic, no coming in or going out. This indicates that the powers of darkness were bound, that there was a real binding of the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. The king trusted in the wall, knowing that the Israelites did not have any weapons to breach the wall. Even though the Israelites had crossed the Jordan, he did not think that they would be able to cross the wall. He did not have any thought concerning what God would do. It was an easy matter for God to destroy the wall. </p>
<p data-content-id="JyoOMkAfjjeY4BgsRXpUsjTUJBlivAJzXiUfcjhMSwqGUmjHBEDbcRJvKzJ325oeO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43247" data-verses="Joshua 6:2">verse 2</span> Jehovah told Joshua that He had given Jericho, its king, and the mighty men of war into Joshua’s hand. Then God instructed Joshua to have the men of war with the priests bearing the ark circle the city, going around it one time. This they were to do for six days. Seven other priests <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> were charged to carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah. The priests did not blow their trumpets according to their own will. Instead, they waited for the captain to give the command. They needed instructions and leading, just as we today need the leading and guiding of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="zhCwBp7GDQwFvxBW0iXijjWQytMnBQTxDYau7Evx7IF3eRaoH-vxbkGCt-U5rGiJl"> For the first six days, the army of Israel just walked around the city with the ark, which typified Christ as the embodiment of God. I believe that many of the people of Jericho were on the wall watching, wondering what the people of Israel were doing. On the seventh day, the Sabbath day, the situation was different. Israel actually did not have to fight but enjoyed the Sabbath, that is, enjoyed the rest. They walked around the city seven times, and then the visible captain gave the command: “Shout!” The priests trumpeted, the people shouted, and the wall fell down. The city was utterly destroyed, and a curse was placed on anyone who would rise up and build it. The way that Israel conquered Jericho was a strong testimony that Israel’s God, Jehovah, is a true and living God. </p>
<p data-content-id="a6u1EAWIB8Y1TXiK5nF2TvIDz0YSjWAhTbAx6EZPLELoiLxj8LRZcMKQqqR9_k-zR"> We may apply this account of the destruction of Jericho to the matter of preaching the gospel. As we take up the burden to visit sinners, we need to realize that every sinner is a “fortified city” that has been cursed. In dealing with such a fortified city, we must exercise patience, considering when we should be silent and when we should speak. This means that we should follow the Lord’s leading. At the right time, the proper declaration will be very effective, and there will be a Sabbath day in which we can shout, “Praise the Lord! Jesus is Lord! Christ is Victor!” The “wall” will fall, and we will be able to defeat all the demons and possess that sinner for Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="7keN_4jjkqiYUVH8snGzCCpeI9adCcdjrVCuBa8Zql2XYR1x8TTJ50q8l9mdl3acb"> In this message we will consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43278" data-verses="Joshua 7:1-2">Joshua 7 and 8</span>. These chapters give the account of the destruction of Ai. </p>
<p data-content-id="_6Z1jfPiAaEWZ64wRKZ_GF5DOqYPhOn_z-s-ya2wv5c7m9CuWtOKgcNyoFrqcgkiq"> The first time the children of Israel went up to destroy Ai they suffered a defeat. There were four reasons for this defeat. First, Israel sinned. God’s people were to be holy, sanctified, especially during the time of war. But one of the men of war from the tribe of Judah sinned by stealing something that was devoted to destruction. Second, they lost the presence of the Lord. Third, they trusted in themselves. Fourth, they lost their oneness with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="BN6kRm_QQrM5LvnRkLq8sPxA9SFAnDFdp0iAw6V6paMTv0r1Q9xDZLZ7BIERgDQnw"> God can do everything without man, but according to the record of the book of Joshua He wants man to be one with Him. In keeping with the principle of incarnation, God wants to do everything through man, with man, and even in man. At Jericho Israel marched around the city with the ark, a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, on the shoulders of the priests. The spiritual significance of this scene is that it is a picture of a corporate God-man, God and man, man and God, walking together as one person. This was the way the children of Israel crossed the river Jordan, and this was the way they destroyed the city of Jericho. God and Israel were fighting together. Actually, however, God did the fighting, and Israel simply shouted, proclaimed, and testified and then occupied the city. </p>
<p data-content-id="xOGNv61wByIhuhbUOUjTkQoh5WoQBh0X8ZIaaQgxjKqXoW2SXrTHRRrFbulrpVI9d"> This scene should have continued through all the taking of the land. But after the destruction of Jericho, Israel sinned by taking something from Jericho that was devoted to destruction (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43279" data-verses="Joshua 6:18-19">6:18-19</span>). Although this sin was committed by an individual, Achan, it affected the entire body of God’s people. <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> For this reason God said to Joshua, “Israel has sinned” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43280" data-verses="Joshua 7:11">7:11a</span>). Because of this sin God stayed away from them, withdrawing His presence from them. This was the reason that Joshua and all the children of Israel became foolish, proud, and blind in attacking Ai. </p>
<p data-content-id="rfCCuiyqO0r5_ipBWJIBx8aCDcG-ad5QtAnFwkRiKTKfrpWaCHrQi1k-oap2s6d6z"> At Jericho, according to God’s economy, Joshua sent out spies, not for fighting but to gain Rahab. In the destruction of Jericho, no fighting was needed. But at Ai, because they lost the presence of the Lord, Joshua sent out spies for fighting (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43281" data-verses="Joshua 7:2">v. 2</span>). The spies returned to Joshua and said that because the enemies were few, not all the people needed go up. They suggested that about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Because of their foolishness, pride, and blindness, they despised their enemy. Nevertheless, Joshua received the report from the spies and sent three thousand men of war against Ai. But when Israel was defeated by the people of Ai and thirty-six men were slaughtered, Joshua realized that something was wrong. He then fell to the ground upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until evening (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43282" data-verses="Joshua 7:6-9">vv. 6-9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="wZGVrmpjmMhhQXKjJL8yC41qnKUl00_CtZELdnseB4qDEjUeA-leWJKVlZ5-RRyDv"> God spoke to Joshua, telling him that unless they judged the sin, He would not be with them anymore (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43283" data-verses="Joshua 7:12">v. 12</span>). Joshua called the people together, and through the Urim and Thummim he found the tribe (Judah), the family (Zerah), and the person (Achan) who had sinned (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43284" data-verses="Joshua 7:16-18">vv. 16-18</span>). The children of Israel then stoned and burned Achan and all that he had. In this way Israel was cleared up and brought back to God to be one with God again. </p>
<p data-content-id="LHJL_zcvC1sbRAnF16bpzYo7doAS4iRZqGrEeioVYMkR7QaTSHNj9GSiFfHwHN6tY"> We all need to learn a lesson from this account. We, the people of God, should always be one with our God. Today, especially in the New Testament, our God is not only among us but also within each one of us. Therefore, every one of us is not a solitary individual, a person alone. On the contrary, we are men with God, God-men. Do you realize that, as a believer in Christ, you are a God-man, that God is a part of your being and that you are a part of God’s being? We come from many different countries, but we all are the same kind of person. We all are God-men. For this reason, we must realize that whatever we do, wherever we go, and whatever we are should not <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> be by ourselves. We should not act, behave, or do things by ourselves but with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="mwZC1abhGL0Is3OlnEvDgkVWXx6a679uE4Rr7UGKZlxGfd-I-JkbxdnABfEXdqNyb"> The report of the spies to Joshua indicates that Israel had set God aside. They forgot God and knew only themselves. At that time they were not one with God but cared only for themselves. Thus, God stayed away from them, and He said to Joshua, “I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy that which was devoted to destruction from among you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43285" data-verses="Joshua 7:12">v. 12c</span>). It is a very serious matter for God no longer to be with us. Nothing can replace Him. I can testify that without God I cannot live. Apart from Him I cannot have any being. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zr54OIkCh6pZYcoBPbruF8coHz01q6X10ZaBYOcBRwhHm0k1zV3pNulTPMSh2_cKr"> Israel was separated from God because of their sin. This sin caused them to become foolish. Israel should have asked God what He wanted them to do against Ai. This was the secret for their victory. Joshua should have said to the people, “Do not forget what we experienced at Jericho. We did not fight, but instead we walked with God as one. Let us do the same thing at Ai, walking around the city with the ark.” If Joshua had said this, he would have been a wise man, and the children of Israel would have followed his wise counsel. </p>
<p data-content-id="ATAqzg1lrtCwC0RXMz-8J8j7-CLcAM4aGE62QhJ8DfWznrpgQ33IpjsPd45z0tW5K"> The secret of Israel’s defeat at Ai was that they lost God’s presence and were no longer one with Him. After this defeat, Joshua learned the lesson of staying with the Lord before the ark. Eventually, the Lord came in to speak to him and to tell him what to do. The principle is the same with us today. If we have God’s presence, we have wisdom, insight, foresight, and the inner knowledge concerning things. </p>
<p data-content-id="FAziNMknEpNQmIfgOfilyaHc-blg_H_aaIjsS8WFW1pHrIxulEasIBjKP9pJN_Lnd"> As we study the intrinsic significance of this part of Israel’s history, we need to learn the secret of walking with the Lord. Today we should not merely follow the Lord but walk with Him, living with Him and having our being with Him. This is the way to walk as a Christian, to fight as a child of God, and to build up the Body of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmVRmh0-5eJ9jDxQOz5vCilCJoGpvtgz_SX5ivmarG90DJXpS7fDr2u45pSE4rEYz"> We need to remember that we are God-men and to practice being one with the Lord. Concerning this, the Lord Jesus said, “In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43286" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span>). This word reveals that we are a people of “ins”: we are in Christ and He is in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43287" data-verses="John 15:4">15:4</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> Therefore, whatever we do should not be done by ourselves but should be done with and by another One. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCbU-9uGEHhpJPwUoOy4FwfAzsquO8UWZguFVKJ6cU4zRZqH2xcAgJ8797KoE39tJ"> In my youth I was taught various ways to overcome, to be victorious, to be holy, and to be spiritual. However, not any of these ways worked. Eventually, through more than sixty-eight years of experience, I have found out that nothing works but the Lord’s presence. His being with us is everything. </p>

After they spied out Ai, they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Not all the people need go up; let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people labor there, for the enemies are few” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43291" data-verses="Joshua 7:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>). So only about three thousand men from the people went up there (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43292" data-verses="Joshua 7:4">v. 4a</span>).

They were deceived because they were like a wife who forgot her husband. What they did here was exactly the same as what Eve did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43320" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>.

<p data-content-id="3DMua4QweZr2yWnmBcwOKMFZ2E81EiS4genouGt-HJI94h5Lk_9ZgPPcxZxd8FnYU"> The Bible reveals that in the universe there is a divine romance between God and His elect. The Bible is the record of a romance, in the most pure and holy sense, of a universal couple. The male of this couple is God Himself, and the female is God’s redeemed people as a corporate being. The Bible shows us that we, as God’s elect, are His wife and that between Him and us there must be a marriage union based upon mutual love. The universe, therefore, is a wedding place, the place where the Husband, the processed and consummated Triune God, is being joined in marriage to the redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified tripartite man. The Husband is triune and the wife is tripartite, and thus they match each other very well to live together as the unique couple in the entire universe. The consummation of this romance, of this married life, is seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43323" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span>, <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> two chapters that we need to read again and again until we have a clear view of the married life of this universal couple. </p>
<p data-content-id="G5U0MksYOEnfAS3Ma_Y2wYXE1QU_zE3mitAvzI1N35YKULja8HdbFjTF0T86rA6X9"> This divine romance is revealed repeatedly throughout the Bible. After man fell, God selected one man, Abraham.

In the Old Testament God often refers to Himself as the Husband and to His people as the wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43324" data-verses="Isaiah 54:5">Isa. 54:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43325" data-verses="Isaiah 62:5">62:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43326" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jer. 2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43327" data-verses="Jeremiah 3:1">3:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43328" data-verses="Jeremiah 3:14">14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43329" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:32">31:32</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43330" data-verses="Ezekiel 16:8">Ezek. 16:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43331" data-verses="Ezekiel 23:5">23:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43332" data-verses="Hosea 2:7">Hosea 2:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43333" data-verses="Hosea 2:19">19</span>). Eventually, the Bible ends with the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of God’s elect in the new heaven and new earth, as the universal wife for eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43334" data-verses="Revelation 21:9-10">Rev. 21:9-10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="cVv713rHcO18cObWaDw0GrS6p-82LitDmvF-kUZNWukbhn_NrMolPVnN4bEAXpC76"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43335" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span> Jehovah said to Israel, “I remember concerning you... / The love of your bridal days.” There were some “bridal days,” a period of time in which God “courted” Israel. By the time God had brought Israel out of Egypt to Sinai, surely she had “fallen in love” with this universal Man, this unique Hero. Whatever Israel wanted, He could do. What they needed, He had. He had the wisdom, the capacity, the ability, the strength, the might, the power, and the authority to do everything. He seemed to say to Israel, “I am the unique One for you, and I am sufficient for you. Since I am the best One, you should not go to anyone else but just take Me. I am the loving One, and you are My beloved.” I believe that when Israel arrived at Sinai they made a definite determination to “marry” this One. </p>
<p data-content-id="ORZz_jwUMOElRQK8Sv2YCaOigR551mM6S0G-xwcf5QBosk8xtgGMlMGsqD59abtEp"> At Sinai they were married, and they went on together as a couple. Wherever they went, they were a couple walking together—the husband and the wife, the Triune God and His elect, walking as one. That was a picture of the God-man, partly God and partly man. The part that is God is the Husband, and the part that is man is the wife. </p>
<p data-content-id="412cOUqyH1Q55Sj9rq7wpFGL18y-K4Pi4hVzsNQL1DrwKgU_RtZoEvWhA-fmTwYms"> A wife should never leave her husband. Rather, she should always rely upon him and be one with him. If Eve had kept this principle when Satan came to seduce her, she would have run away to her husband. That would have been her protection, her safeguard. </p>
<p data-content-id="oQtJHQy0mWycmjihiCwtNKBq5kj4L69uDSdM7-fb-1VCb--TeABu_TQ92JrtPUNzK"> Suppose I am a wife and a poor woman comes to me asking for some help. As a wife, should I do something directly, on my own, for this poor woman? Since this seems to <span class="pg" data-page-id="55" id="55">[55]</span> be an insignificant matter, I might just give her a little money or some bread without asking my husband about it. This is what happened in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43336" data-verses="Joshua 9:1">Joshua 9</span>. The Gibeonites came to Israel like a poor woman coming to a rich lady from a strong, high-ranking family. Israel, the wife, should have gone to her Husband and checked with Him. But Israel “did not ask for the counsel of Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43337" data-verses="Joshua 9:14">v. 14</span>). Instead, Israel was deceived by the Gibeonites and made a covenant with them. Once the people of Israel had made this covenant, swearing to the Gibeonites by the name of Jehovah, the covenant could not be altered, and the Israelites could not touch the Gibeonites. </p>
<p data-content-id="3DMua4QweZr2yWnmBcwOKMFA_E81EiS4genouGt-HJI94h5Lk_9ZgPPcxZxd8FnYU"> The real married life is when the wife is co-living with her husband, always one with him. This means that the only way to have a pleasant married life is for the wife to be one with her husband. However, this dear wife, Israel, never learned to be habitual in this matter. At Ai they suffered a defeat and learned the lesson to be one with the Lord, but they did not learn it fully. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43338" data-verses="Joshua 9:1">chapter nine</span> the Gibeonites came to them in a different way. Whereas the people of Ai fought against Israel strongly, the Gibeonites came to them begging to be their servants. The result was that Israel, this independent, individualistic wife, was deceived. She had no protection, no safeguard. From this chapter we need to learn that, as the Lord’s wife, we should be one with Him all the time. This is the intrinsic significance of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43339" data-verses="Joshua 9:1">Joshua chapter nine</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="G5U0MksYOEnfAS3Ma_Y2wYXh7QU_zE3mitAvzI1N35YKULja8HdbFjTF0T86rA6X9"> Now that we have seen the intrinsic significance of this chapter, let us go on to consider what it says concerning the saving of Gibeon. </p>

They went out as though they were envoys, taking old sacks upon their donkeys, old torn up and bound up wineskins, old patched sandals on their feet, and old garments upon themselves. All the bread of their provisions was dry and had become moldy. They went to Joshua at the camp of Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “From a faraway land we have come; now therefore make a covenant with us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43343" data-verses="Joshua 9:6">v. 6</span>). The men of Israel said to these Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell among us. How then can we make a covenant with you?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43344" data-verses="Joshua 9:7">v. 7</span>). They told Joshua that they would be their servants. When Joshua asked them who they were and where they came from, they answered that they came from a very far land, having heard reports of Jehovah and of all that He had done in Egypt and to the two kings of the Amorites, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan. They went on to say that their elders and the inhabitants of their land told them to take provisions, go to meet the people of Israel, and say to them, “We will be your servants; make then a covenant with us” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43345" data-verses="Joshua 9:11">v. 11</span>). They claimed that their bread had been hot but was now moldy, that their wineskins were new but were now torn up, and that their clothes and sandals had become old because of the very long journey. From this we see that the Gibeonites acted craftily. </p>

In studying the Bible, we should not understand it merely according to letters nor according to the natural way by the natural mind. The Bible has its spirit, reality, and center.

The strongest people in Canaan were in a strip of land from Lebanon in the north to Egypt in the south and from the Mediterranean Sea to the river Jordan. These people included the Anakim, a race of giants. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43358" data-verses="Numbers 13:33">Numbers 13:33</span>, the sons of Anak were from the Nephilim. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43359" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span> reveals that the Nephilim were the issue of the evil union between the daughters of men and fallen angels. Because of the Nephilim, God charged His elect to slaughter everyone in the land. God is kind, loving, and merciful, but He is also severe because He has an enemy on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="NjN_f8h1GdjILTYtHS9rrAHQYXlOsjkTvkV9QlqkFJtFJ5vXsfh_4KyHl3Vqvg6kw"> God made the earth in His economy, and He purposely created a strip of land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.

But when Israel was ready to take possession of Canaan, it was filled with demon-possessed people, idol worshippers, and Nephilim. Joshua slaughtered them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43361" data-verses="Joshua 11:21-22">Josh. 11:21-22</span>), but some on the mountain were quite strong, so Caleb came in and conquered them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43362" data-verses="Joshua 14:6-14">14:6-14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="tCUrboafQNdzoEUqPMDBLHJ9QLgIDePm5LuWdRKrCKnBa9LkmI-AJb_2FIbvoqQoZ"> The significance of this is that without Joshua we cannot fully understand the spiritual warfare in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43363" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">Ephesians 6</span>.

The heavenlies are full of Satan’s forces. Christ is our good land, and God wants us to gain Christ, but there is a layer of devilish, demonic forces between us and the good land. If we would take possession of the good land for our enjoyment, we have to defeat these satanic forces. </p>

The good land was wide and spacious; however, Israel’s territory never spread to the Euphrates. Since there was much fighting and rebellion after the time of Joshua, there was not the opportunity for God’s people to build a temple. When David gained more land and there was a time of peace, Solomon, David’s son, was able to build the temple of God to set up God’s kingdom on earth. </p>

<p data-content-id="ATAqzg1lrtCwC0RXMz-4D8jmwCLcAM4aGE62QhJ8DfWznrpgQ33IpjsPd45z0tW5K"> Many spiritual items concerning Christ and the church are revealed in the New Testament in principle but not in detail. This is especially true in the matter of gaining Christ, experiencing Christ, and enjoying Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="FAziNMknEpNQmIfgOfih4aHFxblg_H_aaIjsS8WFW1pHrIxulEasIBjKP9pJN_Lnd"> In the book of Ephesians Christ is revealed as being all-inclusive because He is the One who fills all in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43449" data-verses="Ephesians 1:23">Eph. 1:23</span>). He is not only all-inclusive but also all-extensive because His love is immeasurable in its breadth, length, height, and depth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43450" data-verses="Ephesians 3:18-19">3:18-19a</span>). Christ’s love is just Himself. If His love is immeasurable, He is immeasurable. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43451" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. His riches are so plentiful and vast that they are untraceable. Although Ephesians reveals a Christ who is all-inclusive, all-extensive, and unsearchably rich, in this book we cannot find the detailed ways to gain this Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="CmVRmh0-5eJ9jDxQOz5rIilnFoGpvtgz_SX5ivmarG90DJXpS7fDr2u45pSE4rEYz"> The detailed ways to gain Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ are not in the New Testament. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43452" data-verses="Joshua 13:1">Joshua 13—22</span> provides the detailed way to possess and enjoy the land, which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="PCbU-9uGEHhpJPwUoOy8Pwfh-squO8UWZguFVKJ6cU4zRZqH2xcAgJ8797KoE39tJ"> The good land was spacious, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates, but the children of Israel did not possess all the land. Even with what they possessed, they still needed a detailed way to allot the land in order to gain and enjoy it. The way was by casting lots. In the book of Joshua the word <em>lot</em> is used in the sense of casting lots (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43453" data-verses="Joshua 18:8">18:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43454" data-verses="Joshua 18:10">10</span>). Humanly speaking, we know that casting lots depends on fortune, but God is our fortune, and the outcome <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> of the casting of lots was according to what He had ordained. When God created the earth, He had a clear view concerning the situation of the good land. He was clear, for instance, that Jerusalem and the surrounding district were for Judah, out of whom Christ would come. This was foreordained, but it still had to be realized by casting lots. God’s ordaining hand was present in the casting of lots to direct the result. This means that the division of the land did not depend upon Joshua, upon the high priest, or upon anyone other than God. As a result, there was no ground for the tribes to complain about the portion of the land allotted to them. The way of allotting the land was fair, and it caused everyone to be subdued. </p>
<p data-content-id="HE1VbQqcz8OJAkI-K1_SzGLbNirDYtjl-zLE7fjIEVFfRsEKYvG-sSnojq1RAYWh1"> At this juncture, I would like to emphasize the fact that Christ in Himself is uniquely one and always the same. As to Himself there is no change; He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43455" data-verses="Hebrews 13:8">Heb. 13:8</span>). However, in our experience and enjoyment Christ is of many sizes and types, as indicated by the different kinds of burnt offerings and meal offerings. What Christ is to us in our experience does not depend upon Him—it depends upon us. We gain Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ according to what we are. Therefore, someone who is diligent in pursuing Christ will experience a larger Christ than someone who is lazy in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="XcAS_zgEDuVm-7JBoxGSffG7oTOGB2ZWcl9kmDdVR58pO-2XBZq4BZgMtKewFWnaU"> Recently I have been considering that we may regard the twelve tribes of Israel as a picture of the believers from the first century until today. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43456" data-verses="Galatians 6:16">Galatians 6:16</span> says that we are “the Israel of God.” This indicates that among God’s New Testament elect there should be twelve “tribes.” The first tribe was the early apostles, who brought in the New Testament revelation. The second tribe was the church fathers. The third tribe was the martyrs in the Roman Empire. The fourth tribe was the reformers in the Roman Church, before the papal system was established. The fifth tribe was the Protestants, and the sixth was the mystics. The Protestants became shallow and dead, so there was a reaction from the mystics, including Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence. The seventh tribe was the Moravian brothers under Count Zinzendorf. The eighth tribe was the British Brethren under <span class="pg" data-page-id="79" id="79">[79]</span> John Nelson Darby. When the Brethren became full of dead knowledge, there was a three-way reaction. First, there was a reaction from the inner life Christians, including Andrew Murray, Jessie Penn-Lewis, and T. Austin-Sparks. This was the ninth tribe. Second, there was a reaction from evangelical Christians, including C. H. Spurgeon, D. L. Moody, Charles Finney, Hudson Taylor, William Carey, and David Livingstone. This was the tenth tribe. Third, there was a reaction from Pentecostal Christians. This was the eleventh tribe. The twelfth tribe is the recovery, which has recovered the New Testament revelation back to the early apostles. </p>
<p data-content-id="k8n9GXVUwH-Qit_XmyBEmScnHMpYMy9xX_cDzF-2lJQCa58oX1VD4Y8elhDfcOXpm"> In the recovery the truths from Matthew to Revelation have been recovered by the Lord. In particular, the Lord has recovered the truths concerning the all-inclusive Christ and the New Jerusalem. The truth in the recovery is the consummate truth of the past nineteen centuries. We are standing on the shoulders of all the tribes that have gone before us. Thus, the truth has been extracted, condensed, and crystallized for us. </p>

Even in His infancy Christ was a God-man. In a slow, gradual way Christ passed through boyhood into manhood. For thirty years Christ in His humanity lived in a despised country, in the despised town of Nazareth, and in the home of a poor carpenter. Then He came out to teach God, to minister God to people, and to express God’s attributes through man’s virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="17bzOhzUwAxG1E4F0KCUXnT8G16ioOGlP32InUNqHMcruCiVIfWSFIhxOhYOmObK3"> This God-man expressed God in man, through man, and with man. Although He was not learned, His speaking was full of wisdom. Although He was humble, He spoke not only with power but also with authority. In every virtue of this One there was something divine, for He was the God-man, God with the divine attributes expressed in man with the human virtues. He was God living as a man, God living a human life. </p>

The divine life, which was concealed in His humanity, needed to be released in order to increase and multiply. Therefore, Christ died not only to take away sin and to destroy Satan but also to release the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="TLwCShOFDcklJD0GUAcNFKElPLuoTvpJc7sufjsL7h1vpdVR8UHEocV_sD8J5dU8m"> By His death on the cross, Christ also terminated the old man and the old creation. Through incarnation Christ <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> became a man, and that man was the old creation. When Christ died, the old man in his totality and ultimate consummation also died. Therefore, when Christ was crucified as a man, the old man was terminated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43525" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>). Furthermore, when Christ became a man, He also became a creature, the Firstborn of all creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43526" data-verses="Colossians 1:15">Col. 1:15</span>). This creature was not of the new creation but of the old creation. When Christ was crucified as a creature, the entire old creation was brought to an end. </p>
<p data-content-id="nOrmH8KYLM2rxNX6myeFabjF51wubmtjSHEMQohvNIh0-YFYMjStOHoVnRpbLVqFE"> In addition, in His crucifixion Christ abolished “in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43527" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">Eph. 2:15</span>). The word <em>ordinances</em> here refers to rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and division. Because every nation and culture has its particular ordinances, today there are thousands of different ways of living. Nevertheless, in His crucifixion Christ abolished all these ordinances. Now among us in the church life there is only one way to live—to take Christ as our life, our living, and even our way of living and to live Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="6CVEZhIT-HJa9HolEQ3iJUbvS024qVSUe5hakZ9D1h5iJXItholkL_8CsGgE023SA"> After the Lord Jesus died, “one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43528" data-verses="John 19:34">John 19:34</span>). Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43529" data-verses="Hebrews 9:22">Heb. 9:22</span>) for the purchasing of the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43530" data-verses="Acts 20:28">Acts 20:28</span>). Water is for imparting life, for the ministering of God into us as life. The blood of Christ has redeemed us, and the divine life of Christ has flowed into us as a river to minister God into us. Now, as believers in Christ, we have been redeemed back to God, and we have God flowing into us as living water. </p>
<p data-content-id="RhR4z9jI4RcF9NY-xNqX_9ReNY3VgtBGknEIcLmxlZJztNYpfeXmg3E3tacIbm1yY"> Through the crucifixion of Christ, sin has been taken away, Satan has been destroyed, the divine life has been released, the old man has been terminated, the old creation has been brought to an end, the ordinances have been abolished, we have been redeemed back to God, and we have God flowing into us as living water. We all need to have such a view of the crucifixion of Christ. </p>

After incarnation, through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God’s firstborn Son. We may say that in His resurrection His humanity was “sonized.” Furthermore, Christ’s resurrection was a birth not only to Him but also to all His millions of believers, who were regenerated by God in the resurrection of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43535" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>) to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43536" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10-12">Heb. 2:10-12</span>). </p>

This Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God and the reality of resurrection. Actually, this Spirit is the pneumatic Christ Himself. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43538" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span> resurrection is Christ Himself, and Christ is now the life-giving Spirit. Hence, the life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection. When we live in this Spirit, we live in resurrection. When we love others in this Spirit, we love them in resurrection. </p>

All the believers of Christ are <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> organically united with Him and constituted with His life and element and have thus become His Body, an organism, to express Him.

In typology, these three matters show us certain details regarding the enjoyment of Christ. </p>

This indicates that in order to inherit Christ as our good land, we must have the proper genealogy; that is, we must have the proper origin of life. In the Bible, inheritance is determined according to genealogy. A genealogy is a matter of life, and this life is related to tribes, houses, and families. The fact that the daughters of Zelophehad were of one of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph indicates that they had the proper origin of life. The enjoyment of Christ as our inheritance depends very much on the life which we have received in Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> </p>

In the church we have the standing to inherit Christ for our enjoyment. This means that if we would enjoy Christ as our inheritance, participating in His riches, we must have the church life. Our fellowship with the saints in the church life is crucial for our enjoyment of Christ. If we lose our fellowship with the saints, we will lose our enjoyment of Christ. Those who give up the church life with the fellowship of life spontaneously lose their right to inherit the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="09fUXFohdgdgghowQf3ChxwVa-bWgfDTOFY46iIcYA1WGv10ZEbzD2Ik1XB1aWd5c">The Females Being Weaker Ones</h2><p data-content-id="7keN_4jjkqiYUVH8snG3OCpPB9adCcdjrVCuBa8Zql2XYR1x8TTJ50q8l9mdl3acb"> The females signify the weaker ones. In the sight of God, we all are females; we all are weaker ones. Only Christ is the strong One. Spiritually speaking, in the entire universe there is only one male—God embodied in Christ. All the believers, including the brothers, are females. Therefore, the five daughters of Zelophehad typify us. </p>
<p data-content-id="_6Z1jfPiAaEWZ64wRKZ7KF5eAqYPhOn_z-s-ya2wv5c7m9CuWtOKgcNyoFrqcgkiq"> In particular, the daughters of Zelophehad, being females, signify the weaker ones in the church life. We have been born of God and we are in the church life, having the standing to inherit Christ as our good land for our enjoyment. However, we may be weak, not having the strength or capacity to enjoy Christ. We may have the heart to enjoy Christ but may lack the capacity or the strength to enjoy Him. How, then, can we inherit Christ as the good land? We need to take the way of fellowship, indicated by the contact the daughters of Zelophehad had with their kinsmen. Among the tribe of Manasseh, there were many families with men, signifying the stronger ones. By contacting the stronger kinsmen, the weaker ones were able to keep their father’s name and his inheritance within the tribe, signifying the keeping of the enjoyment of Christ. Today, you may be weak, but in God’s house, the church, there are stronger ones. Through fellowship, especially in the vital groups, the weaker ones will be strengthened by the stronger ones and thus will be able to enjoy Christ as their inheritance. <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="rfCCuiyqO0r5_ipBWJIF98ajOcG-ad5QtAnFwkRiKTKfrpWaCHrQi1k-oap2s6d6z"> The cities of refuge signify the all-inclusive Christ as the place to which we can escape when we realize that we are sinful. The all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the redeeming God is the city of refuge where we are safeguarded, covered, and concealed. Christ is not only our Savior but also our refuge. Whenever the “storm” of our sin comes, we can run into Christ as our refuge to stay with Him. Then by Christ’s death, signified by the death of the high priest, we are released. </p>

After these tribes fought along with their brothers, they were qualified to return to their land to enjoy their inheritance. This indicates that we cannot enjoy Christ without the Body. We must be one with the Body in order to share the inheritance of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="KW14aVNgzhpECQjvKKoIE7BcI0SmUlygEh73WtOKi0rbhfNXa9tmciSqmJO9J7dRp"> When Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned to enjoy their inheritance of the land, they built a great altar at the river Jordan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43559" data-verses="Joshua 22:10">Josh. 22:10</span>). This offended the other tribes and caused the children of Israel in Canaan to go up in battle against them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43560" data-verses="Joshua 22:11-20">vv. 11-20</span>). Eventually, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh explained to the other tribes that they built the altar not for offerings but for a witness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43561" data-verses="Joshua 22:21-29">vv. 21-29</span>). When Phinehas the priest, the leaders of the assembly, and the heads of the thousands of Israel who <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> were with him heard this explanation, it seemed good in their sight (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="43562" data-verses="Joshua 22:30">v. 30</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="lP3-PmOBr-l-bpcGMKvgZrUOLISX_XckH5UuqL8Qc8L4jfeMKbBEniotpitBebLb9"> The record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="43563" data-verses="Joshua 22:1">Joshua 22</span> shows us that no matter what the situation of God’s people might be today, we are not allowed to set up another altar for the worship of God or for fellowship with God. In God’s economy, among God’s people there should be only one altar, in Jerusalem. All God’s people had to go there to offer their sacrifices to God for their worship and fellowship with God. This indicates that in the enjoyment of Christ division must be avoided to the uttermost. Nevertheless, in certain places the dissenting ones, not caring for the one accord in the Lord’s recovery, have formed divisions by building another altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="ORZz_jwUMOElRQK8Sv2cPaOuiR551mM6S0G-xwcf5QBosk8xtgGMlMGsqD59abtEp"> It is very significant that in a portion of the holy Word concerned with the inheritance of the good land we have a record about the building of another altar.

Then after Moses left, Joshua became the leader of the people of Israel, and he continued as the leader for about twenty-five years. During his years with Moses and his years as leader, Joshua was involved with God’s interest. He had learned that God is unique, faithful, and right in everything. He knew that if the Israelites forsook God, they surely would suffer. Therefore, he issued a warning to them, and afterward he died in peace. </p>
