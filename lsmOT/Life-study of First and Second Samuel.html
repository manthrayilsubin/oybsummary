<h1 class="title" data-content-id="kWw5aASFZea7bwtYztG5qn8XE5X66uALVLmzNecUbYHc-hAvVkqSs5Vi0qsT_2QXU">AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</h1><p class="scripture" data-content-id="Jr790C2wlW11berxSFEhadZgcBao47mAOz94wWzgGinfviOVUPrN8sVgnTjqbNHsB">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44236" data-verses="1Samuel 1:1">1 Sam. 1</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="zaZkutwE1XRflcsIvT7ck19lvpKXh2bhiefqDPd83iIxGGZI7JJxoqAL2Op2XIhpp"> In studying the Bible, the book of books, we need to be clear that the Bible is not a book of doctrine. Strictly speaking, the Bible is not even a book of truths. What, then, is the Bible? The Bible is the divine revelation. The Greek word for <em>revelation</em> means to uncover something that has been hidden or concealed. The Bible is totally God’s revelation concerning Himself, the universe, and humanity. The more I study the Bible, the more I am convinced that it is not by man but by God. There are a great many sentences in the Scriptures that could have been uttered only by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="atI04UAhNpuCGtehkSZBqejKIQfHsR_zz-QaLnwiW70NuxZbeZ6w227c7HaQkRVFc"> To understand the Bible as the divine revelation, we need a spirit of wisdom to know and a spirit of revelation to see. This was the reason Paul prayed that “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,” would give to us “a spirit of wisdom and revelation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44237" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17">Eph. 1:17</span>). This indicates that we need divine wisdom to understand the divine revelation. The natural human mind and the common human knowledge cannot apprehend the revelation of God. For this we need a spirit. Thank God that He has created us with such an organ! As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44238" data-verses="Job 32:8">Job 32:8a</span> says, “There is a spirit in man.” God has created for us a spirit particularly that we may know Him. Today we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know and to see the things which are covered, hidden, concealed. </p>
<p data-content-id="bHgn9Q-KapSSLQIR4Z1ZCaIJAqxnki1mY62v4yHLSCXg6Npt6ik4O8XtWIWCGVnWq"> We must admit that we do not know the Bible. Only the processed and consummated Triune God knows the Bible. The more we realize this, the more we will pray, “Lord, we need You. We need Your mercy and Your blessing. Lord, we need You as the Spirit and as the Word. Otherwise, we may read the Bible again and again and still not know anything.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="q4UpcavGePTL-kVcmkI_1k4WMIj3wsFXmXOEW27zccYzKTtt3tVJpytK9vdW7NziE"> The Bible as the divine revelation reveals God’s eternal economy, which is for a particular person—Christ. Christ is God Himself from eternity, but one day He became a man. He is the complete God and a perfect man; hence, He is called the God-man. We can see God only in Christ. Apart from Christ, or outside of Christ, we cannot see God. Likewise, the real humanity is only in Christ. Apart from Him, we cannot see a true, real, and genuine man. </p>
<p data-content-id="yg0jPmYJ7QrN1rOclXhYeGR-iSGEJ5sdLpaXE80KoYeZquG2SEtfDdKt-Iqp3ahgE"> Christ came to do the will of the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44239" data-verses="John 6:38">John 6:38</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44240" data-verses="John 4:34">4:34</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44241" data-verses="John 5:30">5:30</span>), to carry out God’s economy. He lived on earth and tasted all aspects of human life. He then went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death. Three days later He rose in His humanity, and by resurrection He brought His humanity into divinity, making His humanity a part of the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44242" data-verses="Romans 1:3-4">Rom. 1:3-4</span>). In this way He became the firstborn Son of God, regenerating us as the many sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44243" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44244" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="T8Yneii7JXABIOGJQmw3OBHaPi5TV8yEYJ0PNO2UKNoN5otHiOSNZYnzxySXqTzgb"> He as God became a man, and we as man are becoming God in life and in nature but not in His Godhead. He is the source, and we are the produce. The produce must be the same as the source. Thus, we, the children of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44245" data-verses="John 1:12">John 1:12</span>), are the same as God in life and nature but not in the Godhead, in the person of God. As a whole, we are the Body of Christ. Christ as the Head and we as the Body form the new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44246" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">Eph. 4:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44247" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">Col. 3:10-11</span>). As believers in Christ, we all are parts of this new man. This is a brief sketch of the divine revelation concerning God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="nqpweAlRJS8AoyA_4zh7qA7BNEEE9dZNgYtqN9SMuiykXXNLFL4M_rWNASOdOzf_2"> Without this governing view of God’s economy, we cannot understand the Bible. If we do not have such a view as we read the Bible, we will wrongly understand the Bible. This is the reason I pointed out in the messages on Joshua, Judges, and Ruth that the most important thing for us to see is God’s economy. These three books are not merely books of history; they are a part of the divine revelation concerning God’s economy. Furthermore, in these books are a number of types, which are pictures, portraits, showing us how we can participate in God’s economy. The principle is exactly the same with the books of 1 and 2 Samuel. These books are part of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> revelation concerning God’s economy and contain pictures related to our participation in God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="67dasedgohowRZZ1VRYMp4gKMmVwkGH1Gac0kTepqLY8x9YtHe1yLONS3jH88y7bp"> For this life-study of 1 and 2 Samuel, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see what is revealed in these two books. In 1 and 2 Samuel there are four main persons—Eli, Samuel, Saul, and David—and at this point I would like to say a brief word about each of them. The crucial matters regarding these persons may be expressed in the following four statements, which are extracts of 1 and 2 Samuel: </p>
<p data-content-id="RW-1T0ORFGeCiLT-Iz1TafFivcSWBgjf4d3lz74DDUxwncZxua7ENRg1wL1jq8Kta"> 1. Eli’s failure in the people’s degradation brought in the waning of the stale priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="soofKjz9MBuX3nvwndy-__zPTLkQbhzognrIBAGznTNM_e_ir8Q5nU0BSBnD7GOkw"> 2. Samuel’s ministry in the Nazarite vow ended the judgeship and brought in the priesthood for God’s oracle and the kingship for God’s administration. </p>
<p data-content-id="wz_Tf5AacTANnmKa2WKosNmj5tdWkfSKFSI5lh4iJCr3UYMVf53leSgEeElHEzqpd"> 3. Saul’s fleshly life insulted the kingship in the divine government and caused him to lose it. </p>
<p data-content-id="LLbJJ89S3KOyxNA70NQVap6zWv-xFMv2AMxcQqDgUokcBGwcLZat849aMMcrCKeXE"> 4. David’s godly life secured the kingship in God’s economy, and his indulgence contaminated the kingship of God’s holiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="mcSqnaE9mgCHQOhwj7Jq6ycs4awmmV7BkgrzJyIIrbyi59GjNyb05oCMHY5IjEnlE"> At the beginning of 1 Samuel, there is a picture of Eli’s failure. This failure took place in the degradation of the people of Israel. Eli was a priest who brought in the waning of the stale priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZtLh1kzlclk25dqS_ej05rXlSwOBmKMNLgRMSnHHKeu6cu8s1RWgQ-18amj-W4aUx"> Samuel’s ministry brought in the prophethood for God’s oracle and the kingship for God’s administration. The priesthood ordained by God was supposed to do two things: to speak the word of God and to carry out God’s administration, His governmental dealing with His people. Thus, on the one hand, the priests were God’s spokesmen and, on the other hand, they were God’s representatives. They spoke the things of God, and they represented God in His administration. Because the priesthood at the time of Eli was stale and was waning, Samuel was raised up to replace the stale and waning priesthood. Samuel did not have a failure. Rather, he had a ministry in the Nazarite vow that ended the judgeship and brought in the prophethood for God’s speaking, for God’s oracle, and also brought in the kingship for God’s administration. </p>
<p data-content-id="AfAVbsLtC9DIxrFPNyNVVyAgswv4XXlvOti463N5_Sh8hOXv9OqyQs-r4UKFjVqw3"> Although it may be difficult for us to understand Samuel, it is easy for us to understand Saul because he and we are <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> sick with the same disease. Saul’s life was fleshly, and our life also is fleshly. No matter what our nationality may be, we all are Sauls. Saul’s fleshly life insulted, offended, the kingship in the divine government and caused him to lose it. He brought shame upon God’s kingship in the divine government. In a sense, many believers have done the same thing and have lost their kingship. </p>
<p data-content-id="FSfjCLh95kgikpunHmmaLH8vT4PBJZ_bBMjo2jd698WbzSDMeptiJa37d2ri2sU54"> David is a contrast to Saul. Whereas Saul’s life was fleshly, David’s life was godly. The word <em>fleshly</em> denotes the fallen man, and the word <em>godly</em> refers to one who is with God. Saul’s fleshly life caused him to lose the kingship, but David’s godly life secured the kingship in the divine economy. However, David’s indulgence in lust contaminated and damaged the kingship of God’s holiness. Although David did not lose the kingship wholly, he lost a very large part of it. Only one tribe, Judah, was left for him. </p>
<p data-content-id="CVJUZ8dFaRK-daeisd7tj5VwmEq-FpU59aBBJw8laSj1aTpF6T5cUb1MEKccvu5hb"> Let us now go on to consider several other introductory matters. </p>

Samuel was a Levite by birth and a Nazarite by consecration, to be a priest, a prophet, and a judge. He initiated the prophethood to replace the waning priesthood in the speaking for God, terminated the judgeship, and brought in the kingship. Saul was the first king among Israel in the negative sense. David was the king in the positive sense according to the heart of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="d8cYMfPwVEOUSxuQeIsNTYHVM11ebomX0ESmEtIVO7W0skwBfSQM2Mdnip5OhGGHn"> In this message we will begin to consider the history concerning Samuel, beginning with his origin, birth, and youth. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QqvXxFmTgnGbhODqVAxClRqYxUY9FXTPYod2M8wzk2ZoO-fbJrWrMSqmTSAyZomhL">I. HIS ORIGIN</h2><p data-content-id="K_cgtAS9sdpAfEKAoaggi84YvOwKkJFiVZ3AdCLj0Rxy_aNDVz-Xw4s77PwOh-10e"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44262" data-verses="1Samuel 1:1-20">1:1-20</span> we have a word regarding Samuel’s origin. We should not consider that Samuel came out simply from his father, Elkanah. Actually, Samuel came out of God’s economy. God had His eternal economy, but the carrying out of God’s economy had come into question. God had ordained that Aaron’s descendants would be the priests for the carrying out of His economy, but that priesthood became stale and waning. God’s heart’s desire was to gain someone to replace that priesthood. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZqMjMYs4GUm2DWmzRlPzGiDmxn1pEQLi3b6mw1YD_-oilAqhKPeQ_hGBK4mVheFk"> In order to gain such a person, God brought together in marriage Elkanah and Hannah. Elkanah had two wives. According to God’s sovereign arrangement, the second wife, Peninnah, had children, but Hannah had no children. Furthermore, “her rival provoked her bitterly to irritate her, because Jehovah had shut up her womb” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44263" data-verses="1Samuel 1:6">v. 6</span>). This forced Hannah to pray desperately not mainly for herself but for God. She promised God that if He gave her a male child, she would return the child to Him by the vow of a Nazarite. God was pleased with Hannah’s prayer and her promise and He opened her womb. Hannah conceived, bore a child, and named him Samuel. From this we see that actually no human being <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> was the origin of Samuel. God was the real origin, who motivated His people sovereignly and secretly. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="d8cYMfPwVEOUSxuQeIsNTYHVM11ebomX0ESmEss5O7W0skwBfSQM2Mdnip5OhGGHn">A.

The line of life is a line to bring forth Christ for the enjoyment of God’s people that on earth God may have His kingdom, which is the Body of Christ, the very organism of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="O2CcE15dHP5ikXGu_1sMIOCs2aj9GgeMuL-i4GG2vV8NxpvdpvUnniKG5UJSUOwur"> Elkanah and Hannah remained in this line of life not merely for God’s eternal salvation but for His eternal purpose. God’s salvation is mainly for our benefit, whereas God’s purpose is related to the fulfilling of God’s desire. We need to ask ourselves whether we are here for our profit or for God’s purpose. Today on this earth everyone is concerned for his own profit. Even the majority of Christians do not care for God’s purpose. I can testify of Brother Watchman Nee that he was a man altogether for God’s purpose. I would like to follow his pattern. In the Lord’s recovery, we are for God’s purpose, remaining in the line of life ordained by God for His eternal purpose, which is to gain the Body, the organism of the Triune God, that He may have a full expression in a corporate way. </p>

Elkanah and Hannah were not the only ones moving; they were moved by the moving One, by the unique, divine Mover, who was moving secretly behind the scene. Under God’s sovereign dealing, Hannah was suppressed in her soul with a burden in her spirit to pour out before Jehovah. This was God’s move. Because of God’s moving in her, Hannah could not have peace <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> until she prayed for a son. God, the sovereign One, kept moving her and motivating her so that she had to pray, even though Eli, the one taking care of the service in God’s house, did not understand her. In her prayer Hannah cooperated with the move of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="3NDAFlHwhdy_9dmD-OFuZYGiVyE5FvKtszLMmKjyvR5y1jJ5uS9IDcOlTaQ3xQ8Jd"> God could motivate Hannah as a person who was one with Him in the line of life. As long as He can gain such a person, He has a way on earth. I hope that at least some of us will be today’s Hannahs and say, “Lord, if You have anything on Your heart to accomplish for Your purpose, I am here. I am remaining in the line of life for the carrying out of Your economy.” If you do this, I have the full assurance that you will be the ones whom God will move. He will come to you and motivate you. God needs many Hannahs, persons who can bring forth some Samuels to turn the age. </p>

Her prayer was an echo of the heart’s desire of God. Her prayer was a human cooperation with the divine move for the carrying out of God’s eternal economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="YIV0JDP8kkyRSBzBIpSKK33vdQshUkeEbWJnjoHrKerlT5clVjbaCk4taXbuGg5Qo"> We should no longer pray old prayers in a formal way. Instead, we need to pray something that is an echo of what is on God’s heart. This means that what we say in our prayer is exactly what God wants to speak. Such a prayer is the speaking out of God’s heart. Hannah’s prayer was like this. God wanted a Samuel, yet He needed Hannah’s cooperation to pray to Him, saying, “Lord, I need a son.” This prayer was very human, yet it was a cooperation with the divine move for God’s economy. </p>

A Nazarite is one who is consecrated to God absolutely. A Nazarite could never cut his hair or drink wine. In the Bible, long hair signifies the headship, the authority. A Nazarite’s keeping his hair long was a sign that just as a female takes her husband as her head, he takes God as the Head, considering God his Husband. Thus, a Nazarite is one who submits himself to God, taking God as the Head, the authority. This is why Hannah prayed that if the Lord would give her a boy, no razor would come upon his head (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44267" data-verses="1Samuel 1:11">v. 11</span>). In the Bible, to drink wine is to enjoy the worldly pleasures. A Nazarite not only submits to God as the authority but also has no interest in the enjoyment of worldly pleasures. Even before he was born, Samuel was consecrated by his mother to be such a person. This is a great thing, for it was Samuel who brought in a new age. </p>
<p data-content-id="tnH-aFo5-PXqo1bpASNkoXeDQcqTrH6fzGUcvakYVJLGRuJ4QU0v6lAcxNcH0gN82"> The New Testament age was brought in by another Nazarite—John the Baptist. The Lord Jesus was a Nazarite, as were Peter and Paul. Actually, everyone who remains in the line of life is a Nazarite. If we would be today’s Nazarites, we must take God as our Head and Husband, submitting to Him, and have no interest in worldly pleasures. </p>
<p data-content-id="hcRtWqGBH-hUmb-3ALjMglnZDtvzYW8cjeRohbaYxPq0ZHYmcvLVc70RG3Ua-Psta"> We need to be impressed with Samuel’s origin, with his source. Because he came out of such a strong source, he could <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> not be an ordinary, worldly person. Rather, he was the one who replaced the waning priesthood and brought forth David, who brought forth Christ. </p>

This verse speaks of Samuel’s birth, which came through God’s answer to man’s prayer. His name means “heard of God” or “asked for of God.” </p>

<p data-content-id="1-A3n7O6FOYbwU6kTuqyqC0vQiYuSoJ9ruEMiY335TRm4FKiiizQN5jJKSsMpv__D"> In his youth, perhaps at the age of two or three, Samuel was offered to Jehovah by his mother to fulfill her vow to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44269" data-verses="1Samuel 1:21-28">vv. 21-28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44270" data-verses="1Samuel 1:11">11</span>). It was not easy for Hannah to take her child from her bosom and place him under the custody of another person, especially a very old person who had nearly lost his sight. Nevertheless, Hannah fulfilled her vow by offering Samuel to God. </p>

This was God’s wisdom. Because God intended to replace the waning priesthood with Samuel, it was necessary for him to learn certain lessons while he was under Eli’s custody. Samuel could realize that Eli had become a failure in the degraded priesthood. Samuel had the capacity to understand and apprehend what he saw in Eli’s situation, and this became a constant warning to Samuel for the future. </p>

How terrible! History tells us that this kind of thing has happened repeatedly among God’s servants. In serving the Lord we cannot avoid having contact with the other sex, but we must learn the lesson to always keep a distance between us and the other sex. We should never stay in a private room with a member of the other sex with the windows covered and the doors closed. That gives the evil one the opportunity to tempt us to fall into sin. The two sons of Eli were caught by this. Concerning this, we should learn from Joseph, who fled from temptation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44292" data-verses="Genesis 39:7-12">Gen. 39:7-12</span>), and from Boaz, who was highly appraised for his high standard of morality in his contact with Ruth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44293" data-verses="Ruth 3:1-14">Ruth 3:1-14</span>). </p>

Rather, they trusted in the systems ordained by God. In their situation they should have repented, made a thorough confession, and returned to God from their idols.

Thus, his being placed by God in His wisdom under the custody of the old Eli was very profitable, for he learned certain things positively and observed other things negatively.

<p data-content-id="lvrBgN9QRVrZMnZ6kelG9W4QHZOTYAkx7smeTvT28m94ceSIDzFoHrXnTpc_JrGEk"> While Samuel was under Eli’s custody, God taught him in a very fine way, built him up, and established him as His proper priest. As such a priest, Samuel became a judge to judge Israel, a prophet to prophesy for God, and the one to bring forth the kingship. By this kingship the kingdom of God was established on earth. This is a picture of what our situation should be today. We need to be, first, a Samuel, and then, a David, enjoying Christ to such a degree that what we have enjoyed of Christ will become a kingdom, which is the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="O2CcE15dHP5ikXGu_1sMIOCs2aj9GgeMuL-m4HWuvV8NxpvdpvUnniKG5UJSUOwur"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44314" data-verses="Matthew 16:18-19">Matthew 16:18-19</span> the church and the kingdom are identical. The kingdom today is the church, and within the church there is the intrinsic essence—the Body of Christ. The church is visible, but the Body of Christ, as the intrinsic essence, is invisible. In the visible church there is the kingdom, the reigning, of God. In this visible church there is also the intrinsic essence as the very content, the reality, of the church. Our human body is visible, but the life within the body is invisible. The principle is the same with the church and the Body. The Body is the intrinsic life of the church. </p>

Usurped, in Their Superstition for Their Victory<br/>in Their Fighting against the Philistines,<br/>by the Elders of the People of Israel,<br/>Who Were Degraded from the Line of God’s Economy</h2><p data-content-id="cTs4v7F-ocP7t-ZtOJK7PcjT_NztMc_mTpQOrpsj5vMk25J4rOeutOBXwq04bxC0S"> The ark of God was usurped by the elders of the people <span class="pg" data-page-id="22" id="22">[22]</span> of Israel, who were degraded from the line of God’s economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44317" data-verses="1Samuel 4:1-8">4:1-8</span>). The elders usurped the ark in their superstition for their fighting against the Philistines. Because the children of Israel had been defeated by the Philistines, the elders of Israel proposed that the people take the ark of God from the tabernacle in Shiloh into battle with them. The elders said, “Let us take unto us the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from Shiloh that it may be in our midst, and thus save us from the hand of our enemies” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44318" data-verses="1Samuel 4:3">v. 3b</span>). When the ark came into the camp, the people were glad and “all Israel shouted with a great shout” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44319" data-verses="1Samuel 4:5">v. 5</span>). They trusted in the system ordained by God, but they did not trust in God directly. They should have repented to God of their failure and inquired of Him as to what He wanted them to do. Before bringing the ark of God out of the tabernacle, they should have checked with God as Joshua did at Jericho (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44320" data-verses="Joshua 6:2-4">Josh. 6:2-4</span>). The elders knew the history of Jericho, but because they had become degraded, not having any heart for God’s desire or His eternal economy, their situation was absolutely different. </p>
<p data-content-id="YIV0JDP8kkyRSBzBIpSKK33vdQshUkeEbWJ_jo3jKerlT5clVjbaCk4taXbuGg5Qo"> The ark was a type of Christ as the embodiment of God. It also signified Christ as the presence of the Triune God to be with His people for the carrying out of His economy to establish His kingdom on earth. To bring out the ark was just to bring out the presence of God. When the children of Israel began to move with the ark from Mount Sinai, Moses offered a prayer to God, saying, “Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44321" data-verses="Numbers 10:35">Num. 10:35</span>). The ark took the lead to travel onward. The move of the ark was a picture of God’s move on the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="EWXpwEJc1QH9LIugyCBIbt_R_R1UxFcxvpjhOJtHN5lz-m5QHO_Mkoa3O4gh9MJIC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44322" data-verses="1Samuel 4:1">1 Samuel 4</span> the elders of Israel were actually usurping God. At that time, God did not intend to move. The children of Israel had no thought of or concern for God’s economy, and their bringing out the ark indicated that they were usurping God for their safety, peace, rest, and profit. They were usurping God, even forcing Him, to go out with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="DfbFTJZtA2pONOAHay_Pqwt3UUpArXNcdgTL3ADejZb_vgfxuXqpLanr1eBBzVVPQ"> Today many Christians usurp God by praying for their prosperity, health, or family without any consideration of God’s economy. When we ask God for His healing, we must be fully related to His economy. If you are ill, you should not <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> pray for healing in the way of usurping God. On the contrary, from the depths of your spirit you should say, “Lord, I am not here on earth for my health, my prosperity, my children, or my work. I am here for Your economy. Do You still want me to live on earth for Your economy? I have seen Your economy, I realize that You need Nazarites, and I have a heart to be a Nazarite for You. As one who has been born of God and who has the life and nature of God, I ask You what is on Your heart concerning me.” If God intends that you continue living on earth for His economy, you will be healed, either through a physician or through some other way. The point here is that, instead of usurping God, we must pray, live, and be persons according to God’s heart and for His economy. </p>

From that time the ark began to have a history within the history of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="eqxHAx-voiEWGwWaUJ3iFiiPhXyZlFNcIOoAJyRIymK2gjblcrDofftfcAHMO6D4o"> A short time after the children of Israel brought out the ark of God, they were defeated, and the ark was captured. Thirty thousand among Israel were killed, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were also killed. Eli probably had a kind of intuition concerning the ark of God. Instead of staying at home, he sat “on his seat by the roadside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44324" data-verses="1Samuel 4:13">v. 13a</span>). When the news came that the ark of God had been captured, Eli fell backward, broke his neck, and died. Also, at that time Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, delivered her child and called him Ichabod, which means “No glory.” Then she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44325" data-verses="1Samuel 4:22">v. 22</span>). Because the ark of Jehovah had been captured, the glory had departed from Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UmS-dXn2vc7BbV-xn9e2alx6qek-lDmhZtlGG5yeZPLzAE7RS94Fz-7w9rUCNhsh"> These events must have made a deep impression upon the young Samuel. During the night he might have thought about them, saying, “Here I am in the tabernacle, and the center of the tabernacle is the ark. Today the elders brought out the ark, <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> but Eli, under whose custody I am, was not at peace. His heart was trembling as he was waiting for news. When the news came about what happened to the ark and to Hophni and Phinehas, Eli fell backward and died. His daughter-in-law also died as she was giving birth to her child. Before she died, she named her boy Ichabod.” I believe that Samuel, a very thoughtful boy, considered the significance of all these things. </p>

After the Philistines brought the ark to Ashdod, they brought it into the house of Dagon and set it next to Dagon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44328" data-verses="1Samuel 5:2">v. 2</span>).

<p data-content-id="soofKjz9MBuX3nvwndy-__zPTLkQbhzognrYBCSLnTNM_e_ir8Q5nU0BSBnD7GOkw"> In this message we will begin to consider Samuel’s ministry. Under God’s sovereignty, Samuel was given to God by his mother, he grew up under the custody of Eli, he was educated and perfected, and his eyes were opened to see both positive and negative things. As a result, he became a person who was ready to be used by God to turn the age. </p>
<p data-content-id="wz_Tf5AacTANnmKa2WKosNmj5tdWkfSKFSIplj8eJCr3UYMVf53leSgEeElHEzqpd"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44359" data-verses="1Samuel 7:1">First Samuel 7:1</span> tells us that the men of Kiriath-jearim brought the ark of Jehovah to the house of Abinadab. “It was a long time from the day when the ark began to abide in Kiriath-jearim, for it was twenty years. And all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44360" data-verses="1Samuel 7:2">v. 2</span>). Here we see a dividing line in the history of Israel. Prior to this time Israel’s situation was upside-down; after this time the situation became right-side-up. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44361" data-verses="1Samuel 7:3">verse 3</span> Samuel “spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you are returning with all your heart to Jehovah, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from your midst, and direct your heart to Jehovah and serve only Him; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.” Then the children of Israel removed the Baalim and the Ashtaroth and served only Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44362" data-verses="1Samuel 7:4">v. 4</span>). Following this Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Jehovah for you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44363" data-verses="1Samuel 7:5">v. 5</span>). The picture portrayed in these verses is very beautiful. Here we have a people returning to <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> God and a man—Samuel—who was one with God on earth. We may say that Samuel was the acting God on earth. At least we may say that Samuel was the representative of the very God in heaven to rule over His people on earth. As such a person, Samuel began to minister. </p>

The Nazarite vow was initiated by his mother and completed by Samuel. </p>

Referring to Samuel, God says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44368" data-verses="1Samuel 2:35">2:35</span>, “I shall raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in My heart and in My mind; and I shall build him a sure house; and he shall go before My anointed continually.” This indicates that Samuel would be a faithful priest to act on behalf of God, even to appoint and establish kings for the divine government on earth. David was appointed and anointed by him. From this we see that Samuel was high in qualifications and great in capacity. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="Jr790C2wlW11berxSFEhadZgcBao47mAOz9owXnoGinfviOVUPrN8sVgnTjqbNHsB">2.

His whole being and person, not just <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> his doing, living, and work, were according to God. Samuel’s being and God’s heart were one. For this reason it is not too much to say that Samuel, a man according to God, was the acting God on earth. God’s mind was Samuel’s consideration. He had no other thought, consideration, or thinking. His living and working were for the carrying out of whatever was in God’s heart. As a consequence, Samuel was one who turned the age. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="atI04UAhNpuCGtehkSZBqejKIQfHsR_zz-QKLm0KW70NuxZbeZ6w227c7HaQkRVFc">3.

He did not rebel against the house of Aaron, and he did not usurp anything of the house of Aaron. There was no revolution; there was only revelation. As Samuel was growing, God arranged the environment to perfect him and to build up his capacity to do everything that was needed for God to change the age. In the recovery the Lord will never allow any kind of rebellion, but He will bring in many changes, adjustments, and improvements, not through rebellion but through revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="q4UpcavGePTL-kVcmkI_1k4WMIj3wsFXmXOUW0fTccYzKTtt3tVJpytK9vdW7NziE"> Samuel had a clear view of God’s economy and also of what the enemy had been doing to devastate God’s economy on earth. Samuel was thus a person full of insight concerning God’s economy and concerning the environmental situation. Eventually, God did something to match him, and there was a change among the people of Israel. The people returned to God, lamented before God, and were willing to remove all the idols. Before this change took place, there was preparation on two sides: on the side of the people, who returned to God, and on the side of Samuel, who was perfected, equipped, and qualified for God’s move on earth. In this situation the Philistines, who knew certain things concerning Israel and God and who tried to bribe God with their kind of trespass offering, were defeated to the uttermost. </p>

Anointing Saul and David to Be Kings</h2><p data-content-id="8Ai1vnnjfDSI2kARU_QU2Bor3dRdPCT-Y5w8bJ0a6dvRy9ur0pq18_jV8xhqMAGmh"> In this replacing priesthood, Samuel anointed Saul and David to be kings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44369" data-verses="1Samuel 10:1">10:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44370" data-verses="1Samuel 16:1">16:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44371" data-verses="1Samuel 16:13">13</span>) as God ordained that he <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> should go before His anointed continually (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44372" data-verses="1Samuel 2:35">2:35b</span>) to supervise the king, observing what the king was doing. This indicates that Samuel, the acting God on earth, was greater than the king. Samuel could be qualified to such an extent because for many years God had been perfecting him for His economy, not for anything else. </p>
<p data-content-id="09jsWLSoWMPfukP6C7e9LNeQ9H5TPdN9omqalgdv3WdxZYS8pu1mdRLVIT9HzdAZd"> When God’s economy is carried out among His people, they are blessed. This means that our welfare, our well-being, is altogether linked to the carrying out of God’s economy. We should not seek our well-being apart from God’s economy. Because this has been neglected and even lost, it needs to be recovered. I wish to say, especially to the young saints, that we should not expect to have prosperity for ourselves. Rather, as saints in the Lord’s recovery, we should expect that through us the Lord will do as much as possible to accomplish His economy. Then we will be blessed. </p>

In the priesthood the first thing that a priest should do is speak for God. The breastplate and the Urim and the Thummim worn by the high priest were the means used by God to speak to His people. In the degradation of the priesthood, God’s speaking was almost lost. Thus, God needed to raise up a living person, a prophet, to speak for Him, and this is what He did with Samuel. In God’s ordination Samuel is counted as the first prophet. Of course, Abraham was a <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> prophet speaking for God, but in God’s ordained way Samuel was the first prophet to set up a prophethood. </p>
<p data-content-id="QqvXxFmTgnGbhODqVAxClRqYxUY9FXTPYodqM-ETk2ZoO-fbJrWrMSqmTSAyZomhL"> In the Old Testament the last part of the divine revelation is with the prophets, from Isaiah to Malachi. Apart from God’s speaking the universe would be empty. We thank the Lord that, by His mercy, we have His continual speaking in His recovery today. </p>

Samuel received the word of God and spoke it to the old Eli in the waning priesthood. This speaking should have gone forth through Eli, but he was waning, and God could not speak through him. Instead, God spoke through someone much younger. </p>

From this we should learn the lesson that no matter what we do, no matter how good, “spiritual,” and even scriptural it may be, as long as we have a replacement for God, that is evil. We may do good things, but those good things are evil in the sight of God as long as we reject <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> Him as our Head, our Husband, and our King. It is not a matter of good or bad, right or wrong; it is a matter of whether we take God as our King or reject Him. Even in small matters such as shopping, we often take a replacement rather than God Himself. This is why the Nazarite must always keep his hair long, covering his head with God Himself as his authority. </p>
<p data-content-id="v44slLo_2ynybXa3mygpLB-p5l49HsMiz8y4NCqQsc8cC7Hm89g4s2x_hmS-1EqJZ"> We need to learn to take God as our Head in our married life. When we argue with our spouse, the only way to settle the disagreement is to stop arguing and come to our King, our Head. Although I am the husband, I would not exercise my headship. Rather, I would go with my wife to my Husband, to our Husband, to see what our Husband, the very God, would say to us. Whatever He would say, we would take. This settles every problem and maintains a good and proper married life. </p>
<p data-content-id="WCLNsN5Rwvft4vPRf4gJuVD6_uEL7Hee5-8cnWKxPU8xAoRachdW77TlORGap5S8E"> We need to learn the same lesson concerning the service of God in the church life. Concerning any problem related to God’s economy, we should stop any quarreling, struggling, debating, and reasoning and go to our Head. We should stand on the position that we keep our hair long; we should keep our vow as a Nazarite. </p>
<p data-content-id="2d5RxvqBRWvweMgdRBUa1GwmcoqheHrkPtxdOqdnGSSG1ViN6SmjDFNP23n2eB2x6"> I encountered rebellious ones at least three times in the past forty-four years. Every time, I told the brothers, “Let us stop and go to the Lord and pray together. Let us gather the leading ones in the Lord’s recovery and come together to pray and fellowship.” But they would never agree. We all need to learn from this to accept the Lord as our Head, our Husband, and our King. This is the only way to participate in the fulfillment of God’s eternal economy. </p>

<p data-content-id="IMqW3mInpZkLBs7tv46oGA5lucj1obiPY6IkShwgMNHz35my44Vo76utIqJH57WDy"> The proper prophethood is always an assistant to the kingship. This should be a lesson to us. In the church life today, the elders hold the kingship. If you are not one of the elders and you see something in the church that is not so right, you should never criticize, oppose, or gossip. You need to be a prophet by praying to the Lord to receive a word from Him. If you do not receive a word from the Lord, you should not say anything. But if, in His mercy to His church, the Lord gives you a word, a prophecy, then you should go to the elders and prophesy to them. The elders, realizing that they hold the kingship, should learn that they are not all-capable, that they may be deficient. Therefore, they should listen to this brother’s prophecy. This is the proper situation in the church life. </p>

We all need to learn to do these two things. However, one may be a prophet, having a vision of the riches of Christ, but he may not know how to exercise God’s authority to take the proper way to deal with the lack of vision concerning Christ’s riches. Troubles in the church life are often caused by those who do not know how to exercise God’s authority. </p>

We may say that in the whole universe, there was only one who was above him, and that one was God. We may even say that, as God’s representative, Samuel was the acting God. God intended to move, to act, yet He needed a representative. Samuel thus became a prophet, a priest, and a judge. He was God’s oracle and God’s administration. As such, he was the acting God on earth. </p>

Rather, according to the Bible, God determined to raise up a man named David, through whom He intended to build up a kingdom. When God chose Abraham, it was not His intention to gain a single person or even a group of people who would seek after Him. God’s intention has been to have a kingdom. The consummation of the revelation in the Bible is a kingdom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44428" data-verses="Revelation 11:15">Revelation 11:15</span> says, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.” In the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem, there will be the eternal kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Jr790C2wlW11berxSFEhadZgcBao47mAOz9gwXnIGinfviOVUPrN8sVgnTjqbNHsB"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44429" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span> there is a word concerning both the kingdom and the church. When Peter received the revelation <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> of Christ as the Son of the living God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44430" data-verses="Matthew 16:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>), Jesus said to him, “You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44431" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">v. 18</span>), and then He went on to speak of the kingdom of the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44432" data-verses="Matthew 16:19">v. 19</span>). In these verses the phrase “the kingdom of the heavens” is used interchangeably with the word “church.” This shows that God does not want just a church but a kingdom-church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44433" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Romans 14:17</span> Paul also indicated that the practical church life is the kingdom: “The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.” </p>

As a man who was according to God’s heart, Samuel knew that within God’s heart there was a desire for a kingdom. God wanted the kingdom to be brought in not through Samuel but through David. </p>

If you had been Samuel, would you have given any ground for someone to match you or be above you? Samuel was pure and single. He was a Nazarite according to his mother’s vow and was altogether not self-seeking. He never sought to gain anything for himself. He had no heart for anything besides God and God’s elect. God loved Israel, and His heart was duplicated in Samuel. </p>
<p data-content-id="q4UpcavGePTL-kVcmkI_1k4WMIj3wsFXmXOcW0vLccYzKTtt3tVJpytK9vdW7NziE"> Because God’s heart was duplicated in Samuel, Samuel did not care for his own interest or gain. At the end, Samuel gained nothing but a tomb to be buried in. Due to the situation at the time, Samuel appointed his sons to be judges, but, contrary to Saul, he had no intention to build up a kingdom for them. His sons did not follow in his ways but went after unjust gain, took bribes, and perverted justice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44434" data-verses="1Samuel 8:1-3">1 Sam. 8:1-3</span>). When the people asked Samuel to appoint a king, he was not offended by anything related to his sons; on the contrary, he was offended by their desire to replace God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44435" data-verses="1Samuel 8:4-7">vv. 4-7</span>). Because he had no intention to build up a kingdom for his descendants, Samuel’s concern was not for his children but for God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> people. In such a situation it was easy for God to bring in the kingdom. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="yg0jPmYJ7QrN1rOclXhYeGR-iSGEJ5sdLpaPE-w2oYeZquG2SEtfDdKt-Iqp3ahgE">A PERSON WHO CARED ONLY FOR GOD<br/>AND FOR GOD’S INTEREST AND PROFIT</h2><p data-content-id="8Ai1vnnjfDSI2kARU_QU2Bor3dRdPCT-Y5w0bJES6dvRy9ur0pq18_jV8xhqMAGmh"> Samuel would never have cooperated with God if he had been a self-seeking person. As we will see in the next message, the day before Saul came to Samuel, God revealed to Samuel what He wanted him to do. God said to him, “At about this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him as the leader over My people Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44436" data-verses="1Samuel 9:16">9:16</span>). When Saul and his servant came to Samuel, Samuel did exactly as God had instructed. He did not care to gain anything for himself or for his children. </p>
<p data-content-id="09jsWLSoWMPfukP6C7e9LNeQ9H5TPdN9omqSlgtn3WdxZYS8pu1mdRLVIT9HzdAZd"> Now we can see why Samuel was so useful in the hand of God. He had no self-seeking nor any thought of self-gain. Instead, as a Nazarite, who allowed no razor to come upon his head and who did not drink any wine, he was absolutely for God. He was happy to go wherever God wanted him to go and to do whatever God wanted him to do. He was a man according to God, a man according to God’s heart. Therefore, he was a man whom God could use to carry out His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="7KV5zTW_Vu7O16ZMCrPfhVVUyMCPBbdNx21SpLbdWO_wt5LqUy05_PLTEacYLn4tD"> We should not think that Samuel did not have any kind of human concept. One day Jehovah said to him, “Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have selected for Myself a king among his sons” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44437" data-verses="1Samuel 16:1">16:1b</span>). When Samuel heard this, he said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44438" data-verses="1Samuel 16:2">v. 2a</span>). This indicates that Samuel was very human and had human concepts. Nevertheless, he was not a self-seeking person. All of his seeking was for God and for God’s elect. He cared for God and for His interest and profit, and He prayed for God’s people. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_xzm0jWZWlHscFKEIW2CvolLHW027l5yItNvAFvwjvSgyQfdFYjm1Q2FBJcRopIqX">THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SAMUEL AND SAMSON</h2><p data-content-id="BvM_-Scvlh5o83NSXOF8cGpqR2l7GkUwh6n4o0-E1XvlisxXCnmYBweD-AE8fTqCL"> Some Bible students have pointed out that Samuel was a person of high character. The matter of character, however, is not the crucial point regarding Samuel. Many people have a high character, but they are just for themselves, their enterprise, and their kingdom. They are not for God’s kingdom. <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> Samuel was not only high in character; he was high in the Nazarite vow. </p>
<p data-content-id="x81aRroco2KbAeOicF7UkJ3xcJE95dmNUj1kNxfbUd9LzwC3ZBWThhynW5sLDmfuz"> It is worthwhile to compare Samuel with another Nazarite—Samson. Samson also was a Nazarite by his mother’s vow, but he was very different from Samuel. When the Bible speaks of Samson and the other judges, it often says that the Spirit of God rushed upon them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44439" data-verses="Judges 14:6">Judg. 14:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44440" data-verses="Judges 14:19">19</span>). But there is no such word about Samuel. A Nazarite does not need rushing power; rather, a Nazarite needs a heart that is a reflection of God’s heart. Unlike Samson, Samuel did not gain a mighty victory by slaughtering a great number of others. On the contrary, Samuel was a Nazarite for God’s interest. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZqMjMYs4GUm2DWmzRlPzGiDmxn1pEQLi3bumwFQD_-oilAqhKPeQ_hGBK4mVheFk"> Although it was not easy for Samuel to stand for God in his particular environment, he cared for God’s interest and he turned the age. According to the Old Testament, Samuel is ranked with Moses in being for God and for God’s interest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44441" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:1">Jer. 15:1</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d8cYMfPwVEOUSxuQeIsNTYHVM11ebomX0ESyEscxO7W0skwBfSQM2Mdnip5OhGGHn">GOD USING A NEGATIVE KING TO DISCIPLINE ISRAEL</h2><p data-content-id="QqvXxFmTgnGbhODqVAxClRqYxUY9FXTPYodiM-ULk2ZoO-fbJrWrMSqmTSAyZomhL"> The history in 1 Samuel was directed by God. God did not go directly to David because David was still young and because Israel, whom God loved to the uttermost, needed some training. They needed to be disciplined by God with a negative king so that they would realize that replacing God with a king was not a matter of blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="K_cgtAS9sdpAfEKAoaggi84YvOwKkJFiVZ3UdA_f0Rxy_aNDVz-Xw4s77PwOh-10e"> God is a God of patience. Even though Eli was not so positive, God allowed him to be the judge for forty years. It is difficult to determine the length of Samuel’s judgeship, which must have lasted at least thirty years before Saul came in to reign over Israel negatively. Next, God tolerated the reign of Saul for forty years, and then He brought in David. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lvrBgN9QRVrZMnZ6kelG9W4QHZOTYAkx7smOTuzm8m94ceSIDzFoHrXnTpc_JrGEk">GOD’S INTENTION THAT CHRIST<br/>WOULD BE BORN IN THE LINEAGE OF DAVID</h2><p data-content-id="O2CcE15dHP5ikXGu_1sMIOCs2aj9GgeMuL-24G2-vV8NxpvdpvUnniKG5UJSUOwur"> Without Samuel it would have been very hard for God to carry out His economy. God had the intention that Christ would be born in the lineage of David, and only Samuel could bring in David. Without a David there would not have been the lineage of Christ’s genealogy. In order for God to reach the <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> time of incarnation, there had to be some preparation, and Samuel was a part of that preparation. God raised up Samuel and prepared him for God’s use to do whatever was necessary to gain, through David, the proper lineage of the genealogy of Christ. </p>

That he was not genuinely humble is seen in his being unwilling to give up the throne.

<p data-content-id="ozdq48uBsaLHr_n26fewT_VIrJZpX2FgJ7zZwAFfmMDKBSLV8qjZwZqbrxgTGUFuG"> As we read the history recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel, we need to realize that, no matter what was happening, God was behind the scene directing everything. We see this in a particular way in the history concerning Saul. </p>
<p data-content-id="3NDAFlHwhdy_9dmD-OFuZYGiVyE5FvKtszLgmI36vR5y1jJ5uS9IDcOlTaQ3xQ8Jd"> Saul, who was very tall and handsome, matched Israel’s human concept of a king, and they immediately recognized him as the king. But God sees through all things from beginning to end and knew what was within Saul’s heart. In the sight of God, Saul was useful at a certain juncture for carrying out God’s temporary purpose. He was needed by God to discipline and train Israel. Israel needed an education under a king who was apparently good but who actually was very selfish. On the one hand, Saul was qualified and capable and had the capacity, humanly speaking, to rule Israel. On the other hand, he was evil in the sight of God and also a pretender who could put on many different masks. At the time of his inauguration, Saul put on a mask of humility, but near the end of his life, he was exposed as actually being an evil person before God. </p>
<p data-content-id="GNGENG7u8BgPb4quiP-9_1Y3nwyl-dSCrFOnqfc3ydQ0w1GEwcwOLHFb5QsK7QB38"> After Saul’s forty years of reigning, Israel surely learned not to follow the nations in a human way. As a peculiar people, a particular possession belonging to God, their way should be according to God’s heart. This is the kind of person Samuel was. He was absolutely according to the heart of God, <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> not according to the customs of the nations. Although Israel had been delivered from tyranny in Egypt and had been brought into the promised land to be a particular treasure in the sight of God, they were not willing to be such a treasure but instead followed the customs of the nations. Therefore, God used Saul to discipline them. </p>
<p data-content-id="7KV5zTW_Vu7O16ZMCrPfhVVUyMCPBbdNx21qpLb9WO_wt5LqUy05_PLTEacYLn4tD"> Because Samuel, a Nazarite, was fully in submission to God as the Head, he was willing to do whatever God wanted him to do, without expressing his opinion. For this reason, when God told Samuel to anoint Saul to be the king over Israel, Samuel was obedient. </p>
<p data-content-id="_xzm0jWZWlHscFKEIW2CvolLHW027l5yItNXAFvQjvSgyQfdFYjm1Q2FBJcRopIqX"> With this in mind, let us now go on to consider the history concerning Saul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44482" data-verses="1Samuel 11:1">chapters eleven</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44483" data-verses="1Samuel 12:1">twelve</span>. </p>

<p data-content-id="rZqMjMYs4GUm2DWmzRlPzGiDmxn1pEQLi3bWmw1ID_-oilAqhKPeQ_hGBK4mVheFk"> After Saul was anointed king, the Ammonites came to threaten and reproach the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44484" data-verses="1Samuel 11:1-5">11:1-5</span>). Nahash the Ammonite encamped against Jabesh-gilead, and the men of Jabesh told him that if he made a treaty with them, they would serve him. Nahash replied that he would make a treaty on the condition that all their right eyes would be gouged out. He would thus make it a reproach upon all Israel. The elders of Jabesh asked for seven days’ respite to see if there was one who could save them, and they sent messengers to Gibeah of Saul. This created an opportunity for Saul to make a show. He was not for the kingdom of God but for his monarchy. </p>

God sent the Spirit to rush upon Saul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44486" data-verses="1Samuel 11:6">v. 6</span>), and he was empowered by God. Then he gathered the people, divided them into three groups, and slaughtered the Ammonites (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44487" data-verses="1Samuel 11:7-11">vv. 7-11</span>). </p>

Bring the men that we may put them to death” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44488" data-verses="1Samuel 11:12">v. 12</span>).

All the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before Jehovah and sacrificed peace offerings before Jehovah. There at Gilgal Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44492" data-verses="1Samuel 11:15">v. 15</span>). Although Saul had been victorious over the Ammonites and appeared to be such an attractive, humble person, according to Samuel the nation of Israel was still not the kingdom of God on earth. </p>

Of His Integrity</h2><p data-content-id="EWXpwEJc1QH9LIugyCBIbt_R_R1UxFcxvpjVOJdPN5lz-m5QHO_Mkoa3O4gh9MJIC"> First, Samuel reminded Israel of his integrity—that he was pure and just in dealing with the people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44494" data-verses="1Samuel 12:1-5">vv. 1-5</span>). He reminded them that he had not taken anything from them, defrauded them, oppressed them, or taken any bribe from them. He said, “Jehovah is Witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> in my hand” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44495" data-verses="1Samuel 12:5">v. 5a</span>).

Instead, Samuel reminded the people of his integrity and then went on to speak to them of Jehovah’s righteous acts for Israel. He reminded them that it was Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought their fathers up out of the land of Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44496" data-verses="1Samuel 12:6">v. 6</span>). Then he reminded them that Jehovah delivered them from the hand of their enemies all around (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44497" data-verses="1Samuel 12:11">v. 11</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="graZLPxGDPuDuvIWgEb6FawjvUy7qqPoMcSUloE-nFq7h8TAnbQbhI0LUnxZDLYDW">3.

Jehovah was their King, yet they wanted another king (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44499" data-verses="1Samuel 12:12">v. 12</span>). Here Samuel was rebuking Israel for leaving her Husband. Because they wanted a king as a replacement for God, they would not have the proper enjoyment of the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="5UmS-dXn2vc7BbV-xn9e2alx6qek-lDmhZtRGGZSeZPLzAE7RS94Fz-7w9rUCNhsh"> I believe that, to some extent at least, Samuel’s intent here was to provoke the children of Israel. After Saul’s conquest of the Ammonites, the people were happy, but they had been deceived by Saul, and Samuel was not happy about this situation. Samuel seemed to be saying to Israel, “You should have remained under the kingship of God, taking Him as your Husband and your Head. Then you would have enjoyed a good life, for He would have had His kingdom among you. But you have done wrong in taking a man as your head instead of God. You have actually divorced God and married Saul. You regard him as a handsome man, a man of choice, a man who is kind and humble. But this is only his outward appearance. Within him there is something dark. He will cause you to suffer and will take away many things from you.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> </p>

Samuel told them to stand and see the great thing that Jehovah would do before their eyes.

As we will see, Samuel’s intention, which was according to God’s heart, was to build the kingdom of God on earth. Saul’s intention was altogether in another realm.

In this war Saul’s intention to act on his own for the building up of his monarchy was exposed. Saul’s disobedience, which was observed by Samuel, meant that he had given up God.

<p data-content-id="yg0jPmYJ7QrN1rOclXhYeGR-iSGEJ5sdLpKTE-Q2oYeZquG2SEtfDdKt-Iqp3ahgE"> In studying the history in the Bible, we need to learn all the different lessons. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44519" data-verses="1Samuel 13:1">First Samuel 13—14</span> contains a great lesson. It may seem that Saul’s disobedience in making an offering was a small disobedience. But Samuel realized that Saul would take the opportunity to usurp God’s appointment to build up his own monarchy within the building up of God’s kingdom. God intended to build up His kingdom on earth, not to build up a monarchy for Saul. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Ai1vnnjfDSI2kARU_QU2Bor3dRdPCT-Y5gobJkS6dvRy9ur0pq18_jV8xhqMAGmh"> Samuel taught the people the custom of the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44520" data-verses="1Samuel 10:25">1 Sam. 10:25</span>). Moses gave the law to the children of Israel, but before Samuel came they did not have a set of by-laws, a constitution. Samuel told the people the by-laws, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> constitution, the practice, the customs, the manners, the ordinances, and the rules of how to practice the kingdom of God on earth. Saul should have practiced the kingdom life according to this constitution. Samuel, the composer of the constitution, watched Saul, and he saw a tendency with him to build up a human monarchy by usurping the practice of the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="09jsWLSoWMPfukP6C7e9LNeQ9H5TPdN9om6OlgNn3WdxZYS8pu1mdRLVIT9HzdAZd"> The Lord’s recovery today is the kingdom of God. Some have attempted to build up their work and to establish a monarchy for themselves within the recovery. Brother Nee strongly stressed this same matter when he said that some so-called co-workers were building up for themselves something separate from the recovery while they remained in the recovery. These co-workers built up their own little empires. Recently, a monarchy was built up in a certain area of this country, but the saints there refused to go along with such a monarchy. They wrote to me saying that the churches in that area were not raised up by the one who wanted to build up a monarchy, but were established and nourished by the essence of the Lord’s recovery. These saints said that they wanted the recovery, the kingdom of God today. </p>
<p data-content-id="7KV5zTW_Vu7O16ZMCrPfhVVUyMCPBbdNx2lOpL7dWO_wt5LqUy05_PLTEacYLn4tD"> The recovery around the globe is uniquely one. The intrinsic essence of the kingdom of God is the Body of Christ, the church of God. Through the past several decades, some brothers have worked and labored very well, and we appreciate what they have done. Yet certain of the workers carried out a work in the recovery by usurping the recovery. Today in some places there is still a tendency, under the name of the recovery, to build up something within the ministry of the recovery, usurping the advantages of the recovery and using the materials of the ministry of the recovery. There are signs that the work in these places is not a pure work—a work purely for the building up of the Body of Christ, the kingdom of God. Rather, it is a work built up for the interest of certain ones. </p>
<p data-content-id="_xzm0jWZWlHscFKEIW2CvolLHW027l5yItdzAFPwjvSgyQfdFYjm1Q2FBJcRopIqX"> Six years ago a teaching came out which said that the local churches are autonomous. Some said that after the apostles establish a church and appoint elders, they should keep their hands off the church, leaving the church as an <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> autonomy. Such a teaching of autonomy was actually the building up of a monarchy. </p>
<p data-content-id="BvM_-Scvlh5o83NSXOF8cGpqR2l7GkUwh63ko1eE1XvlisxXCnmYBweD-AE8fTqCL"> We practice the local churches, and each of the local churches is autonomous in business affairs. But this does not mean that the local churches are divided. In a sense they are local churches, but all the local churches on this globe are just one church. Every local church has its own freedom and jurisdiction to make decisions concerning, for example, the times of the meetings. However, this does not mean that the local churches are different. Paul taught all the churches in the same way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44521" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:17">1 Cor. 4:17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="x81aRroco2KbAeOicF7UkJ3xcJE95dmNUjl4Nw_bUd9LzwC3ZBWThhynW5sLDmfuz"> All the churches are the same in life, in nature, in testimony, in serving, and in expressing Christ. We may be different in nationalities and languages, but our singing and praising are the same. We are one Body, testifying the same Christ. We preach, announce, admonish, and teach concerning Christ as revealed in the Bible. We do not have different schools, different teachings, or different testimonies. Christianity has been divided because of different practices, for example the practice of baptism. But the “dictionary” in the Lord’s recovery has only one word—Christ. We are not for various kinds of teachings. We are for Christ, who is for the kingdom of God. We are for the kingdom of God, which is the Body of Christ, the unique church of God. </p>

The divine revelation in the Bible shows us that God did not create the flesh. God created a man. However, man became fallen and eventually became flesh. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44560" data-verses="Genesis 6:3">Genesis 6:3</span> indicates that because man had become flesh, God could not do anything with him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44561" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Romans 3:20a</span> says, “Out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him.” Here “no flesh” means no fleshly man.

Without the flesh, Satan would have no way to fight <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> against God. In the church life all the troubles come from the flesh.

When we are in our spirit, we may regard the church, the elders, and the recovery as wonderful. However, when we are in the flesh, we may be critical of certain elders, or our flesh may be so bothered that we may even consider leaving the recovery. Whenever we realize that we are in the flesh, the enemy of God and the source of troubles in the church life, we need to pray and ask the Lord to forgive us. </p>

It was told Samuel that Saul had gone to Carmel and had set up a <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> monument for himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44577" data-verses="1Samuel 15:12">v. 12</span>). Saul built this monument not for the kingdom of God but for the remembrance of himself because of the victory that made both him and his monarchy rich. This was a strong indication that Saul’s intention was to build up his monarchy. </p>

When Saul declared that he had fulfilled the word of Jehovah, Samuel asked, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears and the lowing of oxen that I hear?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44579" data-verses="1Samuel 15:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>). Saul explained that they had been brought from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to Jehovah and destroyed the rest. Samuel then told Saul to stop and he would tell him what Jehovah had spoken to him the night before. Then he went on to say, “Though you are small in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah has anointed you as king over Israel. And Jehovah sent you on a journey and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed. Why then did you not obey the voice of Jehovah, but flew upon the spoil and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44580" data-verses="1Samuel 15:17-19">vv. 17-19</span>). Saul responded by claiming that he did obey the voice of Jehovah, but that the people took sheep and oxen of the spoil to sacrifice to Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44581" data-verses="1Samuel 15:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="M-qWlbSuZIKU1I0RRNNoBiBDCim2TspAwwSiCNhhdBeNlwcrh51zzZ_zk3NjVoOGQ"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44582" data-verses="1Samuel 15:22-23">verses 22 and 23</span> Samuel continued by speaking a very strong word to Saul: “Does Jehovah delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices / As much as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? / Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, / And to heed, than the fat of rams. / For rebellion is like the sin of divination, / And insubordination is like idolatry and teraphim.” Here Samuel seemed to be saying, “Saul, you say that you spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to Jehovah, my God. But God prefers that you obey His word. He told you to utterly destroy the Amalekites and all that they have. Instead of obeying this word, you kept some of the sheep and <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> oxen for yourself. This morning you raised up a monument for yourself. You did not raise up anything for God. Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed, to take care of, God’s speaking is better than the fat of rams. Saul, you have rebelled against God, and rebellion is like the sin of divination, like the sin of witchcraft. What you did was just as evil as contacting an evil spirit for the purpose of carrying out the intention of that spirit, not God’s intention. You did not subordinate yourself to God as your Head but acted presumptuously, according to your ways and by your will. Now your kingship is over. Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah, He has rejected you from being king.” Saul was thus exposed as being a rebel against God and an enemy of God. </p>

God had abandoned Saul, rejecting him from being king over Israel. Then in the first verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44597" data-verses="1Samuel 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, God sent Samuel to contact a young boy, who was perhaps only about fifteen years old. This shows that while Saul was abusing the God-given kingship, God knew the whole situation and was doing something marvelous to prepare the right person. God went secretly to David, the great grandson of Boaz and Ruth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44598" data-verses="Ruth 4:21-22">Ruth 4:21-22</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="-szw3pjUEYSi-TwKtRPDlpenrcg3VQMlukvlXijIqM6v2WcL_gTJjAh-8WpBDV2hT"> God gave Saul the kingship for the purpose of building up His own kingdom. Saul should have been God’s acting king, reigning over the people for God. Yet he behaved as a king absolutely for himself. He usurped and even abused the gifts given to him by God—the kingdom, the people, and the kingship—in order to build up his own monarchy. But while Saul was openly abusing, God was secretly preparing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> Eventually, God’s preparation was completed in David, the youngest of Jesse’s sons. David was the eighth son, and in the Bible the number eight signifies resurrection. In the scriptural sense, David was one in resurrection; hence, he was the one whom God could use. </p>
<p data-content-id="pRV5l2-3TTRQt9kqAoiM-Y6TBWAQ_GaS8cxVq7Z-CU40tyGXV_U0EPGRgohXWruqj"> David was prepared by God to be a man according to the heart of God. Otherwise he could not have been such a man. In a very real sense, he was created by God to be such a man. However, he still needed to pass through the process of being chosen, trained, anointed, tested, and approved. To be chosen is wonderful, but to be trained by God is to go through suffering. To be anointed also is very good, but after being anointed we must be tested. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44599" data-verses="2Samuel 5:4">Second Samuel 5:4</span> tells us that David was thirty years old when he began to reign. After David, a boy of about fifteen, was anointed by Samuel, he was tested for about fifteen years. In particular, he was bothered and troubled by Saul. Eventually, David passed the test and was approved by God. </p>

<p data-content-id="EWXpwEJc1QH9LIugyCBIbt_R_R1UxFcxvpz9OJtXN5lz-m5QHO_Mkoa3O4gh9MJIC"> As we read the Bible, we should not interpret it in a loose way. We surely need guidance from the Lord, and we also need to know the controlling principles. Otherwise, we may be careless in our interpretation. In studying the books of history in the Bible, we need to be poor in spirit and we need a seeking spirit. We need to pray, “Lord, there is something here that I do not know, but You know. Lord, reveal to me the intrinsic significance of this portion of the Word.” This should be our prayer as we continue to consider the history concerning David as one prepared by God to be a man according to the heart of God. </p>

JONATHAN’S LOVE FOR DAVID</h2><p data-content-id="SgWLM0HBGvAAygu4IfnY_gPuraUm710M3rKdlLBgtC3Ften25qc7EACCLoR66Q6t2"> David was persecuted and tried by Saul. Saul was nearly the unique source of all David’s trials. In the trials that God gave to him in His sovereignty, God prepared a provision for David. God prepared Jonathan, Saul’s son, who loved David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44641" data-verses="1Samuel 18:1-5">18:1-5</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> </p>

While the father was persecuting David and plotting to kill him, his son was loving David to the uttermost. It seems that there was discord in the family over David, with the father hating him and the son loving him. If God had not provided Jonathan in such a way, it is doubtful that David could have endured the trials under Saul. David could pass through these trials mainly because of the help that Jonathan rendered to him. From this we see that when we are under God’s trial, God knows that we need some provision. On the one hand, we have the trials; on the other hand, we have God’s provision to support us and sustain us in the trials. </p>

The secret of David’s success was his wisdom. Even as a youth, he behaved in a very wise way. For example, when his oldest brother condemned him for coming to the camp of the Israelites, he asked his brother, “Is there no cause?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44648" data-verses="1Samuel 17:29">17:29</span>). He realized that there was a cause from God and that God had prepared him and sent him. God had sovereignly put <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> him in the field to take care of sheep, and God used the attack of the lion and the bear to train, prepare, and equip him to kill Goliath. David was also very experienced in speaking and in confronting people. His youth had been full of experiences which were the basis for his assurance in relation to Goliath. It is not an insignificant thing for a teenager to kill a lion or a bear. As a youth David gained this experience. Therefore, he was not afraid of Goliath. </p>

David’s Return from Striking the Philistines</h2><p data-content-id="67dasedgohowRZZ1VRYMp4gKMmVwkGH1GaM8kTuBqLY8x9YtHe1yLONS3jH88y7bp"> Saul became envious of David after David’s return from striking the Philistines (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44651" data-verses="1Samuel 18:6">v. 6a</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="RW-1T0ORFGeCiLT-Iz1TafFivcSWBgjf4dntz7IrDUxwncZxua7ENRg1wL1jq8Kta">B. The Women’s Welcome and Praise</h2><p data-content-id="soofKjz9MBuX3nvwndy-__zPTLkQbhzogn7ABAmjnTNM_e_ir8Q5nU0BSBnD7GOkw"> As David returned from striking the Philistines, the women came out of all the towns of Israel to meet Saul and they said, “Saul has stricken down his thousands; / But David, his ten thousands” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44652" data-verses="1Samuel 18:7">v. 7</span>). When Saul heard this praise, he was displeased and said, “They ascribe ten thousands to David, but to me they ascribe only thousands. And what more can he have except the kingdom? So Saul eyed David from that day on” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44653" data-verses="1Samuel 18:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>). Saul was angry and was envious of David. </p>
<p data-content-id="wz_Tf5AacTANnmKa2WKosNmj5tdWkfSKFSYxlhYyJCr3UYMVf53leSgEeElHEzqpd"> There are many “Sauls” in the church life today. We may become envious when others are approved and we are not. For example, suppose you share in a meeting and hardly anyone says amen. Then someone else shares, and he receives many amens. You may say to yourself, “Why were so many amens <span class="pg" data-page-id="90" id="90">[90]</span> spoken to him and so few to me?” If you say this, you are today’s Saul. </p>
<p data-content-id="LLbJJ89S3KOyxNA70NQVap6zWv-xFMv2AMhUQqjwUokcBGwcLZat849aMMcrCKeXE"> Let us take as another illustration of the Sauls in the church life the matter of appointing elders. In appointing elders we must be fair and pure, and we must not be political. Suppose that in a particular church five brothers are taking the lead, but thus far no one has been officially appointed to be an elder. Eventually, only three of these brothers are appointed. The other two are very good brothers, but they do not have the capacity to be elders. These two may be stumbled and wonder why the other three were appointed to be elders and they were not. These two brothers might say, “The five of us have been laboring together to take care of the church, but we two have been set aside. Why were the others appointed to be elders and we were not?” These brothers need to receive grace in order to put their flesh on the cross. Otherwise, they may become cold to the church and withdraw, no longer continuing faithfully in the church life. </p>
<p data-content-id="mcSqnaE9mgCHQOhwj7Jq6ycs4awmmV7Bkg77JyoYrbyi59GjNyb05oCMHY5IjEnlE"> The hardships in the church life are related to the flesh. All the flesh in the church life needs to be diminished. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44654" data-verses="Galatians 5:17">Galatians 5:17</span> says, “The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.” In the whole universe there is only one war—the war between man and God. The man warring against God is the flesh. The flesh wars against God as the Spirit, and God who is the Spirit is warring against our flesh. Our flesh is the real enemy of God. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44655" data-verses="Galatians 5:1">Galatians 5</span> not only speaks of this war but also says, “They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44656" data-verses="Galatians 5:24">v. 24</span>). Christ has crucified the flesh, and now we must apply this to ourselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZtLh1kzlclk25dqS_ej05rXlSwOBmKMNLgBESnn3Keu6cu8s1RWgQ-18amj-W4aUx"> David was very different from Saul. David knew only to behave and to have his being according to God’s heart.

When Saul attempted to kill him, David did nothing to avenge himself. He only fled (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44659" data-verses="1Samuel 18:11">v. 11b</span>). Saul was afraid of David, for Jehovah was with David and had departed from Saul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44660" data-verses="1Samuel 18:12">v. 12</span>). If Saul had learned to know the flesh, he would have worshipped the Lord for choosing David. He would have realized that the Lord was sovereign and that He, not Saul, should be the originator. </p>

This lesson is that in the church life there should not be anything of the flesh; there should be no anger, no devices, no conspiracies, and no plots. The church is the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44687" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>), and in the church there must be the divine authority with the proper order. No one should overthrow this order. As we will see, David feared God and did not dare to overthrow the order arranged by God. It would be a shame for us to say that we are in the Lord’s recovery, yet we do not know that there is a God-ordained order. Rebellion and fighting annul the church <span class="pg" data-page-id="96" id="96">[96]</span> life. With us there should be no rebellion, no anger, and no fighting.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44688" data-verses="Ephesians 4:26">Ephesians 4:26</span> Paul said, “Do not let the sun go down on your indignation.” This means that when the sun sets our anger should also set.

On the other hand, God prepared a Saul to perfect David by testing him and putting him on trial. Saul was produced and prepared through God’s sovereignty. Without Saul, David would have been greatly lacking in perfecting. David’s father and brothers did not care very much for him. David received only a limited perfecting through his experience with the lion and the bear. The greatest part of David’s perfecting took place through Saul.

He is our Jonathan and our Michal. He is much greater than Jonathan and Michal, and He is nearer to us. We have a Christ who is in us. While we are bearing the cross, actually we are not the ones who are doing this. The Christ who is within us is the One who bears the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="T8Yneii7JXABIOGJQmw3OBHaPi5TV8yEYJkfNO20KNoN5otHiOSNZYnzxySXqTzgb"> In the New Testament there are two crucial “ins.” The New Testament revelation emphasizes the fact that, on the one hand, Christ is in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44728" data-verses="Romans 8:10">Rom. 8:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44729" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:5">2 Cor. 13:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44730" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44731" data-verses="Galatians 4:19">4:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44732" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Col. 1:27</span>) and that, on the other hand, we are in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44733" data-verses="John 14:20">John 14:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44734" data-verses="John 15:4">15:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44735" data-verses="Romans 6:3">Rom. 6:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44736" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44737" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:17">2 Cor. 5:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44738" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:2">12:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44739" data-verses="Galatians 3:27-28">Gal. 3:27-28</span>). How wonderful it is that we are in Christ and that Christ is in us! The entering of Noah and his family into the ark, a type of Christ, illustrates that our Christ today is enterable. However, this illustration is limited, because <span class="pg" data-page-id="103" id="103">[103]</span> although Noah could enter into the ark, the ark could not enter into Noah. We therefore must go on to see that Christ is not only the enterable One—He is also the entering One, the One who has come into us to live in us and to bear the cross within us. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nqpweAlRJS8AoyA_4zh7qA7BNEEE9dZNgY96N9SsuiykXXNLFL4M_rWNASOdOzf_2">God’s Provision</h2><p data-content-id="67dasedgohowRZZ1VRYMp4gKMmVwkGH1GaMkkTuhqLY8x9YtHe1yLONS3jH88y7bp"> As David was taking the lessons of the cross, he enjoyed God’s provision. Jonathan was a type of Christ as God’s provision, and Michal was a type of God’s provision. We have seen that when David was persecuted by Saul, he did not react in a negative way, and he did not complain, condemn, criticize, or oppose. The only thing he did was flee. As God’s provision to David, both Jonathan and Michal helped David to flee. Without them, David would not have had a way to escape from Saul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44740" data-verses="1Samuel 20:1-42">1 Sam. 20:1-42</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44741" data-verses="1Samuel 19:11-18">19:11-18</span>). Eventually, David “graduated” from his trials under Saul. If God had graded David, He surely would have given him the highest mark. </p>

Because of this David eventually was not a loser but a gainer, not a sufferer but an enjoyer. Whereas David became the winner, Saul was the loser and also the sufferer. </p>
<p data-content-id="wz_Tf5AacTANnmKa2WKosNmj5tdWkfSKFSYplhI6JCr3UYMVf53leSgEeElHEzqpd"> The situation should be the same with us today. We need to learn two vital lessons—the lesson of God’s sovereignty and the lesson of taking the cross with the power of resurrection. If we would be quiet, remaining in a situation under the cross, we may apparently be the losers and the sufferers, but actually we are the gainers and the enjoyers. The more we learn the lessons of God’s sovereignty and of taking the cross, the more we will be the gainers and the enjoyers. </p>

In particular, we need to have the view of one who sees God’s sovereignty and who has received the <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> grace to learn to suffer under the cross while enjoying all the provisions afforded by the processed, consummated Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZtLh1kzlclk25dqS_ej05rXlSwOBmKMNLgBcSn3_Keu6cu8s1RWgQ-18amj-W4aUx"> In the New Testament we have the pure revelation, but we do not have very many illustrations. However, the books of history in the Old Testament, especially 1 and 2 Samuel, contain many stories that actually are illustrations of the New Testament revelation. There are a number of lessons that we cannot learn adequately without these illustrations. As we read the stories in these books, we need to pray with Paul that “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,” would give us “a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44742" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17">Eph. 1:17</span>). If we have such a spirit, then in the record concerning David’s trials under Saul we will see the Triune God, the cross of Christ, and the power of His resurrection. </p>

David sent ten young men to Nabal, instructing them to say to him, “Live long; and peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44749" data-verses="1Samuel 25:6">v. 6</span>). The young men were also to say, “Give whatever you may have on hand to your servants and to your son David” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44750" data-verses="1Samuel 25:8">v. 8</span>). Here David was very humble, considering himself a servant and a son to Nabal. <span class="pg" data-page-id="107" id="107">[107]</span> </p>

Nabal said to them, “Who is David, or who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants today who break away from their masters. Shall I then take my food and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men who come from I do not know where?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44751" data-verses="1Samuel 25:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>). When David’s servants told him what Nabal said, David charged each of his men to gird on his sword (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44752" data-verses="1Samuel 25:12-13">vv. 12-13</span>). Then David said, “It was certainly in vain that I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that he has; for he has repaid me evil for good. May God do so to David’s enemies, and even more, if I leave so much as a male child of all that he has until morning” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44753" data-verses="1Samuel 25:21-22">vv. 21-22</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="GNGENG7u8BgPb4quiP-9_1Y3nwyl-dSCrFebqdoDydQ0w1GEwcwOLHFb5QsK7QB38"> David’s word here indicates that he was offended by Nabal. In this matter David did not pass the test. He bore the cross under Saul, but in this small cross he failed. If David had taken the cross in this situation, he might have praised the Lord for Nabal’s refusal to provide food. Then God might have come in to inspire Nabal to repent and come to David with an abundance of food. However, with Nabal David did not take the cross. </p>

She “hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread and two skins of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched grain and one hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and she put them on <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> her donkeys” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44756" data-verses="1Samuel 25:18">v. 18</span>). When she saw David, she fell at his feet and said, “Upon me alone, my lord, be this iniquity; and let your maidservant speak in your hearing, and hear the words of your maidservant. May my lord not take this worthless man Nabal to heart” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44757" data-verses="1Samuel 25:24-25">vv. 24-25a</span>). Abigail went on to ask David to please forgive the transgression, and then she concluded, saying, “When Jehovah has done to my lord according to all the good He has spoken concerning you and has appointed you ruler over Israel, this will not be a qualm of conscience to you or a stumbling block in heart to my lord, that you shed blood without cause or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Jehovah has dealt well with my lord, may you remember your maidservant” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44758" data-verses="1Samuel 25:30-31">vv. 30-31</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="DfbFTJZtA2pONOAHay_Pqwt3UUpArXNcdgDD3AjOjZb_vgfxuXqpLanr1eBBzVVPQ"> David responded to Abigail’s appeal by blessing Jehovah, who sent her to meet him, and also by blessing her, who kept him from entering into bloodshed and from avenging himself by his own hand. David then took from her hand what she had brought and said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have listened to your voice and have accepted your person” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44759" data-verses="1Samuel 25:35">v. 35</span>).

Her beauty and wisdom caught David, and after Nabal’s death he took her as his wife. Here we see the weak point in David’s life. He was quite prevailing and overcoming in nearly everything, but he was weak in the matter of sex. David overcame the lion and the bear, but he did not overcome his sexual lust. Eventually, David’s weakness and indulgence contaminated the kingship of God’s holiness. The root of his later failure in murdering Uriah and taking Bath-sheba was manifested here. <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="T8Yneii7JXABIOGJQmw3OBHaPi5TV8yEYJkXNO2UKNoN5otHiOSNZYnzxySXqTzgb"> From the tragic end of Saul we can learn many things concerning God’s economy. The tragedy suffered by Saul was altogether due to his not being properly related to God’s economy. God is carrying out His economy on earth, and He brought Saul into His economy. Instead of participating in God’s economy and cooperating with it, Saul was selfish. God wanted to build up His kingdom among His chosen people, but Saul usurped God’s kingdom to build up his own monarchy. With David the situation was entirely different. When David was anointed by Samuel, he had a clear understanding that he had been assigned by God to be the king, but he did not have any thought about kingship. After Saul was appointed to be the king, he was immediately filled with thoughts of the kingship, including how his son would succeed him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44785" data-verses="1Samuel 20:31">20:31</span>). In this Saul was selfish and wrong to the uttermost. He sought to build his selfish monarchy rather than the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="nqpweAlRJS8AoyA_4zh7qA7BNEEE9dZNgY9yN9SMuiykXXNLFL4M_rWNASOdOzf_2"> Eventually, God gave Saul up and cut him off, tearing the kingdom away from him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44786" data-verses="1Samuel 15:28">15:28</span> Samuel said to Saul, <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> “Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today and has given it to an associate of yours, who is better than you.” Because Saul was given up by God, he was left alone, like an orphan, having no provision of help when trouble came. Even though David was the most skillful and experienced fighter, he was of no use to Saul because of Saul’s selfishness and envy. Actually, because Saul wanted to do away with him, David was forced to go to a country that was Israel’s biggest enemy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44787" data-verses="1Samuel 27:1-2">27:1-2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="67dasedgohowRZZ1VRYMp4gKMmVwkGH1GaMskTepqLY8x9YtHe1yLONS3jH88y7bp"> David went to the Philistines, in particular to King Achish. When the Philistines gathered their camps to fight against Israel, David, who had become the bodyguard to King Achish, was in a dilemma of being one with the Philistines to fight against Israel. This dilemma was the result of Saul’s selfishness. The people of Israel suffered defeat and were slaughtered also because of Saul’s selfishness. But God in His sovereignty came in to deal with Saul and to rescue David from his dilemma. </p>
<p data-content-id="RW-1T0ORFGeCiLT-Iz1TafFivcSWBgjf4dn9z74DDUxwncZxua7ENRg1wL1jq8Kta"> We need to muse upon every aspect of this story, for it contains some lessons that we need to learn. First, from this story, this illustration, we should learn the lesson of crucifying our flesh. Next, we should learn to condemn our selfishness—our self-interest and self-seeking. Furthermore, Saul was full of self, and from his tragic end we must learn to deny our self. As the Lord Jesus said, if we would follow Him, we must deny the self and take up the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44788" data-verses="Matthew 16:24">Matt. 16:24</span>). </p>

Then David and four hundred of his men pursued the Amalekites, with the assistance of a young man of Egypt who was a servant of an Amalekite. The provision of the help from this Egyptian indicates that the details of David’s environment were under God’s sovereignty. Eventually, David conquered the Amalekites and captured their captives, delivering all that the Amalekites had taken. “Nothing was missed by them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil nor anything that they had taken; David brought everything back.

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="d8cYMfPwVEOUSxuQeIsNTYHVM11ebomX0ECOEss5O7W0skwBfSQM2Mdnip5OhGGHn">XXIII. THE ENDING OF SAUL</h2><p data-content-id="QqvXxFmTgnGbhODqVAxClRqYxUY9FXTPYoNeM-kTk2ZoO-fbJrWrMSqmTSAyZomhL"> The first point concerning Saul’s ending was that he lost God’s presence (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44825" data-verses="1Samuel 16:14">1 Sam. 16:14</span>). Today we treasure and enjoy God’s presence. God’s presence is just the Spirit. The Spirit is the resurrection of Christ; the resurrection of Christ is Christ Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44826" data-verses="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>); and Christ is the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Spirit is the reality of God and of the resurrection of Christ. If we have the Spirit, we are in resurrection. If we have the resurrection, we have Christ. If we have Christ, we have the embodiment of God. It is a tragedy that many of today’s Christians miss the Spirit. They have the Spirit in their theology, but they do not treasure the Spirit as the consummated God. </p>
<p data-content-id="K_cgtAS9sdpAfEKAoaggi84YvOwKkJFiVZnodAPH0Rxy_aNDVz-Xw4s77PwOh-10e"> At this point I would like to say a word about the steps of God’s process. God in eternity past was merely God, divine <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> and triune—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. According to His desire God made an economy, and according to His economy He created the heavens and the earth with man as the center. Yet He still remained purely divine. However, God intended to join Himself to man in order to make Himself one with man. Thus He became a man through incarnation, putting on man’s blood and flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44827" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). In eternity past He was merely divine, but by being incarnated He became a God-man named Jesus Christ. Through the process of incarnation He entered into humanity, making Himself, the divine One, one with humanity. In this way He became the God-man, the One who is both divine and human, the complete God and the perfect man. </p>
<p data-content-id="lvrBgN9QRVrZMnZ6kelG9W4QHZOTYAkx7s2yTuDu8m94ceSIDzFoHrXnTpc_JrGEk"> As the almighty, eternal, and complete God, He lived in humanity for thirty-three and a half years. Then, as the eternal One who is the eternal life, He entered into death and toured Hades for three days. Rising from Hades, He walked out of death and entered into resurrection. Through incarnation He brought God into man, and in resurrection He brought man into God. Through incarnation He brought divinity into humanity, and in resurrection He brought humanity into divinity. After His resurrection He entered into heaven, and today He is in the heavens as a man sitting on the throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44828" data-verses="Acts 7:56">Acts 7:56</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44829" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Heb. 1:3b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44830" data-verses="Ephesians 1:20">Eph. 1:20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="O2CcE15dHP5ikXGu_1sMIOCs2aj9GgeMuLuK4GG2vV8NxpvdpvUnniKG5UJSUOwur"> As such a One, He is now the consummated God, having passed through the steps of incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension. In ascension as the consummated Triune God He remains the complete God mingled with the perfect man—the God-man. This realization is the conclusion of our study of the Bible over the last seven decades. </p>
<p data-content-id="4kpXpjtpWfZIzPoCD7f74KSGR90-YkX-6QNvZ7D75aTKrEPC2Dp38kWIga1yKPtaD"> Today as the consummated God He is the Spirit, our life, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Master, our Lord, our Father, and our God. He is everything to us. He became a man that we as men may become God in life and nature (but not in the Godhead). He has made Himself one with us, and He has made us one with Him. He went through human living, and we traveled with Him. He went to the cross, and we were crucified with Him. He resurrected, and we resurrected with <span class="pg" data-page-id="123" id="123">[123]</span> Him. He is in the heavens, and we are there with Him. Now the consummated Triune God as the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44831" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>) indwells our spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44832" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">6:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44833" data-verses="Romans 8:11">Rom. 8:11</span>). Hence, the realization of God’s presence is altogether a matter of these two spirits. </p>

Saul’s intention was to preserve the kingdom for Jonathan. However, Jonathan was not willing to take the kingdom but recognized that David should be on the throne. Jonathan should have told his father about this and then should have left his father to be with David. In typology, for Jonathan to follow David would have signified our following Christ today and our giving Him the preeminence. If Jonathan had gone with David, Saul might not have suffered such a tragic ending. Saul might have been helped by Jonathan not to build up a monarchy for himself but to build up the kingdom of God. </p>

To practice divination is to have contact with evil spirits, something that is utterly contrary to God’s principle. What Saul did in rebelling against God was like this sin of divination.

ESTABLISHED BY GOD AS KING<br/>WITH HIS KINGDOM EXALTED<br/>FOR THE SAKE OF GOD’S PEOPLE ISRAEL</h2><p data-content-id="BvM_-Scvlh5o83NSXOF8cGpqR2l7GkUwh6Hgo0-k1XvlisxXCnmYBweD-AE8fTqCL"> David was established by God as king with his kingdom exalted for the sake of God’s people Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44943" data-verses="2Samuel 5:6-25">vv. 6-25</span>). Here we see that David’s kingdom was established by God. Saul, on the contrary, had tried to exalt himself with his monarchy, but he did not succeed. With David, God did everything to establish and exalt him and his kingdom for the sake of God’s people. From this we need to learn that if we do anything for ourselves, God will not exalt us, but if we live our lives for God’s kingdom and God’s people, God will exalt us for His people’s sake. Therefore, we should not seek any kind of self-exaltation. If we do, we will suffer and be put down (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44944" data-verses="Matthew 23:12">Matt. 23:12</span>). Saul tried his best to exalt himself, but in just one day Saul and three of his sons were terminated. On the same day that God was putting down Saul, He was exalting David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44945" data-verses="1Samuel 30:1">1 Sam. 30—31</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="x81aRroco2KbAeOicF7UkJ3xcJE95dmNUjV8Nxf7Ud9LzwC3ZBWThhynW5sLDmfuz"> The history concerning David, particularly the record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44946" data-verses="1Samuel 18:1">1 Samuel 18:1 through 2 Samuel 5:25</span>, reveals that our God is sovereign. It may seem that He is silent and that He is hiding Himself, but He is everywhere and with everyone. I believe, for example, that God motivated all the lords of the Philistines to complain about David, making it necessary for Achish to send David away (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44947" data-verses="1Samuel 29:1-11">1 Sam. 29:1-11</span>). This rescued David from the dilemma of having to fight with the Philistines against Israel. From this we can see that God was doing everything behind the scenes, directing everyone to accomplish His purpose for the carrying out of His economy. Everything, everyone, and every situation were in the hand of the God in whom David trusted. David did nothing, but God did everything behind the scenes. As a result, Saul was put <span class="pg" data-page-id="142" id="142">[142]</span> down, and David was exalted. After the death of Saul, “there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David became continually stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44948" data-verses="2Samuel 3:1">2 Sam. 3:1</span>). Throughout the books of 1 and 2 Samuel we can see that God was moving and acting all the time in every way for Himself, His kingdom, His people, and the accomplishing of His economy. Without anyone seeing or knowing, God takes care of everything according to His will to accomplish His economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44949" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11">Eph. 1:11</span>). </p>

In His Victory over the Jebusites</h2><p data-content-id="d8cYMfPwVEOUSxuQeIsNTYHVM11ebomX0EyqEsM5O7W0skwBfSQM2Mdnip5OhGGHn"> A number of matters in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44950" data-verses="2Samuel 5:6-25">2 Samuel 5:6-25</span> are evidence that God had established David and had exalted his kingdom. The first of these is recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44951" data-verses="2Samuel 5:6-8">verses 6 through 8</span>, where we see that David was established by God in his victory over the Jebusites. </p>

Furthermore, “David became greater and greater; and Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44953" data-verses="2Samuel 5:10">v. 10</span>). This indicates that David had God’s presence. In serving the Lord, we need to have the assurance that we have His presence. If we are really following the Lord for the fulfillment of His economy, we will certainly have His presence. If in any matter we do not have the inner sense that the Lord is with us, we must be careful and consider our way. Saul first lost the presence of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44954" data-verses="1Samuel 16:14">1 Sam. 16:14</span>). That should have helped him to reconsider his way, but he did not. In the Lord’s recovery, whenever we do anything, we must take care of the sense of the Lord’s presence. </p>

This was a further strong evidence that David’s being established as king over Israel was really of God. Such an assurance is very important and is necessary in our working for the Lord. We all need to learn the lesson of caring for these two things: the inward presence of God and the outward confirmation in our environment. </p>

All things had worked together in David’s favor. He had become the king not only of Judah but also of all the tribes of God’s people. He had obtained a stronghold—Zion—and a capital—Jerusalem. Furthermore, he had a palace, which had been built with cedar from Lebanon. He was under God’s sovereignty, and God’s presence was with him. At that juncture he began to take thought about God’s dwelling place on earth. Whereas he was living in a house of cedar, the ark, which represented God, still did not have a home (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44965" data-verses="2Samuel 7:2">2 Sam. 7:2</span>). Unable to bear such a situation, David decided to remove the ark of God to a permanent dwelling <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> place. This indicates that David’s heart was set on God’s house, God’s habitation. </p>
<p data-content-id="tnH-aFo5-PXqo1bpASNkoXeDQcqTrH6fzG0cvaUwVJLGRuJ4QU0v6lAcxNcH0gN82"> The matter of God’s dwelling place on earth is worthy of much consideration on our part. We need to realize that whatever God does for us and whatever He gives to us should be altogether for our concern for the building up of God’s dwelling place on earth. For God to have a house on earth is a great shame to His enemy, Satan. For generations Satan has been struggling to abuse, usurp, and occupy the earth. As a result, in a sense God has been driven away from the earth. That was the situation at David’s time. However, David was for God; he was one with God and according to God. As a man according to God’s heart, David desired to prepare a place where God could settle Himself down on this earth. </p>

The ark was placed in the inner chamber of the tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, and thus became the center of the tabernacle. On the lid of the ark God came to contact His people. There God’s righteousness was appeased, and God and man could have peace and harmony with each other. This was also God’s oracle, where God spoke to man. </p>
<p data-content-id="Vr3sKIAqnhtOTVVU1EzEbjUzXIUiDNQQR_yInOnGdjUbPSS2xSpooZ3WVXMMrsW9S"> The ark was respected to the uttermost by the Jewish people because they considered that the ark was God’s presence. To go to the ark was to go to God. Thus, to remove the ark to David’s stronghold was to move God from the heavens to the earth, to the holy land, and to Zion, where He could have His residence. </p>

Where do we live today? We live in Christ. Before Christ the Son of God was wrought into our being, we were homeless. To be homeless is to be Christless. Without Christ, we do not have a home. Likewise, without Christ we do not have righteousness, justification, or satisfaction. We need God to build Christ into our being to be our righteousness, justification, food and drink, clothing, satisfaction, dwelling place, and home. In order for this to happen, God has put us into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45012" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>), and now Christ is becoming everything to us. </p>

It is a marvelous fact that eventually David’s seed would be called the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45014" data-verses="Romans 1:3">Rom. 1:3</span>). This indicates the principle of incarnation. Christ is the God-man. As God, He is the Son of God; as man, He is our seed. If the Son of God is not constituted into us, we are nothing. The Son of God must become our seed, yet He remains the Son of God. </p>

The more I study the Bible, the more I realize <span class="pg" data-page-id="155" id="155">[155]</span> that the gospel is not shallow. The genuine and intrinsic gospel is that God intends to work Himself in Christ into us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45015" data-verses="2Samuel 7:12">2 Samuel 7:12</span> we have the genuine preaching of the gospel. If we preach this intrinsic gospel, we will tell others that they should not think that they can do something for God, for their human life is empty. We will tell them that they are short of something and that what they need is Christ, the very God Himself, to be wrought into their being. This is the gospel. </p>

I have been studying this chapter for over sixty years. My first impression was that here we see the love and kindness of God in wanting to build David a house instead of having David build a house for Him. That was merely the natural, human concept of a young man. I spent a number of years with the Brethren, who devoted a great deal of attention to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45039" data-verses="2Samuel 7:1">2 Samuel 7</span> and who preached and taught on it and published books about it. However, they did not see the intrinsic significance of this chapter, especially of God’s word to David in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45040" data-verses="2Samuel 7:12-14">verses 12 through 14a</span>. </p>

The book of Revelation, for example, is mainly a book of prophecy, but this book also contains quite an amount of typology. Hence, Revelation is a combination of prophecy and typology. The situation is the same with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45041" data-verses="2Samuel 7:1">2 Samuel 7</span>. This chapter conveys a great prophecy, but this prophecy is unveiled through typology. We may say that it is a prophecy in typology. </p>

Is building the church not a matter of building something for God? To answer this question we need to realize that apparently we are the ones who are building the church, but actually God is the One who is building the church with Christ as the unique element. When we are about to do some building work by speaking for God, He may check with us, saying, “Do you intend to build My house? With what material will you build My house?” If we say that we are building up the church with Christ, God may ask us how much we have of Christ. This exposes our shortage of Christ. We need Christ not merely in name and in knowledge; we need the real Christ, Christ as the Spirit in resurrection. We all need more and more of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="i-e-TLLq12rpNZQ2hFgjz3vdK1Tmx25OBPYisSBuIdrsiMM-XAgMeHvJERTmqzMkF"> We may have much knowledge of the Bible and be able to teach the Bible to others, but this is not the way to build up the church. The church is not built with the knowledge of the Bible. The church is built with Christ as the unique element. Many times, after trying to build up the saints with Christ, I have had to ask myself, “How much of Christ have you really ministered to the saints? Did you minister only doctrine and the high truths concerning God’s economy, or did you minister the real Christ, the genuine Christ, the reality of Christ in resurrection as the Spirit?” Then I had to confess my shortage of Christ and repent, saying, “Lord, forgive me. I am still short of You. I need You to be wrought into me. I need more of You to be constituted into my being.” </p>

Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45044" data-verses="2Samuel 7:1">2 Samuel 7</span> is the unveiling of a prophecy through typology showing us there is no need for us to build something for God. We simply are not able to do this. We cannot build something for God with ourselves or with our knowledge of the Bible and theology. We need God to <span class="pg" data-page-id="161" id="161">[161]</span> build up Christ into our intrinsic constitution so that our entire being will be reconstituted with Christ. As a result, we are not only changed, but we are transformed from one kind of person into another. </p>
<p data-content-id="jwjllZww68lHm2rMyuqquJX3pzsDBBpCcYKU6K5DO-zdwbMdjvZWzeaXxfu1B4vDg"> Perhaps now we can see that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45045" data-verses="2Samuel 7:1">2 Samuel 7</span> simply indicates that God does not need us to build anything for Him. We are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing. Therefore, we need Christ to be wrought into our being. </p>

God’s economy is to work Himself into us in Christ as His embodiment. Through death and resurrection Christ has become the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45046" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). Now we need to let God work Christ as the Spirit into every part of our being. The more God does this, the more we will be able to declare, “To me, to live is Christ,” and “I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45047" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45048" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). </p>

Here Paul says that Christ is making His home in our hearts. This is building. What is of crucial importance today is the question concerning how much of Christ has been built into us. How much has Christ been built not only into your spirit but into your heart in order to make His home there? </p>
<p data-content-id="soofKjz9MBuX3nvwndy-__zPTLkQbhzognLcBAGDnTNM_e_ir8Q5nU0BSBnD7GOkw"> Our spirit, the central part of our being, is surrounded by our heart, which is composed mainly of our mind, emotion, and will. Christ is in our spirit, but how much has Christ made His home in our heart? Most of our hearts are still vacant, not occupied, saturated, and soaked with Christ. Every day our hearts are filled with other things. As a result, Christ is imprisoned in our spirit. </p>

Paul bowed his knees to the Father and prayed that He would <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45051" data-verses="Ephesians 3:14">vv. 14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45052" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16">16</span>) so that Christ may make His home in our hearts. Here we have the Divine Trinity: the Father is the One to whom Paul prayed; the Spirit is the One who carries out the strengthening; and Christ the Son is the One who is making His home in our heart. By building Himself into our being, He makes our heart, our intrinsic constitution, His home. </p>

If we build the church with wood, grass, and stubble—with the attainments that come from our natural background or with the natural way of living—we will mar the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45054" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:17">v. 17</span>). We should build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones, signifying respectively God, Christ, and the Spirit. To build the church with these materials is to build the church with the processed and consummated Triune God. When we build the church with the processed and consummated Triune God, it is not actually we who are building.

It is he who will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his Father, and he will be My son.” The word concerning “your seed” and “My son” indicates that the seed of David would become the Son of God, that the seed of a man would become God’s Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pf18V059FoWRDKglYpzGqXnz_I6ke6EsvFjtEnAZ9t7HCn_EzXj08fXF6UQKjCIIp"> This thought is continued very strongly in the New Testament, particularly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45067" data-verses="Romans 1:3-4">Romans 1:3 and 4</span>. Here Paul says, “Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.” Here we have the same thought as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45068" data-verses="2Samuel 7:12-14">2 Samuel 7:12-14a</span>—that the seed of David becomes the Son of God. These verses reveal, on the one hand, that Christ is the seed of David and, on the other hand, that He, the seed of David, has been designated the Son of God.

However, God intervened and did not permit David to do this, because David did not have an adequate and thorough view of God’s economy. After stopping David from building Him a house, God went on to reveal something further concerning His economy. In this chapter, therefore, the divine revelation took a great step forward. </p>
<p data-content-id="_xzm0jWZWlHscFKEIW2CvolLHW027l5yIttnAFvQjvSgyQfdFYjm1Q2FBJcRopIqX"> The Bible tells us that David was a man according to God’s heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45070" data-verses="1Samuel 13:14">1 Sam. 13:14</span>). Under the influence of this word, many Bible students have estimated David too highly. Yes, David was a man according to the heart of God, but, as the remainder of 2 Samuel and the book of Psalms show us, he was still a man in life, in nature, and in constitution. He was a man according to God, but he was not God in life and in nature. David could not say, “To me, to live is Christ” or “It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45071" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21a</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45072" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>).

Athanasius referred to deification when at the council of Nicea in A.D. 325 he said, “He [Christ] was made man that we might be made God.” Although the term <em>deification</em> is familiar to many theologians and Christian teachers, during the past sixteen centuries only a small number have dared to teach regarding the deification of the believers in Christ. </p>

We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is.” This verse clearly reveals that we will be like God. </p>
<p data-content-id="d8cYMfPwVEOUSxuQeIsNTYHVM11ebomX0Ey6EsspO7W0skwBfSQM2Mdnip5OhGGHn"> God makes us like Him by imparting His life and nature into us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45074" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">Second Peter 1:4</span> says that we have become “partakers of the divine nature.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45075" data-verses="John 1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span> says that we were born, regenerated, by God with His life.

Thus, my burden in this message is to point out that, as a prophecy given in the way of typology, these verses speak of God’s building Himself in Christ into our being through the metabolic process of transformation. </p>

First, He ministered on the earth until He died on the cross for our sins to terminate the old creation. Then He rose in resurrection and ascended to the heavens. There He became and still is the Minister of all the heavenly things to us. As such a Minister, He is not in the flesh, for in resurrection He as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45090" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>).

We should look to Him, behold Him, and reflect Him, opening to Him the three layers <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> of our being—our spirit, our heart, and our mouth. Then we will spontaneously reflect Him as a mirror and gradually be transformed into His glorious image from glory to glory. As a result, we will have the same image that He has. This is altogether from the Lord, the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45092" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Cor. 3:18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="soofKjz9MBuX3nvwndy-__zPTLkQbhzognLUBAGjnTNM_e_ir8Q5nU0BSBnD7GOkw"> In this way the Lord Jesus makes us like Him and even makes us Him.

This is illustrated by one’s having a healthy complexion through the proper, daily eating, digesting, and assimilating of food. This healthy appearance is the result not of cosmetics but of nourishment. This nourishment causes a metabolic process in which a new element is brought in and the old element is discharged. In like manner, we need to receive spiritual nourishment day by day. This nourishment will supply a new element and then cause the old things to be carried away. Gradually, we will grow, change, and mature. This is transformation. God’s economy is just to work Himself into us that we may experience such a metabolic process of spiritual digestion and assimilation that produces a gradual, intrinsic change in life. </p>

It is a tragedy that many <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> Christians know Christ only in an objective way. The Bible reveals that Christ came and stayed with His disciples for a period of time. Then He passed through death and entered into resurrection, and through this process He became the life-giving Spirit. Today as the Spirit He is real, genuine, living, and present. Thus, we may say that He is the “now” Christ. </p>

Through this metabolic process Christ is constituted into our being. This constitution is the building. Christ, therefore, is building Himself into us as our inner constitution. The issue of such a building is that we become a very particular class of people—the members of the Body of Christ. Whenever we gather together we are the church of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Pf18V059FoWRDKglYpzGqXnz_I6ke6EsvFjhElUR9t7HCn_EzXj08fXF6UQKjCIIp"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45096" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> the Lord Jesus said, “I will build My church.” Now we can see by what way Christ builds the church. He is building His church by supplying us with spiritual drink and by feeding us with spiritual food, which are uniquely Himself as the Spirit. The more we enjoy Him by eating, drinking, and breathing Him, the more He builds His church. </p>

In different kinds of meetings, we endeavor to minister Christ into the saints as their spiritual food and drink. The more we receive Christ in this way, the more we will experience the inner, spiritual metabolism. This metabolism is transformation, and transformation is the building. </p>

The church is a group of transformed people who have grown into one organism, the organic Body of Christ. The way to be built up as this organism is to grow, and the way to grow is to eat, drink, and breathe Christ. No matter what our race or nationality may be, we are all undergoing the same metabolic process that day by day produces transformation, which equals building. This is the spiritual growth and also the spiritual building. </p>
<p data-content-id="WCLNsN5Rwvft4vPRf4gJuVD6_uEL7Hee5-ccnWaZPU8xAoRachdW77TlORGap5S8E"> Every member of our physical body is not only organic but also inseparably connected to our body, for all the members have grown together organically to be one body.

Without the church I could not live, for apart from the church, life would have no meaning. </p>

It is only through this process that human beings can be transformed into sons of God. It is only through this process that something human—the human seed—can become divine—the sons of God. In typology God prophesied to David regarding this when He told David that his seed would be God’s son. This indicates that a human seed would become a divine son. This is what we are experiencing today. Therefore, we, the believers in Christ, are a very particular and peculiar people. We are a precious treasure in the eyes of God. </p>

First, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45098" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>, the Lord builds. Then He builds through the gifted persons, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45099" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">Eph. 4:11</span>). He then builds the church through us, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="175" id="175">[175]</span> perfected saints (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45100" data-verses="Ephesians 4:12">v. 12</span>). These are three layers of building. Eventually, the Body builds itself up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45101" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">v. 16</span>). This is the fourth layer. This is all by ministering Christ as the daily supply, as food, water, and breath. </p>
<p data-content-id="HW86XUipd3gbYdNb7fKMW5Z5A9_I8jUKNLwoQcw-94L_HwH98fzdohiHypW9jmEgn"> We cannot build the church. We can only minister Christ to others. When they are nourished with Christ as their supply, a spiritual metabolism within them transforms them into His image and makes them just Him. Such a metabolic transformation is both the growth and the building up. This is the way the Lord Jesus builds us into the church. </p>

Concerning this, the Lord Jesus asked a question of the Pharisees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45112" data-verses="Matthew 22:41-45">Matt. 22:41-45</span>). First, He asked them, “What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45113" data-verses="Matthew 22:42">v. 42</span>). When they said that Christ was David’s son, the Lord Jesus went on to ask how David could call Him Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45114" data-verses="Matthew 22:43">v. 43</span>). Finally, He said, “If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45115" data-verses="Matthew 22:45">v. 45</span>). This is the greatest question in the universe. How could Christ be the seed of a man and also the Son of God? How could He be the son of David and also David’s Lord? The Pharisees knew the Bible very well, but when the Lord Jesus questioned them concerning the two aspects of His person, their mouths were shut. The Pharisees realized that Christ was the seed of David, and they answered without any hesitation. But when the Lord Jesus asked why David, a forefather of Christ, called Christ the Lord, they could not answer. On the one hand, He was a man; on the other hand, He was God. No one can reconcile these two. </p>

<p data-content-id="4kpXpjtpWfZIzPoCD7f74KSGR90-YkX-6Q9vZ5XL5aTKrEPC2Dp38kWIga1yKPtaD"> The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive. At the very beginning, in Genesis, God created man with a good nature. This means that there was nothing sinful or evil in the man created by God. When God looked at what He had created, including man, He saw that it was “very good” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45142" data-verses="Genesis 1:31">1:31</span>). At the beginning of man’s history, God put man into a pleasant garden in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God commanded Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, telling him that in the day that he ate thereof he would die (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45143" data-verses="Genesis 2:17">2:17</span>). This indicates that God wanted man to partake of the tree of life. However, man fell. The conscience was activated, and fallen man thus feared God and worshipped Him, realizing that he should do good and abandon evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="ozdq48uBsaLHr_n26fewT_VIrJZpX2FgJ7TdwDlfmMDKBSLV8qjZwZqbrxgTGUFuG"> Eventually, Abel received the revelation of God’s redemption. Redemption did not come at Abel’s time. Rather, it was anticipated in God’s foreknowledge, and this anticipated redemption was revealed to Abel. Later, a little more of the divine revelation was given to Enoch and to Noah. <span class="pg" data-page-id="184" id="184">[184]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Pf18V059FoWRDKglYpzGqXnz_I6ke6EsvFjZElUx9t7HCn_EzXj08fXF6UQKjCIIp">The Case of Job</h2><p data-content-id="-szw3pjUEYSi-TwKtRPDlpenrcg3VQMlukfNXijIqM6v2WcL_gTJjAh-8WpBDV2hT"> During the time from Adam to Job, the divine revelation was somewhat ambiguous. Job was a person who feared God, who worshipped God, and who endeavored to build himself up to the uttermost in his integrity, uprightness, and perfection. Job tried his best to practice his integrity. However, God stripped Job of everything to show him that his need was not integrity nor perfection nor the highest standard of morality; his only need was God Himself. God seemed to be saying, “Job, I do not want you to build yourself up in your integrity or perfection. I want you to build yourself up with Me. You should not be a man of integrity or perfection—you should be a man of God. Job, you need to realize that what you lack is Me. You do not need perfection or integrity—you need Me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="pRV5l2-3TTRQt9kqAoiM-Y6TBWAQ_GaS8cB9q7Z-CU40tyGXV_U0EPGRgohXWruqj"> At the time of Job, the divine revelation had not proceeded very far. What had been revealed was mainly that man needed God, that man had been created by God and for God, and that he needed to receive God as life. A man should be solely, wholly, and absolutely a man of God. Thus far, nothing had been revealed concerning God’s building. If we stop with the book of Job, we may think that it is sufficient for us to have God. However, to have God is not adequate, for, as we will see, God wants a building. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="v44slLo_2ynybXa3mygpLB-p5l49HsMiz8SANCKAsc8cC7Hm89g4s2x_hmS-1EqJZ">The Revelation Given to Abraham</h2><p data-content-id="WCLNsN5Rwvft4vPRf4gJuVD6_uEL7Hee5-cknWqBPU8xAoRachdW77TlORGap5S8E"> After God gained Abraham, He gave him the promise of the good land and of a descendant to enjoy the land. Isaac, one who enjoyed the good land, was a type of Christ. The good land itself also was a type of Christ. The rich produce of the good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45144" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:7-10">Deut. 8:7-10</span>) signifies Christ as our life supply. This life supply eventually becomes the life-giving Spirit, who is the reality of Christ. The blessing of the gospel that God promised to Abraham is actually Christ in reality as the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45145" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">Gal. 3:14</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="2d5RxvqBRWvweMgdRBUa1GwmcoqheHrkPtRlOq9XGSSG1ViN6SmjDFNP23n2eB2x6">The Revelation Given to David</h2><p data-content-id="ukpWGp3PTo2b-3b2kUeZDOn1txZjUN4RdLvl6Pr_0e3c9HKQLSLg2w3nxTzHiKYxj"> With David the revelation went further to show that man not only needs God but needs God to be built into him. God <span class="pg" data-page-id="185" id="185">[185]</span> wants not only to be our life and our life supply; He wants to be built into us. God desires to build Himself into us and to build us into Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="fMJkoGahiLBKs8sogsJuBNQjQyoPR_lb5AeQ-jC9dl_4fXQxWsObyOLlIq51YUeys"> David wanted to build a house for God, but God stopped him and told him that He would build a house, a family, for David, and out of that building He would give him a seed. Here we see that God builds Himself into man to produce a house, and the issue of this building is a seed, which is Christ. After this Christ enters into us, He does a building work in us, making His home in our hearts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45146" data-verses="Ephesians 3:17">Eph. 3:17</span>). Christ builds His home in our hearts with the elements of divinity and humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="IMqW3mInpZkLBs7tv46oGA5lucj1obiPY6ocSggIMNHz35my44Vo76utIqJH57WDy"> This home is a mutual abode. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45147" data-verses="John 14:23">John 14:23</span> the Lord Jesus said, “If anyone loves Me,...My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.” To “make an abode” is to build a house. This house, this abode, is for mutual abiding. Hence, the Lord Jesus went on to say, “Abide in Me and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45148" data-verses="John 15:4">15:4a</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="kWw5aASFZea7bwtYztG5qn8XE5X66uALVLGXNeI4bYHc-hAvVkqSs5Vi0qsT_2QXU"> God wants a building, and the consummate issue of the Bible is a building. This building is the New Jerusalem as a wife, a counterpart, to match Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45150" data-verses="Revelation 21:2">Rev. 21:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45151" data-verses="Revelation 21:9">9</span>). The New Jerusalem as the corporate wife of Christ is composed of the Old Testament saints and the New Testament believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45152" data-verses="Revelation 21:12-14">vv. 12-14</span>), who have been built together with the Triune God.

Eventually, Job learned <span class="pg" data-page-id="186" id="186">[186]</span> that what he needed was God. With Job, however, we cannot see the building. We need to realize, therefore, that it is not adequate simply to take God as our life and life supply. We today may say that Christ is everything to us: our life, our breath, our food and drink, our clothing, and our abode. Yet even to have Christ in all these aspects still is not adequate. We need Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, to be built into our being, to be constituted into us. This is what Christ is doing today. </p>
<p data-content-id="atI04UAhNpuCGtehkSZBqejKIQfHsR_zz-w-Lm0aW70NuxZbeZ6w227c7HaQkRVFc"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45155" data-verses="Philippians 3:7-11">Philippians 3:7-11</span> speaks of pursuing Christ and gaining Christ. When I was a youth, I heard that we should pursue Christ and gain Him. Later I discovered that it is not adequate even to pursue and gain Christ. We need the Christ who is dwelling in our spirit to build Himself into our heart, making our heart, with our humanity, His home. </p>
<p data-content-id="bHgn9Q-KapSSLQIR4Z1ZCaIJAqxnki1mY6WL4zT3SCXg6Npt6ik4O8XtWIWCGVnWq"> Are you pursuing Christ? Are you gaining Christ? It is wonderful to be a person who is pursuing and gaining Christ, but this is not adequate. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45156" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45157" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> both reveal that Christ comes into us not just to dwell, or abide, in us but especially for the purpose of making a home for Himself in our inner being. This is building. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="q4UpcavGePTL-kVcmkI_1k4WMIj3wsFXmXugW0fDccYzKTtt3tVJpytK9vdW7NziE">GOD’S ECONOMY AND GOAL<br/>ACCORDING TO HIS HEART’S DESIRE<br/>BEING TO BUILD HIMSELF INTO MAN<br/>AND TO BUILD MAN INTO HIM</h2><p data-content-id="yg0jPmYJ7QrN1rOclXhYeGR-iSGEJ5sdLp6zE-A-oYeZquG2SEtfDdKt-Iqp3ahgE"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45158" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> reveals the tree of life with a river and precious materials of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. These materials are for building, for after this, God built a woman, Eve. This corresponds to the entire Bible. Christ came into us as the Spirit to be life to us. On the one hand, He is working within us to transform us into precious stones; on the other hand, He is building with Himself (divinity) and with us (humanity) to produce a home, a dwelling place. Eventually, this dwelling place, which is a mutual abode, will issue in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Ai1vnnjfDSI2kARU_QU2Bor3dRdPCT-Y5QIbJ0q6dvRy9ur0pq18_jV8xhqMAGmh"> This view of God’s building in the Bible indicates that God’s economy and goal according to His heart’s desire are just to build Himself into man and to build man into Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="187" id="187">[187]</span> We have seen that Athanasius said, “He [Christ] was made man that we might be made God.” This means that as God’s children, we are “baby gods,” having the life and nature of God but not the Godhead. However, not even this is God’s goal. God in Christ is within us to build Himself into our being and to build us into His being. He builds His divinity into our humanity and builds our humanity into His divinity in order to mingle and blend His divinity with our humanity into one entity. This is like the meal offering: fine flour mingled with oil for the satisfaction of both God and man. </p>

For instance, He revealed something to Job that He had not revealed to Adam, Abel, Enosh, or Noah. God revealed to Job that what He wants is a man who has God, not a man of uprightness, integrity, and perfection. God seemed to be saying, “Job, you should forget about your integrity, your perfection, and your uprightness. You do not need these things—you need Me.” God revealed to Job that his unique need was God Himself, but He did not reveal to him anything concerning building. </p>

The good land and the seed both typify Christ. This indicates that, in typology, God would give Abraham Christ as the good land and also give him Christ as the seed, the real Isaac. The genealogy of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45167" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> speaks of Christ as “the son of Abraham” <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45168" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">v. 1</span>). Isaac is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the One who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45169" data-verses="Genesis 22:17-18">Gen. 22:17-18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45170" data-verses="Galatians 3:16">Gal. 3:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="EWXpwEJc1QH9LIugyCBIbt_R_R1UxFcxvpDVOJtXN5lz-m5QHO_Mkoa3O4gh9MJIC"> According to Paul’s interpretation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45171" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3</span>, both the good land and the seed are the Spirit. The blessing of the gospel is the promised Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45172" data-verses="Galatians 3:8">vv. 8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45173" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">14</span>). The land signifies Christ, the seed signifies Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45174" data-verses="Galatians 3:16">v. 16</span>), and eventually Christ became the life-giving Spirit. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45175" data-verses="Galatians 3:14">verse 14</span> Paul says, “In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45176" data-verses="Genesis 12:7">Gen. 12:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45177" data-verses="Genesis 13:15">13:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45178" data-verses="Genesis 17:8">17:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45179" data-verses="Genesis 26:3-4">26:3-4</span>), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ.

He died for our sins, accomplishing redemption; He rose up from among the dead; and He has become our life. However, this does not tell us what God wants to do. God wants to work Himself in Christ into us. Redemption and salvation are for this. Christ’s incarnation, Christ’s human living, Christ’s death and resurrection—they all are for God’s desire to work Himself in Christ into us. Everything that Christ is and everything that Christ has accomplished are for this one thing. All the steps, big and small, that God takes in our daily life are to fulfill His intention of building Himself in Christ into our being. <span class="pg" data-page-id="191" id="191">[191]</span> </p>

God reacted by saying to David through Nathan the prophet, “Is it you who will build Me a house for Me to dwell in?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45183" data-verses="2Samuel 7:5">v. 5</span>). God went on to reveal to David, through a prophecy in typology, that His intention was not that David would build a house for Him but that He would build Himself into David. First, God told David that He would make him a house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45184" data-verses="2Samuel 7:11">v. 11b</span>). Then He said, “I will raise up your seed after you...and I will establish his kingdom. It is he who will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his Father, and he will be My son” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45185" data-verses="2Samuel 7:12-14">vv. 12-14a</span>). Here God revealed to David something concerning building, a matter that had not been revealed to either Job or Abraham. </p>
<p data-content-id="NDDOuOq3K8J9WdzSdzRIwXzzqPAJx5R-0AGJunAMquM6awkVEZ8U9vkBvyvfHOsvv"> The prophecy in typology in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45186" data-verses="2Samuel 7:1">2 Samuel 7</span> is related to the prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45187" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span>, which tells us that a twig will come forth from the stem of Jesse and that a branch from his roots will bear fruit. This refers to Christ. The house of David, which was a flourishing tree at Solomon’s time, eventually was reduced to a stump consisting mainly of Joseph and Mary. Out of that stump the child Jesus came forth as a twig, a sprout. That was God’s building a house for David, and through this house God gave David a seed—Jesus Christ. Thus, the prophecy given to David in the way of typology was fulfilled in Christ’s incarnation and human living. Christ is the seed that is the issue of God’s building a house for David. </p>

This is building, and it is carried out through the mingling of divinity with humanity. Such a building is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45190" data-verses="John 14:23">John 14:23</span>: “If anyone loves Me,...My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.” This abode is not only for the Triune God but is also for us.

<p data-content-id="M-qWlbSuZIKU1I0RRNNoBiBDCim2TspAwwiCCNhBdBeNlwcrh51zzZ_zk3NjVoOGQ"> This thought regarding the building is strengthened in 1 Corinthians and in Revelation.

Eventually, the New Jerusalem, the consummation of the building, a composition of the Old Testament saints and the New Testament believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45194" data-verses="Revelation 21:12-14">21:12-14</span>), will be the wife of the Lamb, Christ, and a mutual abode for God and His redeemed for eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45195" data-verses="Revelation 21:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45196" data-verses="Revelation 21:9">9</span>). </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45214" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16-17">Ephesians 3:16-17</span> Paul prayed to the Father, saying, “That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.” To be sure, Christ’s making His home in our hearts involves building. If we would make a home, we must first build a house. To make a home implies being settled in a particular place. However, if we would be settled, we must have a house. The words <em>that Christ may make His home</em> are a strong indication that He is doing a work of building in us. Christ is building a home in our inner being. </p>

When God created the universe, He did not use any material; He created simply by His speaking. For instance, He said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. However, in order to build a home in us, Christ must have the material. On the one hand, this material is Christ Himself as the element, on the other hand, this material includes something from us with our humanity. </p>

Once this seed comes into us, it meets something within us—our spiritual nutrients—and it begins to grow. The degree of growth depends not on the divine seed but on how many nutrients we afford this seed. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45220" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> indicates that only the good soil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45221" data-verses="Matthew 13:8">vv. 8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45222" data-verses="Matthew 13:23">23</span>) affords the adequate nutrients for the growth of the divine seed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="198" id="198">[198]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="BvM_-Scvlh5o83NSXOF8cGpqR2l7GkUwh6Xko0-U1XvlisxXCnmYBweD-AE8fTqCL">Our Need to Be Strengthened into Our Inner Man</h2><p data-content-id="x81aRroco2KbAeOicF7UkJ3xcJE95dmNUjF4NxfLUd9LzwC3ZBWThhynW5sLDmfuz"> Since God’s building Himself in Christ into us depends not only on Himself as the element but also on the nutrients supplied by us, we need to be strengthened into our inner man. If we remain in our soul, in our natural man, there will not be any nutrients for the growth of the divine seed. But if we are strengthened into our inner man and if we pay attention to our spirit and exercise our spirit, the nutrients will be supplied. Then Christ will make His home in our inner being. </p>
<p data-content-id="rZqMjMYs4GUm2DWmzRlPzGiDmxn1pEQLi3rymwFAD_-oilAqhKPeQ_hGBK4mVheFk"> If Christ’s making His home in our hearts did not need something from us, Paul would not have prayed for us as he did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45223" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span>. Here Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into our inner man. This power, referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45224" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19-22">Ephesians 1:19-22</span>, is the power that raised Christ from the dead, seated Christ at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, subjected all things under Christ’s feet, and gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. Such power operates in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45225" data-verses="Ephesians 3:20">3:20</span>), and with it God strengthens us for His building. The Spirit through whom God strengthens us is the consummation of the processed Triune God. On the one hand, God strengthens us with Himself as the element, and on the other hand, we afford the nutrients. Through these two God in Christ carries out His intrinsic building—the building of His home—in our entire being. </p>

This building is a blending and mingling of divinity with humanity. This is proved by the description of the New Jerusalem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45226" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Revelation 21</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45227" data-verses="Revelation 21:3">Verse 3</span> refers to the New Jerusalem as “the tabernacle of God,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45228" data-verses="Revelation 21:22">verse 22</span> says, “I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.” The New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for the redeemed saints to dwell <span class="pg" data-page-id="199" id="199">[199]</span> in. This indicates that the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for God and man. Furthermore, this building is a composition of human beings. The gates are pearls inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45229" data-verses="Revelation 21:12">v. 12</span>), and on the twelve foundations are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45230" data-verses="Revelation 21:14">v. 14</span>). This indicates clearly that the New Jerusalem is a composition of the Triune God, who is the essence, center, and universality, and God’s redeemed people. </p>

<p data-content-id="wz_Tf5AacTANnmKa2WKosNmj5tdWkfSKFS45lg8eJCr3UYMVf53leSgEeElHEzqpd"> The books of history in the Old Testament contain many stories. On the one hand, these stories are helpful. On the other hand, we may be distracted by these stories from the unique goal in the Bible. The one goal in the Bible has been neglected by Christians for centuries, but in His recovery the Lord has shown us this goal in a very clear way. </p>
<p data-content-id="LLbJJ89S3KOyxNA70NQVap6zWv-xFMv2AMBcQr3QUokcBGwcLZat849aMMcrCKeXE"> In this concluding word on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45242" data-verses="2Samuel 7:12-14">2 Samuel 7:12-14a</span>, I have the burden to consider some striking matters covered in or implied by these verses. These matters are all related to the significance of the seed of David being designated the Son of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="mcSqnaE9mgCHQOhwj7Jq6ycs4awmmV7BkgbzJzs8rbyi59GjNyb05oCMHY5IjEnlE">GOD MAKING HIMSELF MAN<br/>IN ORDER TO MAKE MAN GOD IN LIFE AND IN NATURE</h2><p data-content-id="ZtLh1kzlclk25dqS_ej05rXlSwOBmKMNLghMSlTPKeu6cu8s1RWgQ-18amj-W4aUx"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45243" data-verses="2Samuel 7:12">verse 12</span> God spoke of David’s seed, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45244" data-verses="2Samuel 7:14">verse 14a</span> He said, “I will be his Father, and he will be My son.” Here we have something of very great significance—the seed of David becoming the Son of God. These verses clearly unveil that a seed of man, that is, a son of a man, can become the Son of God. This implies that God’s intention is to make Himself man in order to make man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. Such an implication is exceedingly great. Eventually, the whole Bible consummates with this matter. The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of the Bible, involves God becoming man and man becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead, and God and man being mingled together to be one entity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> </p>

This means that although the Bible is real in itself, in our understanding of it the Bible is empty. As an illustration, let us suppose that a certain box, which is quite attractive, contains a large diamond. A child may be interested in the box but not in the diamond. An adult, however, would focus his attention on the diamond contained in the box. Today, many Christians care for the Bible as the “box,” but they have not seen and do not appreciate the “diamond,” which is the content of this box, and they may even condemn those who have a proper appreciation of the “diamond” in the “box.” The “diamond” in the “box” of the Bible is the revelation that in Christ God has become man in order that man might become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. </p>
<p data-content-id="UcXrz84oIVL1Wzgkh4hUysR9kDULs4ULhQpBS1ALT2LPBPl8KU3_6B23D38mGJdMJ"> The vast majority of today’s Christians neglect the crucial point in the Bible that in Christ God has become man in order to make man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead and that God desires to mingle Himself with man to be one entity. Some not only neglect this; they falsely accuse as heretical those who teach it. Today many believe one aspect of this crucial point—that God became a man named Jesus—but they do not believe the other aspect—that man is becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. </p>

This One is both the Son of God and the Son of man. On one occasion when the Pharisees were gathered together, the Lord Jesus questioned them, saying, “What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45245" data-verses="Matthew 22:41-42">Matt. 22:41-42a</span>). When they said to him “David’s,” He went on to say to them, “How then does David in spirit call Him Lord...? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45246" data-verses="Matthew 22:43">vv. 43</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45247" data-verses="Matthew 22:45">45</span>). The Pharisees could not understand this, and they were not able to answer Him. Here the Lord Jesus was <span class="pg" data-page-id="205" id="205">[205]</span> indicating that He, the son of David, was the Son of God—the very matter revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45248" data-verses="2Samuel 7:12-14">2 Samuel 7:12-14a</span>. </p>

These verses say, “Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.” Christ is a descendant of David, yet He has been designated to be the Son of God. This is the mystery of God becoming man to make man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. The two, God and man, are thus built together, constituted into each other. In Christ God has been constituted into man, man has been constituted into God, and God and man have been mingled together to be one entity, which is called the God-man. </p>

God is building Himself not in Himself but in man, and not only <em>in</em> man but also <em>into</em> man. This building is God’s constituting of Himself in Christ into man. </p>
<p data-content-id="jwjllZww68lHm2rMyuqquJX3pzsDBBpCcYaA6K5TO-zdwbMdjvZWzeaXxfu1B4vDg"> God in Christ is constituting Himself into man, making Himself the element of man. Thus, we human beings are constituted with a divine element. This means that a divine element is built into our human element, and the two elements are mingled with each other. Not only is God’s divine element constituted into us—the human element is constituted into God. As the divine element is constituted into our humanity, we become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. As the human element is constituted into God, God becomes man. This is the building revealed in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="T8Yneii7JXABIOGJQmw3OBHaPi5TV8yEYJEPNO20KNoN5otHiOSNZYnzxySXqTzgb"> Such a revelation should become a principle that governs our understanding of God and of God’s building. When we talk about the building up of the church or about the building up of the Body, we need to realize that this building is a constitution of the divine element into the human element and <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> of the human element into the divine element. This building, therefore, is a constitution of the divine element and of the human element into each other. Such a constitution makes the divine element and the human element one entity. This is the building of the church, the building of the Body of Christ. </p>

The servant told him that there was still a son of Jonathan, one who was crippled in his feet. When Mephibosheth came to David, David told him not to be afraid, for he would surely show kindness to him for the sake of Jonathan his father. David went on to tell him that he would restore to him all the land of his father Saul and that he would eat food at his table continually (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45275" data-verses="2Samuel 9:7">v. 7</span>).

Seeing that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon hired soldiers of the Syrians and men of Maacah and Tob (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45281" data-verses="2Samuel 10:6">v. 6</span>).

David comforted and encouraged Joab, the one who carried out the conspiracy, by saying, “Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your fighting against the city and overthrow it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45296" data-verses="2Samuel 11:25">v. 25</span>). What a terrible thing for David to say! Uriah was not merely devoured by the sword—he was actually murdered by David so that he could take Uriah’s wife. </p>
<p data-content-id="IMqW3mInpZkLBs7tv46oGA5lucj1obiPY64wSgAoMNHz35my44Vo76utIqJH57WDy"> David’s behavior here was utterly different from that of Joseph and Boaz. Joseph was tempted, but he ran and escaped from adultery (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45297" data-verses="Genesis 39:1">Gen. 39</span>). Boaz, David’s forefather, also kept himself clean from the indulgence of the flesh of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45298" data-verses="Ruth 3:1">Ruth 3</span>). This purity kept Boaz in the line of the genealogy of Christ. David, however, willingly committed adultery. By his one sin David broke the last five of the Ten Commandments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45299" data-verses="Exodus 20:13-17">Exo. 20:13-17</span>). </p>

David was perfect in every way, but he was weak in the matter of the indulgence of the lust of the flesh. The lust of the flesh is like a wild horse. To subdue this lust, we must hold the bridle very tightly. In this matter David was loose, and he sacrificed his high attainment in the pursuit of God. David was a great “diamond,” but his indulgence in lust was a black, foreign particle in this diamond. Even though he was a person of high attainment in his spiritual pursuit, he was still able to commit such a great sin. </p>

Further, God said that He would take David’s wives before his eyes and give them to his companion, who would lie with them in the sight of the sun (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45316" data-verses="2Samuel 12:11">v. 11</span>). David had done this secretly, but God would do it before all Israel and even before the sun (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45317" data-verses="2Samuel 12:12">v. 12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="QqvXxFmTgnGbhODqVAxClRqYxUY9FXTPYotyM_07k2ZoO-fbJrWrMSqmTSAyZomhL"> Here we see that God is not only loving; He is also fearful. Under God’s punishment, there was fornication and killing in David’s family, and David’s son, Absalom, even rebelled against him. </p>

<p data-content-id="QqvXxFmTgnGbhODqVAxClRqYxUY9FXTPYotuM8wzk2ZoO-fbJrWrMSqmTSAyZomhL"> God desires to work Himself in Christ into His chosen people, making Himself and them one organic entity. This means that the processed and consummated Triune God is building Himself in Christ into the intrinsic being of His chosen people, in order to have a constitution that is both divine and human. Such an entity is called the kingdom of God, the organism of the Triune God, and the organic Body of Christ. Whereas God is building such an entity, many of those who are spiritually blind are endeavoring to build up for themselves a monarchy within the divine kingdom. </p>

David, a man according to God’s heart, failed in the matter of the lust of the flesh. David’s defect was that he did not restrict his flesh. When he was crowned in Hebron at thirty years of age, he already had at least six wives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45322" data-verses="2Samuel 3:2-5">2 Sam. 3:2-5</span>). Later, he abused his kingship by murdering Uriah and robbing him of his wife. </p>
<p data-content-id="d8cYMfPwVEOUSxuQeIsNTYHVM11ebomX0Ei-Ess5O7W0skwBfSQM2Mdnip5OhGGHn"> In His creation God ordained that man have one wife so <span class="pg" data-page-id="218" id="218">[218]</span> that man may have godly children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45323" data-verses="Malachi 2:14-15">Mal. 2:14-15</span>). However, some men broke this principle. For instance, Gideon, one of the judges of Israel, had many wives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45324" data-verses="Judges 8:30">Judg. 8:30</span>). Boaz, an important ancestor in the genealogy of Christ, was a good pattern because he controlled the lust of his flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45325" data-verses="Ruth 3:1">Ruth 3</span>). Samuel was also a good example. His mother consecrated him to God as a Nazarite, and he kept the vow of his mother throughout his life. David, on the contrary, even though he was a man according to God’s heart, had a great failure in the matter of the lust of the flesh. </p>

God exercised a severe punishment upon David because his sin was very evil. </p>

It seemed that, after David’s failure, the behavior of his children changed. This change is seen particularly in the case of David’s son Absalom. Absalom killed his brother Ammon because he had defiled Absalom’s sister, and then he rebelled against his father David, even seeking to kill him. The source of this unprecedented evil was David’s indulgence in the lust of the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="4kpXpjtpWfZIzPoCD7f74KSGR90-YkX-6QtfZ7D75aTKrEPC2Dp38kWIga1yKPtaD"> The change that took place with David’s children should teach us to fear God. We must learn the lesson to have a holy fear toward God and to tremble before Him. Whether our children will be good or bad is altogether up to God. What we are in the sight of God will affect our children. Furthermore, God’s chastisement and His governmental dealing with those who love Him always affect their children. </p>

In God’s sovereign mercy, another child was born of her. The name given to him by God was <span class="pg" data-page-id="219" id="219">[219]</span> Jedidiah, which means “beloved of Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45327" data-verses="2Samuel 12:25">v. 25</span>). David gave him the name Solomon, which means “peaceful” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45328" data-verses="2Samuel 12:24">v. 24</span>). This indicates that David expected to have a peaceful time. But from that time there was no peace in David’s family or in the entire kingdom of Israel. Solomon’s kingship had a wonderful beginning, but the same thing happened with him as with his father, and his end was pitiful. He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45329" data-verses="1Kings 11:3">1 Kings 11:3</span>). His pagan wives brought their idols with them and turned Solomon’s heart away from God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45330" data-verses="1Kings 11:4">vv. 4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45331" data-verses="1Kings 11:8">8</span>). </p>

God loved David, but because of his sin David lost his standing and position and eleven of the twelve tribes. Only the tribe of Judah remained with David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45332" data-verses="2Samuel 20:1-2">2 Sam. 20:1-2</span>). After Solomon’s reign the kingdom was divided, and eventually Judah and Israel were taken into captivity. The children of Israel lost their nation and the land of their fathers; they were scattered around the globe; and they were persecuted and killed. Today, although they have a narrow strip of land near the Mediterranean Sea, they have no peace with their neighbors. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45333" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">chapters two and three</span> of Revelation, we see the church under God’s judgment. This judgment will consummate in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="45334" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>, with the judgment of Babylon the Great. As we consider this matter of God’s judgment, we need to be very conscious of what God is and of what our response should be. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DfbFTJZtA2pONOAHay_Pqwt3UUpArXNcdgjL3AzGjZb_vgfxuXqpLanr1eBBzVVPQ">THE ACCOUNT OF GOD’S<br/>PUNISHING JUDGMENT ON DAVID<br/>BEING WRITTEN AS A WARNING TO US TODAY</h2><p data-content-id="SgWLM0HBGvAAygu4IfnY_gPuraUm710M3rqBlLx4tC3Ften25qc7EACCLoR66Q6t2"> The account of God’s punishing judgment on David is <span class="pg" data-page-id="220" id="220">[220]</span> written as a warning to us today (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45335" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:11">1 Cor. 10:11</span>). We should read this account seriously in the presence of God. This account warns us that the indulgence of the flesh is a serious thing. David was tempted simply by a glance and then he failed to restrict himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="graZLPxGDPuDuvIWgEb6FawjvUy7qqPoMcigloEOnFq7h8TAnbQbhI0LUnxZDLYDW"> In contacting the opposite sex, we in the Lord’s recovery need to be sanctified and separated unto God. The evil concerning sex is very contagious. We must exercise our spirit to overcome our flesh and our old man. This must not be a mere teaching; it must be a practice in our daily life. </p>
<p data-content-id="eqxHAx-voiEWGwWaUJ3iFiiPhXyZlFNcIOYAJyhwymK2gjblcrDofftfcAHMO6D4o"> All the saints, especially the young ones, should search their hearts and make a strong resolution of heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="45336" data-verses="Judges 5:15-16">Judg. 5:15-16</span>) never to go the way of the indulgence of the flesh. Our God is living, and Christ is real. With Christ as the life-giving Spirit, everything is real, but apart from Him everything is vanity of vanities. The Spirit is moving within us in a very gentle way. We need to say, “Lord Jesus, I love You, I need You, and I receive You.” If we say this, He will be our Savior and our dynamic salvation. As the pneumatic Christ, He will save us, preserve us, and protect us from the contamination of this age, so that we may keep the glory that we have gained. </p>
