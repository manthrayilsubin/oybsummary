<p data-content-id="MT9xlpOYVla6COwA4Wy0HLxKC9tcY3I-scimi85mUkOOka2rM_yxzybdWvpROJAH9"> Zechariah was the grandson of Iddo and the son of Berechiah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60449" data-verses="Zechariah 1:1">Zech. 1:1</span>). In Hebrew the name Iddo means “at an appointed time”; the name Berechiah means “Jehovah will bless”; and the name Zechariah means “Jehovah will remember.” Hence, the total significance of these three names is that at an appointed time Jehovah will bless and Jehovah will remember. </p>

He was first a priest, and then he became a prophet. He returned to Judah with Zerubbabel at the time of the prophet Haggai (about 520 B.C.). Zechariah and Haggai encouraged the building of the temple of God under the hands of Zerubbabel and Joshua. Joshua was the high priest, representing the priesthood, and Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal family, was the governor of Judah, representing the kingship. Thus, the kingship went forth with the priesthood and built the temple of God. Even today in the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, we need both the priesthood and the kingship. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>

They had returned from Babylon to Jerusalem, but probably most of them had not returned to the Lord. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60459" data-verses="Zechariah 1:3">Verse 3</span> says, “Return to Me, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts.” Here we have a principle: first we have to return to the Lord, and then the Lord will return to us. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GKH4b9T7mJPSeQyuDr9UYBX3G6mTa7OcrcuBwDMp9rhUHPyHYqee7MSnQUntftvXc">V. THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF ZECHARIAH’S PROPHECY</h2><p data-content-id="cg68dlg4PKmLORWWl5dn86rSgeqbRGmyFKtpipS77OFi1EoNV0Cc_zdMuBQldPTGo"> The central thought of Zechariah’s prophecy is that Jehovah remembers His chastised people and sympathizes with them in their suffering of the nations’ excessive reaction to His punishment over them. For their suffering of His punishment, God sent Christ as His Angel to be with them and go with them through their captivity, who accomplished a fine redemption for their salvation. In the meantime Jehovah also raised up “craftsmen” to deal with the nations who had reacted in excess. He also gave a hearty word of consolation and promise through Zechariah, a prophet of restoration, saying that He would bring the scattered Israel back to their own country with the expectation of a time of restoration and prosperity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="YrrNtih-CK7JN0bHfYP5cbAuo67DXMnQD-SpfHOTKbXUpZ9ZppR33MANz5h-8JOse"> In this central thought there are several important factors: God’s sympathy, redemption, salvation, the Savior, the Redeemer, and the Deliverer. Because of His sympathy, God came in to console the people whom He had chastised. In this consoling work, Christ was sent to accomplish redemption for their salvation, making Christ their Savior as well as their Redeemer. In God’s redemption for salvation, Christ is the centrality. Christ came the first time to redeem God’s elect by being crucified and shedding His blood. His coming the second time will not be to redeem but to deliver God’s elect out of the hand of Antichrist and to bring in a time of restoration and prosperity. Thus Christ is also the Deliverer, making Christ the universality. In this universe we see Christ on the cross as the center, and from that center Christ is spreading Himself to the circumference. This is the universality of Christ. Ephesians tells us that this redeeming Christ who produced the Body, the church, is the One who fills all in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60460" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">1:22-23</span>). He is surely the centrality and the universality in God’s plan and in God’s redemption. </p>

<p data-content-id="el0B_4PIGJqAzDE1lTLuEw1-iE64yrd6I8HmasliT9iIevE3SjB6NpKBXs_U6ce9p"> Concerning God’s economy toward His chosen people, Isaiah reveals that all the nations are for God’s chosen people either positively or negatively. God’s real concern is for Israel, and all the nations are utilized by God for Israel’s benefit, both positively and negatively. For example, Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar was used in a negative way, whereas Medo-Persia under Cyrus was used in a positive way. Cyrus was chosen by God and was His delight. God regarded him as the shepherd of His people in their captivity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> </p>

In Daniel</h2><p data-content-id="NZwOfERH1aTXRKEMmg6tK7QNlVun5iRHAP7gamwgVZdhRV-Mhk59wWJOPp1fogAIa"> In Daniel all the nations are sovereignly under God’s heavenly ruling for Israel to be God’s witness and testimony on earth. Satan used Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Judah and to carry the Jews into captivity in Babylon. Satan’s intention was to end God’s testimony on earth with all His witnesses. But he did not realize that among these captives God had four young overcomers. Whatever Satan would do, these overcomers had a way to counter it and annul it. They overcame the demonic diet, the devilish blinding, and the seduction of idol worship. All of Satan’s devices merely resulted in God’s testimony being strengthened and uplifted through His young overcomers. Eventually, the authority to govern the land of Babylon was in the hands of Daniel and his three companions. </p>

God’s concern for Israel is seen in His dealings with all the nations. </p>

<p data-content-id="VjF2vNGjgeWWN5ha51qaAC4X5vm2SLw4bzkE16Ufc4VqkELDidkWrB57g4_8yWY0x"> The book of Isaiah unveils Christ in many items, mainly concerning Christ’s being, that is, concerning what Christ is. Regarding Christ for the people of God’s concern, in Isaiah we see that Christ is ushered in as the all-inclusive One to meet the need of the chastised Israel and of the judged nations. God is so merciful in His dealing to bring in Christ not only for Israel but also for the nations. Hence, Christ is the Savior not only of Israel but also of all the nations. </p>

In Daniel</h2><p data-content-id="18ZRcXOLDUAmDnrO5SRgpaZJpq_rpmctqxsBA6spzDMFH-aOxuvWsZNe2cvgVR5zY"> The book of Daniel reveals that Christ is the excellent One who came to be crucified for the producing of the new creation to match Him as His bride and who will come back with His bride to terminate the human government and replace it with God’s eternal kingdom. In Daniel we see that <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> Christ in His crucifixion is the landmark between God’s old creation and God’s new creation. In His appearing to the prophet, He was the excellent and precious One for the appreciation and expectation of the people of God. In His appearing to the human powers on the earth, He will end the human government and become the divine kingdom throughout the whole earth for eternity. </p>

We also see that in His humiliation He goes with them through their suffering to be their Savior in a fine and sympathetic way. </p>
<p data-content-id="T6ON5QYtRHtI-KwBvKObGCG8xxqZQGh6uakxYtCKkvVgexUodY1CtxKSBmryNXVH9"> The book of Zechariah does not stress Christ’s being or His working. Rather, it reveals Christ as the One who was sent to Israel as their King in a lowly form but was detested, sold, attacked, and pierced, and thereby accomplished redemption for them. Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was with them in their captivity. Eventually, Christ will fight for Israel and will be King over all the earth. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60493" data-verses="Revelation 6:1">Revelation 6</span> the red horse signifies war, which <span class="pg" data-page-id="8" id="8">[8]</span> always involves bloodshed, but here the red horse signifies Christ’s swift move in His redemption by the shedding of His blood. </p>

This means that He remained strongly among the captured Israel in the lowest part of the valley in their humiliation. Captured Israel was in the lowest part of the valley, and Christ was ready to do anything for them swiftly. Christ, the One on the red horse, was their patron taking care of them in their captivity. </p>

Christ was riding on a red horse, and following Him were horses of three different colors. This indicates that Christ’s redemption (the red horse) leads the repentant Israel (the reddish-brown horses) to be justified and accepted by God swiftly (the white horses). Although they were the redeemed people of God (the red horses), as the reddish-brown horses indicate, they were not that pure but were a mixture. The word <em>reddish</em> indicates redemption, and the word <em>brown</em> indicates a mixture. Eventually, as signified by the white horses, when the redeemed people of God come to God and are dealt with, they will be justified. </p>
<p data-content-id="IKa8ftyC8hI0ai0DlQurwwapIYIKJ-Nu3_V5djHJwAU4wbP0a5q_5tTVGmO-Pg47i"> This vision of the horses portrays the situation of Israel in their captivity. In the eyes of God, Christ the Redeemer was with them taking the lead, and they, God’s redeemed people, were following Him. Because they were God’s redeemed people, they appear at first sight as red horses. But <span class="pg" data-page-id="9" id="9">[9]</span> because they were not pure, they are signified also by the reddish-brown horses. They need to contact God and to be dealt with by Him in order to gain God and be justified by Him and thus become those signified by the white horses. Once they repent, they will swiftly be accepted by God and justified by Him. </p>

Here we see that the red, reddish- brown, and white horses, signifying those among Israel who were to be redeemed and brought back to God for His justification and acceptance, had been sent by Jehovah to go to and fro on the earth; and they answered the Angel of Jehovah standing among the myrtle trees that they had gone to and fro on the earth and had seen that all the earth sat still and was quiet. </p>
<p data-content-id="kT4C73PRS3fx4Bgo4uxZqEHPsYnOzxHSaoM7voKrxTC2T7bds30TyyXqHuPpWfAo9"> These verses reveal that in addition to Christ, who had been sent as the Redeemer to take care of Israel in their captivity, others had been sent by God to go through the earth to see the situation of the nations. As indicated by the movement of the horses, God’s captured people were unsettled and were without peace, rest, and the enjoyment of life. The nations, on the contrary, were sitting still and quiet. This indicates that, in the eyes of God, all the nations around Israel at that time were sitting there enjoying their life in peace and quietness while God’s elect were suffering. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60503" data-verses="Zechariah 1:17">verse 17</span> Jehovah went on to say, “My cities will again overflow with good, and Jehovah will again comfort Zion and will again choose Jerusalem.” This is the way Christ’s prayer for Israel was answered by God. </p>

After the captivity, God came back to Jerusalem to measure it for His possession. This measuring is not only to know the size but also to know the condition and the situation. The measuring was done by a Man, not by an angel. An angel is unqualified to measure anything human, because he does not have the human nature. Only Jesus, who has both the divine nature and the human nature, is qualified to measure Jerusalem. </p>

However, this verse says not that God scattered them but that He spread them. This is like the spreading of the believers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60529" data-verses="Acts 8:1">Acts 8</span>. Thousands of believers were in Jerusalem, but God was not satisfied. A persecution was raised up which scattered them. That persecution was not good, but it brought in a glorious spreading (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60530" data-verses="Acts 11:19">Acts 11:19</span>). Likewise, if the children of Israel had not been captured, God’s testimony would have been limited to the small city of Jerusalem with its temple. But when the children of Israel were scattered to Babylon, four young people became witnesses of God and a testimony for Him. In this way, God’s testimony was spread to Babylon. If God’s testimony had not come to Babylon, how could people realize that He is able to make the fire in the blazing furnace of none effect and able also to shut the mouths of lions? God is great and sovereign, and He has a broad heart. Therefore, He wanted His testimony to be spread to faraway places. </p>

It refers to after the return of the captives. In the seventy years of <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> captivity, the glory was absent from the center of Jerusalem. But when the children of Israel returned to Jerusalem, the glory also returned. Although Joshua and Zerubbabel were godly, many of the others who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon were not. Nevertheless, in the sight of God, their return was a glory. Therefore, “after the glory” means “after the return.” </p>

<p data-content-id="jKHBfNlJ4CJWDjS_Cm-rbmS3FOxqd840U1l433_ExRTTNAjBTLesiXxfypb79CEk2"> In the Old Testament, <em>Jehovah</em> is a divine title that refers to the Triune God. This is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60535" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>, where we see that Jehovah is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Although there is a distinction between the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and also between the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, this does not mean that there are three Gods. To say that there are three Gods is to fall into the heresy of tritheism. God is triune—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60536" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> tells us that God the Father chose and predestinated us, that God the Son redeemed us, and that God the Spirit sealed us. Thus we have the choosing and predestinating Father with the redeeming Son and the sealing Spirit. This is the Triune God, the three-one God. The word <em>triune</em> is composed of the Latin <em>tri,</em> meaning three, and <em>une,</em> meaning one; hence, three-one. We have one God, the unique God, but He is three-one. </p>
<p data-content-id="T6ON5QYtRHtI-KwBvKObGCG8zxqdeGh6uakxYtCKkvVgexUodY1CtxKSBmryNXVH9"> The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three separate Gods but three “hypostases...of the one same undivided and indivisible” God (Philip Schaff). The Greek word for <em>hypostasis,</em> the singular form of <em>hypostases,</em> is composed of two Greek words: <em>hupo</em> meaning “under” or “below” and <em>stasis</em> meaning “substantial support.” Hence, hypostasis refers to a support under, a support beneath, that is, something underneath that supports, a supporting substance. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead. <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> </p>

An adversary is an inward enemy. For example, if someone outside your family opposes you, that person will be your enemy. But if a member of your family opposes you, that person will be your adversary. Such an adversary is a more serious threat than an enemy. As the adversary, Satan’s intention was to put Joshua down in front of his fellows (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60568" data-verses="Zechariah 3:8">v. 8</span>) and to frustrate the rebuilding of God’s temple. </p>

Recently, as I was considering how the high priest could still be clothed with filthy garments, I was reminded how even the believers in the church could steal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60578" data-verses="Ephesians 4:28">Eph. 4:28</span>). We may not steal outwardly, but we may inwardly desire something that belongs to someone else. This is covetousness and greediness. Likewise, every day we speak a lot, and the matters we cover in our talk or gossip may be either dirty or with an evil intention to defame others. This is why we must often pray, “Lord, cleanse me. I realize that I am still filthy because I still live in the flesh, which is altogether filthy.” </p>

<p data-content-id="dQogFZMBMUCooYI2r8YQekCPkvHN3U8MkRpIjM6EbTA9pGyCSTm3ivaxeAldH-2KD"> In His charge to Joshua, Christ as the Angel of Jehovah said, “Thus says Jehovah of hosts, If you will walk in My ways and if you will keep My charge, then you will both judge My house and keep My courts, and I will grant you to walk among these standing here.” With respect to this charge, I would like to point out that in God’s administration among the people of Israel, there were three offices: the priests, the kings, and the prophets. The responsibility of the high priest was to be clear about the matters concerning God’s people and to bring these matters to God and wait on God until He enlightened him and gave him a definite answer. The enlightenment and the answer came through the Urim and the Thummim. The high priest, therefore, received God’s decision and instruction regarding various situations, and then he passed on the decision and instructions to the king, who was responsible in God’s administration to carry them out. We may compare the priest’s duty to that of those in the legislative branch of the government, and the king’s duty to that of the president in the executive branch. Just as the president is responsible for enforcing the laws passed by the legislature, so the kings in Israel were responsible for carrying out the instructions received from God by the high priest. However, sometimes both the priests and the kings were weak and inadequate. At <span class="pg" data-page-id="23" id="23">[23]</span> such times God would raise up the prophets to speak for Him. Here in Zechariah both Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the king were rather weak and somewhat discouraged. Therefore, God used Zechariah the prophet to speak for Him and to strengthen and encourage Joshua and Zerubbabel. The vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60583" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1">chapter three</span> is related to God’s decision concerning Joshua. As we will see, the vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60584" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">chapter four</span> is related to Zerubbabel and to his responsibility to carry out God’s decision to continue and complete the rebuilding of the temple. </p>

<p data-content-id="xePdQBV3KqxbtKAH9CcuDWQ0eAlz0OAK-RF2lw6zvaNmjXRa0Z-05SjBN8k9d3PSL"> The priesthood and the kingship are the two offices in God’s administration among His people. These two offices always go together as a pair and are never separated. The priesthood may be compared to the legislative branch of the government, and the kingship, to the executive branch. In God’s administration legislative matters are decided by God Himself through the Urim and the Thummim worn by the high priest. The decisions made known through the priesthood are then executed, carried out, by the kingship. </p>
<p data-content-id="NZwOfERH1aTXRKEMmg6tK7QNhVur_iRHAP7gamwgVZdhRV-Mhk59wWJOPp1fogAIa"> In the church life today, we need both the priesthood and the kingship. Through the exercise of the priesthood, we are brought into God’s presence. Through the exercise of the kingship by the older, experienced ones, the church is saved from anarchy and preserved in a good order. For the church life, we as God’s people with His administration must have both the priesthood and the kingship. </p>
<p data-content-id="t-8VGwjfZ_L7eml2LhbCAFrkH9eyGShHQKj-qGoDTFuGIuRSvfUU9FregKU8igKVY"> One function of the priesthood is to teach us how to worship God and how to have the proper remembrance of the Lord at the Lord’s table. We should not worship God or remember the Lord according to our natural concept. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60603" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> the Lord Jesus says, “God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.” This chapter also shows us that the worship God desires is that we drink of Him as the living water. The more we take God as our living water, the more we worship Him. We drink of God not by exercising our mind but by exercising our spirit. Regarding the remembrance of the Lord at the Lord’s table, we also need the instruction of the priesthood. It is crucial for us to realize that the way to remember the Lord is not to exercise our mind to recall everything He did in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection; the way to remember Him is to enjoy Him by eating and drinking of Him. As we partake of the bread and of the cup, we remember Him and worship Him. </p>

To strengthen Joshua is to strengthen the priesthood and establish it. The vision of the golden lampstand and the two olive trees in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60606" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">chapter four</span> is to strengthen Zerubbabel the governor of Judah in the kingship. Zerubbabel was not a king but a governor in the position of a king. Although Zerubbabel was not actually a king, he was nevertheless a descendant, a shoot, of the royal family of David. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60607" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1">chapter three</span> Joshua was measured, and as a result of that measuring, he was strengthened and established through the cleansing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60608" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">chapter four</span> Zerubbabel is measured so that through it he may be strengthened and established. The strengthening of Joshua in the priesthood and of Zerubbabel in the kingship are both for the rebuilding of the temple. </p>

God had chosen Israel to be a nation of priests (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60609" data-verses="Exodus 19:6">Exo. 19:6</span>). God’s intention was to use the <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> nation of Israel as a priesthood to bring the nations to God that they might enter into God’s presence to be enlightened, exposed, dealt with, and transfused by God with the divine riches. In addition, the priests were to teach the nations how to worship God and serve God. In order for the priests to do this, they would have to be familiar with God’s law and His regulations. In addition to being a nation of priests, Israel was also to be a testimony standing for God. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60610" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1">chapter three</span> we have the priesthood, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60611" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">chapter four</span>, the lampstand. </p>

These two witnesses are Moses and Elijah. Moses, representing the law, and Elijah, representing the prophets, both testify for God. The expression “the law and the prophets” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60622" data-verses="Luke 16:16">Luke 16:16</span>) refers to the Old Testament. The law is centered in Moses, and the prophets are centered in Elijah. These two, Moses and Elijah, will support and supply the persecuted Israelites and the believers during the great tribulation. </p>
<p data-content-id="AhOV6EVB9wC6Gg_qjoUWoh6YJEqiHuQ4Bzm-e92-wx3OyG796adVyR39WutHndTvy"> The nation of Israel is the lampstand, signifying God’s testimony. God’s testimony needs the shining. For this shining there must be the burning, and in order for there to be the burning, there must be the supply of olive oil. In order to have the olive oil, there must be some olive trees. The two olive trees on the two sides of the lampstand are the two sons of oil, Joshua and Zerubbabel. </p>
<p data-content-id="FfQxuZf0lfoqNVrsaqYajnw4fqDE_IwsEqUnd9nh44Io-ssLn_rMUiJWwmJaFcQle"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60623" data-verses="Zechariah 4:11">Zechariah 4:11</span> the prophet says to the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60624" data-verses="Zechariah 4:12">verse 12</span> Zechariah goes on to ask, “What are the two olive branches that are by the side of the two golden spouts, which empty the gold from themselves?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60625" data-verses="Zechariah 4:11">verse 11</span> there are two trees, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60626" data-verses="Zechariah 4:12">verse 12</span>, two branches. The two branches are part of the two trees. When the bowl of the lampstand is void of oil, the two trees will supply oil by flowing it out through the branches and into the two spouts. The oil will <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> then flow from the spouts into the bowl, and from the bowl into the lampstand. </p>
<p data-content-id="CW936gBywdNT77uyY56iyeTqTfbtDa2Ze9DpXG30LkvnEWvw0EuR1i2E3ezLO5u9D"> The relative pronoun <em>which</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60627" data-verses="Zechariah 4:12">verse 12</span> refers not to the spouts but to the branches. These branches “empty the gold from themselves.” To empty the gold is to cause the gold to flow out. The word <em>gold</em> here refers to the oil. The oil and the gold are one. The oil denotes the Spirit, and the Spirit is God. Furthermore, in typology gold signifies God. The gold that fills the bowl is the Spirit; the Spirit is God; and God is typified by gold. As we apply this matter to our experience today, we see that the Spirit who flows out of us is God, and God is gold. Thus, when we minister Christ to others, supplying them with oil, we are actually supplying them with God. God is flowing out from us into them. We all should be olive trees emptying God from ourselves into others. In this way oil will be provided to the needy by those who are olive trees out of which God is flowing. </p>

<p data-content-id="4cz5pgjqYsvlL4kW_5_xponW9oFuQtq1XQ5Z4U_5e5Or8KvWCLrxjLBKP4v96AFNe"> In the first five visions which Zechariah saw (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60653" data-verses="Zechariah 1:7">1:7—4:14</span>), God spoke a comforting, consoling, and encouraging word to Joshua, Zerubbabel, and the people. God said that He would be with them and do something through them. In this way He encouraged them not to stop the building work on the temple, but rather to continue to finish the building of the temple under the priesthood of Joshua, the high priest, and under the kingship of Zerubbabel, the governor. Whereas the first five visions were positive, the last three visions Zechariah saw (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60654" data-verses="Zechariah 5:1">5:1—6:8</span>) were negative, because they concern God’s universal judgment on the evil people and the evil on earth. These three visions are the vision of the flying scroll (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60655" data-verses="Zechariah 5:1-4">5:1-4</span>), the vision of the ephah vessel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60656" data-verses="Zechariah 5:5-11">vv. 5-11</span>), and the vision of the four chariots (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60657" data-verses="Zechariah 6:1-8">6:1-8</span>). In this message we will consider the two visions recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60658" data-verses="Zechariah 5:1">chapter five</span>. </p>

<p data-content-id="GKH4b9T7mJPSeQyuDr9UYBX3B6myX7OcrcuBwDMp9rhUHPyHYqee7MSnQUntftvXc"> “Then I lifted up my eyes again and I saw, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see a flying scroll” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60659" data-verses="Zechariah 5:1-2">5:1-2a</span>). The flying scroll signifies God’s righteous law and its justice (just judgment). Without judgment, there may be righteousness, but there will not be justice. When a particular case is subject to righteous judgment, then there will be justice. <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="a__2QbhbwY11kb5rZCobCFnpj33d6kdYW-s_vYlqkVCH6eaINgcKX_771ltYkHhrg">B.

The number two is the number for testimony, and the number ten signifies completion in fullness. Therefore, the law of God is a testimony to the whole world, and the two squares of ten cubits by ten cubits is the completion in fullness of the law. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="qfIkbAX_QNaHrQjkb8_fhBIMYYH3PcyoHv5I0QiPjMs2My0w_pQBsoQ67d79gbfWj">C.

God’s law is righteous, and this righteous law does not tolerate unrighteousness. The fact that God’s judgment is a curse indicates that it is a very serious matter. This scroll will be the base of God’s thorough judgment over all the sin on earth. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="8YMSJOSOdQ0IGgk6NJY7tTQQj0y0goaHEtRa0AILaY8mBjFAwwH6JYiv1sBtBMhql">D. The Significance of Stealing</h2><p data-content-id="0bE3Jvz_RkPcZL4WlLRbj4_uGMSMsXtIrOOgGYySL8lp-FT9odvUMZxSN3ISKmWyy"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60661" data-verses="Zechariah 5:3-4">Verses 3b and 4b</span> speak of those who steal. Stealing signifies sins toward man, which are the issue of covetousness. Stealing issues from greed and covetousness. Today is an age of stealing. Business and trade involve stealing. Everyone is greedy and full of covetousness. The apostle Paul could keep many of the Ten Commandments, but he could not fulfill the commandment concerning coveting (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60662" data-verses="Romans 7:7-8">Rom. 7:7-8</span>). </p>

The Significance of Swearing<br/>Falsely by Jehovah’s Name</h2><p data-content-id="_U4FejSse0mMB0SUO_Fjw0Ta3AteA1CTOMOoNzISdVRvs8hs4eSWG8K1rS-WN6M0U"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60663" data-verses="Zechariah 5:1">Zechariah 5</span> also speaks concerning those who swear falsely by Jehovah’s name (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60664" data-verses="Zechariah 5:3">vv. 3c</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60665" data-verses="Zechariah 5:4">4c</span>). Swearing falsely by Jehovah’s name signifies sins toward God, which are the issue of a wrong relationship with God. Those who swear falsely in this way are not honest, faithful, and sincere with God. They may claim to speak and act in the name of God, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="35" id="35">[35]</span> their claim is a falsehood. Such falsehood is surely an offense to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Bi3nL3JNoId8bjoSzrQiIdvkH4j2rUyhwiSgjcwpdozKhtqfPlo1PAoUKo2ktKefS"> The law of God given to Moses is of two sections. One section concerns the relationship between man and God, and the other concerns the relationships among men. God requires that we be right with Him and also right with other people. To be right in this way is to be righteous. Those who are not right with both God and man will suffer God’s judgment. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="xePdQBV3KqxbtKAH9CcuDWQ0dAlS3OAK-RF2lw6zvaNmjXRa0Z-05SjBN8k9d3PSL">F. God’s Judgment of Sins Reaching<br/>the House of the Sinners and Lodging There</h2><p data-content-id="rIY1WVMzRBzYAI4syOss0lsISXkIwBTZo_hwwmd6RzAjroo60_R5x7zOZbmvFd-yn"> Speaking of God’s judgment, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60666" data-verses="Zechariah 5:4">verse 4</span> says, “I will cause it to go forth, declares Jehovah of hosts; and it will enter the house of him who steals and the house of him who swears falsely by My name; and it will lodge overnight within his house and consume it, both with its timbers and its stones.” From this we see that the exercise of God’s judgment of sins will be most serious and also very thorough. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dQogFZMBMUCooYI2r8YQekCPmvHN_U8MkRpIjM6EbTA9pGyCSTm3ivaxeAldH-2KD">VII. THE VISION OF THE EPHAH VESSEL</h2><p data-content-id="QweKkYlHYG_uopmC2_Z8MTCtLa1SaOj1iDnItGckoYkE_lgIAwHejthAruTPqgONA"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60667" data-verses="Zechariah 5:5-11">Verses 5 through 11</span> describe the vision of the ephah vessel, which is the measuring vessel, a container able to hold one ephah, used for purchasing and selling in business. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="K_6Ron_bqL09Qd0HHX_h47H5Gxi7tqjX4MbCNpuYwCnE9A6M9a5Px-8RnWepepBP3">A. Its Appearance in All the Land</h2><p data-content-id="lbJDFoWg_lm39ga-wvOxQSkcVt706h_Rky-S9BDRjRQQNRIQ7LzMh7cf5fHtQc75u"> “Then the angel who spoke with me went forth and said to me, Lift up now your eyes and see what this is that goes forth. And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah vessel that goes forth; and he said, This is their appearance in all the land” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60668" data-verses="Zechariah 5:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). A large percentage of the world’s population is engaged in business or commerce. The appearance of business is not that bad; rather, in all the land commerce seems to have a proper appearance. But as we will see, actually today’s commerce is totally wicked. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="OoboRfPJlccj98VBH4cU2M5i1GeiH-Wx-5lmOhYBaOsm9nbIa4rzN5onWsGwG681m">B. A Woman Sitting within the Ephah Vessel</h2><p data-content-id="4cz5pgjqYsvlL4kW_5_xponW9oF_ctq1XQ5Z4U_5e5Or8KvWCLrxjLBKP4v96AFNe"> “This is a woman sitting within the ephah vessel. Then he said, This is Wickedness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60669" data-verses="Zechariah 5:7-8">vv. 7b-8a</span>). This reveals that the woman sitting within the ephah vessel signifies the <span class="pg" data-page-id="36" id="36">[36]</span> wickedness contained in commerce, such as covetousness, deceit, and the love of mammon. The seller loves money and tries to get money out of the buyer’s pocket; the buyer also loves money and tries to obtain the things he wants at a low price, thereby saving money. </p>
<p data-content-id="ojigeZFB43pBpSU65rimjNuugIn73ud15G-KnammzxSkd2ruVylHJ8JeqlyM8F6c3"> The vision in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60670" data-verses="Zechariah 5:1">Zechariah 5</span> corresponds to that of Babylon the Great in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60671" data-verses="Revelation 18:1">Revelation 18</span>. These visions show us that in the sight of God the wickedness contained in commerce is a kind of idolatry and fornication. Business is an adulterous woman desirous of making money. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="3AGKVBT1AB6BrUpdWsjk3g_9R6zWG2LHxqIyvUWLn9_Q5ID-ALzYs3w4fWsrm8nVt">C.

This signifies the restriction of the wickedness in commerce by God’s sovereignty. Wickedness is hidden and concealed in international trade. If commerce, especially international trade, could be restricted, the whole earth would be holy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="cg68dlg4PKmLORWWl5dn86rSneqTZGmyFKtpipS77OFi1EoNV0Cc_zdMuBQldPTGo">D. Two Women Going Forth</h2><p data-content-id="YrrNtih-CK7JN0bHfYP5cbAuv67LfMnQD-SpfHOTKbXUpZ9ZppR33MANz5h-8JOse"> “Then I lifted up my eyes and I saw, and behold, there were two women going forth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60673" data-verses="Zechariah 5:9">v. 9a</span>). The one woman becoming two women signifies the double effect of commerce once it becomes free of the restriction. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="EQTrzcX51Ise3ZOMgNxvhMAa6UX_PYCMuz-0FfUl4ec-cABu6EPto3qJzBjn8P3gk">E.

They lifted up the ephah vessel between the earth and the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60674" data-verses="Zechariah 5:9">v. 9b</span>). All this signifies the rapid spreading of the wicked commerce. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="S96XDhq6n3a4lhIP5x4Qd9LSPA6MSalp7LLK0FH6bRhfHSeyt5rlEfhTOUr3aam5a">F.

This signifies that <span class="pg" data-page-id="37" id="37">[37]</span> God’s sovereignty will cause the wickedness in business, which the people of Israel learned of the Babylonians in their captivity, to go back to Babylon (the land of Shinar).

We must be right with both God and man; otherwise, we will suffer God’s judgment. The vision of the ephah vessel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60680" data-verses="Zechariah 5:5-11">vv. 5-11</span>) shows us that the most evil thing on earth is commerce. Apparently commerce is something good, but actually it is evil, full of wickedness. In this message we will go on to consider the two matters revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60681" data-verses="Zechariah 6:1">chapter six</span>: the vision of the four chariots (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60682" data-verses="Zechariah 6:1-8">vv. 1-8</span>) and the concluding word to confirm the eight visions in this book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60683" data-verses="Zechariah 6:9-15">vv. 9-15</span>). </p>

These four chariots signify the four winds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60686" data-verses="Zechariah 6:4-8">vv. 4-8</span>) from the four corners of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60687" data-verses="Revelation 7:1-3">Rev. 7:1-3</span>) for God’s judgment of sins upon the earth. These four winds are used by God to carry out His administration in the entire universe. In particular, they are used by God to carry out His judgment, not mainly on people but on nations, governments, and kingdoms. <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> </p>

Then God prepared four “craftsmen” to destroy these four horns. The first of these craftsmen was the Persian Empire, sovereignly used by God to destroy Babylon, the first horn. Persia was a great empire; its territory stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean. Surely it was not easy for anyone to conquer that vast empire. But Alexander the Great, a young man, came and swiftly defeated all of the Persian Empire.

Prior to the time of Zechariah, no one had held both offices, for the priesthood is of the tribe of Levi and of the family of Aaron, and the kingship is of the tribe of Judah and of the family of David.

When He comes, He will put the priesthood and the kingship together on His shoulders. In all of history He is the only person who is qualified to bear the responsibilities of these two offices in God’s administration. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60704" data-verses="Hebrews 7:1">Hebrews 7</span> Christ is both the High Priest and the King, as typified by Melchizedek. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60705" data-verses="Genesis 14:1">Genesis 14</span> Melchizedek was first a king, and then he came as a priest to Abraham, ministering the bread and the wine.

In the one thousand years of the kingdom, after the Jews are saved at the Lord’s coming back, they will become the priests to teach all the repentant nations. </p>

<p class="scripture" data-content-id="mS5TPzZ6-ynMM3hihSYE2Ujt1YYur178zyKIYJuGMQBoB_quN4h8HBlIlFqDKBowu">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60750" data-verses="Zechariah 9:1">Zech. 9</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Z45nQkUays0G-jX_UfNpUrv4bHrdK_5uiYzrtMNbU-2ol8AMhQyZa2B1bQ8Vzdgf6"> Zechariah’s burden was to help the returned people of Israel to see God’s purpose. At that time God’s purpose was to recover the temple as the center of His interest. Through Zechariah the Lord seemed to be saying to them, “I do not want your fasting and weeping. Forget about these things. I would even ask you to forget what I did in the past to deal with you. You need to know what I want you to do today. I want you to realize that My desire is that the temple would be built up by My people to be the center and reality of My interest on earth.” Today God’s intention, His desire, is that we would be one with Him. He has brought us back to the very site, to the ground, even to the foundation of the temple. God wants us to see that His interest, desire, and burden are to finish the building of this temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="AhOV6EVB9wC6Gg_qjoUWoh6YFEq3EuQ4Bzm-e92-wx3OyG796adVyR39WutHndTvy"> God has a burden. This burden is that He may gain a people in this age to know His heart, to realize His desire, and to be one with Him to build up the Body of Christ. This is what God wants. God’s desire is related to His economy. God’s economy is to have Christ as everything, to have Him as the center and the circumference, the centrality and the universality, of God’s move on this earth. We all need to see this. </p>
<p data-content-id="FfQxuZf0lfoqNVrsaqYajnw4TqDp1IwsEqUnd9nh44Io-ssLn_rMUiJWwmJaFcQle"> Throughout the book of Zechariah Christ is revealed. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60751" data-verses="Zechariah 1:1">chapter one</span> we see Christ as the Man riding on a red horse to take care of God’s suffering people; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60752" data-verses="Zechariah 2:1">chapter two</span>, as the One who is measuring Jerusalem; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60753" data-verses="Zechariah 3:1">chapter three</span>, as the One, the High Priest, typified by Joshua the high priest and signified by the stone with seven eyes; in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60754" data-verses="Zechariah 4:1">chapter four</span>, as the One, <span class="pg" data-page-id="52" id="52">[52]</span> the real King, typified by Zerubbabel; and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60755" data-verses="Zechariah 6:1">chapter six</span>, as the unique One who is qualified to bear the office of both the priesthood and the kingship for the consummation of the building up of God’s temple. Now we must go on to see that this all-inclusive Christ is altogether wrapped up with human history. Human history from Adam to the last person of the human race is nothing without Christ. However, according to God’s economy, Christ is intimately involved with human history. This means that Christ is wrapped up with every crucial aspect of the four empires signified by the great human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60756" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>. As we will see, the Christ revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60757" data-verses="Zechariah 9:1">Zechariah 9—14</span> is a Christ who is involved with human history in a fine, particular, and even intimate way. </p>
<p data-content-id="CW936gBywdNT77uyY56iyeTqffbEIa2Ze9DpXG30LkvnEWvw0EuR1i2E3ezLO5u9D"> The visions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60758" data-verses="Zechariah 1:1">chapters one through six</span> of Zechariah were mainly for consolation to the children of Israel, whereas the prophecies in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60759" data-verses="Zechariah 9:1">chapters nine through fourteen</span> are mainly for their encouragement. Without Christ there is neither consolation nor encouragement. The consolation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60760" data-verses="Zechariah 1:1">Zechariah 1—6</span> is Christ, and the encouragement in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60761" data-verses="Zechariah 9:1">Zechariah 9—14</span> is also Christ. In this message we will consider the first of the prophecies of encouragement. </p>

Although Alexander, a mighty king, caused damage to so many nations around Judah, he did not cause much damage to Judah and Jerusalem, and he did not damage the temple at all. </p>

This means that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60771" data-verses="Zechariah 9:11">verse 11</span> is actually the continuation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60772" data-verses="Zechariah 9:8">verse 8</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60773" data-verses="Zechariah 9:9">Verse 9</span> says, “Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; / Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! / Now your King comes to you. / He is righteous and bears salvation; / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey.” This reveals that Christ would come in a righteous way with salvation for us and that He would ride upon a donkey, even a colt of a donkey. This verse was fulfilled in the four Gospels when Jesus Christ came into Jerusalem the last time. He came as a King, but as a lowly King, a humiliated King, riding not on a majestic horse but on a colt. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="pFyYVVZOin3cxCPsv5BXio9Zs_iINS2-WB9RdnlQX-c34_avtfIbhWP5ZN-shywBc">D. The Millennial Kingdom as a Time of Restoration</h2><p data-content-id="v4CRZ6qWy_djFaryQtO6xJVhXNBhAF5SS8WBskoLDPdbnFHS90x4fr2XX4FNq1NJK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60774" data-verses="Zechariah 9:10">Verse 10</span> says, “I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim / And the horse from Jerusalem, / And the battle bow will be cut off; / And He will speak peace unto the nations, / And His dominion will be from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth.” This refers to the millennial kingdom, which will be a time of restoration. In the millennial kingdom God will stop all the fighting. This word concerning the kingdom surely must have been a comfort and an encouragement to the people of Israel. <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="WUAYS7LUIBnwhMV-0DoTSSy5KE4DfbOWZdFm-dP7rF_1s_eMOTLld2AF4iQLJsOuq"> The sequence in this chapter is very meaningful. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60775" data-verses="Zechariah 9:1-7">Verses 1 through 7</span> speak concerning the damage and devastation Alexander the Great caused to the nations surrounding Judah. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60776" data-verses="Zechariah 9:8">verse 8</span> continues to say that the Lord Himself encamped around His temple within the holy city. This saved Judah with Jerusalem and the temple from the devastation of Alexander. Jerusalem and the temple were spared and saved from the devastation of the enemy. That was a good deliverance and a sign of the coming restoration. However, the coming restoration needs the coming of Christ. For this reason, after the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60777" data-verses="Zechariah 9:8">verse 8</span> concerning the deliverance of Jerusalem and the temple, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60778" data-verses="Zechariah 9:9">verse 9</span> says that Christ is coming, being righteous and bearing salvation. Eventually, the situation was right and fitting for Christ’s coming, and He came in humility, and also in an intimate manner, riding upon a donkey. </p>
<p data-content-id="2tH9nL88srA-qztm7ilsog_xkOqVECfqJEekUQJI6UTkgS_ixbdIKR1kz-PuVJsho"> What should be the issue of Christ’s coming? As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60779" data-verses="Zechariah 9:10">verse 10</span> indicates, after His coming peace and restoration should be here, and God’s dominion should also be here. In the restoration the first item is peace: “He will speak peace unto the nations.” The second item is dominion: “His dominion will be from sea to sea.” </p>
<p data-content-id="uxTnQuuK7xL42uIwcZvpd2vztxyGLBeDZOiGwc-CAtEyA1L5PipNdAC0fJeNpdrZe"> However, when Christ came the first time, He was only welcomed a little and was ultimately rejected, detested to the uttermost, and put to death by being crucified. Regarding His rejection by the children of Israel, the Lord Jesus said, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house is left to you desolate” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60780" data-verses="Matthew 23:37-38">Matt. 23:37-38</span>). The word <em>house</em> denotes the house of God, which was the temple. It was the house of God, but here it is called “your house.” The house of God had become their house, and it would be utterly destroyed by Titus in A.D. 70 (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60781" data-verses="Matthew 24:2">Matt. 24:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="fAiRuFHleLaeremHcIwwULqgZhklJ0baj1zG7c0TrXWszLTLUmEpgMV2sYU0hJZY4"> Because the children of Israel rejected Christ the King, the restoration was somewhat suspended, and a time of judgment over the children of Israel entered in, which has lasted about twenty centuries. Therefore, Christ needs to come <span class="pg" data-page-id="55" id="55">[55]</span> a second time, this time not riding a donkey but coming as lightning (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60782" data-verses="Matthew 24:27">Matt. 24:27</span>). Then peace and the eternal kingdom, as God’s dominion, will be on the earth from sea to sea. This is the sequence according to the spiritual significance. </p>

As we will see, this loving visitation is actually Christ’s coming to Israel. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Hue8CqynBCycJVgbCvbM77i1Oydxduypjhnzh_7qQglg4OcfhQFQxVF5-F-zdEuki">A.

The word <em>rain</em> here signifies blessing. To ask for more rain is to seek more blessing. Thus, in this verse the Lord is encouraging the children of Israel to seek more blessings while He would be favorable to them. While the Lord is so favorable to us, we should ask Him to send us even more favor. Since God is giving us showers of rain, we should ask Him for more rain. This indicates that we all need to pray for the Lord’s abundant blessing. </p>

All those false gods and all the diviners spoke vanity and false dreams; they comforted in vain. Therefore, the people wandered like sheep. They were afflicted because there was no shepherd. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60804" data-verses="Zechariah 10:3">Verse 3</span> tells us that the Lord’s anger was kindled against the shepherds and that He would punish the male goats.

God came to His people in such a gracious way to visit them. His visiting them was Christ’s coming to them. He came in the man, Jesus. Of course, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60810" data-verses="Zechariah 10:1">chapter ten</span> does not mention the name Jesus Christ or Messiah, but the word <em>visited</em> here should be understood as Christ’s coming.

In the New Testament the Lord Jesus likened Himself to a shepherd. He came as the real Shepherd and blamed the other shepherds, who were the elders, the scribes, and the priests.

I can testify from my experience that when we enjoy the Lord’s loving visitation, our situation is exactly like that of God’s people described in this chapter. Often after we enjoy such a loving visitation, our situation changes. In His visitation He encourages us to seek more blessings. We are little lambs, but after His loving visitation, we become horses. We are not that bold or strong, but after the Lord’s visitation with His dear touch, we are strengthened to become horses of majesty in battle. Eventually, the Lord strengthens us in Himself so that we may walk about in His name. </p>

Jehovah as Jesus came to feed His people, who were about to be slaughtered, the afflicted of the flock. </p>
<p data-content-id="fAiRuFHleLaeremHcIwwULqkRhkpP0baj1zG7c0TrXWszLTLUmEpgMV2sYU0hJZY4"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60835" data-verses="Zechariah 11:7-11">Verses 7b through 11</span> say, “And I took to myself two staffs; one I called Favor, and the other I called Bonds; and I fed the flock. Then I destroyed the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also detested me. Then I said, I will not feed you. What is to die will die, and what is to be destroyed will be destroyed, and those who are left will each eat one another’s flesh. And I took my staff, Favor, and I broke it in pieces so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. And it was broken in that day; and thus the afflicted of the flock, who watched me, knew that it was the word of Jehovah.” Here we see that Jehovah as Jesus brought two staffs—Favor and Bonds. Favor means grace, and Bonds means to be bound into oneness. Then Jehovah as Jesus set aside the three shepherds—the priests, the elders, and the scribes. He destroyed them, and their souls detested Him. The Lord Jesus as the proper Shepherd was rejected, leaving the children of Israel as a flock without any shepherd (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60836" data-verses="John 10:11">John 10:11</span>). With respect to Israel’s being without a shepherd, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60837" data-verses="Matthew 9:36">Matthew 9:36</span> says, “Seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd.” Furthermore, He broke the staff, Favor (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60838" data-verses="Zechariah 11:10">Zech. 11:10</span>). This indicates that He broke the covenant which God made through Moses, leaving the people without a covenant to cover them. He thus took away the grace (Favor). </p>

As a result, the nation was divided and full of inner fighting (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60840" data-verses="Zechariah 11:9">v. 9</span>). From the day of Christ’s crucifixion, <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> there has not been any oneness among the Jews. Although those in the northern kingdom, Israel, and the southern kingdom, Judah, were brothers, the brotherhood among them has been broken because the binding love has been broken. This took place as they were living under the oppression of the Roman Empire. </p>

So they weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver. And Jehovah said to me, Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price that I am priced with by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter, into the house of Jehovah.” This clearly indicates that Christ was detested, attacked, rejected, and sold. In order to understand these verses and know who provided the silver and who threw it into the house of Jehovah, we need to study the four Gospels. </p>

This means that after the crucifixion of Christ, there was no proper leadership among them. They fought with one another, devouring one another. The foolish, worthless shepherds who rose up among them caused them further suffering. This kind of situation allowed Titus to come in to devastate the entire country of Judah. <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> </p>

The Lord Jesus Himself lived under the reign of the Roman rulers; He lived under the reign of Caesar, the highest ruler, and also under the reign of Herod and Pilate, who were subordinate rulers. Under this reign, He, the real and proper Shepherd, was detested, rejected, attacked, sold, and crucified. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60845" data-verses="Matthew 26:31">Matthew 26:31</span>, a quotation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60846" data-verses="Zechariah 13:7">Zechariah 13:7</span>, says, “I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.” When Christ, the Shepherd, was put to the cross, all the sheep of His flock were scattered. </p>

The center of the prophecies in these chapters is Christ as the rejected Messiah. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60848" data-verses="Zechariah 9:1">chapter nine</span> Christ came and entered into Jerusalem as the King in a lowly form. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60849" data-verses="Zechariah 10:1">chapter ten</span> reveals this kind, intimate, and gentle One as the Shepherd coming in His loving visitation to Israel. When He was thirty years of age, He came forth to shepherd the people. During the three and a half years of His ministry on earth, He ministered the spiritual supply to God’s chosen people. The time of His ministry was a time of shepherding, and many were helped by His shepherding. However, because His help became so popular, the elders, scribes, and priests became jealous. In their jealousy they arrested Jesus through Judas’s betrayal of Him. Following this, He was judged first by the high priest according to God’s law and then by the rulers of the Roman government, Herod and Pilate, according to Roman law. The Lord Jesus was altogether justified. Pilate told the Jews that he could not find anything wrong with Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60850" data-verses="John 18:38">John 18:38</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60851" data-verses="John 19:4">19:4</span>), but they would not listen to him, and their voices overcame him. “When therefore the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I do not find fault in Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60852" data-verses="John 19:6">John 19:6</span>). Instead of acting justly, Pilate delivered Jesus into the hands of the Jews. They then took Jesus and led Him away to a place called Golgotha, and there they crucified Him. They rejected their King to the uttermost. </p>

If they had been ready, they would have welcomed Him. Then the kingdom of the heavens would have been set up on earth, and the time of restoration would have come. It should have happened in this way, but because of Israel’s rejection of Christ, it did not. If we realize this, then we will understand what is revealed concerning Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60853" data-verses="Zechariah 9:1">Zechariah 9—11</span>. </p>

In this message we will consider the prophecy of encouragement regarding Israel’s destiny in the great war of Armageddon. However, first I would like to give a word concerning the significance of the human spirit as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60868" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">12:1</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="lbJDFoWg_lm39ga-wvOxQSkYRt7d0h_Rky-S9BDRjRQQNRIQ7LzMh7cf5fHtQc75u"> This verse says, “The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.” The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit that he may contact God, receive God, live God, fulfill God’s purpose for God, and be one with God. It is marvelous <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> that such a verse as this is in an Old Testament book which unveils a Christ who is so involved with human history and politics. This indicates that in His economy God planned to have Christ as the centrality and universality of His move on earth. As the very God, He has ruled over the entire human race, managing the world situation age after age for thousands of years. For His chosen people, who would care for Him as the Creator and as the Redeemer, there was the need for Him to create a receiver so that they would have the capacity to receive all that God had planned for Christ to be. Christ is wonderful, but if we did not have a spirit, how could we receive Him? Today in every circle of society, people do not exercise their spirit. Even in religious circles, the matter of the human spirit is neglected or even opposed and denied. If we neglect our human spirit, there is no way for us to contact God. </p>
<p data-content-id="OoboRfPJlccj98VBH4cU2M5mxGePI-Wx-5lmOhYBaOsm9nbIa4rzN5onWsGwG681m"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60869" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span> the Lord Jesus said clearly that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit. This is the basic principle. To worship God is just to contact God, to receive God, to enjoy God, and to experience God. However, very few among the human race today know that God is a Spirit and that we have been created by God with a spirit. God has ordained that we should contact Him and receive Him by the exercise of our human spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="S96XDhq6n3a4lhIP5x4Qd9LWLA6EWalp7LLK0FH6bRhfHSeyt5rlEfhTOUr3aam5a"> In God’s creation there are principles. For instance, if we want to see different colors, we must use our eyes. Suppose I were blind. Could I hear the colors? Could I smell them? Certainly not! In order to see colors, we must use the proper organ. The principle is the same in relation to us and God. God is real, yet some dare to say that there is no God. Of course, if we do not exercise our spirit, surely there is no God to us. We cannot touch God by means of our physical body. Neither can we realize Him by our mentality, by our mind, for this is not the proper organ to use in contacting God. God is Spirit. If we would worship Him, contacting Him and receiving Him, we must exercise our spirit. Thank God that in His creation He made three crucial, equally important matters—the heavens, the earth, and our spirit. Our spirit, therefore, is as crucial, as important, as the heavens and the earth. <span class="pg" data-page-id="69" id="69">[69]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="gtSZFFm57gMSdGNgHFUWDotx1AD5o3uuX7MMCeaaRWLjpc2bv_tS13LoCAnt_CaD1"> Zechariah is a book unveiling Christ as God’s center and circumference, yet this Christ is intimately involved with human history. Not just anyone can know this One, but God’s chosen people who realize that they have a spirit can know Him. In reading the book of Zechariah and in contacting the Christ revealed in this book, we must first know that we have a spirit. Then we need to exercise our spirit to pray, saying, “Lord, I want to gain the Christ who is unveiled in Zechariah.” If we exercise our spirit in this way, we will sense something living touching us deep within. This is why there is in this book such a verse as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60870" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">12:1</span>, a verse that charges us to pay full attention to the receiver within us, our human spirit, that we may receive the Christ revealed in the book of Zechariah. </p>
<p data-content-id="el0B_4PIGJqAzDE1lTLuEw16hE600rd6I8HmasliT9iIevE3SjB6NpKBXs_U6ce9p"> God’s purpose is for us to receive Christ. However, Christ is complex in all that He is. He is all-inclusive, because He is so many items. Furthermore, this all-inclusive Christ is very involved with history, politics, and governments. How can we understand such a One? The only way is, after reading and studying, to turn ourselves to prayer. When we turn ourselves to prayer, we exercise our spirit. At that moment, Christ imparts Himself into us. This is the heavenly, divine dispensing. Through this dispensing we receive Christ as our life, our light, our patience, our love, our everything. </p>
<p data-content-id="5oo0RfiDN9ySM3x71Ajlz2xh66Z-rP3wRjm-H6aFwBXLa_Fsw8JXlQQqPM0FNorlo"> Though Zechariah was a young man, he knew the secret of contacting God to receive what God has revealed. We all need to learn of him to exercise our spirit to receive God and to receive what He has revealed. </p>

Satan has his followers, and God has His saints. For thousands of years, Satan has been exercising his devices to gain people for his army.

Antichrist, the embodiment of Satan, will be the commander of Satan’s army, and Christ, the embodiment of God, will be the Commander of God’s army. Thus, on the one hand, it will be a devilish war; on the other hand, it will be a divine war. In this divine war, Christ will destroy Antichrist “by the breath of His mouth” and bring him to nothing “by the manifestation of His coming” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60890" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:8">2 Thes. 2:8</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="71" id="71">[71]</span>).

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60915" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span> there was the participation in the divine power through the Holy Spirit, but there was not that much enjoyment of the Triune God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60916" data-verses="Acts 2:1">Acts 2</span>, at the beginning of the age of grace, the church age, the Spirit was mainly the Spirit of power.

They suffered the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 and were scattered to other countries. In these other countries they continued to suffer persecution. Today most of the Jews remain in dispersion, but many are returning to the nation of Israel. At the time of Antichrist, two-thirds in all the land of Israel will be slaughtered (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60918" data-verses="Zechariah 13:8-9">13:8-9a</span>).

At this juncture they will repent, because they have lost their taste <span class="pg" data-page-id="77" id="77">[77]</span> for everything. The Holy Spirit will be poured out upon them, and they will follow their spirit to be fully occupied with God. I believe that because they will have learned that everything apart from God is vanity and because they will exercise their spirit, the pouring out of the Spirit of God upon them will be intensified. The Jews on the day of Pentecost were stubborn and hard. Hence, the Spirit of power was poured out to inspire them to repent. But the inhabitants of Jerusalem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60921" data-verses="Zechariah 12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span> will have already repented; therefore, the Spirit of grace will be poured out upon them so that they can receive the Triune God as their enjoyment. </p>

<p data-content-id="0bE3Jvz_RkPcZL4WlLRbj4_qDMSMgXtIrOOgGYySL8lp-FT9odvUMZxSN3ISKmWyy"> The repentant Jews will look upon the One whom they have pierced.

Repentant Israel will wail over Christ as the only Son of God and will cry bitterly over Him as the firstborn Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Bi3nL3JNoId8bjoSzrQiIdvgC4j6hUyhwiSgjcwpdozKhtqfPlo1PAoUKo2ktKefS"> In the New Testament Christ is revealed first as the only begotten Son of God and then as the firstborn Son of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60925" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span> says that the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60926" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> tells us that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. Through His death and resurrection, the only begotten Son became the <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> firstborn Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60927" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60928" data-verses="Hebrews 1:6">Heb. 1:6a</span>). According to the New Testament, Christ’s being the only begotten Son is for us to be redeemed and to receive eternal life. Christ’s becoming the firstborn Son through death and resurrection is for us to become sons of God as heirs to inherit all the riches of what God is, that is, to receive, participate in, and enjoy all the riches of the Triune God. In their repentance Israel will recognize Christ both as the only begotten Son of God and as the firstborn Son of God. They will realize that as the only begotten Son Christ has redeemed them and has brought them eternal life and that as the firstborn Son He has made them heirs to inherit the riches of the Triune God as their enjoyment. </p>

Zechariah uses these families as illustrations. All those who look upon Christ, the pierced One, with a repentant spirit, will wail over Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="RvCAgVmk7Pubw8sqRV_vPhnY_uTwEwgn_iM-kYShNcAKpCasd_ehs4gOSRkYOvmTg"> The book of Zechariah reveals that Christ is wonderful and that He is the centrality and universality of God’s economy. But how can we receive such a Christ? The means and the instrument by which we can receive Christ is our human spirit. In this message, therefore, I would like to give a word concerning the human spirit and the Christ unveiled in Zechariah. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="sYLiVwOrolRGXPe6UAA48xXhat9MRO4b6IBGmv4U3lGqROK1HOmiBq7FTdmPb7kPm">SISTER VERSES IN ZECHARIAH AND ISAIAH</h2><p data-content-id="wpDqoNbRwQ5_H5Gcr0bOc6DOu0OaZ8TEt7BtxmGQ3SlWD7Krxxjvt4t2RtazkHoax"> In the books of Zechariah and Isaiah, both of which have much to say about Christ, there are sister verses that speak clearly regarding the human spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61029" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span> says, “Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.” This reveals that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit that he may contact God, receive God, live God, fulfill God’s purpose for God, and be one with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="LuBUZ_Zf8mQW_Z3d8hzlCRbLucUHrQly7u1OIptEfpE5FRMvzMGirV-pL297gQK-z"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61030" data-verses="Isaiah 42:5">Isaiah 42:5</span> is a sister verse to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61031" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span>. “Thus says God Jehovah, / Who created the heavens and stretched them out, / Who spread forth the earth and what springs up from it, / Who gives breath to the people upon it / And spirit to those who walk on it.” The Hebrew word translated <em>breath</em> here can also be rendered <em>spirit</em> (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61032" data-verses="Proverbs 20:27">Prov. 20:27</span>). These sister verses both mention three matters: the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit. Whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61033" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span> speaks of <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> God’s forming the human spirit, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61034" data-verses="Isaiah 42:5">Isaiah 42:5</span> simply speaks of God’s giving a spirit to man. </p>
<p data-content-id="mS5TPzZ6-ynMM3hihSYE2Ujp5YYer178zyKIYJuGMQBoB_quN4h8HBlIlFqDKBowu"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61035" data-verses="Isaiah 42:6">Verse 6</span> goes on to speak concerning God’s purpose in giving man a spirit. “I am Jehovah; I have called You in righteousness; / I have held You by the hand; / I have kept You and I have given You / As a covenant for the people, as a light for the nations.” Here we see that God intends to give His Son Christ to us as a covenant and as a light to the nations. Such a Christ is wonderful, but unless we can receive Him, He does not have anything to do with us. In order to receive this Christ, we must have a receiver within us, and this receiver is our human spirit. God has given us a spirit so that we can receive, partake of, participate in, and enjoy Christ as the covenant and as the light. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="8YMSJOSOdQ0IGgk6NJY7tTQUg0y0koaHEtRa0AILaY8mBjFAwwH6JYiv1sBtBMhql">WORSHIPPING GOD IN SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="0bE3Jvz_RkPcZL4WlLRbj4_qFMSMoXtIrOOgGYySL8lp-FT9odvUMZxSN3ISKmWyy"> At this point I would like to remind you of the Lord’s conversation with the Samaritan woman in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61036" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span>. The Lord Jesus said to her, “Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61037" data-verses="John 4:14">v. 14</span>). When she asked Him to give her this water, He told her to go and call her husband (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61038" data-verses="John 4:15-16">vv. 15-16</span>). His intention was to help her to know her sins. However, she immediately turned the conversation to the matter of worship, saying, “Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61039" data-verses="John 4:20">v. 20</span>). The Lord Jesus replied, “An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father....But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness....God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61040" data-verses="John 4:21">vv. 21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61041" data-verses="John 4:23-24">23-24</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61042" data-verses="John 4:24">John 4:24</span>, a wonderful verse, matches <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61043" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61044" data-verses="Isaiah 42:5">Isaiah 42:5</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="7pmZQPXqYj39HatD1d5-FfV1nA1qhC4MvkyFl-J0nvO98vay28-9GXEcDfBVsQgT0"> In His word to the Samaritan woman, the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, “Woman, you do not know what it is to worship God. The real worship of God is not on a mountain or in Jerusalem—it is in your spirit. Only by using your spirit <span class="pg" data-page-id="93" id="93">[93]</span> can you touch God. I am your God, and I am here as living water for you to drink of Me. The way to drink this living water is to exercise your spirit. This is what it means to worship the Father.” God has given us a spirit that we may worship Him by drinking of Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="_U4FejSse0mMB0SUO_Fjw0Te0AteE1CTOMOoNzISdVRvs8hs4eSWG8K1rS-WN6M0U">THE LORD BEING WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="Bi3nL3JNoId8bjoSzrQiIdvgE4j2nUyhwiSgjcwpdozKhtqfPlo1PAoUKo2ktKefS"> Another crucial verse concerning the human spirit is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61045" data-verses="2Timothy 4:22">2 Timothy 4:22</span>. “The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.” This verse does not say that the Lord is with our mind or soul or heart; it tells us that He is with our <em>spirit.</em> Deep within, in the center of our being, we have a particular organ—the human spirit—created by God for the purpose of receiving Him and containing Him. We all, especially the young people, need to see that today the Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xePdQBV3KqxbtKAH9CcuDWQweAlS7OAK-RF2lw6zvaNmjXRa0Z-05SjBN8k9d3PSL">OUR SPIRIT AND THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="rIY1WVMzRBzYAI4syOss0lsMRXkE2BTZo_hwwmd6RzAjroo60_R5x7zOZbmvFd-yn"> Our regenerated human spirit matches Christ, who is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61046" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). Regarding this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61047" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zechariah 3:9</span> says, “This is the stone that I have set before Joshua: upon one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.” This stone which has been engraved with God’s engraving to take away the sin of God’s people is Christ. The seven eyes of the stone are “the eyes of Jehovah running to and fro on the whole earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61048" data-verses="Zechariah 4:10">4:10</span>). In order to understand the significance of the seven eyes, we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61049" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>. “I saw...a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.” The Lamb here, who is the stone in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61050" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">Zechariah 3:9</span>, is Christ, and the seven eyes are the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Thus, the Christ who has been engraved by God to take away our sin bears the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Actually, He, the last Adam, has become a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61051" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>), even the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Christ today is the Spirit, and we have a spirit particularly formed by God to match Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="dQogFZMBMUCooYI2r8YQekCLlvHB5U8MkRpIjM6EbTA9pGyCSTm3ivaxeAldH-2KD"> Let us now go on to consider the Christ who is unveiled in the book of Zechariah. In the first part of this book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61052" data-verses="Zechariah 1:1">chs. 1—6</span>), there are five visions concerning Christ, and in the last part (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61053" data-verses="Zechariah 9:1">chs. 9—14</span>), many details concerning Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QweKkYlHYG_uopmC2_Z8MTCpIa1eQOj1iDnItGckoYkE_lgIAwHejthAruTPqgONA">VISIONS CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="K_6Ron_bqL09Qd0HHX_h47H9Fxi3nqjX4MbCNpuYwCnE9A6M9a5Px-8RnWepepBP3"> In the first of the five visions concerning Christ, Christ is unveiled as the Man as the Angel of Jehovah riding on a red horse and standing among the myrtle trees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61054" data-verses="Zechariah 1:7-17">1:7-17</span>). The myrtle trees signify the humiliated yet precious people of Israel in their captivity. Christ’s riding on a red horse indicates that He was the redeeming One. His being the Angel of Jehovah indicates that He was the One sent by God to take care of His people with much expectation while they were in captivity. </p>
<p data-content-id="lbJDFoWg_lm39ga-wvOxQSkYWt70-h_Rky-S9BDRjRQQNRIQ7LzMh7cf5fHtQc75u"> In the second vision (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61055" data-verses="Zechariah 1:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>) Christ is the last Craftsman used by God to break the four horns—Babylon, Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire—which damaged and destroyed the chosen people of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61056" data-verses="Zechariah 1:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>). Christ will be the unique One not only to break the four horns but also to smash the entire human government from the toes to the head, as signified by the great human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61057" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="OoboRfPJlccj98VBH4cU2M5m2GeiD-Wx-5lmOhYBaOsm9nbIa4rzN5onWsGwG681m"> In the next vision Christ is the One who measures Jerusalem in order to possess it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61058" data-verses="Zechariah 2:1-2">Zech. 2:1-2</span>). This One not only possesses Jerusalem but also becomes the center of Jerusalem as the glory within her and the circumference of Jerusalem as the wall of fire round about her (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61059" data-verses="Zechariah 2:5">v. 5</span>). Furthermore, He is both the sending One and the sent One. He, Jehovah of hosts, has sent Himself as the Angel of Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61060" data-verses="Zechariah 2:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61061" data-verses="Zechariah 2:11">11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="4cz5pgjqYsvlL4kW_5_xponS-oF_Ytq1XQ5Z4U_5e5Or8KvWCLrxjLBKP4v96AFNe"> In the fourth vision Christ is unveiled as the topstone of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="61062" data-verses="Zechariah 4:7">4:7</span>). As indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="61063" data-verses="Zechariah 3:9">3:9</span>, upon this stone are seven eyes, signifying the seven Spirits, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Christ is therefore the topstone of grace to consummate God’s building with the sevenfold intensified Spirit. </p>
