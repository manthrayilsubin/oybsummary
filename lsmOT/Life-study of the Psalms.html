<p data-content-id="-vxlXU6cmTLDZeIgsltRkW7I4fk9PR4omIpgyX1cWz_fCQS9vCp2fzq9vYNGAYAbP"> 1) The economy of God is to bring forth an organism for His Divine Trinity. </p>

<p data-content-id="WtbcvCEgnrqy-dE42XrsEQcrThMyCDtcObPJRXsB2bnNVrU4zObvTu4Y4s7w2TT6w"> 4) The issue of the experience of grace in the economy of God is the organic Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="RF99mNghJcAjqAzGSAkwd2VDWbTnyYTK8F_bH0457aEcoqMtCJBP6MvoDLWTtZiuq"> I praise the Lord for His sovereign arrangement in allowing us to have this conference with these four main points before we begin our life-study of the Psalms. In the Psalms we will see these four main points. </p>
<p data-content-id="swd5PZucw8Weq5orQKdZ2kqo2pmNj9flJYCofaCPSu3vPBuDVlmeBwHc2dDffPws_"> The first psalm is concerning the law. David did not know the real function of the law. He likened himself, as one who delighted in the law, to a tree growing beside streams of water and flourishing all the time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48295" data-verses="Psalms 1:3">v. 3</span>). But after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48296" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>, there is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48297" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> concerning Christ. Then there is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48298" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalm 3</span>. The heading of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48299" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalm 3</span> says, “A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.” The one who enjoyed the law as the streams of water by which he grew became a kind of exile due to the rebellion of his son. This happened to David because of his murder of Uriah and his taking of Uriah’s wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48300" data-verses="2Samuel 12:10-12">2 Sam. 12:10-12</span>). The one who enjoyed the law so much in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48301" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> became an intentional murderer. Does this show that the law works? The law does work, but not in David’s way. The law <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> works to expose us. The law exposed David to the uttermost as one who conspired to kill Uriah and rob Uriah of his wife. Does the law work or not? We have to say that the law works, not according to David’s concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48302" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>, but according to the apostle Paul’s teaching in the New Testament. Paul pointed out that the law was something added to the central line of the divine revelation to expose man’s sinful nature and wicked deeds (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48303" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Rom. 3:20b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48304" data-verses="Romans 5:20">5:20a</span>). We need this view of the law in order to understand the Psalms according to the divine concept in the New Testament. We are not in the Old Testament as David was, but we are in the New Testament. </p>

<p data-content-id="fV0aAyMXuYdaoZynkbs4EbWOTWNZmmM0Y8hBOvH-1E7ENHRl8MwaIW5bA5iMLvlPg"> The psalmists, as godly men, loved the law, loved God, loved the temple, loved the holy city, and loved the holy people, but eventually, they were exiled. They were brought into captivity. The law, after being given, results in captivity. Jeremiah shows the pitiful captivity and exile which the people of Israel experienced. They experienced captivity upon captivity and exile upon exile. Many of them were killed by the Babylonians. A small remnant of them remained, but they would not take the word of God to remain in their holy land. Instead, they wanted to go to Egypt. They went there to be exiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48305" data-verses="Jeremiah 42:1">Jer. 42:1—43:7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVeeje4owsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> The Old Testament law given by God through Moses resulted altogether in captivity. Captivity came because of the failure of the carrying out of the first covenant. Because the old covenant was altogether a failure, Jeremiah said that God would make a new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48306" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:31-34">31:31-34</span>). Even by the end of the time of the early apostles, the New Testament believers had entered into captivity due to the fact that they remained in the old covenant although they had been put into the new covenant. Today’s Catholic Church is a mixture of the Old Testament and the New Testament. Their rituals, formalities, and even the clothing of their clergy are an Old Testament mixture. Today’s Pentecostalism is also a mixture of the Old Testament with the New Testament. These are proofs that even today’s New Testament believers have entered into captivity as a result of keeping the Old Testament practices <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> with the law. Eventually, the psalmists turned from enjoying the law in which they delighted to enjoying their God whom they loved and sought after. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWw2JGDalao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ">II.

We also have to pick up this point. Otherwise, we cannot properly understand the Psalms. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="kVUJkTRCD2ceWNANfSpmSXqrMTkTgrwo3WzP5v2H-gzE3CDAPM4O-xZzgNga2L9ku">A. The Human Concept of the Holy Writers</h2><p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHrbJpdKE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> The first concept, according to which the Psalms were written, is the human concept of the holy writers. Their human concept was produced out of their good nature created by God, formed with the traditions of their holy race, constituted with the teachings of their holy Scriptures, promoted by their practice of a holy life, and uttered out of their holy sentiments and impressions. These are the constituents of the human concept of the holy writers of the Psalms. They were from a holy race, possessing the Pentateuch, the first five books of Moses. They were a greatly cultured people. The traditions of their holy race formed their human concept according to which many of the psalms were written. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AoqK9xo6iYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8">B. The Divine Concept of God</h2><p data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_tEM3NYAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV"> The Psalms were also written according to the divine concept of God as the divine revelation. This divine concept of God as the divine revelation is concerning His eternal economy in Christ, taking Christ as its centrality and universality. It is also concerning Christ in His divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, life-imparting and seed-producing resurrection, glorification, ascension, appearing in glory, and reigning forever. All these points are clearly, and even in detail, revealed in the Psalms. The divine concept in the Psalms is also concerning God’s heart’s desire, His good pleasure in Christ as His centrality and universality, in the church as His fullness for His expression, in the kingdom for His eternal administration, and in the recovery of the earth for His eternal kingdom in eternity. This divine <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> concept of God was uttered from the godly writers of the Psalms as a part of the utterance in their holy writings. The same writers uttered two kinds of concepts—the human concept and the divine concept. </p>

THE LAW IN MAN’S APPRECIATION</h2><p data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AoqJ9xFyiYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48420" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> is concerning the law in man’s appreciation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48421" data-verses="Psalms 1:2">v. 2</span>). I hope that we will receive a clear view to see this Psalm. We need to see the truth concerning the law in its position, its nature, its content, its function, and its weakness. We need to fight the battle against the wrong teachings concerning the law which are not in the light of God’s New Testament economy. Among Christians there are two schools concerning the law. One school is positive and the other school is very negative. The top person in the negative school related to the law is the apostle Paul. Concerning the law, he was negative to the uttermost. I want to point out some of the points he stressed in his teaching concerning the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_tHM3kRAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV"> In Romans and in Galatians, Paul stressed that no flesh, no fallen human being, can be justified before God by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> works of the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48422" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Rom. 3:20a</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48423" data-verses="Galatians 2:16">Gal. 2:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48424" data-verses="Galatians 3:11">3:11a</span>). To work to be justified by the law is to labor in vain. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48425" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> Paul told us that the law, instead of giving us life, becomes the killing instrument by which sin deceives and kills us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48426" data-verses="Romans 7:11">v. 11</span>). Do we like something that kills us? David was wrong to exalt and appreciate something by which we can be killed. This shows us how negative Paul was in his view concerning the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="K1eAihiqzvOD_ioDc2UJRRf_DEn8sDcLTtT8TGFcTdIl76OxcXwPf6jwTsqT2wjk7"> I want to raise up Paul’s argument as my argument against the law. Some may say that Paul told us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48427" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> that the law is holy, righteous, good (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48428" data-verses="Romans 7:12">v. 12</span>), and even spiritual (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48429" data-verses="Romans 7:14">v. 14a</span>). But this is only in its nature. In nature the law is holy, righteous, good, and spiritual, but we also need to see what Paul says concerning its position, its function, and its weakness. </p>

Because of this, the law does not have an orthodox position. It was not orthodox because it entered in alongside the main line of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6fom_qfdpS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c"> Many today do not see this main line. Instead, they teach the Bible according to the natural way, without any governing principles. Over sixty years ago, I first heard that we have to interpret the Bible with the proper principles. When I heard that, I was asking myself, “What are the principles for us to understand the Bible?” At that time, I did not understand, but gradually I came into the proper realization of the governing principles of understanding and interpreting the Bible. In this message I am interpreting the Word according to these principles. </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW7n_vvpZA7ULO884Evm-HphAm8UKndBtrUuO3Kkg1_Ay9Dcj0p0s6xSsEx_kZu_"> The principle we need to see concerning the law is this—Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48431" data-verses="Romans 5:20">Romans 5:20a</span> told us that the law entered in alongside. <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> The Greek word here also means to “come in alongside.” The law did not come in by itself. It came in alongside of something. This means that the main line of God’s economy was there already. </p>
<p data-content-id="cT8NrRFfPzsynu5lLu-GGbddYoBuqjDuifVLWXa6H4_HpI5ahTZpRhf9TqTD8W_99"> After the creation of man, however, something happened. Satan came in, sin followed Satan, and man became fallen. Thus, man became a fallen man constituted with sin to be a sinner. God created man in His own image and after His own likeness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48432" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>) with the intention that man could take in God, live God, and express God. The main line of God’s economy began with man and was on the way when something happened. A “car accident” occurred. Therefore, the law needed to come in alongside the main line of God’s economy. This should help us to understand Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48433" data-verses="Romans 5:20">Romans 5:20a</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2oy9HGRRUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> The law was not originally ordained and arranged by God. In God’s original economy, there was not such a thing. God in His economy planned to create and to have a man in His image and after His likeness that man one day could receive Him as life to live Him and to manifest Him so that He might have an organism to express His Divine Trinity. But Satan came in to deceive man, and Satan and man became one. The man created by God in His own image was constituted by Satan with Satan’s nature to be a sinful man. Now God had to fix the situation. Would God keep man out of His plan, forgetting about man? Of course, God would never do that because He is the Alpha and also the Omega (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48434" data-verses="Revelation 22:13">Rev. 22:13</span>). He cannot start anything without completing it. </p>
<p data-content-id="E4td5kmomfAjeGazEU83dwkyXjy28rxL8oQNM-rYLdkLIoLtHs8mIAM7ZuMPCTHuG"> In order to continue His purpose with man after man’s fall, God added something to the main line of His economy. The Chinese version of the Bible says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48435" data-verses="Romans 5:20">Romans 5:20</span> that the law was added. It was something in addition to grace. The law was in addition to the orthodox line of grace in God’s economy. </p>

Paul told us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48437" data-verses="Galatians 4:1">Galatians 4</span> that Abraham had two wives. One was the orthodox <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> wife, Sarah, and the other was the concubine, Hagar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48438" data-verses="Galatians 4:22-31">vv. 22-31</span>). We all know that a man’s concubine does not have an orthodox position. Paul indicated that Sarah signifies the new covenant of grace, and he pointed out that Hagar symbolizes the old covenant of the law. Thus, the law’s position is that of a concubine. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPfbBHDneBjs_yEzYD3KxVyubd2UeNDPuK-ioxqWo82BpQ0oXABpY_L_3MbRH5kXR"> In God’s creation, He did not ordain man to have a concubine. He ordained that man should have one wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48439" data-verses="Matthew 19:3-9">Matt. 19:3-9</span>). Anyone that has more than one wife enters into corruption. We should not try to bring a concubine into God’s economy. If we are appreciating and uplifting the law, we are bringing a concubine into God’s economy. This is absolutely against God’s ordination. </p>
<p data-content-id="ex-VBPE6iEBPGjLm6o1EHZdmFA6QdIW9p5b-_TOqQLTnIw18TKY2WJPOMgBwUFYmG"> The law as a concubine entered in alongside the main line of God’s economy. Whoever is of the law is a child of the concubine, not a son of the free woman. The law does not have an orthodox position. The followers of the law are not the children of the orthodox wife. Ishmael, the son of the concubine, Hagar, was looked down on and was chased away. He was chased away from the main line of God’s economy, the line of grace. We must remember this point in our interpretation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48440" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>. The writer of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48441" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> uplifted the law according to the human concept, which is contradicting to the main line of God’s economy. </p>

<p data-content-id="tQ24bEsDAJrapHMLOR8UaXfHMzVeA2NL9qpON8dWnjClKumw-BgbGeVcZwAx4ViCq"> Now we need to see the nature of the law. In its nature, the law is holy, righteous, and good (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48442" data-verses="Romans 7:12">Rom. 7:12</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="hkLfpjCNovaGmCzIPtjYO9QrFk3mtR0lr9YKIdhUAkLiGtbw24ZWzZYjCzQ5ensMw">2. Spiritual</h2><p data-content-id="U3SJ7x2XZmwE-vT9C-B0lEquCtOBuETEkreZHMxUhbPpeAsVz1iLkblSuDuEcWpye"> The law is also spiritual (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48443" data-verses="Romans 7:14">7:14a</span>). This is because the law was God’s speaking. Since the Ten Commandments are God’s speaking, they are God’s breathing. All Scripture is God-breathed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48444" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16a</span>). The entire Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible considered as the law, is God’s breathing. God’s breathing, of course, is altogether spiritual. Thus, in this sense, the law is spiritual. <span class="pg" data-page-id="17" id="17">[17]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="M7fCqdO3rsw64DHJPn8tPVwrm6VwUJRZ3yHZlLdZbQwfTUGFzmgEUPSGaDO0Z7qHX"> Although the position of the law is not right, the nature of the law is good. This is the point where troubles can arise in our understanding. The positive school stands on the nature of the law. They point out that Paul said that the law is holy, righteous, good, and even spiritual. Then they ask, “How could you say the law is negative?” It is true that the nature of the law is good and spiritual, but its position is wrong. A lady may be good and spiritual in her nature, yet still be a concubine. This lady may be a “golden” lady, a spiritual lady, but she does not have an orthodox position. </p>

This psalm says that those who meditate in the law will be like a tree absorbing the water from the streams, but according to the New Testament revelation this is not very high. Eventually, the New Testament tells us that the river of living water gets into us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48549" data-verses="John 7:38">John 7:38</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48550" data-verses="John 4:14">4:14</span>). Do we want to be a tree by the side of a river or do we want to have the river flowing within us? Which is better and which is higher? The thought of a river flowing within us is the ultimate concept of the Bible (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48551" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Rev. 22:1</span>). To be a tree planted by the river to absorb its supply of water is good, but it is not the best. Paul said that he planted and Apollos watered (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48552" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6">1 Cor. 3:6</span>). The thought here is the same as that of a tree absorbing water, but this is not as high as the thought of the river of water of life flowing within us. This is God’s ultimate thought. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xcf_6qhqmuUpIGfe8Jx6UOr58ZlCW67PmCtIfSUeGYkLK3j9subuJKvpbUUJeUzlR"> In my youth I was taught that when we study the Bible, we have to get the secret of the Bible. Later, Brother Nee told us that we have to know the spirit of the Bible. The Bible, the written Word, has a spirit. The Lord Jesus said, “The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48553" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>). This shows us that the Word is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48554" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17">Eph. 6:17</span>). Not only is the Spirit in the Word, but also the Word itself is the Spirit. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48555" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says, “In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God.” The Word is God, and the Word is the Spirit. Thus, God, the Word, and the Spirit are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="kVUJkTRCD2ceWNANfSpmQXqvOTkTgrwo3WzP5v2H-gzE3CDAPM4O-xZzgNga2L9ku"> When we come to the Bible, we should not think that we are coming to an ordinary book. We should not read it as we would a magazine or a newspaper. We have to realize that the Bible is God’s Word, and the Word is God’s embodiment, Christ. Christ is the Word of God. Also, whatever He as the Word of God utters, whatever is spoken out of His mouth, is the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48556" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> is the Word of God. Paul told us that all Scripture is God-breathed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48557" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16a</span>). If we take this <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> position when we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48558" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>, we will receive the Spirit, we will see the secret, and we will also see the spirit of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHrZJpZIE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> Does the spirit of the Bible reveal to us the law of Moses, exalting the law given at Mount Sinai? On the mount of transfiguration, Peter put Moses and Elijah on the same level as Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48559" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-13">Matt. 17:1-13</span>). When Moses and Elijah appeared with Christ, Peter became excited. He said, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48560" data-verses="Matthew 17:4">v. 4</span>). Then God said, “This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48561" data-verses="Matthew 17:5">v. 5</span>). In God’s New Testament economy, we should no longer hear Moses (the law) or Elijah (the prophets). The Bible does not exalt the law or the prophets. The spirit of the Bible exalts only one person—Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AoqI9xs8iYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8"> We must understand why <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48562" data-verses="Psalms 1:1-2">Psalms 1 and 2</span> were sovereignly arranged in this way. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48563" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> is concerning the keeping of the law. Immediately after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48564" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>, Christ is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48565" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> as the exalted One. The spirit of the Bible, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48566" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48567" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>, reveals only Christ as the prominent One, as the first One, as God’s centrality and universality. Eventually, the Bible concludes with a new city. The new city, the New Jerusalem, will be a complement of Christ and a complement to Christ. The spirit of the Bible does not exalt anything or anyone other than Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_tGM3JeAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV"> Paul, in his fourteen Epistles, fought a battle to put down everything other than Christ. In his Epistle to the Galatians, Paul put down the law, circumcision, tradition, and religion. To him all things other than Christ were refuse (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48568" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">Phil. 3:8</span>). He exalted only Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="bqm-JyB7SIVXqnqTXQ7oLdfN7BBkuLKDq-WD-CusQJYOpzha7vmOWzhRlrUftDbwd"> In Paul’s last visit to Jerusalem, he went to the elders, and the leading elder at that time was James. James told him, “You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48569" data-verses="Acts 21:20">Acts 21:20</span>). James exalted the law. I believe that he exalted the law higher than David did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48570" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>. James declared that there were thousands of Jewish Christians who were enthusiastic for the law. The Greek word for <em>thousands</em> <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> means myriads or tens of thousands. Tens of thousands of Jewish brothers were all burning for the law. James was concerned that these ones would dispute with Paul, since they had heard that Paul put down the law. History tells us that James was a man of prayer, a pious, godly, and devoted man. In his Epistle he taught the practical virtues of Christian perfection. But we need to see that James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers were still in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law. </p>
<p data-content-id="qf_Q-HCS9YUo9GMzE5AQWv_E1oKb3vFVaOmLANx-Rc98knFI2YImImMaqhN5dQJl3"> In this message, I want us to check with ourselves. Is our spirit for the law or for Christ? We may say that we are for Christ, but we are also for the law. Our being for Christ is mostly in theory, but our being for the law is very practical. We act mostly according to the law, according to yes and no, right and wrong, and not according to Christ. We even educate and teach our children according to right and wrong. A parent may say to his child, “That is not right; you shouldn’t do it.” But have we ever said, “That is not Christ; you shouldn’t do it”? Who ever tells someone not to do something because that is not Christ? This should help us to realize that we are for Christ in theory, but actually we practice the law. Do we practice Christ or the law? To practice Christ is to get out of the realm of yes and no, right and wrong, good and evil. This means that we get out of the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We may say that our spirit is for Christ, but in practice we live according to the law, according to what is right and wrong, good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="y_qtpCA_Os0zZ8Y1K0v4No3CN9n24t68Y4eSGBoEmfCndK11UbLXrTHcfLFkGc3Th"> The book of Psalms shows us the contrast between the law and Christ. The first psalm is concerning keeping the law, and the second psalm tells us to kiss Christ. Which is higher? I am not asking which one is right or wrong, but which one is higher. Surely, kissing the Son is higher than keeping the law. </p>

<p data-content-id="oaKMapIqH0taB_HBBSgnqwZSJCm6qQIfo0VKLpq7SbpietHAMYoHv6iuAZG_bJfmq"> Thus far, we have covered <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48680" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> concerning the law in man’s appreciation and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48681" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> concerning Christ in God’s economy. We have seen that it was altogether by the Holy Spirit for the Psalms to be arranged this way. Suppose that we were the arrangers of the one hundred fifty psalms. Which psalm would we place as the first one? The Lord’s way is the best way. He put <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48682" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> first, where we see the law in man’s appreciation. Then we see Christ in God’s economy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48683" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>. What would be next in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48684" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalms 3—7</span>? It is interesting to see that right after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48685" data-verses="Psalms 1:1-2">Psalms 1 and 2</span>, there are five psalms which show us David’s concepts concerning a godly life. </p>
<p data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6fom5qfEmS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c"> The title of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48686" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalm 3</span> says, “A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.” Absalom was a rebellious son. The Psalms were arranged in this way to show us that David needed to be corrected and disciplined. David appreciated the law so highly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48687" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>, but did he keep the law? Did he as a tree stand by the streams steadfastly? He was not planted by the streams in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48688" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalm 3</span>. Instead, he was fleeing from his rebellious son. </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW7n_vvpZA7ULO884Evg-HMtAm8UKndBtrUuO3Kkg1_Ay9Dcj0p0s6xSsEx_kZu_"> From my youth I have loved <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48689" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psalm 51</span>. This is a psalm of David’s repentance after his great sin recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48690" data-verses="2Samuel 11:1">2 Samuel 11</span>. David committed intentional murder, using his power and authority as a king to carry out his conspiracy to kill Uriah, one of his fighters. After that murder, he robbed Uriah of his wife. The last five commandments of the law <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> prohibit killing, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting. David broke the last five commandments. He killed Uriah, committed fornication, stole Uriah’s wife, lied to Uriah, and coveted Uriah’s wife. That offended God to the uttermost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48691" data-verses="1Kings 15:5">1 Kings 15:5</span>). Right away God sent the prophet Nathan to reprove David, as recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48692" data-verses="2Samuel 12:1">2 Samuel 12</span>. David became subdued, and he repented. Then he wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48693" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psalm 51</span>. That is a wonderful psalm. The standard in this psalm is high; it is full of life and full of spirit. It even takes care of God’s economy. The end of that psalm shows that after his confession of his own sin, he still remembered Zion and Jerusalem. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48694" data-verses="Psalms 51:18">verse 18</span> David said, “Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion: / Build the walls of Jerusalem.” </p>
<p data-content-id="cT8NrRFfPzsynu5lLu-GAbd8VoBuqjDuifVLWXa6H4_HpI5ahTZpRhf9TqTD8W_99"> That psalm is very good and very high. But it is difficult to believe that about three years later, he wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48695" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalms 3—7</span>, which are full of the human concept. After David committed murder and fornication, God disciplined him by allowing there to be trouble among his children (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48696" data-verses="2Samuel 12:11">2 Sam. 12:11</span>). One of David’s sons committed fornication with one of his daughters. Then the fornicator was killed by another son of David, Absalom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48697" data-verses="2Samuel 13:1-36">2 Sam. 13:1-36</span>). After the killing of his brother, Absalom fled to Geshur and stayed there for three years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48698" data-verses="2Samuel 13:37-39">vv. 37-39</span>). Then after three years, he came back to David, and a little later he rebelled. Then David fled. In his flight from his rebellious son, he wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48699" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalms 3—7</span>. We have to know the history of these psalms in order to see them in the light of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2oy7HGRZUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> Some Chinese Christians have said that if you want to learn how to pray, you should study the Psalms, but I would say that we should not do this. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48700" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalms 3—7</span> are all psalms of prayer, but they are the wrong example of how to pray because they are according to David’s human concept for his personal interest. The Chinese Christians also say that if you want to learn how to preach, you should study Proverbs. But I would say that if you want to be a good preacher, you should study Paul’s fourteen Epistles. Furthermore, if you want to learn to pray, you should go to Paul. Paul gave us two model prayers in one book, the book of Ephesians. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48701" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians 1</span> he said that he would ask the Father, the God of our <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> Lord Jesus Christ, to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48702" data-verses="Ephesians 1:17-19">vv. 17-19</span>). Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48703" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span>, Paul said, “I bow my knees unto the Father...that He would grant you...to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48704" data-verses="Ephesians 3:14-19">vv. 14-19</span>). If we compare these two prayers of the apostle Paul with the prayers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48705" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalms 3—7</span>, we will realize that the prayers in these psalms should not be the examples of how we should pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="E4td5kmomfAjeGazEU83bwkyfjy28rxL8oQNM-rYLdkLIoLtHs8mIAM7ZuMPCTHuG"> In this message I would like to paraphrase the main points in these five psalms. We need to evaluate these psalms point by point in the light of God’s New Testament economy. The prayers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48706" data-verses="Psalms 3:1">Psalms 3—7</span> are all involved in sufferings, in good and evil, and are even involved in avenging, self-righteousness, and accusing of others. There is no point in these psalms indicating life, repentance, self-condemnation, or self-denial. Furthermore, there is no point indicating much fellowship with God, touching God or being touched by God, and being humble and contrite in spirit. As we consider these psalms, we need to see these points. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48714" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> he highly uplifted and exalted the law with its keeper. In his great sin, however, he broke all the last five commandments, which require men to have virtues expressing God’s divine attributes. Did David, the one who wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48715" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>, keep the law? I do not believe that many readers of the Psalms ever thought about this. They agreed with David’s exaltation of the law in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48716" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>. They never thought that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48717" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> was wrong in treasuring and uplifting the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="tQ24bEsDAJrapHMLOR8UcXfLCzVeA2NL9qpON8dWnjClKumw-BgbGeVcZwAx4ViCq"> The greatest teacher in the New Testament, Paul, told us that no flesh can be justified by keeping the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48718" data-verses="Galatians 2:16">Gal. 2:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48719" data-verses="Galatians 3:11">3:11</span>). It is impossible for fallen man to keep the law. Asking man to keep the law is like asking a crippled bird to fly from Los Angeles to New York. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48720" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Romans 8:3</span> says that the law cannot do what God requires because it is weak through the flesh. The law is good in its nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48721" data-verses="Romans 7:12">Rom. 7:12</span>), but the law cannot give us life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48722" data-verses="Galatians 3:21">Gal. 3:21</span>); it cannot impart the very dynamic power, life power, organic power, into us. </p>

Eventually, he was fleeing from his rebellious son. Because David committed murder and fornication, God chastised him through his son’s rebellion. His children became a mess. Among them, there were also murder and fornication. If we see this picture, we will be convinced not to treasure and uplift the law. We should not appreciate the law. The more we appreciate the law, the more we will commit something against the law. </p>

Jehovah’s name is excellent in all the earth, and He has set His splendor above the heavens. Actually, the heavens are the source of the excellency. The excellency does not initiate from the earth, but from the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="fV0aAyMXuYdaoZynkbs4AbWCVWNZmmM0Y8hBOvH-1E7ENHRl8MwaIW5bA5iMLvlPg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48780" data-verses="Psalms 8:2">Verse 2</span> says, “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings / You have established strength / Because of Your adversaries, / To stop the enemy and the avenger.” This verse shows us three negative categories of persons: the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger. Above the heavens is God’s splendor, and on the earth Jesus’ name is excellent. But in this universe, there are still many adversaries, enemies, and avengers. Adversaries are those who are within, enemies are those who are without, and the avengers are those who run back and forth (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48781" data-verses="Job 1:7">Job 1:7</span>). Satan can be signified by these three categories. First, Satan was within God’s kingdom. Then Satan became an enemy without, outside the kingdom of God. He is also the avenger, running back and forth. Above the heavens there is splendor, and on the earth there is the excellent name. But in between the heavens and the earth, there are the adversaries within, the enemy without, and the avenger running back and forth. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVeaje0uwsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> What would God do about this? God does something in a consummate way. He establishes His praises out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, the youngest, smallest, and weakest ones. Babes are a little stronger than sucklings, and sucklings are somewhat smaller than the babes, but both of them are in the category of the smallest and weakest. </p>
<p data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWw2NGDWvao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ"> In this message I would like to ask if we consider ourselves as babes and sucklings. Perhaps some of us have a doctor’s degree, or others are high school seniors. Are we seniors, or are we sucklings? If you would ask me, I would say that I am the smallest suckling. In the kingdom of God, there is no old person. The Lord Jesus told people, “Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48782" data-verses="Matthew 18:3">Matt. 18:3</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="55" id="55">[55]</span>). He also said, “Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48783" data-verses="Matthew 19:14">19:14</span>). The Lord stressed that to participate in the kingdom of the heavens, we must be like little children. All the people who are in the kingdom of the heavens are as babes. A brother may be over sixty years old, but in God’s kingdom, he is a suckling. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xcf_6qhqmuUpIGfe8Jx6SOr1-ZlCW67PmCtIfSUeGYkLK3j9subuJKvpbUUJeUzlR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48784" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span> is poetry. Poetic writing should not be understood in a mere physical and literal way. We have to understand the terms according to a poetic way. Babes are not the real babes, and sucklings are not the real sucklings. These are the children of the kingdom of the heavens. All the people who are in the kingdom of the heavens are either babes or sucklings. If we consider that we are people with a high degree or status, that we have a doctor’s degree, that we are seniors, we are not in the kingdom. The brothers and sisters who are seniors in high school should not take this standing in the church life. We should not be seniors, but sucklings. The psalmist means that we, the children of God, all are babes and sucklings, yet God could cause us to praise Him. </p>

Seemingly, strength does not refer to something that comes out of the mouth. When the Lord quoted this verse in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48786" data-verses="Matthew 21:16">Matthew 21:16</span>, He used the word <em>praise</em> instead of <em>strength</em>. Weaker ones in themselves cannot praise. To cry or weep does not require strength, but to praise requires strength. When we gossip, argue, or reason with people, that does not require strength. But without strength, we cannot praise the Lord. Some praises may come out of our mouth, but they cannot be considered as perfected praises, because they are not so full of strength. Praises should be full of strength. Many times when the saints are praising the Lord, we can see the strength. </p>
<p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHrfJpVOE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> The Septuagint version of the Psalms translated the Hebrew word for <em>strength</em> into <em>praise</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48787" data-verses="Psalms 8:2">Psalm 8:2</span>. This translation was quoted by the Lord in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48788" data-verses="Matthew 21:16">Matthew 21:16</span>. This means that the Lord admitted that this translation was right. The scholars who translated the Old Testament into Greek for the Septuagint did have some kind of spiritual knowledge. <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> To praise is to have the strength in our mouth. God can work in His redemption to such an extent that the weakest ones and the smallest ones can have the strength to praise Him. God has established this. </p>
<p data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AoqO9xg-iYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8"> The Hebrew word for <em>established</em> is a hard word to translate. In the Lord’s quotation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48789" data-verses="Matthew 21:16">Matthew 21:16</span>, it says that He has “perfected” praise out of the mouths of the babes and sucklings. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48790" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span> says that He established strength out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, but the Lord Jesus quoted it by saying that He perfected praise. Is our praise perfect? We have to admit that our praise is altogether imperfect. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48791" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span> is not a long psalm, but it is a completed, perfected, and perfect psalm. If we are short of strength, we cannot praise. If we do not have the extra strength, we cannot have a completed, perfected, and perfect praise. </p>
<p data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_tAM3FcAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV"> On earth the Lord’s name is excellent; above the heavens is the Lord’s splendor, His glory. In between there are the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger, who are stopped by the praise of strength that comes out of the mouths of the smallest ones and the weakest ones. This is God’s marvelous consummation. The highest consummation of the Lord’s work in His redemption is to perfect the praise to Him out of the mouths of the smallest and the weakest. </p>
<p data-content-id="bqm-JyB7SIVXqnqTXQ7oNdfB1BBkuLKDq-WD-CusQJYOpzha7vmOWzhRlrUftDbwd"> The Lord does this because of His adversaries, with the purpose of stopping the enemy and the avenger. The Chinese translation shows that to stop the enemy and the avenger means to shut up their mouths. Today before the Lord and God, Satan’s mouth has been shut up. In the whole universe, there are many voices. The adversaries have their voices, the enemy has his voice, and the avenger has his voice. But all these voices have been stopped by the overcoming Christ. He has overcome all of God’s enemies in the entire universe, so He can perfect the praise to Him out of the mouths of the smallest and weakest persons, in order to stop the voices of His enemy and His avenger. </p>

Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48872" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> comes in to annul what was exalted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48873" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48874" data-verses="Psalms 3:1-7">Psalms 3 through 7</span>, we again see David’s human concept.

But in the whole universe there is only one person who is perfect according to the law—Jesus Christ. There is no one else. Everyone else has broken the law. We have seen that David exalted the law so highly, but by his failure regarding Uriah, he broke the last five commandments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48894" data-verses="Exodus 20:13-17">Exo. 20:13-17</span>). He murdered, he committed adultery, he stole by robbing another of his wife, he lied to Uriah, and he coveted Uriah’s wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48895" data-verses="2Samuel 11:1">2 Sam. 11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="tQ24bEsDAJrapHMLOR8UeXfLKzVeA2NL9qpON8dWnjClKumw-BgbGeVcZwAx4ViCq"> The last five commandments prohibiting killing, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting were given by God with the requirement that man would have the human virtues to express the divine attributes. If there were no killing, fornication, stealing, lying, or coveting in the human race, the kingdom of the heavens would really be on this earth. Today the newspapers, however, report all the evil things that take place on earth day by day. The earth is filled with murder, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting. </p>
<p data-content-id="hkLfpjCNovaGmCzIPtjYK9QnDk3mtR0lr9YKIdhUAkLiGtbw24ZWzZYjCzQ5ensMw"> No one is perfect according to the law.

This One is the very God who became a man and lived a human life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48899" data-verses="Psalms 16:1-8">vv. 1-8</span>). In His human life, He kept the law perfectly. He lived a life full of human virtues expressing the divine attributes. Then He died (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48900" data-verses="Psalms 16:9-10">vv. 9-10</span>) and was resurrected (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48901" data-verses="Psalms 16:10-11">vv. 10-11a</span>).

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48905" data-verses="Psalms 9:1">Psalm 9</span> we see David’s concept concerning God’s judgment on David’s enemies among the nations. David mentioned clearly that he had many enemies among the nations. Today all of the Arab countries are enemies of Israel. It is regrettable that Israel has not yet turned to God, but the Bible tells us that although Israel has been re-formed as a nation, they will not turn to God until Christ returns (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48906" data-verses="Zechariah 12:10">Zech. 12:10</span>). Today Israel, just like David, is surrounded by enemies. In addition to the enemies surrounding David, he had the adversaries from within, even from his house, from his family. His son Absalom became the leading adversary. </p>
<p data-content-id="M7fCqdO3rsw64DHJPn8tLVwns6VwUJRZ3yHZlLdZbQwfTUGFzmgEUPSGaDO0Z7qHX"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48907" data-verses="Psalms 10:1">Psalms 10—14</span> David speaks of man’s condition before God. It is hard to find another portion in the Bible which presents us a complete picture of man’s condition as in these psalms. When Paul preached the gospel in Romans, he quoted from this portion of the Word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48908" data-verses="Romans 3:10-12">Rom. 3:10-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48909" data-verses="Romans 3:14">14</span>). </p>

God has an economy, and in God’s economy there is a central line. This central line is Christ to be enlarged to have a counterpart, that is, His church. Thus, Christ and the church are the central line of God’s economy. But David’s concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48910" data-verses="Psalms 9:1">Psalms 9—14</span> was not along this line. David’s concept was according to the law, a subsidiary line that goes along with the central line. The law is not the central line. The law is a side line going along with the central line. </p>

These psalms show that David was full of the knowledge of good and evil. I would even say that in these psalms David himself was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Now I would like us to consider what kind of “tree” we are. We all should be able to declare that we are the tree of life. We should not be those who minister good and evil to others. Instead we should always minister Christ as life. Since I began to minister in the United States in 1962, all of my messages have been in the principle of the tree of life. </p>

We may feel that this word is good, but we need to consider it in the light of the New Testament. In the New Testament, we are told that Christ is the King, even the Ruler of all the kings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48915" data-verses="Revelation 1:5">Rev. 1:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48916" data-verses="Revelation 19:16">19:16</span>), sitting on the throne not to judge but to save. Today we have a saving King. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48917" data-verses="Acts 5:31">Acts 5:31</span> says that God uplifted Christ to His right hand that He may be the Leader and the Savior. David’s thought is that his God is the King on the throne to judge—not to save the world in mercy and grace but to judge the world in righteousness and with equity. <em>With equity</em> simply means with justice. The whole world is neither righteous nor just, so David had a good concept that the One who is sitting on the throne judges in righteousness and with justice. But this concept is according to the law and according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="ZoqnkBJsv_ave8S39rvY_QRnapXvjyoKcjH_ufhMTX22UVAGWPYGMDioB-HdgCp6h"> In this message we come to another pair of psalms, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48976" data-verses="Psalms 15:1-2">Psalms 15 and 16</span>. We have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48977" data-verses="Psalms 1:1-2">Psalms 1 and 2</span> were sovereignly arranged as a pair. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48978" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> says that the man whose delight is in the law of Jehovah is blessed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48979" data-verses="Psalms 1:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48980" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> says that the man who takes refuge in the Son is blessed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48981" data-verses="Psalms 2:12">v. 12</span>). Thus, we see the human concept of being blessed by the keeping of the law versus the divine concept of being blessed by taking refuge in the Son. The comparison in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48982" data-verses="Psalms 1:1-2">Psalms 1 and 2</span> is between the law and Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="A-hYX8zK16VtRI8Qvi6JEs7nIA5IMzgSzJYENfWXzvBiO6IqbYJRxuTolost_F3Qd"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48983" data-verses="Psalms 15:1-2">Psalms 15 and 16</span> also present a comparison. The end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48984" data-verses="Psalms 15:1">Psalm 15</span> says, “He who does these things will not be shaken forever.” <em>These things</em> refer to the good things according to the law in the foregoing verses. On the other hand, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48985" data-verses="Psalms 16:8">Psalm 16:8b</span> says, “Because He is at My right hand, I shall not be shaken.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48986" data-verses="Psalms 15:1">Psalm 15</span> says that if you do all the good things according to the law, you will never be shaken. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48987" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16</span> says concerning Christ that because God is at His right hand, He will not be shaken. No doubt, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48988" data-verses="Psalms 15:1-2">Psalms 15 and 16</span> were arranged together to show us a comparison between the keeping of the law and the participating in the Son. Do we keep the law or do we partake of Christ? Do we keep the law or do we enjoy Christ as our portion? </p>
<p data-content-id="F2xyP711-ImVwCRnTxPdZF4p8OzRP_L_Fsgt0ia8aB6yvP3rASXANWKWp8ji3KpUG"> At this point I would like us to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48989" data-verses="Psalms 15:1-2">Psalms 15 and 16</span> together so that we can see the different concepts in these psalms. Afterward, we will cover them in more detail. </p>
<p data-content-id="C0vZoeE_Tq6zu9_Fulg8JRWe0dNTgG7cDJrnlW3MlPGUBMuWsC2B7F32iItZg_FXY"> At the beginning of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48990" data-verses="Psalms 15:1">Psalm 15</span>, the psalmist asks, “O Jehovah, who may sojourn in Your tent? / Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?” The tent refers to God’s house, the temple. <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> David says that this one is “He who walks in integrity / And does righteousness / And speaks truth from his heart. / He does not slander with his tongue; / He does not do evil to his friend, / Nor does he take up reproach upon his neighbor. / In his eyes a reprobate is despised, / But he honors those who fear Jehovah. / Should he swear to his harm, / He does not change. / He does not lend his money on interest, / Nor accept a bribe against the innocent. / He who does these things will not be shaken forever” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48991" data-verses="Psalms 15:2-5">vv. 2-5</span>). This may seem like an excellent psalm, but actually it is a psalm in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="PdqflOTfa_fEqM2Whps5NbY10E82eUf_xHvz09sRCXeut0OLr1OkE4g8-OxoH5y1Y"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48992" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16</span>, on the other hand, is a psalm revealing the God-man, Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48993" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16:1</span> does not say, “Preserve Me, O God, for I keep the law, and I meditate in the law day and night.” This is absolutely wrong. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48994" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16:1</span> says, “Preserve Me, O God, for I take refuge in You.” It was as if the psalmist said, “I don’t care for the law; I care for You and I enjoy You.” Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48995" data-verses="Psalms 16:2">Psalm 16:2</span> continues, “O My soul, you say to Jehovah, You are My Lord; / No good have I beyond You.” When the Lord Jesus was a man on this earth, He always held such an attitude of recognizing God the Father as His Lord. His attitude toward the Father could have been expressed by His saying, “I do not have anything beyond You which is good. I have no blessing, no pleasure, and no enjoyment other than You.” </p>
<p data-content-id="bqm-JyB7SIVXqnqTXQ7oPdfB9BBkuLKDq-WD-CusQJYOpzha7vmOWzhRlrUftDbwd"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48996" data-verses="Psalms 16:3">Verse 3</span> says, “To the saints who are on the earth and to the excellent, / All My delight is in them.” The Lord Jesus loved God the Father. He also had His delight in the saints, in the believers, in the members of His Body. He did not delight in the commandments of the law, but in the members of His Body, the saints in God’s kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="qf_Q-HCS9YUo9GMzE5AQSv_IzoKb3vFVaOmLANx-Rc98knFI2YImImMaqhN5dQJl3"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48997" data-verses="Psalms 16:4">Verse 4</span> says, “Sorrows will be multiplied to them who bartered for some other god; / Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, / Nor will I take up their names upon My lips.” <em>Their names</em> refers to the names of the idols, the names of the other gods. </p>
<p data-content-id="y_qtpCA_Os0zZ8Y1K0v4Jo3OH9n24t68Y4eSGBoEmfCndK11UbLXrTHcfLFkGc3Th"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48998" data-verses="Psalms 16:5">Verse 5</span> says, “Jehovah is the portion of My inheritance and of My cup; / You maintain My lot.” God is the portion of two things: of the inheritance and of the cup. The inheritance <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> refers to the substance of the lot, and the cup refers to the enjoyment of God as our blessing. At the Lord’s table, we drink the cup of blessing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48999" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:16">1 Cor. 10:16a</span>). Stanza 3 of <em>Hymns,</em> #223 points out that in this cup God is our portion. Thus, we have God as the portion for our inheritance and for our enjoyment. God the Father was the very portion of these two things to Christ as a man on this earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49000" data-verses="Psalms 16:5">Verse 5b</span> says, “You maintain My lot.” The lot is the portion of the inheritance. </p>
<p data-content-id="8ENujLHBaosPnjKTCIaf0H-_nTk0bRCtyxH-7F3HoVERIgtsLU3NTyz-xJOwN2Xhu"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49001" data-verses="Psalms 16:6">Verse 6a</span> says, “The measuring lines have fallen on pleasant places for Me.” To understand this verse, we have to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49002" data-verses="Psalms 2:8">Psalm 2:8</span>, which says that God will give to Christ the nations as His inheritance and the limits of the earth as His possession. <em>The limits</em> are the measuring lines of God in His divine economy. God has measured the earth. Whatever God has measured will be Christ’s possession. The measuring lines have fallen on pleasant places for Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="06PDAD4GrV_FKIhpCfMXhD3fs1CIPlVFrY5NJoIo2UG9xThAvlhoVRVjeam3mHMdS"> Today the whole earth is not a pleasant place, not a place of pleasure. Even though people are trying to have their amusements, that is not the real pleasure. The earth today is a messy earth, not a pleasant earth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49003" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> the earth was a pleasant garden, but after the fall of man, this pleasant garden became a messy earth. But when the earth will be measured and given to Christ, it will become a pleasant earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49004" data-verses="Psalms 16:6">Verse 6b</span> says, “Indeed the inheritance is beautiful to Me.” All the nations with the earth will be not only pleasant but also beautiful to Christ as the man who inherited God’s inheritance. </p>
<p data-content-id="7fIo7B_PtuxVHXWcNo-eAFVyAgZW-4YJzsHxBU9VHS6r_ObuAQxI8_Q5fJE47Frz7"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49005" data-verses="Psalms 16:7">Verse 7a</span> says, “I will bless Jehovah, who counsels Me.” Do you like to have someone as your counselor? To take others’ counsel implies humility. A person is humble who wants to receive counsel from others. The Lord Jesus blessed Jehovah, the One who counseled Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49006" data-verses="Isaiah 50:4">Isaiah 50:4</span> tells us the attitude of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah: “The Lord Jehovah has given me / The tongue of the instructed, / That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word. / He awakens me morning by morning; / He awakens my ear / To hear as an instructed one.” Christ, in His human living, had the tongue of an instructed One, and He heard as an instructed One. He took God the Father as His counselor. <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="_Kg3rgsrWaIDsgfCFJ26_uS1zFR7I4zgAOVRYaoYrTK7cWtwrlBYbr6bIuzFYwU_s"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49007" data-verses="Psalms 16:7">Psalm 16:7b</span> says, “Indeed in the nights My inward parts instruct Me.” This shows us that when God counseled Christ as a man, Christ’s inward parts instructed Him. The inward parts of Christ were one with God. God counsels, and the inward parts instruct. This is our proper experience today. On the one hand, it is God who counsels us. On the other hand, it is our inward parts which instruct us. Our inward parts instruct us mostly in the nights while we are quiet. In the night, from four to six in the morning, I receive many things and many instructions from the Lord. Most of the light I have written down in the outlines for these messages has come during these hours. This is an experience of our inward parts instructing us in the nights. </p>
<p data-content-id="Blqqdh81kLssrkuFxB4mmg6vGoAGD5eM2eD35Njpagb8MS9jmxPe2PiUpxlR9O2AT"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49008" data-verses="Psalms 16:8">Verse 8a</span> says, “I have set Jehovah before Me continually.” According to David’s natural concept, he might have said, “I have set the law before me continually.” We may want to say, “I have set the Bible before me continually.” But even this is not as good as saying, “I have set Jehovah, the person, before me continually.” </p>
<p data-content-id="x3A_NVyRy-HcN2uaXwrCJw0fPcSNkQ1jqPzGJPy-vjJMMSTkeSMACaaj1wZdzKNhZ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49009" data-verses="Psalms 16:8">Verse 8b</span> says, “Because He is at My right hand, I shall not be shaken.” Because the Father was at Christ’s right hand, He would not be shaken. Our security is not to keep the law, but to have Jehovah, the person, at our right hand. We shall not be shaken because we have Him as our security. </p>

<p data-content-id="uFsqFRd_NLv7RJd4aDXh8N2O6EDnkND2Dwws_fXkNmAQvidAcHcRx7M_n1Xj0Awsc"> In order to help us understand the book of Psalms and even the entire Bible, we need to see the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible concerning Christ and the law. The spirit of the Bible does not refer to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, directly. The Bible as an entity has its own spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="fV0aAyMXuYdaoZynkbs4NbWffWNZmmM0Y8hBOvH-1E7ENHRl8MwaIW5bA5iMLvlPg"> The book of Psalms, composed of one hundred fifty psalms, is the longest book among the sixty-six books of the Bible. Furthermore, each psalm is not just a story, a history, or a kind of teaching, exhortation, or instruction. Each psalm is man’s speaking to God. In the Psalms we see prayers, thanksgivings, or praises to God. Thus, it is not an ordinary book. Many Bible readers spontaneously and naturally love this book, but they do not know why it is so lovable. The Psalms are very sweet to us because they are man’s talk to God. The title of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49128" data-verses="Psalms 18:1">Psalm 18</span> says that it is a psalm which David “spoke to Jehovah.” This psalm was not just David’s prayer, thanksgiving, or praise, but his speaking to God. When we pray, that is the sweetest time because we are speaking to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVeXjetlwsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> Even in our sweet talk to God, however, we make mistakes. We may be mistaken, but our talk to God is still very sweet. A husband and a wife may speak to each other in a way that is full of mistakes, but their talk to each other can still be very sweet. In order for us to understand such a sweet book as the Psalms which is full of both the divine concept and the human concept with human mistakes, we need to see the way <span class="pg" data-page-id="100" id="100">[100]</span> to understand the Bible. In order to understand the Bible, we need to see the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWw2AGDznao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ">I. THE TWO LINES CONCERNING<br/>GOD’S ETERNAL ECONOMY IN THE PSALMS<br/>AS IN THE ENTIRE SCRIPTURES</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Xcf_6qhqmuUpIGfe8Jx6fOrU3ZlCW67PmCtIfSUeGYkLK3j9subuJKvpbUUJeUzlR">A. The Line of Life versus<br/>the Line of the Knowledge of Good and Evil </h2>
<p data-content-id="jyiBgcfJaOuZcFp53JYpISyZq4nLGYcTPPv0-djD3AT7nms9hwerC-8sv3vMX42bn"> In order to see the two lines of the Bible, we need to go back to the very beginning of the divine revelation at the creation of man. The book of Genesis reveals that God created man in His image so that He could have a vessel to contain Him for His expression (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49129" data-verses="Genesis 1:26-28">1:26-28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49130" data-verses="Genesis 2:7-9">2:7-9</span>). After God created man, He did not give man a long list of instructions. He did not say to man, “Man, you have to know that I am your God. You have to fear Me, love Me, and obey Me. Furthermore, I will make you a wife, and you have to love her. After you have a wife, you will produce children, and you have to listen to Me so that you can pick up the best way to raise them.” God did not do this. </p>
<p data-content-id="TFDIF40UiPk-cgxjaStiHj3hL_RCqdMXeSDN5VOxZEPCgCcaslOmgbIqwsUleJWh8"> After God created man in His own image and after His own likeness, He did not tell man what to do and what not to do. Instead, God brought man into a garden, signifying that God’s intention with man for the accomplishment of His economy needs a pleasant situation, a pleasant environment. Even to carry out the church life, we need a pleasant situation. If there is much complaining, arguing, debating, gossiping, and reasoning among us, the church life cannot be carried out. The garden on this earth today is the place where God’s people are gathered into the Lord’s name. </p>
<p data-content-id="nXSsIWvnEm9T-8mcYN38Ama7PZlKGh2ENS-aZbkA31Stn79c3XGP-e0fZ7Wcfl5i4"> God brought Adam into a garden, into a pleasant environment, and put him in front of two trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49131" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>). God told Adam that he could freely eat of every tree in the garden, including the tree of life, but He warned Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49132" data-verses="Genesis 2:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). In telling Adam that all the trees in the garden were good for food, God was very wise. His intention was to stress to Adam that <span class="pg" data-page-id="101" id="101">[101]</span> the tree of life was good for food. Then God warned Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, telling Adam that if he ate of it, he would surely die. </p>
<p data-content-id="6UcEf2xoIcCLjOF3SwXKcjTJVwO3uC2fFkYMo08kyKe5uy4FS6utSCxH9zoYoGimB"> We need to realize that the entire Bible was written according to these two trees. The entire divine revelation is the development of the notion of these two trees. Genesis shows us man in a pleasant garden with the tree of life before him. Then in Revelation at the end of the divine revelation, we see the tree of life again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49133" data-verses="Revelation 22:2">22:2</span>). The tree of life not only was in the garden but also will be in the eternal city, the New Jerusalem. The line of the tree of life runs through the entire Bible from Genesis to reach the last chapter of the book of Revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="RF99mNghJcAjqAzGSAkwU2VDSbTnyYTK8F_bH0457aEcoqMtCJBP6MvoDLWTtZiuq"> Someone may ask, “What does the Bible teach?” This question can be answered in many ways. We can say that the Bible teaches God’s economy or that it teaches Christ. In this message, I would say that the Bible teaches the tree of life. The Bible is a book which defines the tree of life. Along with the main line of the tree of life, there is another line, the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="swd5PZucw8Weq5orQKdZ_kqoypmNj9flJYCofaCPSu3vPBuDVlmeBwHc2dDffPws_"> When I was very young, I thought that God made a mistake in allowing Satan to exist. If He had not allowed Satan to exist, everything would be fine. Furthermore, after God created man, He did not put man in front of one tree. If there were only one tree, the tree of life, Adam would not have been able to fall even if he had wanted to fall. Why did God allow there to be two trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? We might say that if we were God, we would have had only one tree in the garden. We probably think, “How good it would be if in this whole universe, there were only God, but not Satan.” We might think this, but this is not according to God’s thought. Without Satan, the excellency, the majesty, the wisdom, and the marvelous, wonderful points of God could never be exhibited. God and Satan are two sources in the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="wz9YZjJszQSaVqUbb2iSchI0gtrzM6eJbBJ9AgWWAfl9SPNOQr15VHqMpSEz2Zobj"> The two trees set before man after man’s creation signify God and God’s enemy, His opposite. God is positive, and Satan is negative. From these two sources, there are two flows, and these two flows become two lines. A line is also a way. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> tree of life is a way, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is also a way. The tree that you live by is the way that you live. To live by the tree of life is to live by the way of life. To live by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is to live by the way of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="L6zuCla4RL_Dfjmk9Gp-NyBo-vi7geOvYeyAJwwV7Ig0bDaJc2KxHtWDDozzngrax"> About six thousand years have passed since the time of Adam, and the entire world today is taking the way of the knowledge of good and evil. Families, societies, and nations of the world are formed not by the way of life but by the way of the knowledge of good and evil. But thank the Lord that we are a group of people who have been called out of the group of those who live by the way of the knowledge of good and evil, the way of complication. </p>
<p data-content-id="m0i-wy-RG-xPsDhHONkVSyTp0aEHJYJZEFR9UfXFGxjnD7XcVM08W-VxUhCdMTvok"> Much of the time, however, instead of living by the way of life, we live by the way of the knowledge of good and evil. Day by day we parents raise our children to deal with three things—knowledge, good, and evil. The mothers teach their children with the knowledge of what is good and what is evil. The children are taught in their homes and schools to pick up the proper knowledge to do good and hate evil. The law courts and human governments are set up according to the concept of the knowledge of good and evil. Even Christianity and many other religions have fallen into the same “cage” of the way of the knowledge of good and evil. But we need to be those who are outside of this cage. We do not care for the knowledge of good and of evil. We care only for life. </p>

We may say that these five psalms are five “birds of the same feather.” The taste, the flavor, the spirit, and the attitude are all the same in these psalms. </p>
<p data-content-id="y_qtpCA_Os0zZ8Y1K0v4Ho3TP9n24t68Y4eSGBoEmfCndK11UbLXrTHcfLFkGc3Th"> In the previous message, we saw the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible. The two lines of the Bible are the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the line of the tree of life. We saw that Cain was in the line of knowledge and that Abel was in the line of life. We can either be in the group of Cain or in the group of Abel. </p>
<p data-content-id="8ENujLHBaosPnjKTCIaf6H-muTk0bRCtyxH-7F3HoVERIgtsLU3NTyz-xJOwN2Xhu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49234" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> there is not any hint that David was with Abel. In this psalm every aspect and every point indicate that David stayed with Cain in the line of knowledge. But there are also three stations in the first sixteen psalms in which David was with Abel in the line of life. These three stations are <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49235" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49236" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49237" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16</span>. These psalms are extraordinary and great in unveiling the secret concerning the centrality and universality of Christ in God’s economy. After the first sixteen psalms, we can see that David made some progress and improved in his concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="06PDAD4GrV_FKIhpCfMXvD36i1CIPlVFrY5NJoIo2UG9xThAvlhoVRVjeam3mHMdS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49238" data-verses="Psalms 17:1">Psalms 17—21</span> David jumped out of the line of knowledge a number of times. David at least had a little taste in these psalms of the line of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49239" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalms 22—24</span> are the fourth station of the line of life in the Psalms. These three <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> psalms unveil Christ to us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49240" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalm 22</span> reveals Christ’s death, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49241" data-verses="Psalms 23:1">Psalm 23</span> unveils Christ’s shepherding in His resurrection, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49242" data-verses="Psalms 24:1">Psalm 24</span> shows that Christ will be the overcoming and upcoming King in the age of restoration. </p>
<p data-content-id="7fIo7B_PtuxVHXWcNo-eOFVTPgZW-4YJzsHxBU9VHS6r_ObuAQxI8_Q5fJE47Frz7"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49243" data-verses="Psalms 17:1">Psalms 17—21</span> show us David’s concept concerning two things—concerning a man before God and concerning David’s kingship before God. His concept was based upon the keeping of the law and the principle of good and evil. We can see this in light of the divine revelation in the Bible, particularly in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="x3A_NVyRy-HcN2uaXwrCHw0fHcSNkQ1jqPzGJPy-vjJMMSTkeSMACaaj1wZdzKNhZ"> The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49244" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> Paul said, “I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49245" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Philippians 1:21a</span> Paul said, “For to me, to live is Christ.” These verses reveal a great step forward in the progression of the divine revelation. In the entire thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, we cannot find any word concerning Christ’s living in us and our living Christ. David’s concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49246" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> was that the one who meditates in the law is blessed, but Paul said, “For to me, to live is Christ.” If we desire the blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49247" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>, we are very primitive and backward. Our understanding of the divine revelation of the Bible must be progressive. </p>
<p data-content-id="rrxK-XF2yr3YMWZDIfZH6rKk_jZpP7YHo3mw07NHikAb8Knk8XK9RdNnxWk8yUOYV"> In the Old Testament, we cannot find all the mysterious expressions by Paul. This is because Paul’s ministry was to complete the word of God, the mystery concerning Christ and the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49248" data-verses="Colossians 1:25-26">Col. 1:25-26</span>). If Paul’s fourteen Epistles were taken away from the Bible, we would not know God’s economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49249" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">1 Tim. 1:4</span>), the mystery of God, Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49250" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Col. 2:2</span>), and the mystery of Christ, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49251" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4">Eph. 3:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49252" data-verses="Ephesians 5:32">5:32</span>). There is no word in the Old Testament which says, “To me, to live is Christ.” When we come to the Psalms, we must see them in the light of the full revelation of God’s New Testament economy. </p>

David’s concept improved from his righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49255" data-verses="Psalms 17:1-6">vv. 1-6</span>) to God’s wondrous lovingkindness and God’s hiding him in the shadow of His wings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49256" data-verses="Psalms 17:7-9">vv. 7-9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="OStP7wKqw4XofP1Nzz4oRm4Vxivn3tW4ba4lk0uKaZVu2pdBrTzyGBK2L-ogLSmdV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49257" data-verses="Psalms 17:3">verse 3</span> David said, “You have tried me: You have found nothing. / My thoughts do not pass through my mouth.” David said that his thoughts did not pass through his mouth and that his prayer was not made with “lips of deceit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49258" data-verses="Psalms 17:1">v. 1</span>). James, in the New Testament, said that the hardest thing for us to control is our mouth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49259" data-verses="James 3:1-12">James 3:1-12</span>). But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49260" data-verses="Psalms 17:1">Psalm 17</span>, David told God that he had success in controlling his mouth. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49261" data-verses="Psalms 17:5">verse 5</span> David said, “My steps have held fast to Your tracks; / My footsteps have not slipped.” David said that he was still on God’s track, like a locomotive which is still on the rails. </p>
<p data-content-id="4Pl1H-TvAJj7lZqOZ3beHXc6dXEYW2Yis2c6ZRGIY5fJcSQcdP3Ys4DBvkiP0VUqd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49262" data-verses="Psalms 17:7-9">verses 7-9</span> David’s concept turned from his righteousness to God’s wondrous lovingkindness and God’s hiding him in the shadow of His wings. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49263" data-verses="Psalms 17:8">verse 8</span> he prayed, “Guard me like the apple of Your eye; / In the shadow of Your wings hide me.” David enjoyed the shadow of God’s wings, and he even enjoyed being guarded like the apple of God’s eye. </p>
<p data-content-id="oaKMapIqH0taB_HBBSgnnwZPLCm6qQIfo0VKLpq7SbpietHAMYoHv6iuAZG_bJfmq"> In the first six verses he was in his righteousness. He was boasting of his righteousness. James said that no one can control his mouth, but David said that God examined him and found nothing. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49264" data-verses="Psalms 17:7-9">verses 7-9</span>, however, he came out of his righteousness. He entered into God’s eye and came under God’s wings to enjoy the shadow. His boasting in his righteousness was in the line of the tree of knowledge, but God’s eye and God’s wings are in the line of the tree of life. This shows an improvement in David’s concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6fom0qfdlS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c"> Right after this, however, David turned his attention to his enemies. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49265" data-verses="Psalms 17:10-14">Verses 10-14</span> are his accusation of his enemies. After the mentioning of his enjoyment in God’s eye and under God’s wings, he could not forget his enemies. To accuse our enemies and to ask God to bring them down (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49266" data-verses="Psalms 17:13">v. 13a</span>) is not a prayer according to God’s economy. In God’s economy, God tells us to love our enemies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49267" data-verses="Matthew 5:44">Matt. 5:44</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW7n_vvpZA7ULO884Evt-HlnAm8UKndBtrUuO3Kkg1_Ay9Dcj0p0s6xSsEx_kZu_"> At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49268" data-verses="Psalms 17:1">Psalm 17</span>, we can see David’s improvement in <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> the satisfaction with God’s likeness (presence), yet he was still remaining in his righteousness before God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49269" data-verses="Psalms 17:15">v. 15</span>). How could David boast of his righteousness when he committed such a sinful act by taking Bathsheba and murdering her husband, Uriah? God forgave David of this great sin, but He did not forget what David did. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49270" data-verses="1Kings 15:5">First Kings 15:5</span> says that David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite. Much later, in the New Testament, the genealogy of Christ in the book of Matthew says, “David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49271" data-verses="Matthew 1:6">1:6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="cT8NrRFfPzsynu5lLu-GNbdReoBuqjDuifVLWXa6H4_HpI5ahTZpRhf9TqTD8W_99"> The Bible tells us that in the new covenant, God forgives our sins and does not remember them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49272" data-verses="Hebrews 8:12">Heb. 8:12</span>). Why then did God record David’s failure in the genealogy of Christ? This shows us that the Bible is not easy to understand. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49273" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psalm 51</span> shows that God forgave David, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49274" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> God still mentioned Uriah, meaning that God did not forget. Uriah was a Hittite, a heathen. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49275" data-verses="Matthew 1:6">Matthew 1:6</span> says that David begot Solomon “of her who had been the wife of Uriah” to emphasize David’s great sin, thus showing that Christ as the kingly Savior is related not only to the heathen but also to sinners. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2oy2HGdbUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> In spite of David’s great sin, he said in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49276" data-verses="Psalms 17:15">Psalm 17:15</span>, “As for me, in righteousness will I look into Your face.” He still remained in his righteousness before God, but at least in one sense, he was not in righteousness. James said, “Whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49277" data-verses="James 2:10">James 2:10</span>). We have seen previously that David, by his one transgression, directly broke the last five commandments because he murdered, committed adultery, stole, lied, and coveted (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49278" data-verses="Exodus 20:13-17">Exo. 20:13-17</span>). David should have said that he would look into God’s face because of God’s mercy and lovingkindness. God’s lovingkindness is versus David’s righteousness. What is trustworthy—David’s righteousness or God’s lovingkindness? If God would examine us to the uttermost, how could we stand? We could not stand before God’s face in our righteousness. We have to hide ourselves under the shadow of His wings. </p>
<p data-content-id="E4td5kmomfAjeGazEU83Wwk-djy28rxL8oQNM-rYLdkLIoLtHs8mIAM7ZuMPCTHuG"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49279" data-verses="Psalms 17:1">Psalm 17</span> we see David’s human concept, but we also see <span class="pg" data-page-id="119" id="119">[119]</span> the improvement of his concept. We see his improving from being “Cain-David” to being “Abel-David.” </p>

The top psalms we have seen thus far are <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49352" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49353" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49354" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16</span>. Now we come to the fourth top psalm, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49355" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalm 22</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="K1eAihiqzvOD_ioDc2UNTRfiJEn8sDcLTtT8TGFcTdIl76OxcXwPf6jwTsqT2wjk7"> Generally speaking, we love every psalm because every psalm is full of an aspiration to seek after God, to pray to Him, to contact Him, and to receive the spiritual help from Him. Even <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49356" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> does this. We have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49357" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> uplifts the law instead of Christ, but we should not condemn <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49358" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> to the extent that we give it up. That is wrong. We have to love every psalm because every psalm as the Word of God is eatable (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49359" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:16">Jer. 15:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49360" data-verses="Matthew 4:4">Matt. 4:4</span>). If you are weak or down, you can read one psalm a number of times with some amount of prayer. Then you will be nourished. Every psalm can be a spiritual supply to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="lnStf6w0mGYlfBdHZPgvJ2mph4W_Vp4Xr-bbSzE8X4PBExpGgaJ9ExBbKKISN9aOg"> But often we receive this spiritual supply in a wrong way. Eating is not that simple. We need the proper groceries and the proper way to cook them. This is why we need to enter into the right way to understand all of the psalms one by one. My burden is mainly to show us that the book of Psalms, in the proper understanding, is centered on Christ. The Psalms are fully Christ-centered. Christ is not only the centrality but also the universality of the Psalms. I believe that the Lord has given us the proper and particular way to study, to know, and to interpret the Psalms.

The hind of the dawn here refers to the Christ in resurrection. There was such a teaching in the church, in the Body of Christ, in the past. I received this light through Brother Watchman Nee. This title of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49363" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalm 22</span> shows that it is a psalm concerning Christ in resurrection. Christ is a hind. He is a leaping, jumping, active, living deer. A hind is a fast animal. When a hind runs, it leaps; it jumps. Christ in resurrection is the leaping One (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49364" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:8-9">S. S. 2:8-9</span>). </p>

Even a year ago, we did not have the idea to go to Russia. The decision to follow the Lord to “leap” for His move in Russia was on Memorial Day of last year, 1991. This move is surely the move of the Christ in resurrection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49365" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalm 22</span> is on Christ as the hind of the dawn, the resurrected Christ in the early morning. </p>

David was <span class="pg" data-page-id="129" id="129">[129]</span> complaining to God. He asked God why He had forsaken him, saying that he called out to God, but God did not answer him. Our God is loving and is also very patient with us. David was groaning before God. Have we ever groaned before God? We all may have prayed, but not many of us have groaned before God. </p>
<p data-content-id="pOSFl8c_X-HYWYsp6UJY21n_3h2lwww2mnDf2YZn0tCbZM12hbPXMVxewp8ZD97ww"> Our God is surely a loving God, but sometimes it seems that He is not so loving. Instead of being promoted, a brother may be laid off. Another brother may not be healed of his illness, even though he has prayed for three months. God surely hears our prayers, but many times He does not answer our prayers which are not according to His desire, His economy, His plan. When our prayer does not work, we have to learn to come to God to complain to Him. We should not be those who merely praise or pray to God. We need to realize that God likes to hear our complaints. </p>

I hope that some, especially the young people, would remember these words which describe the Lord’s suffering. Each of them has a particular meaning to describe what the Lord suffered on the cross. We may have never considered the significance of each of these words. This shows that when we read the Bible, we have a tendency to take everything for granted. </p>
<p data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWwyIGDapao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ"> The word <em>reproach</em> is also used in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49385" data-verses="Hebrews 13:13">Hebrews 13:13</span>, which says, “Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.” This indicates that we need to come outside the camp of religion to follow the suffering Jesus. To bear the Lord’s reproach is to bear His disgrace or shame. To despise is to look down on with contempt and scorn. To deride is to make fun of or laugh at in contempt. To sneer is to smile or laugh with facial contortions that express scorn or contempt. When Christ was on the cross, the ridiculers also shook, or wagged, their heads (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49386" data-verses="Psalms 22:7">Psa. 22:7b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49387" data-verses="Matthew 27:39">Matt. 27:39</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49388" data-verses="Mark 15:29">Mark 15:29</span>), saying, “He committed himself to Jehovah; let Him rescue him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49389" data-verses="Psalms 22:8">Psa. 22:8a</span>). To mock is to hold up to scorn or contempt and to imitate or mimic in derision. All these things were suffered by the Lord Jesus Christ while He was nailed on the cross. Groups of people reproached Him, despised Him, derided Him, sneered at Him, shook their heads at Him, and mocked Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_pFM3JSAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV"> Years ago, I read an article describing how the children of Israel slew the lamb during the Passover. They took two wooden bars and formed a cross. They tied two legs of the lamb at the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the crossbar. Then they slew the lamb so that all its blood was shed, for they needed all of the blood to sprinkle on their doorframes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49395" data-verses="Exodus 12:7">Exo. 12:7</span>). The way the Passover lamb was killed is a picture of Christ’s crucifixion on the cross as the Lamb of God. </p>

The church in the Bible is called a flock. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49464" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span> the Lord said that He was the good Shepherd who would collect the sheep from Israel and from the Gentiles to form them into one flock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49465" data-verses="John 10:14-16">vv. 14-16</span>), which is the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49466" data-verses="1Peter 5:2">1 Pet. 5:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49467" data-verses="Acts 20:28">Acts 20:28</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="gPfbBHDneBjs_yEzYD3OyVyHTd2UeNDPuK-ioxqWo82BpQ0oXABpY_L_3MbRH5kXR"> Jehovah, of course, is the divine God, and we are mere humans. How can God, the divine One, approach us human beings to be our Shepherd? If God would come to us in a direct way, that might frighten us to the uttermost. The Bible tells us that this happened when God appeared to various people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49468" data-verses="Revelation 1:17">Rev. 1:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49469" data-verses="Genesis 17:3">Gen. 17:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49470" data-verses="Daniel 8:17">Dan. 8:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49471" data-verses="Matthew 17:6">Matt. 17:6</span>).

How can the divine Triune God be so close to us, just as a shepherd is to his flock? Furthermore, how can we <span class="pg" data-page-id="138" id="138">[138]</span> sinners, the fallen people, be the flock of the divine Shepherd? According to our fallen nature we are snakes, vipers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49475" data-verses="Matthew 23:33">Matt. 23:33</span>), and “scorpions.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ex-VBPE6iEBPGjLm6o1AEZdLMA6QdIW9p5b-_TOqQLTnIw18TKY2WJPOMgBwUFYmG"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49476" data-verses="Psalms 23:1">Psalm 23</span> implies that this Shepherd is the One who became a man, who died for us to redeem us and wash away our sins, and who entered into resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49477" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>) to regenerate us. As such a One, He can change our nature. Since He has taken these three steps—1) incarnation; 2) crucifixion for redemption; and 3) resurrection for regenerating—He is altogether qualified, equipped, and suitable to be our Shepherd. He is not only God but also a man. He is not only divine but also human. He died for our sins, He was resurrected, and in His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="oaKMapIqH0taB_HBBSgjvwZPDCm6qQIfo0VKLpq7SbpietHAMYoHv6iuAZG_bJfmq"> The Lord Jesus today is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49478" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). As the life-giving Spirit, He is our Shepherd inwardly. He is not only with us but also within us. We were snakes and scorpions, but we have been redeemed, we have been washed in His blood, and we have been resurrected (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49479" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Eph. 2:6</span>) and regenerated. As those who have been redeemed, washed, resurrected, and regenerated, we are the sheep of God’s flock, the church. By Jehovah, the Triune God, being incarnated, crucified, and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, He is qualified to be our Shepherd. By His redeeming, washing, resurrecting, and regenerating us, we are qualified to be His flock. He is qualified to be our Shepherd, and we are also qualified to be His flock. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49480" data-verses="Psalms 23:1">Psalm 23</span> is altogether a psalm on Christ as the Shepherd in His resurrection. </p>

When we see the green trees and pastures, we see the riches of life. If the trees are yellow and dried up and the grass is brown, this indicates death. </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW7n_vvpZA7ULO884Erl-HplAm8UKndBtrUuO3Kkg1_Ay9Dcj0p0s6xSsEx_kZu_"> The green pastures signify the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus spoke concerning this in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49482" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span>. He said that His sheep would hear His voice and follow Him out of the fold to enjoy the green pastures as the flock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49483" data-verses="John 10:9">vv. 9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49484" data-verses="John 10:16">16</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49485" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10</span>, Christ is the door (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49486" data-verses="John 10:9">v. 9</span>), the Shepherd (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49487" data-verses="John 10:11">v. 11</span>), and the pasture (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49488" data-verses="John 10:9">v. 9</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="139" id="139">[139]</span> Christ Himself is our pasture, our nourishment. He is the feeding place for all the sheep. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49489" data-verses="John 6:1">John 6</span> Christ said that He is the bread of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49490" data-verses="John 6:35">v. 35</span>) to nourish us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49491" data-verses="John 6:57">v. 57</span>). The “bread” for the sheep is the green pasture, so the green pasture is Christ. Christ can be our green pasture through His incarnation, death, and resurrection. After His incarnation, death, and resurrection, He is growing here as the green pasture for our nourishment. </p>
<p data-content-id="cT8NrRFfPzsynu5lLu-CFbddcoBuqjDuifVLWXa6H4_HpI5ahTZpRhf9TqTD8W_99"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49492" data-verses="Psalms 23:2">Psalm 23:2b</span> says that Christ as our Shepherd leads us to waters of rest. The waters of rest are the Spirit. The Spirit is the water, and Christ is the pasture. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49493" data-verses="Psalms 23:5">Verse 5</span> says, “You anoint my head with oil.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49494" data-verses="Hebrews 1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span> refers to the oil of exultant joy. This oil signifies the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49495" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span> says that before Christ’s resurrection, the Spirit was not yet. This means that the Spirit was not yet consummated. The Spirit of God has been consummated through Christ’s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. In Christ’s resurrection, the Spirit of God became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49496" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). Now He is available to us because He has been consummated. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49497" data-verses="Psalms 23:1">Psalm 23</span>, the Spirit as typified by the waters and the oil signifies the consummated Spirit after Christ’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2o2-HGRdUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> This psalm also tells us that Christ’s shepherding of us is in five stages. The first stage is of the pastures and the waters of rest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49498" data-verses="Psalms 23:2">v. 2</span>). Pasture and waters are for our nourishment, including cherishing and enjoyment. The second stage is the stage of the paths of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49499" data-verses="Psalms 23:3">v. 3</span>). The paths of righteousness indicate our walk. After we enjoy Christ, are filled up with Christ, and are nourished by Christ, we walk on the paths of righteousness. The third stage is the valley of the shadow of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49500" data-verses="Psalms 23:4">v. 4</span>). The valley, the shadow, and death are not pleasant. Christ’s shepherding leads us through the valley of the shadow of death. The fourth stage is the battlefield (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49501" data-verses="Psalms 23:5">v. 5</span>), where we are fighting against the adversaries. At the battlefield a table, a feast, is spread for us. Finally, the last stage is to dwell in the house of God all the days of our life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49502" data-verses="Psalms 23:6">v. 6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="E4td5kmomfAjeGazEU8zewkybjy28rxL8oQNM-rYLdkLIoLtHs8mIAM7ZuMPCTHuG"> I would like us to consider what stage we are in among these five stages of Christ’s shepherding. The first stage is the initial stage of enjoyment. This is just like elementary school. <span class="pg" data-page-id="140" id="140">[140]</span> In our educational system there are five stages—elementary, junior high, high school, college, and graduate school. This is comparable to the five stages of Christ’s shepherding in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49503" data-verses="Psalms 23:1">Psalm 23</span>. Many of us are in “elementary school” while others are in “high school” in their experience of Christ. A brother who is more mature in the Lord and who has been a seeking Christian for many years may have passed through all five stages of Christ’s shepherding. Now in his present experience, he may say that he experiences all five stages at various times. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="DTkPp079Cp66d6XMH5N9xJFtwknnEno0ABS1nCLXQ91_Z47wAvbepEUjXUVIJrvBR">A.

Because He is our Shepherd, we will lack nothing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49505" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">Phil. 1:19b</span>). Right after we were saved, we entered into this first stage of enjoyment. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49506" data-verses="John 21:1">John 21</span> the Lord Jesus asked Peter if he loved Him. When Peter said that he did love the Lord, the Lord charged him to feed His lambs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49507" data-verses="John 21:15">v. 15</span>). We need to be like nursing mothers to cherish and feed the little ones under our care (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49508" data-verses="1Thessalonians 2:7">1 Thes. 2:7</span>). Right after a child is delivered, a mother feeds the child so he can grow. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPfbBHDneBjs_yEzYD3OyVyiRd2UeNDPuK-ioxqWo82BpQ0oXABpY_L_3MbRH5kXR"> In the initial stage of the enjoyment of Christ, the lambs, the infants, feed on Christ as the green pasture (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49509" data-verses="John 10:9">John 10:9</span>). Infants do not have table manners. All the little lambs lie down to eat the pasture without any thought of manners. Christ makes us to lie down, not sit down in a mannerly way, in green pastures. This kind of eating, without the thought for proper manners, is more enjoyable. The little lamb lying down in the pasture and eating the grass does not have to worry about proper table manners. This is just like an infant lying in the bosom of his nursing mother. No table manners are necessary. </p>

Thus far in our fellowship, we have seen four major stations concerning Christ—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49567" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalms 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49568" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49569" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">16</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49570" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">22—24</span>. We all need to see the particular aspects of Christ revealed in these psalms. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49571" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> tells us that Christ is God’s anointed One. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49572" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span> reveals Christ as the incarnated and crowned One, the excellent One in all the earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49573" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16</span> reveals Christ in His human living. It shows that Christ lived on this earth as a God-man, died on the cross, resurrected, and then ascended to the right hand of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49574" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalm 22</span> shows us Christ crucified and resurrected to produce His brothers to constitute His Body, the church. Then in resurrection in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49575" data-verses="Psalms 23:1">Psalm 23</span>, He became our Shepherd, shepherding us through five stages of enjoyment. Eventually, He will come back to be the King of glory, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49576" data-verses="Psalms 24:1">Psalm 24</span>. These psalms present us a completed Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="VRhjPpz4JdnWROtHhxAa1OTigFNWmZKbLuiblGSkCvPkgGcqezXq0pmSA19ZCDN-R"> After these first four stations concerning Christ in the Psalms, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49577" data-verses="Psalms 25:1">Psalms 25—41</span> follow as a group of psalms showing us the mixed expressions in the psalmist’s sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God’s house. In these seventeen psalms, the main point, the major point, the crucial point, is the enjoyment of God in the house of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="iTbtceJp8CRsXmWGS1x8ypUDSn5u1SBErA31-m4XYfmciafaweXi21GVgQC5RY84s"> We have to realize that God is located! On the one hand, He is not a wandering God, but on the other hand, He is omnipresent. He is everywhere. Thus, He is the universal God, yet the universal God today is located! The house in which we live has an address, which indicates that we are <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> located. People can write us letters if they know our street address and the city in which we live. Because we are located, people can contact us. Today our God is located. He has an address, and we can contact Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49578" data-verses="Psalms 25:1">Psalms 25—41</span> we can see the location of God. This location is also mentioned in the foregoing psalms. The universal God is located in His house, His dwelling place. </p>

THE REVELATION OF THE PSALMS BEGINNING<br/>WITH THE PSALMIST STRESSING THE LAW AND<br/>WITH THE SPIRIT TURNING THE PSALMIST TO CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="9MAUzofrAke3GqQ7OVHzczPYWOfx6kgwnnDYK-CGhCzbB6sVxNA-LxpdL8yQCdNvA"> The revelation of the Psalms begins with the psalmist stressing the law and with the Spirit turning the psalmist to Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49579" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psa. 1—2</span>). When the psalmist began in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49580" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> by stressing the law, he was going in the wrong direction. In the first psalm, the psalmist seeking after God was driving on the wrong highway, so the Spirit came in to turn him to the right way. </p>
<p data-content-id="vBfgOzkctJI64y2wITHEIymWk_4dy56NbUV4FCRoxvXeePiesyP8cinOML7yllUh0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49581" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> the psalmist began to enjoy Christ—to take refuge in this Christ and to kiss this Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49582" data-verses="Psalms 2:12">v. 12</span>). The highest and best enjoyment of human life is kissing. When a child is born, the parents and grandparents enjoy kissing this child. If a person had no one whom he could kiss, he would surely be one of the most miserable people on earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49583" data-verses="Psalms 2:12">Psalm 2:12</span> commands us to “kiss the Son.” Kissing Christ is the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtbcvCEgnrqy-dE42XroHQcKYhMyCDtcObPJRXsB2bnNVrU4zObvTu4Y4s7w2TT6w"> Some may wonder where the word <em>enjoyment</em> is in the Bible concerning our relationship with Christ. Although this word is not in the Bible, the fact of the enjoyment of Christ is there. It is the same with the words <em>trinity</em> and <em>triune.</em> Although these words are not in the Bible, the early church fathers discovered the fact in the Bible that our God is triune, that He is the Divine Trinity. In like manner, the word <em>enjoyment</em> is not found in the Scriptures, but the fact is there. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49584" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> we are told to kiss the Son. <em>The Son</em> is a pleasant title. Kissing the Son is enjoying the Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="2FPleOiE4aUvfE8GzHzPCEHaZIW1AzsIZaZoPhLsk6jHm_KkdS_Ik8gSZ9f6uN5g1"> The enjoyment of Christ in the Psalms begins with kissing the Son in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49585" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>. This enjoyment continues in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49586" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span>, in which the psalmist declares, “How excellent is Your name / In <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> all the earth!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49587" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">vv. 1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49588" data-verses="Psalms 8:9">9</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49589" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16</span> is also full of enjoyment. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49590" data-verses="Psalms 16:11">Verse 11</span> of this psalm says, “You will make known to Me the path of life; / In Your presence is fullness of joy; / In Your right hand there are pleasures forever.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49591" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalm 22</span> gives us a very vivid picture of Christ’s death on the cross. It also shows us His church-producing resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49592" data-verses="Psalms 22:22">v. 22</span>). In Christ’s resurrection His God is our God, His Father is our Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49593" data-verses="John 20:17">John 20:17</span>), and we are His brothers. The apostle Paul quoted <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49594" data-verses="Psalms 22:22">Psalm 22:22</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49595" data-verses="Hebrews 2:12">Hebrews 2:12</span>, pointing out that the Lord’s brothers are the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="uFsqFRd_NLv7RJd4aDXl2N2fzEDnkND2Dwws_fXkNmAQvidAcHcRx7M_n1Xj0Awsc"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49596" data-verses="Psalms 23:1">Psalm 23</span> is full of the enjoyment of Christ as our Shepherd. Many Christians love <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49597" data-verses="Psalms 23:1">Psalm 23</span>, but not many have the realization that in this psalm they need to kiss Christ as the Shepherd. We saw in the previous message that Christ as the Shepherd leads us through five stages of enjoyment. The first stage is that of the green pastures and the waters of rest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49598" data-verses="Psalms 23:2">v. 2</span>). The second stage is the paths of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49599" data-verses="Psalms 23:3">v. 3</span>), and the third stage is the experience of Christ’s presence through the valley of the shadow of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49600" data-verses="Psalms 23:4">v. 4</span>). The fourth stage is the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ, in which we enjoy the Lord’s table in the presence of our adversaries (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49601" data-verses="Psalms 23:5">v. 5</span>). This implies that we are enjoying the Lord on the battlefield. The fifth and final stage is the lifelong enjoyment of the divine goodness and kindness in the house of Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49602" data-verses="Psalms 23:6">v. 6</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49603" data-verses="Psalms 24:1">Psalm 24</span> goes on to show that the victorious Christ as the King of glory is coming to reign as the King in God’s kingdom. All these points in the Psalms indicate that Christ is enjoyable. </p>

THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST LEADING THE PSALMIST<br/>TO THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVadje0qwsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> The enjoyment of Christ leads the psalmist to another state of enjoyment—the enjoyment of God in the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49604" data-verses="Psalms 25:1">Psa. 25—41</span>). God Himself is enjoyable, and His dwelling place is also enjoyable. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49605" data-verses="Psalms 27:4">Psalm 27:4</span> says, “One thing I have asked from Jehovah; / That do I seek: / To dwell in the house of Jehovah / All the days of my life, / To behold the loveliness of Jehovah, / And to inquire in His temple.” The one thing that David asked from God and sought was to dwell in the house <span class="pg" data-page-id="154" id="154">[154]</span> of God to behold His beauty. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49606" data-verses="Psalms 27:4">Psalm 27:4</span> shows us that our God is a lovable person with a lovely dwelling. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49607" data-verses="Psalms 36:1">Psalm 36</span> also tells us that we can be abundantly satisfied with the fatness, the abundance, of God’s house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49608" data-verses="Psalms 36:8">v. 8</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWwyKGDWrao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ">A.

The Scriptures reveal that God is located! Outside of Christ, we cannot find God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49609" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). Christ is God’s location, and the address of God is just one word—<em>Christ.</em> Christ is the street address and the city of God. If we say, “O God, where are You?” He will say, “I am in Christ.” If we come to Christ, we will meet God. Whenever we call, “Lord Jesus,” we have the sensation that God is present with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="kVUJkTRCD2ceWNANfSpiRXqjETkTgrwo3WzP5v2H-gzE3CDAPM4O-xZzgNga2L9ku"> The revelation of God’s house, His dwelling place, is not that simple. In the Old Testament time, God had His residence in the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49610" data-verses="1Kings 8:30">1 Kings 8:30b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49611" data-verses="1Kings 8:39">39a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49612" data-verses="1Kings 8:43">43a</span>), and He also had a “retreat place” on Mount Zion in the center of Jerusalem in Palestine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49613" data-verses="Psalms 76:2">Psa. 76:2b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49614" data-verses="Psalms 135:21">135:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49615" data-verses="Isaiah 8:18">Isa. 8:18</span>). In the center of Jerusalem, there was a temple, which could be considered as God’s retreat place. A number of rich people have a residence and a retreat place. The residence is quite common, whereas the retreat place is very particular. If the weather is too hot or too cold, a person will go to his retreat place. The temple on Mount Zion within Jerusalem was God’s retreat place. </p>

These four stations are <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49669" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49670" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49671" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49672" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalms 22—24</span>. Now we have come to the final part of Book One of the Psalms, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49673" data-verses="Psalms 25:1">Psalms 25—41</span>. The general title of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49674" data-verses="Psalms 25:1">Psalms 25—41</span> is “The Mixed Expressions of the Psalmist’s Sentiment in His Enjoyment of God in God’s House.” We need to consider the meaning of the word <em>sentiment.</em> A person’s sentiment is the condition of his inward situation. When David was writing these psalms, there was a certain inward situation with him. He wrote these psalms according to an “inward scenery.” </p>
<p data-content-id="L6zuCla4RL_Dfjmk9Gp6GyBxzvi7geOvYeyAJwwV7Ig0bDaJc2KxHtWDDozzngrax"> David was not a superficial, shallow person. He was extremely thoughtful. When he was writing these psalms, there was much feeling, thought, and consideration within him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49675" data-verses="Psalms 25:1">Psalms 25—41</span> are David’s mixed expressions of his inward sentiment, his inward situation, his inward scenery, in his enjoyment of God in God’s house. Expressions are outward; sentiment is inward. In David’s enjoyment of God in God’s house, he had many inward feelings and thoughts, so he expressed them. </p>
<p data-content-id="m0i-wy-RG-xPsDhHONkRZyTM2aEHJYJZEFR9UfXFGxjnD7XcVM08W-VxUhCdMTvok"> These seventeen psalms contain many mixed expressions.

Some of his expressions should be put under our feet, whereas others should be <span class="pg" data-page-id="166" id="166">[166]</span> uplifted to the uttermost. The expressions in these psalms are either divine, good, or bad. We need the proper discernment concerning whether these expressions belong to the tree of life or to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>

A way is a main road, and a path is a lane or a trail, a small road. In the divine things of God, in His divine revelation, there are ways, main roads, and there are paths. We need to seek God’s guidance and teaching in His ways and in His paths. </p>

Does this belong to the tree of life or to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? We cannot answer this question in a definite way because David sought God according to and in the age of the old covenant under the law. Today we are in the new covenant under grace. <span class="pg" data-page-id="167" id="167">[167]</span> In the old covenant age, David’s lifting up his soul to God, trusting in God, and waiting on God were very good, but they are not up to the standard of the new covenant.

The way for us to enter into the New Testament age is by our confession of sins plus God’s forgiveness of our sins. This is the threshold of the New Testament age.

Be assured that God, being good and upright, instructs us sinners concerning how to confess and how to receive His forgiveness. </p>
<p data-content-id="9MAUzofrAke3GqQ7OVHzdzP1dOfx6kgwnnDYK-CGhCzbB6sVxNA-LxpdL8yQCdNvA"> David also said that God guides and teaches the lowly His way in justice and treats those who observe His covenant and testimonies in lovingkindness and truth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49685" data-verses="Psalms 25:9-10">vv. 9-10</span>). The word <em>testimonies</em> in the Psalms refers to the law with the Ten <span class="pg" data-page-id="168" id="168">[168]</span> Commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances. In addition to the Ten Commandments, the law of Moses has many statutes. Then when the statutes are accompanied by judgments, they become ordinances. Ordinances are statutes with judgments. These are the three categories of the law—the Ten Commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances. In total, the law is God’s testimony. In David’s expressions we can see that he was in the sphere, the atmosphere, and even the element of the law, because he was born and living in the age of the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="jyiBgcfJaOuZcFp53JYtDSyVo4nLGYcTPPv0-djD3AT7nms9hwerC-8sv3vMX42bn"> In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus did not teach people to keep the Old Testament law. According to the teaching of the Lord Jesus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49686" data-verses="Matthew 5:1">Matthew 5—7</span>, His inner law, the law of the kingdom of the heavens, is much higher and much deeper than the Ten Commandments. The law of the old covenant deals with the act of murder (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49687" data-verses="Matthew 5:21">Matt. 5:21</span>), but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49688" data-verses="Matthew 5:22">v. 22</span>). Anger produces murder, so in the New Testament, anger is equal to murder. </p>
<p data-content-id="TFDIF40UiPk-cgxjaStmMj3tJ_RCqdMXeSDN5VOxZEPCgCcaslOmgbIqwsUleJWh8"> David goes on to say that God instructs the man who fears Him concerning the way that he should choose (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49689" data-verses="Psalms 25:12">Psa. 25:12</span>). If you are such a person, David says that you will be one whose soul will dwell in prosperity and whose seed will possess the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49690" data-verses="Psalms 25:13">v. 13</span>). This concept is according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. To follow the Lord in the New Testament, we must forsake everything. Did the apostle Paul enjoy any kind of outward prosperity? He did not even have a family. He forsook all and lost everything in his pursuit of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="nXSsIWvnEm9T-8mcYN34Lma3JZlKGh2ENS-aZbkA31Stn79c3XGP-e0fZ7Wcfl5i4"> David also said that God makes known to those who fear Him His intimate counsel and His covenant. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49691" data-verses="Psalms 25:14">Verse 14</span> says, “The intimate counsel of Jehovah belongs to those who fear Him, / And His covenant will He make known to them.” David put the covenant, the law, together with God’s intimate counsel. This is a mixed expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="6UcEf2xoIcCLjOF3SwXOXjTFTwO3uC2fFkYMo08kyKe5uy4FS6utSCxH9zoYoGimB"> I would like us to consider whether we have ever experienced God’s intimate counsel. Many Christians love the Psalms because it is filled with sweet terms such as <em>intimate counsel.</em> I experienced God’s intimate counsel in a very real <span class="pg" data-page-id="169" id="169">[169]</span> way when I was imprisoned by the Japanese invading army about fifty years ago in mainland China. The Japanese military police put me into prison twice, the second time for thirty days. I passed through many sufferings during that time, but God preserved me. Furthermore, through a dream God gave me the assurance that my life would be preserved. Even today this dream is still being fulfilled. The Lord also gave me other dreams during this period of imprisonment. All of these dreams were the very intimate counsel of God to me in my time of suffering. In one sense, I was suffering in prison, but the Lord was within me in an intimate way to give me His intimate counsel. I can also testify that I have enjoyed God’s intimate counsel throughout the many years of my Christian life. </p>

<p data-content-id="vBfgOzkctJI64y2wITHEOymLu_4dy56NbUV4FCRoxvXeePiesyP8cinOML7yllUh0"> In this message we want to see the mixed expressions of the psalmist’s sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God’s house in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49748" data-verses="Psalms 28:1">Psalms 28—30</span>. When we put these three psalms under the “microscope” of God’s New Testament economy, it is difficult to find anything in them that is up to the divine standard. The only point that might be worthwhile for us New Testament believers to consider is that David said his heart trusted in God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49749" data-verses="Psalms 28:7">Psa. 28:7</span>). Of course, when David said this, he did not have the realization that we have today in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtbcvCEgnrqy-dE42XroBQcTThMyCDtcObPJRXsB2bnNVrU4zObvTu4Y4s7w2TT6w"> It is somewhat easy to understand what is written in many of the psalms. In the New Testament, however, there are sayings which are very mysterious and difficult to understand. The Lord Jesus said, “Abide in Me and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49750" data-verses="John 15:4">John 15:4a</span>). This is a very simple word, but who can fully understand it? When I was a young Christian, I tried to find a book to help me understand what it meant to abide in Christ. Eventually, I found a book by Andrew Murray concerning abiding in Christ, but all he said was that consecrating ourselves is to abide in Christ. This book did not help me understand what it means to abide in Christ. The truth concerning abiding in Christ is very mysterious and deep. </p>
<p data-content-id="2FPleOiE4aUvfE8GzHzPEEH_RIW1AzsIZaZoPhLsk6jHm_KkdS_Ik8gSZ9f6uN5g1"> There are many things in the New Testament that are simple in terminology but deep and mysterious in their <span class="pg" data-page-id="178" id="178">[178]</span> significance. The New Testament frequently uses the expression <em>in Christ</em> or <em>in the Lord.</em> When some missionaries translated the Bible into Chinese, they thought that the Chinese would not be able to understand the usage of the preposition <em>in.</em> Therefore, they translated “in the Lord” as “trust in the Lord” or “rely upon the Lord.” This translation, however, brings in a wrong concept. Noah and his family had to get into the ark in order to be saved by the ark from God’s judgment. In order to be saved they could not merely rely upon the ark; they had to be in the ark. </p>
<p data-content-id="uFsqFRd_NLv7RJd4aDXlwN2-6EDnkND2Dwws_fXkNmAQvidAcHcRx7M_n1Xj0Awsc"> The New Testament terms are deep because the New Testament was written based upon the principle of the New Testament economy, which is the manifestation of God in the flesh. The great mystery of godliness is the manifestation of God in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49751" data-verses="1Timothy 3:16">1 Tim. 3:16</span>). No one can fully comprehend this. No one can understand what Paul meant when he said, “I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49752" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20a</span>). Who can understand what Paul meant when he said, “For to me, to live is Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49753" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21a</span>)? He also said that he labored more abundantly than all the apostles, yet it was not he but the grace of God which was with him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49754" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Cor. 15:10</span>). He spoke of the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit being with us all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49755" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>). In Philippians he spoke of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ being our salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49756" data-verses="Philippians 1:19">1:19</span>). We may read these expressions in the Bible, but who can understand them? It is easy for us to understand many of the psalms because they were written according to our human concept. The New Testament, however, was written altogether according to another concept on another “planet.” This is why it is so difficult to understand. </p>
<p data-content-id="kVUJkTRCD2ceWNANfSpiXXqjMTkTgrwo3WzP5v2H-gzE3CDAPM4O-xZzgNga2L9ku"> The New Testament charges us to believe <em>into</em> Christ, the Son. Many will not translate this Greek word as <em>into,</em> because they say that this is not good English. They maintain that <em>into</em> should be translated as <em>in.</em> In other words, we are to believe in Christ. The word <em>in,</em> however, should actually be translated as <em>into.</em> We do not merely believe in Christ; we believe <em>into</em> Christ. To believe <em>into</em> Christ is to receive Him <span class="pg" data-page-id="179" id="179">[179]</span> and be united with Him as one. The word <em>into</em> conveys this divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHveJpVKE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> The writer of a book entitled <em>Bone of His Bone</em> quotes Jessie Penn-Lewis as saying that the Greek text of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49757" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> conveys a different meaning from our English versions. It is not he who believes <em>in</em> Christ but he who believes <em>into</em> Him who shall have eternal life. Then the author goes on to say that the Christian life is not an imitation of Christ but a participation in Christ. To believe into Christ is to be united with Christ as one. This shows that in speaking of the divine things in God’s economy, we should not be bound by language. Language should be managed by us to serve our purpose in the culture. </p>
<p data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AouP9xg6iYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8"> The New Testament says that we should believe <em>into</em> Christ. Noah and his family could not have been saved if they had merely relied upon the ark outwardly. They had to enter into the ark. This is a picture of our believing into Christ. We were once outside of Christ. We were born in Adam, but we were outside of Christ. We needed to take a step to get into Him. The first step was our believing into Christ, and the following step was our being baptized into Christ. Through our believing and being baptized, we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. Now we are in Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_pBM3FYAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV"> This brief fellowship should help us to see the standard of God’s New Testament economy in comparison with the mixed expressions of the psalmist’s sentiment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49758" data-verses="Psalms 25:1">Psalms 25—41</span>. While the psalmist was enjoying God in God’s house, he expressed his sentiment, and his expressions were a mixture. In this message we want to see these mixed expressions in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49759" data-verses="Psalms 28:1">Psalms 28—30</span>. </p>

We cannot say that this belongs to the tree of life, because there is no indication of life here. Is it proper to ask God not to be deaf to us? If we asked someone not to be deaf to us, he might not be happy with us. </p>
<p data-content-id="06PDAD4GrV_FKIhpCfMTiD3fg1CIPlVFrY5NJoIo2UG9xThAvlhoVRVjeam3mHMdS"> We have seen that many portions of the Psalms contain David’s words according to his human concept, not God’s words according to the divine concept. We believe that all of the Scripture is God’s breath and each book of the Bible is God’s revelation with every line and word coming from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49762" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49763" data-verses="2Peter 1:21">2 Pet. 1:21</span>). Every line and word of the Scripture is inspired by God, but there are many words in the Bible that are not God’s words. The Bible even contains the words of Satan. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49764" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> records the serpent’s words to Eve (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49765" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">vv. 1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49766" data-verses="Genesis 3:4-5">4-5</span>). These words are a part of the Bible, but they are Satan’s words, not God’s words. This shows that although the entire Bible is God-breathed, not all of the words in the Bible are God’s words. </p>

Then he said that God would tear them down and not rebuild them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49767" data-verses="Psalms 28:3-5">vv. 3-5</span>). Surely this speaking is according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As those in the New Testament age, we cannot ask God to repay the wicked ones. In the New Testament, we are charged to love our enemies and to pray for those who persecute us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49768" data-verses="Matthew 5:44">Matt. 5:44</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AouO9x9yiYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8"> When we come to the Psalms with a clear view concerning the entire Bible with its principles, we can realize that the book of Psalms bears two burdens. It takes care of two responsibilities. First, it shows us Christ. Second, it shows us Christ in comparison with the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_pAM3cRAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV"> Beginning in the book of Genesis, Christ is revealed as the tree of life. One Bible teacher has said that the tree of life is over today, but the tree of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49813" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> is a central item. If the tree of life is taken away from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49814" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49815" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> means nothing and becomes nothing. It is wrong to say that the tree of life is over today. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49816" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">Revelation 2:7</span> the Lord Jesus said that to the overcomer He would give to eat of the tree of life. Jesus came to feed us with Himself as the tree of life. The first responsibility the written word of God bears is to show us Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="bqm-JyB7SIVXqnqTXQ7sNdfk3BBkuLKDq-WD-CusQJYOpzha7vmOWzhRlrUftDbwd"> God’s desire in eternity past was not concerning the law. The law came in at Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai is mentioned by Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49817" data-verses="Galatians 4:1">Galatians 4</span>, not in a positive sense but in a negative sense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49818" data-verses="Galatians 4:24-25">vv. 24-25</span>). In the eyes of both God and the apostle Paul, Mount Sinai is a very negative term. Sinai produces slaves, and is signified by a concubine, Hagar. The proper wife was Sarah. The concubine was Hagar. Whatever comes out of this concubine is a slave. All the Jews who treasure, uplift, and try to obey the law are slaves under the law. <span class="pg" data-page-id="188" id="188">[188]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="qf_Q-HCS9YUo9GMzE5AUQv_p4oKb3vFVaOmLANx-Rc98knFI2YImImMaqhN5dQJl3"> Besides Mount Sinai there is another mount, Mount Zion. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49819" data-verses="Hebrews 12:1">Hebrews 12</span> says that in the New Testament we have come, not to Mount Sinai but to Mount Zion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49820" data-verses="Hebrews 12:22">v. 22</span>). Here we are not slaves, but we are sons of the free woman. That means we are sons of grace. The grace of God is signified by the free woman, Sarah. The law is signified by a concubine. We are not for the law, but as the sons of the free woman, we are exalting Christ. The first responsibility of the Psalms is to show us Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="VRhjPpz4JdnWROtHhxAayOT_qFNWmZKbLuiblGSkCvPkgGcqezXq0pmSA19ZCDN-R"> The second responsibility of the Psalms is to give us a comparison between Christ and the law. In message eight we saw the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible. In the Bible God shows us only two lines. One is the proper line and the other is the negative line. The proper line is of Christ from God, and the negative line is of Satan. This is why there are two trees in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49821" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, and those two trees signify two sources. The tree of life signifies God as the source of life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of death. Then out of these two sources there are two lines. One line is the line of the day, and the other line is the line of the night. The negative line of darkness is the line of satanic chaos. The positive line of the day is the line of the divine economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="iTbtceJp8CRsXmWGS1x81pUaZn5u1SBErA31-m4XYfmciafaweXi21GVgQC5RY84s"> In addition to these two lines, there is also the line of the law. Christ is the main line, and the law is a side line. If you do not handle the side line properly, the side line becomes a part of the negative line, which is the line of chaos, the line of death, the line of the knowledge of good and evil. Since the day the law was given, God’s people have very rarely handled the law properly. I believe that Moses knew something about the position of the law because when he became old he wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49822" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49823" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">verse 1</span> he said, “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.” According to Moses’ realization, God is our dwelling place, and we are living in God. This is absolutely not according to the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="1ushQ5QG2mm5vQ6JwR6JDX8k4HlbYGuYon0k6S7Qrut04qLHEKfdtRUBEgUqfnP--"> The Psalms’ second responsibility is to show us the difference between Christ and the law. However, most of the readers of the Psalms do not understand this. They think that <span class="pg" data-page-id="189" id="189">[189]</span> everything in the Psalms is positive. But we have seen that many expressions in the Psalms are according to the human concept of uplifting the law, not according to the divine concept of exalting Christ. We saw in the previous message that it is difficult to find anything in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49824" data-verses="Psalms 28:1">Psalms 28—30</span> that is up to the divine standard of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="9MAUzofrAke3GqQ7OVHzbzP5fOfx6kgwnnDYK-CGhCzbB6sVxNA-LxpdL8yQCdNvA"> In this message we want to see the mixed expressions of the psalmist’s sentiment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49825" data-verses="Psalms 31:1">Psalms 31—33</span>. Much of David’s speaking in these psalms is according to the natural concept. Regretfully, when most readers of the Bible come to the Psalms, they do not see much of Christ. They may see the good points in the Psalms which are according to the human concept. The Psalms exhort and advise us to fear God. Then they tell us to take refuge in God. As persons under all kinds of attack, we need a refuge, a place to hide. We can take refuge in our God. The Psalms also speak of trusting in God, waiting on God, and hoping in God. Then the Psalms speak of praising God, thanking God, and worshipping God. These are the points based upon which all the psalms are composed: to fear God, to take refuge in God, to trust in God, to wait on God, to hope in God, to praise God, to thank God, and to worship God. These are the main points in many of the psalms, especially in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49826" data-verses="Psalms 31:1">Psalms 31—33</span>. </p>

IN EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING<br/>GOD’S SALVATION FROM HIS DISTRESS</h2><p data-content-id="TFDIF40UiPk-cgxjaStmKj3hP_RCqdMXeSDN5VOxZEPCgCcaslOmgbIqwsUleJWh8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49827" data-verses="Psalms 31:1">Psalm 31</span> shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmist’s sentiment in experiencing and enjoying God’s salvation from his distress. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49828" data-verses="Psalms 31:1">Psalm 31</span> David does not speak of God’s salvation from eternal perdition and from God’s judgment but of salvation from his distress. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49829" data-verses="Psalms 31:1">Psalm 31</span> he lists the items of his distress. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nXSsIWvnEm9T-8mcYN34Nma7LZlKGh2ENS-aZbkA31Stn79c3XGP-e0fZ7Wcfl5i4">A. Taking Refuge in God as a Rock of Protection and a Fortress to Save Him out of the Net Secretly Laid for Him by His Enemies</h2><p data-content-id="6UcEf2xoIcCLjOF3SwXORjTJRwO3uC2fFkYMo08kyKe5uy4FS6utSCxH9zoYoGimB"> David said that he took refuge in God as a rock of protection and a fortress to save him out of the net secretly laid for him by his enemies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49830" data-verses="Psalms 31:1-4">vv. 1-4</span>). The Lord Jesus said that He as <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> the rock is for building the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49831" data-verses="Matthew 16:18">Matt. 16:18</span>), but David said that God as the rock was for his protection to save him from his distress. God’s desire is to save people mainly from eternal perdition and judgment, not from their distress. Once we are saved from eternal perdition, God wants to continue to be our salvation so that we can live and magnify Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49832" data-verses="Philippians 1:19-21">Phil. 1:19-21a</span>). Perhaps the wife wants to be saved from her husband’s bad temper, and the husband wants to be saved from his wife’s disapproval. In other words, they want to be saved from their distress. But God’s salvation for the New Testament believers is for them to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="RF99mNghJcAjqAzGSAk0Z2VDebTnyYTK8F_bH0457aEcoqMtCJBP6MvoDLWTtZiuq"> David also exulted in God’s kindness that He had not delivered him into the hand of his enemies but had made his feet stand in a place broad and free (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49833" data-verses="Psalms 31:5-8">vv. 5-8</span>). These expressions indicate that David was too self-centered even in seeking God’s salvation. </p>

It is very good for David to ask God to be gracious to him, that is, to have grace upon him. This sounds somewhat like the New Testament. David also said that his eye was wasted with grief, even his soul and his body. To be wasted means to be dried up. David said that he had become a dried up person through his grief, which to him was distress. </p>

<p data-content-id="x3A_NVyRy-HcN2uaXwrGIw0CNcSNkQ1jqPzGJPy-vjJMMSTkeSMACaaj1wZdzKNhZ"> In this message we want to continue our fellowship on the mixed expressions of the psalmist’s sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God’s house. If we do not have a deep hunger to seek after the Lord with His Word, these messages may disappoint us. This is because what we may like according to our natural concept is exposed. What we see in the Bible and what the Bible is to us depend upon what kind of person we are. Our understanding of the Bible is always according to what we are. This is why we need to be adjusted and brought into the divine concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="rrxK-XF2yr3YMWZDIfZD1rK90jZpP7YHo3mw07NHikAb8Knk8XK9RdNnxWk8yUOYV"> In this message we want to see the mixed expressions of the psalmist’s sentiment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49882" data-verses="Psalms 34:1">Psalms 34—36</span>. The title of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49883" data-verses="Psalms 34:1">Psalm 34</span> says that this was a psalm of David “when he disguised his sanity before Abimelech, who drove him out, and he departed.” We can see from this that the situation in which <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49884" data-verses="Psalms 34:1">Psalm 34</span> was written was not an honorable one. David was not normal; he disguised himself as being insane because he was before a king who had the power to kill him. As a result of disguising himself, David was delivered from Abimelech (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49885" data-verses="1Samuel 21:10">1 Sam. 21:10—22:1a</span>). Afterward, he wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49886" data-verses="Psalms 34:1">Psalm 34</span>. In this psalm he gave all the credit to God, but actually he delivered himself by disguising himself. To disguise oneself is a kind of falsehood. </p>
<p data-content-id="dBOTWlR4T7_wM4gFXn0JNMqVJjkueMbQQ1oTYUC9Gau_1DxT2LNZ7Ru9AEQXgBzf-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49887" data-verses="Psalms 35:1">Psalm 35</span> David asked God to fight against his enemies <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> with weapons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49888" data-verses="Psalms 35:1-8">vv. 1-8</span>). Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49889" data-verses="Psalms 36:1">Psalm 36</span> he asked God to deal with the wicked (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49890" data-verses="Psalms 36:1-4">vv. 1-4</span>) and even gave God instructions as to how to deal with them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49891" data-verses="Psalms 36:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Q8UfYCni86rdUhWQQG-J0FfEKv9D8U8QpTnSrRADkl3zxMWpQFrmqGRz7b19wETp7"> We need to remember that the book of Psalms needs to be interpreted according to the divine concept of the divine revelation in the entire Bible. The Psalms is the longest book of the Bible, but it is not the only book. It must be interpreted in the light of the divine concept of God as the divine revelation concerning His eternal economy in Christ, taking Christ as its centrality and universality. </p>
<p data-content-id="06PDAD4GrV_FKIhpCfMTgD3fo1CIPlVFrY5NJoIo2UG9xThAvlhoVRVjeam3mHMdS"> We need to be adjusted from our human concept to the divine concept. At the beginning of my Christian life, I came to the Bible with much of my own thought. Throughout the years I have been adjusted, and the adjustment which I have received in studying the Bible has taken away layer upon layer of my human concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="7fIo7B_PtuxVHXWcNo-aBFVyEgZW-4YJzsHxBU9VHS6r_ObuAQxI8_Q5fJE47Frz7"> Our understanding of the Bible depends upon the measure of our growth in the spiritual life. Even today in our human life, our knowledge depends upon the measure of our growth in the human life. When someone is a child, we cannot expect him to understand that much. As this child grows, he is able to understand more and more. Eventually, when he becomes a full-grown man, he can understand things properly. It is difficult to understand the book of Psalms properly according to the divine concept. We have seen that at times David spoke things in the Psalms which were very wonderful. Then he spoke something which was altogether according to the human, natural concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="_Kg3rgsrWaIDsgfCFJ2--uS13FR7I4zgAOVRYaoYrTK7cWtwrlBYbr6bIuzFYwU_s"> In order to understand the Bible, we must exercise one principle. This principle is that God planned in His economy to make Himself one with man. The basic principle, the main principle, of Christ’s birth is that God came to join Himself to man, to be a man, and to be one with man. This is the basic principle of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="Blqqdh81kLssrkuFxB4ing6vCoAGD5eM2eD35Njpagb8MS9jmxPe2PiUpxlR9O2AT"> When we read the Bible, we need to keep the principle of God’s being one with man. We should keep the principle that the Word of God as the divine revelation shows us that God’s main purpose is to make Himself one with man and to make man one with Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49892" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> the Lord said, “I am the vine; <span class="pg" data-page-id="201" id="201">[201]</span> you are the branches....Abide in Me and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49893" data-verses="John 15:5">vv. 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49894" data-verses="John 15:4">4</span>). This shows us that God and the believers in Christ are one. We and God were once separate, but one day we, the wild branches, were grafted into Him in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49895" data-verses="Romans 11:24">Rom. 11:24</span>). We have been grafted into Christ as the tree, and this grafting has made us one with Him. What is needed now is for us to abide in Him that He may abide in us. Then He and we will be one, having one life, one nature, and one living. </p>
<p data-content-id="x3A_NVyRy-HcN2uaXwrGIw0fDcSNkQ1jqPzGJPy-vjJMMSTkeSMACaaj1wZdzKNhZ"> If we see this, we will be fully adjusted in our understanding of the Bible. We need to hold the divine concept in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49896" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span> where the Lord said that He is the vine, that we are His branches, and that we should abide in Him that He may abide in us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49897" data-verses="Psalms 34:1">Psalms 34—36</span>, we can see that David was not acting as a branch who was one with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="rrxK-XF2yr3YMWZDIfZD1rKk7jZpP7YHo3mw07NHikAb8Knk8XK9RdNnxWk8yUOYV"> In our understanding of the Bible, we have to pick up the proper principles. The main principle is that God desires to be one with His chosen people. Eventually, the oneness between God and man will be completed, consummated. All of God’s chosen people will be consummated to be fully one with God to become the constituents of the holy city, the New Jerusalem. Whenever we come to the Psalms, we need to hold this concept; otherwise, we can be misled. </p>

To bless God is to speak well about God, to talk about God in a good way. To praise God is to give the honor and the glory to God. </p>

This story is recorded in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49899" data-verses="1Samuel 21:10-15">1 Samuel 21:10-15</span>. There David disguised himself before this Philistine king in order to escape from being killed. <span class="pg" data-page-id="202" id="202">[202]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49901" data-verses="Psalms 34:1">verse 1</span> he said, “I will bless Jehovah at all times; / His praise will continually be in my mouth.” This is good, but we have to remember the situation in which David said this. When he disguised himself before Abimelech, he surely was not blessing God at that time. Instead, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49902" data-verses="1Samuel 21:13">1 Samuel 21:13</span> says that David scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard to make Abimelech think that he was insane. </p>
<p data-content-id="oaKMapIqH0taB_HBBSgjowZDBCm6qQIfo0VKLpq7SbpietHAMYoHv6iuAZG_bJfmq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="49903" data-verses="Psalms 34:2-6">Verses 2-6</span> say, “My soul makes its boast in Jehovah; / The lowly hear and they rejoice. / Magnify Jehovah with me, / And let us exalt His name together. / I sought Jehovah, and He answered me; / And He delivered me from all that terrified me. / They looked to Him and were radiant; / And their faces will never be abashed. / This poor man called out, and Jehovah heard; / And He saved him out of all his troubles.” </p>
<p data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6foi7qfRvS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c"> David said that Jehovah delivered him. But I would like to ask whether he was delivered out of the hand of Abimelech by Jehovah or whether he delivered himself. People may pray for a number of things, and then give all the credit to God when they are done. Actually, however, God did not do any one of them. Instead, they prayed according to their own desire, and they did it on their own. Sometimes they might have even done something in a way to cheat people, but God surely did not cheat people for them. We may pray for something, get what we prayed for, and then give the credit to God. This is an insult to God. In this case the credit should not go to God but to us to become a debit. </p>

He told the Galatians that they were foolish for trying to keep the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49970" data-verses="Galatians 3:1-3">3:1-3</span>). David encouraged people to keep the law, but Christ crucifies, terminates, every law-keeper. Christ does not want to see anyone endeavoring to keep the law. He wants to see every law-keeper terminated by the cross. </p>

We do not know the kind of prayer God desires, and we are not clear how to pray, according to the burden we feel, for our being conformed to the image of God’s Son; hence, we groan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49982" data-verses="Romans 8:23">v. 23</span>). In our groaning the Spirit groans also, interceding for us. His interceding is mainly that we may experience the transformation in life for growth into the maturity of sonship that we may be fully conformed to the image of God’s Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="49983" data-verses="Romans 8:29">v. 29</span>). </p>

No doubt, when David wrote these two psalms he was under the persecution and mistreatment of his enemies. Because of his suffering, he wanted to see his enemies recompensed. In the New Testament, however, the Lord Jesus told us that we should love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50023" data-verses="Matthew 5:44">Matt. 5:44</span>). This shows that David’s prayer to recompense his enemies is not according to the divine concept. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50030" data-verses="Psalms 41:10">41:10</span> David said, “But You, O Jehovah, be gracious to me and raise me up / That I may recompense them.” David was praising God for God’s deliverance and looking to God for His salvation. This is not <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> wrong, but it was wrong to ask Jehovah to raise him up that he might recompense his enemies. I hope that all of us can see this. Do you believe God is happy to see His children ask Him to raise them up that they might recompense their enemies? This is absolutely wrong. This is why we say that what is written in many of the psalms is a mixture. </p>
<p data-content-id="lnStf6w0mGYlfBdHZPgvB2mwq4W_Vp4Xr-bbSzE8X4PBExpGgaJ9ExBbKKISN9aOg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50031" data-verses="Psalms 41:11-12">verses 11-12</span> David said, “By this I know that You delight in me, / That my enemy has not shouted in triumph over me. / And as for me, You uphold me in my integrity, / And You set me before Your face forever.” David indicated that he would know that Jehovah delighted in him if Jehovah raised him up so that he could recompense his enemies. He also asked God not to let his enemies shout over him triumphantly. In the light of the New Testament revelation, we can see that this is absolutely according to the flesh. David also said that God upheld him in his integrity. He should have said that he was upheld in God’s mercy, in God’s compassions. Actually, we do not have any integrity before God. </p>

Of course, this is poetic writing. But do you believe that when David was sick, God came to take care of him just like a nurse, making all his bed? Surely God takes care of us, but the apostle Paul did not write anything in his Epistles to tell us that God took care of him like a nurse to sustain him on his sickbed and to make his bed in every way. For David to speak in this way indicates that he was too much in the self. </p>

He indicated that all his enemies encompassing him were evils which had become so numerous that they could not be counted. Furthermore, his iniquities were so numerous that he could not see. He was overtaken and bent over by the weight of his iniquities, and the number of his iniquities surpassed the number of the hairs on his head. This shows us that he was altogether in a very desperate situation. Enemies were surrounding him, and iniquities were suppressing him. </p>

<p data-content-id="M7fCqdO3rsw64DHJPn8pFVwrm6VwUJRZ3yHZlLdZbQwfTUGFzmgEUPSGaDO0Z7qHX"> This prophecy was fully quoted and defined by the apostle Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50046" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">Hebrews 10</span>.

Many Christians apply the doing of God’s will in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50048" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">Hebrews 10</span> to their daily affairs. Actually, however, the doing of God’s will in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50049" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1">Hebrews 10</span> refers to Christ coming to replace the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings. In the old dispensation, God commanded His people to offer to Him sacrifices and offerings. But when Jesus came and lived on this earth, God no longer delighted <span class="pg" data-page-id="225" id="225">[225]</span> in those Old Testament offerings. Instead, it was God’s will to replace them with Christ Himself. Christ came to be the real sacrifice, the real offering, the living sacrifice, the living offering, who offered Himself on the cross as the reality of all the offerings. He is the reality of the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. </p>

<p data-content-id="6UcEf2xoIcCLjOF3SwXOdjTQcwO3uC2fFkYMo08kyKe5uy4FS6utSCxH9zoYoGimB"> The Psalms are composed of five books. Thus far in our fellowship, we have covered Book One of the Psalms, composed of the first forty-one psalms. In this message we will begin our fellowship on Book Two of the Psalms. In this book we see the psalmists’ intensified enjoyment of God in His house and city through the suffering, exalted, and reigning Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="RF99mNghJcAjqAzGSAk0V2VmcbTnyYTK8F_bH0457aEcoqMtCJBP6MvoDLWTtZiuq"> The psalms in Book One were written mainly by David. Book Two, however, contains eight psalms that were composed by the sons of Korah, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50133" data-verses="Psalms 42:1">Psalms 42—49</span>. David is a glorious name among the nation of Israel, but Korah is an infamous name because Korah rebelled against Moses and God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50134" data-verses="Numbers 16:1-3">Num. 16:1-3</span>). In spite of this, some of the descendants of Korah became composers of the Psalms. This indicates that among the five books of the Psalms, the revelation is progressive. The five books of the Psalms are not on the same level. The Psalms is like a stairway with five steps, that takes us higher in its revelation in a progressive way. </p>
<p data-content-id="swd5PZucw8Weq5orQKdd-kqJ9pmNj9flJYCofaCPSu3vPBuDVlmeBwHc2dDffPws_"> Book Two of the Psalms begins in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50135" data-verses="Psalms 42:1">Psalm 42:1</span> in a very good way. The psalmist said, “As the hart pants / After the streams of water, / So my soul pants / For You, O God.” We can sense the Lord’s freshness in the desire and aspiration of the psalmist here. This is much different from what is expressed by the psalmist in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50136" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>. The human concept of <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50137" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> is that the man who delights in the law of God prospers in everything. The psalmist said that the one who delighted and meditated in the law would be like a tree transplanted beside streams of water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50138" data-verses="Psalms 1:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>). A tree drinks water by absorbing it. </p>
<p data-content-id="C0vZoeE_Tq6zu9_Fulg4HRW7-dNTgG7cDJrnlW3MlPGUBMuWsC2B7F32iItZg_FXY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50139" data-verses="Psalms 42:1">Psalm 42</span>, however, the psalmist said that his soul panted for God, just as the hart pants after the streams of water. Then he said, “My soul thirsts for God, / For the living God. / When will I come and appear / Before God?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50140" data-verses="Psalms 42:2">v. 2</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50141" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>, the opening word of Book One, begins with the law. But Book Two begins with God. What do we prefer—the law or God? Do we want to be like a tree transplanted by the streams of water by delighting in the law or like a hart panting after God? Surely there is no comparison between God and the law. This shows us that Book Two of the Psalms is higher than Book One. </p>
<p data-content-id="PdqflOTfa_fEqM2Whps9DbYU_E82eUf_xHvz09sRCXeut0OLr1OkE4g8-OxoH5y1Y"> Thus, we have to realize that the psalms progressively become higher in their revelation from Book One through Book Five. Book Five is the high peak of the Psalms. The high peak of this book is expressed in the word <em>Hallelujah! Hallelujah</em> means praise Jehovah, praise God. Thus, Book Two begins with God, and Book Five ends with “Praise God.” </p>
<p data-content-id="-vxlXU6cmTLDZeIgsltVsW7Vwfk9PR4omIpgyX1cWz_fCQS9vCp2fzq9vYNGAYAbP"> When we get into the New Jerusalem, we will all say, “Hallelujah! Hallelujah!” Some have asked me what language we will use in the New Jerusalem. I do not know what language we will speak, but we will probably say—“Hallelujah! Hallelujah!”—all the time. What other things will we need to talk about by that time? When we study the book of Psalms, we should reach some points where we sing “hallelujah” spontaneously. Even when we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50142" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> we can say, “Hallelujah! Hallelujah! I don’t need to love the law anymore.” </p>
<p data-content-id="pOSFl8c_X-HYWYsp6UJY_1n_zh2lwww2mnDf2YZn0tCbZM12hbPXMVxewp8ZD97ww"> It is very striking that Book Two begins with the psalmist’s panting after God. Panting after God is different from worshipping God in a formal, religious way. God is our living water for us to drink. Do we need to bow down to worship the water? We need to pant after this water and then drink it. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50143" data-verses="Psalms 42:1">verse 1</span> the word <em>pants</em> is used. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50144" data-verses="Psalms 42:2">verse 2</span> the word <em>thirsts</em> is used. My soul <em>pants</em> for God and <em>thirsts</em> for God. I love these <span class="pg" data-page-id="237" id="237">[237]</span> predicates. We need to have times with the Lord in which we pant after Him and thirst for Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="vBfgOzkctJI64y2wITHEDymWg_4dy56NbUV4FCRoxvXeePiesyP8cinOML7yllUh0">I. BOOK TWO OF THE PSALMS UNVEILING<br/>THE PSALMISTS’ INTENSIFIED ENJOYMENT<br/>OF GOD IN HIS HOUSE, AND EVEN THE MORE<br/>IN HIS CITY, THROUGH THE SUFFERING,<br/>EXALTED, AND REIGNING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="WtbcvCEgnrqy-dE42XroMQcKchMyCDtcObPJRXsB2bnNVrU4zObvTu4Y4s7w2TT6w"> Book One of the Psalms has turned the psalmists from the law to Christ, and Christ has brought them to the enjoyment of God in His house and in His city. We should come to God through Christ. Christ is the real stairway to God. Christ told us that He is the way. Thomas said, “Lord, we do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50145" data-verses="John 14:5">John 14:5</span>). Then Jesus said, “I am the way” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50146" data-verses="John 14:6">v. 6</span>). He is the real stairway to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="2FPleOiE4aUvfE8GzHzPJEHadIW1AzsIZaZoPhLsk6jHm_KkdS_Ik8gSZ9f6uN5g1"> Thus, Book One of the Psalms turned the psalmists to the right direction, to Christ. Then Christ brought them to the enjoyment of God in His house and in His city. I say this because of the first two verses of Book Two, which say, “As the hart pants / After the streams of water, / So my soul pants / For You, O God. / My soul thirsts for God, / For the living God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50147" data-verses="Psalms 42:1-2">42:1-2</span>). This is the enjoyment of God. Book Two begins with the direct enjoyment of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="uFsqFRd_NLv7RJd4aDXl9N2f3EDnkND2Dwws_fXkNmAQvidAcHcRx7M_n1Xj0Awsc"> Book Two unveils the psalmists’ intensified enjoyment of God in His house, and even the more in His city, through the suffering, exalted, and reigning Christ. Book One does not speak of the enjoyment of God in the house of God and the city of God as strongly as Book Two does. We may say, in a sense, that God was homeless at the beginning of Book One. The law is not God’s home. Who is God’s home? We have seen that God’s home is firstly Christ as the tabernacle and the temple (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50148" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50149" data-verses="John 2:21">2:21</span>). The first part of the New Testament, the Gospels, tells us clearly that God’s home was Christ. He was the tabernacle of God. Actually, this tabernacle was a portable home. Christ was God’s tabernacle, God’s tent, and also God’s temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="fV0aAyMXuYdaoZynkbs8MbWCdWNZmmM0Y8hBOvH-1E7ENHRl8MwaIW5bA5iMLvlPg"> Later, Christ became mingled with His believers, and His believers became His extension, His enlargement. Thus, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="238" id="238">[238]</span> church is God’s home in the second step (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50150" data-verses="Ephesians 2:22">Eph. 2:22</span>). It is difficult to find a verse in Book One of the Psalms which speaks of the city of God. The city of God signifies God’s kingdom. Christ as the tabernacle of God eventually became a kingdom. Christ cannot be a king without a “dom.” When the tabernacle becomes enlarged it becomes the temple, and the temple is the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50151" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16">1 Cor. 3:16</span>). The church is also the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50152" data-verses="Matthew 16:18-19">Matt. 16:18-19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50153" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>), the King with the “dom.” The kingdom is signified in the Psalms by the city. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVaWje0mwsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> Zion was a peak of the mountain range on which the city of Jerusalem was built. Jerusalem was built on a mountain range, that mountain range had a high peak, and on top of that high peak was the temple. That high peak was called Zion. On Zion a temple was built, and the temple was God’s house. Around that temple was the city of Jerusalem. Jerusalem as the city signifies God’s kingdom. In Book Two the psalmist begins to speak about the city. Thus, we have the enjoyment of God in His house and in His city. </p>
<p data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWwyBGDatao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ"> The universal God is located in His house, His dwelling place. God’s house is both Christ as God’s tabernacle and temple and the church as the enlargement of Christ, the enlarged temple. On the one hand, God in Christ is our home, our dwelling place (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50154" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psa. 90:1</span>), and on the other hand, we as the church are His home, His dwelling place. All the unbelieving sinners need to realize that because they are homeless, God is also homeless. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, we come back home. When we get into this home, into Christ, God is also home in us. When I was younger, we preached the gospel by telling the unbelievers that they were homeless, not having any rest. Because they are restless, homeless, God is also homeless. But when we believe in the Lord Jesus, we come back home. Then we are home, and God is also home. We are no longer restless and neither is God. </p>

<p data-content-id="-vxlXU6cmTLDZeIgsltZlW7w4fk9PR4omIpgyX1cWz_fCQS9vCp2fzq9vYNGAYAbP"> In this message we will begin to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50197" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, the highest and the greatest of the one hundred fifty psalms. To enter into the significance of such a psalm is not easy. All seventeen verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50198" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> are quite common, but the way this psalm presents Christ is very peculiar. </p>
<p data-content-id="pOSFl8c_X-HYWYsp6UJU21ne6h2lwww2mnDf2YZn0tCbZM12hbPXMVxewp8ZD97ww"> The title of this psalm tells us that it is a song of love. The word <em>love</em> in the title refers not to a father’s love for his son but to the love between a male and a female. This is indicated by the fact that the Hebrew word for love here is in the feminine gender. Thus, the love in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50199" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> is a feminine love. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2o6_HGRZUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> In order to understand this psalm, we need to turn to the particular book in the Bible which is concerned with love—the Song of Songs. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50200" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> is a psalm of love, and Song of Songs is a book of love. In that book the word love is used in both the masculine and the feminine gender. According to the English translation of Song of Songs, the Lord Jesus is called “the Beloved”; however, the Hebrew word is simply the word for love in the masculine gender. Likewise, when the Lord calls His seeker “My love,” the Hebrew word for love is in the feminine gender. Moreover, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50201" data-verses="Psalms 45:2">Psalm 45:2a</span> says, “You are fairer than the sons of men.” This is similar to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50202" data-verses="Song of Songs 5:10">Song of Songs 5:10</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span>, where the seeker speaks of her beloved as “the chiefest among ten thousand.” This is a further indication that Song of Songs helps us to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50203" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="E4td5kmomfAjeGazEU8_fwkyfjy28rxL8oQNM-rYLdkLIoLtHs8mIAM7ZuMPCTHuG"> In one of the life-study messages on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50204" data-verses="Hosea 11:1">Hosea 11—14</span>, we pointed out that throughout Hosea Israel is depicted as the wife of Jehovah. However, when God’s everlasting love is touched, Israel is called God’s son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50205" data-verses="Hosea 11:1">Hosea 11:1</span>), indicating that Israel has the Father’s life. God’s everlasting love is not a love in affection, like the love of a husband toward a wife, but a love in life, like the love of a father toward a son. Love in affection does not transform, but love in life transforms people. It is in the Father’s love, the love in life, that Israel is transformed. A husband who loves his wife in affection may spoil her, but a father who loves his son in life never spoils his son. Rather, a father’s love in life perfects his son. </p>
<p data-content-id="DTkPp079Cp66d6XMH5NxwJFt0knnEno0ABS1nCLXQ91_Z47wAvbepEUjXUVIJrvBR"> I am not suggesting that Christ’s love for us as virgins, as those who are females in relation to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50206" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:2">2 Cor. 11:2</span>), is a love that can spoil us. According to the biblical truth, Christ’s love does not spoil His believers. Nominal Christians, false Christians, do not know Christ’s love. Genuine Christians, those who have a heart for the Lord, enjoy Christ’s love, but they may enjoy it according to their own concept or feeling. As a result they are spoiled not by Christ’s love itself but by their wrong application of Christ’s love. For instance, if you speak to them concerning the kingdom truth, dispensational punishment, and the casting of certain believers into the outer darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50207" data-verses="Matthew 22:13">Matt. 22:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50208" data-verses="Matthew 25:30">25:30</span>), they may say, “You are teaching heresy. Jesus loves me. He is not cruel, and He would not put me into outer darkness. As long as Jesus loves me, everything is all right.” This indicates that even genuine believers have been spoiled by their mistaken application of the love of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="SbdWgF4EAWEy9ge53uRDt8JkTE_958ZA6o2N5TfAmVLjMVdX55snzFO4ywV8-vS6R"> Such believers need to consider the book of Hebrews. Hebrews is a book not on Christ’s love but on the kingdom. Regarding the kingdom, Hebrews gives us five warnings, and each of these warnings concerns either reward or punishment. Furthermore, in Hebrews we have two kinds of words. The first is the good word of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50209" data-verses="Hebrews 6:5">6:5</span>), the word of the beginning of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50210" data-verses="Hebrews 6:1">v. 1</span>), which is the milk the believers taste when <span class="pg" data-page-id="249" id="249">[249]</span> they believe in the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50211" data-verses="Hebrews 5:13">5:13</span>). The second kind of word is the word of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50212" data-verses="Hebrews 5:13">v. 13</span>), which is solid food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50213" data-verses="Hebrews 5:14">v. 14</span>), embodying the thought of God’s justice and righteousness in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50214" data-verses="Hebrews 12:5-7">Hebrews 12:5 through 7</span> we have such a word of righteousness. “You have completely forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons, ‘My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him; for whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.’ It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons.” Today many believers do not want to hear such a word of righteousness. Instead, they prefer sugar-coated messages. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPfbBHDneBjs_yEzYD3CzVyidd2UeNDPuK-ioxqWo82BpQ0oXABpY_L_3MbRH5kXR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50215" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> is not on the Father’s love; that is, it is not on love in life but on love in affection. This is why this psalm is called a song of love. </p>
<p data-content-id="ex-VBPE6iEBPGjLm6o1MFZdqDA6QdIW9p5b-_TOqQLTnIw18TKY2WJPOMgBwUFYmG"> In this message we will cover the first eight verses of this psalm. These verses are on the praise of Christ as the King from four directions: His fairness, His victory, His kingdom, and His virtues. First, the psalmist praises the King in His fairness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50216" data-verses="Psalms 45:2">v. 2a</span>), in His handsomeness. Christ is truly fair; He is really handsome. </p>
<p data-content-id="5KAH-UmAtuU3gKpaATq0LVxMc4YWsT4usc1Ic-G4s86Oc-dA28nxZLaHM68xJ5WC1"> Christ’s fairness, however, is balanced by His victory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50217" data-verses="Psalms 45:3-5">vv. 3-5</span>). Many husbands who love their wives have fairness, but they do not have victory. Instead, they have defeat after defeat. Thus, they are not balanced. But Christ, having both fairness and victory, is balanced. Yes, He loves us, but, as the four Gospels reveal, He also exercises His victory with its requirements. Because of His victory, He has high requirements. </p>
<p data-content-id="Na7WgVyV478pwtrSChkAVzFrUl-MEQkas-bTZWuSFaQIaC0CuxOLAxx4JGiXrBoG3"> We see Christ’s victory and His requirements not only in the Gospel of Matthew but even in the Gospel of John. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50218" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>, a chapter which speaks about abiding in Christ, the Lord Jesus tells us that if we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off and lose the enjoyment of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50219" data-verses="John 15:2">vv. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50220" data-verses="John 15:6">6</span>). Whereas all believers love <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50221" data-verses="Matthew 1:21">Matthew 1:21</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50222" data-verses="Matthew 1:23">23</span>, they may not appreciate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50223" data-verses="Matthew 5:20">5:20</span>, a verse which says that unless our righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, we will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Likewise, <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> today’s believers may not pay attention to the parable for faithfulness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50224" data-verses="Matthew 25:14-30">Matthew 25:14-30</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50225" data-verses="Matthew 25:30">Verse 30</span> says, “Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.” The point here is that Christ’s fairness is balanced by His victory with its requirements. Hence, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50226" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> fairness and victory are a pair. </p>
<p data-content-id="tQ24bEsDAJrapHMLOR8cYXfLCzVeA2NL9qpON8dWnjClKumw-BgbGeVcZwAx4ViCq"> A second pair in this psalm involves Christ’s kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50227" data-verses="Psalms 45:6-7">vv. 6-7</span>) and His virtues (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50228" data-verses="Psalms 45:8">v. 8</span>). The kingdom is higher than the victory. Christ’s kingdom is the issue of His victory. If there were no victory, there would be no kingdom. Victory produces the kingdom. Because Christ has won the victory, the kingdom belongs to Him. The matter of His kingdom, however, is balanced by the sweetness of His virtues. Therefore, in the praise of Christ as the King in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50229" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, there are two balanced pairs: fairness and victory, kingdom and virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="hkLfpjCNovaGmCzIPtjQM9QnLk3mtR0lr9YKIdhUAkLiGtbw24ZWzZYjCzQ5ensMw"> Let us now go on to consider this psalm in more detail. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="U3SJ7x2XZmwE-vT9C-B8nEquKtOBuETEkreZHMxUhbPpeAsVz1iLkblSuDuEcWpye">I. A SONG OF LOVE<br/>ACCORDING TO THE MELODY OF LILIES</h2><p data-content-id="M7fCqdO3rsw64DHJPn8lNVwru6VwUJRZ3yHZlLdZbQwfTUGFzmgEUPSGaDO0Z7qHX"> The superscription of this psalm calls it “a Song of Love,” and this love is feminine. It is the love between us and the Lord. This love makes us His love. This means that if we are those who love the Lord, we eventually become His love, His favorite. Just as He is our love, so we become His love. </p>
<p data-content-id="VRhjPpz4JdnWROtHhxAW3OTzoFNWmZKbLuiblGSkCvPkgGcqezXq0pmSA19ZCDN-R"> The subject of this psalm is love, and the tune, the melody, is called “lilies.” Here both love and lilies refer to the saints. Every lover of the Lord Jesus is feminine and is also a lily. A lily denotes a pure, simple, single life of trusting in God. Our love for the Lord Jesus should be a love full of affection. We should not only have a life of purity and simplicity as signified by the lily, but we should always have an affectionate feeling toward the Lord. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50230" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, we all need to have a pure life with an affectionate love for the Lord. </p>

Before we come to these verses, however, I would like to say a word concerning the Bible and the way to understand it. </p>
<p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHjbJp0BE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> The Bible is a very particular, special, strange, and wonderful book. Because the Bible is such a book, it cannot be understood by the natural human mind. If we try to understand the Bible according to our natural mind, we will not have the proper understanding. Of course, in order to understand the Bible, we must exercise our mind. However, we should exercise not the natural mind but the renewed, enlightened mind. If we would understand the Bible, we must have a mind that is renewed and enlightened, that is, a mind whose understanding is under the divine light. Therefore, when we study the Bible, we should pray that the Lord will renew our mind and enlighten it. </p>
<p data-content-id="fV0aAyMXuYdaoZynkbswEbWCVWNZmmM0Y8hBOvH-1E7ENHRl8MwaIW5bA5iMLvlPg"> If we do not have a renewed and enlightened mind, we will have trouble when studying <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50272" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, especially <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50273" data-verses="Psalms 45:9-15">verses 9 through 15</span>, which are about praising the king in the praising <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> of the queen with the daughters of kings and with the virgins. We may be bothered by the fact that this king has so many women with him. The Bible teaches us that a man should have only one wife, and in the New Testament Paul tells us that an elder should be “the husband of one wife” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50274" data-verses="1Timothy 3:2">1 Tim. 3:2</span>). But the king in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50275" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> seems to be like a heathen king who has a great many wives and concubines. As we will see, what we have in this psalm is a matter not of ethics but of typology, and to understand this type we need a renewed, enlightened mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVWeje0uwsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> Regarding the interpretation of the Bible, especially the book of Revelation, there are two schools. According to the first school, the book of Revelation should be understood literally. Those who follow this school say the New Jerusalem is a physical city. According to the second school, Revelation should be understood symbolically, since some items of its content are revealed by “signs” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50276" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">1:1b</span>). Those who follow this school say that as the golden lampstands are symbols of the churches, so the New Jerusalem is also a symbol, a sign. </p>
<p data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWw-JGDWvao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ"> The Bible contains many symbols and types. We may regard these symbols and types as pictures or “photographs.” The reason for the photographs in the Bible is that the Bible unveils many heavenly, spiritual things, and these things are invisible and mysterious. The photographs in the Bible help us to understand such things. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xcf_6qhqmuUpIGfe8JxyWOr1-ZlCW67PmCtIfSUeGYkLK3j9subuJKvpbUUJeUzlR"> An example of a biblical symbol or photograph is the tree of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50277" data-verses="Genesis 2:1-2">Genesis 2 and 3</span>. What is the tree of life? In the Bible the tree of life is not actually a literal tree. Rather, the tree of life is a symbol of God as the source and reality of life. This means that the tree of life is a symbol of God as life. </p>
<p data-content-id="kVUJkTRCD2ceWNANfSpuSXqjITkTgrwo3WzP5v2H-gzE3CDAPM4O-xZzgNga2L9ku"> Other symbols in the Old Testament are types of the church. The first of these types is Eve, the wife of Adam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50278" data-verses="Genesis 2:18-23">Gen. 2:18-23</span>). From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50279" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> we know that the relationship between husband and wife portrays the great mystery—Christ and the church. Without the picture of Eve as the counterpart, increase, and enlargement of Adam, we would not realize that the church is the counterpart, increase, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> enlargement of Christ. Thus, we need the type of Eve to symbolize what the church is to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHjbJpVOE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> The Old Testament also uses the tabernacle and the temple as symbols to unveil another aspect of the church. Eve, the tabernacle, and the temple are all photographs of the church. The church is not only Christ’s counterpart, symbolized by Eve, but also God’s house, God’s dwelling place, symbolized first by the tabernacle and then by the temple. If we did not have these two symbols, we would not understand many of the details concerning the church being God’s dwelling place. From this we see that the biblical way is to use symbols to portray spiritual things, and we need to keep this in mind as we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50280" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AoiK9xg-iYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50281" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> was written in praise of King Solomon, who was a symbol, a type, of Christ with a wife composed of many “daughters,” of many believers. If God had no need of a king to symbolize Christ in this way, Solomon would not have been created. The Bible clearly reveals that God’s intention is that a man have only one wife, yet Solomon had hundreds of wives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50282" data-verses="1Kings 11:1">1 Kings 11:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50283" data-verses="1Kings 11:3">3</span>). As far as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50284" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> is concerned, we should understand this not ethically but typically. Ethically, Solomon should not have had many wives. Typically speaking, however, there was the need for a man with hundreds of wives so that God would have a particular type of the church composed of many believers from many nations. Solomon with his wives is a type of Christ with His corporate wife, a wife composed of believers from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50285" data-verses="Revelation 5:9">Rev. 5:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_lEM3FcAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV"> Solomon did not follow God’s regulation about having only one wife, and many readers of the Bible would condemn him for this. Nevertheless, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50286" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, written in praise of Solomon, Solomon is a type of Christ as the One with a corporate wife. If we would understand this, we need a mind that is renewed and enlightened with spiritual understanding. This is the reason I have pointed out that we should not come to this psalm with our natural mind. The natural mind is of no avail in understanding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50287" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="bqm-JyB7SIVXqnqTXQ7gJdfB1BBkuLKDq-WD-CusQJYOpzha7vmOWzhRlrUftDbwd"> If we are enlightened and renewed, we will realize that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50288" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> is lovable. First, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50289" data-verses="Psalms 45:2-7">verses 2 through 7</span>, this psalm praises the king, Solomon, in his fairness, in his victory, in his <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> kingdom, and in the sweetness of his virtues. After this, the psalmist continues by praising the king in the praising of his queen. The queen is not alone but is accompanied by the daughters of kings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50290" data-verses="Psalms 45:9">v. 9</span>) and by the virgins, her friends (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50291" data-verses="Psalms 45:14">v. 14</span>). If we view this as a type, we will see that the king typifies Christ, that the queen typifies the church, and that those around the queen typify the believers. In type, this queen is not a single, individual person—she is corporate. The believers are the constituents, the components, of this corporate queen. Actually, the believers are both the constituents of the queen and the honorable and beautiful women. </p>
<p data-content-id="qf_Q-HCS9YUo9GMzE5AYUv_I7oKb3vFVaOmLANx-Rc98knFI2YImImMaqhN5dQJl3"> The situation is the same in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50292" data-verses="Revelation 19:7">Revelation 19:7</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50293" data-verses="Revelation 19:9">9a</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50294" data-verses="Revelation 19:7">Verse 7</span> says, “Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.” This verse speaks of the wife of the Lamb. However, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50295" data-verses="Revelation 19:9">verse 9a</span> says, “Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.” This verse speaks of those who are invited to the Lamb’s marriage dinner. When I was young I was troubled by this, believing that the wife is the church but not understanding much about the overcomers. Actually, the wife, the bride of Christ, here is not the church but the overcomers. Then who are the invited ones, the guests? The guests also are the overcomers. This means that, on the one hand, the overcomers are the bride and that, on the other hand, they are the guests. We may say that the bride is composed of the guests. First the overcomers are the corporate bride, and then they are also the guests. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50296" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> the bride of Christ is typified by the queen, and His overcoming guests are typified by the honorable women around the queen. The bride of Christ, therefore, is actually the group of overcomers. We need to have this understanding as we study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50297" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>. </p>

We should ask why these three psalms are placed immediately after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50335" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, a psalm praising king Solomon (typifying Christ) with his queen (typifying the church).

However, there is definitely a continuation here. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50339" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> is on the king, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50340" data-verses="Psalms 46:1">Psalm 46</span> is on the city. Surely the king has much to do with the city. If a king did not have a city, what kind of king would he be? A king must have a city. The king in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50341" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> typifies Christ, but what is the city mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50342" data-verses="Psalms 46:1">Psalm 46</span>? This city is Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="Blqqdh81kLssrkuFxB4ujg6OLoAGD5eM2eD35Njpagb8MS9jmxPe2PiUpxlR9O2AT"> In the previous message we pointed out that in studying the Bible, we need an enlightened and renewed mind. When we study a psalm such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50343" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, we should not have any trust in our natural understanding or our natural concept. Instead of relying on our natural mind, we need to exercise our renewed and enlightened mind. </p>
<p data-content-id="tQ24bEsDAJrapHMLOR8caXfLKzVeA2NL9qpON8dWnjClKumw-BgbGeVcZwAx4ViCq"> In addition, if we would understand the Bible, we also need to know the spiritual, divine, and heavenly significance <span class="pg" data-page-id="270" id="270">[270]</span> of the things in the Bible and the significance of the things concerning Christ. As we study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50344" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, for instance, we must find out the spiritual significance of the king, the queen, the daughters, and the sons. Likewise, as we study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50345" data-verses="Psalms 46:1">Psalm 46</span>, we must find out the spiritual significance of the city. </p>
<p data-content-id="hkLfpjCNovaGmCzIPtjQO9QnDk3mtR0lr9YKIdhUAkLiGtbw24ZWzZYjCzQ5ensMw"> The Bible was written not only in letters, and it not only contains many types, but it is a book filled with matters that have a spiritual significance. Consider the first two chapters of Genesis. If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50346" data-verses="Genesis 1:1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span> only according to the letters without caring for the spiritual significance, we will not understand these chapters. As we study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50347" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">chapter one</span>, we need to learn the significance of the heavens, the earth, the light, the land emerging from the water, the vegetable life, the animal life, the human life, the divine life, and the matters of image and dominion. If we know the significance of the items in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50348" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span>, we will see that man was created according to God’s kind to bear God’s image and to represent Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="U3SJ7x2XZmwE-vT9C-B8lEqiItOBuETEkreZHMxUhbPpeAsVz1iLkblSuDuEcWpye"> As we go on to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50349" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, we see that the man created by God is tripartite. He has a body, made from the dust of the ground; he has a spirit, the issue of the breath of God; and he has a soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50350" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">v. 7</span>). The man thus formed by God was put in a garden in Eden and placed before two trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This chapter also speaks of the river that went out of Eden and of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50351" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> we are told that God took a rib out of the man and used it to make a woman. All these things have a spiritual significance, and we need to know this spiritual significance. </p>

In the Bible as a whole and in this psalm in particular, a city signifies a kingdom. The primary city in the Bible is Jerusalem, and a city that stands in opposition to Jerusalem is Babylon. If we would understand the Bible, we need to understand the significance of both Jerusalem and Babylon. </p>
<p data-content-id="VRhjPpz4JdnWROtHhxAW1OT_uFNWmZKbLuiblGSkCvPkgGcqezXq0pmSA19ZCDN-R"> The Psalms are full of matters that have a spiritual, divine, and heavenly significance.

Although the law was exalted according to the human concept of the psalmist, the Spirit came in to correct the psalmist and, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50354" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>, to turn him from the law to Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50355" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> is the first station of the unveiling of Christ in the Psalms. Other stations are <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50356" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">Psalm 8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50357" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">Psalm 16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50358" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalms 22—24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50359" data-verses="Psalms 40:1">Psalm 40</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50360" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>. </p>

The house of God signifies the church. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50361" data-verses="Psalms 23:1">Psalm 23</span>, as we experience Christ in His shepherding, we are brought into the house of God to dwell there forever.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50364" data-verses="Psalms 27:4">Psalm 27:4</span> the psalmist aspires to dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of his life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50365" data-verses="Psalms 36:8">Psalm 36:8</span> the psalmist speaks of the fatness (signifying the abundance) of God’s house, where there is the fountain of life and where we see light in God’s light. </p>

The house is a place of dwelling, but a city is a kingdom for ruling. As the One unveiled as the King in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50373" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, Christ needs a city in which to rule and reign, and we see this city in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50374" data-verses="Psalms 46:1">Psalm 46</span>.

We have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50414" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> is a psalm concerning the king and that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50415" data-verses="Psalms 46:1">Psalms 46—48</span> are a group of psalms concerning the city of the king, Jerusalem.

The first category (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50418" data-verses="Psalms 49:1">Psa. 49</span>) consists of those who trust in their wealth (that is, in anything other than Christ). In the second category (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50419" data-verses="Psalms 50:1">Psa. 50</span>) are those who call upon the Lord according to His covenant. The third category (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50420" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psa. 51</span>) is a single person, King David, repenting, confessing his sins to God, and asking God for His purging. Those in the first category have no share in the enjoyment of God in Christ; those in the second category participate in the enjoyment of God; and the one in the third category has a full portion of the enjoyment of God in Christ. We need to ask ourselves where we are. Are we in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50421" data-verses="Psalms 49:1">Psalm 49</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50422" data-verses="Psalms 50:1">Psalm 50</span>, or <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50423" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psalm 51</span>?

THOSE CALLING UPON THE LORD<br/>ACCORDING TO HIS COVENANT</h2><p data-content-id="lnStf6w0mGYlfBdHZPgjK2m8o4W_Vp4Xr-bbSzE8X4PBExpGgaJ9ExBbKKISN9aOg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50441" data-verses="Psalms 50:1">Psalm 50</span> we have the second category of persons regarding the enjoyment of God in Christ—those who call upon the Lord according to His covenant. To call upon the Lord, saying, “O Lord Jesus,” makes a very real difference in our situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="OStP7wKqw4XofP1Nzz4gbm4Zzivn3tW4ba4lk0uKaZVu2pdBrTzyGBK2L-ogLSmdV"> According to this psalm, we need to call upon the Lord according to His covenant. The Bible is the book of a covenant, the book of a testament. A covenant may be compared to the title deed to a house. To give someone the title deed to a house is actually to “covenant” the house to that person. In the Bible, a book of covenant, God has covenanted Himself to us, and now we need to call upon the Lord according to this covenant. We should say, “O Lord, You have covenanted Yourself to me. According to Your covenant, You are now my possession, my portion, and my enjoyment.” This is to call upon the Lord according to His covenant. <span class="pg" data-page-id="280" id="280">[280]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="4Pl1H-TvAJj7lZqOZ3bWNXc2fXEYW2Yis2c6ZRGIY5fJcSQcdP3Ys4DBvkiP0VUqd">A. As the Saints of God,<br/>Who Have Made<br/>a Covenant with God by Sacrifice</h2><p data-content-id="oaKMapIqH0taB_HBBSgvtwZDFCm6qQIfo0VKLpq7SbpietHAMYoHv6iuAZG_bJfmq"> In this psalm, those who call upon the Lord according to His covenant are the saints of God who have made a covenant with God by sacrifice. They have been charged by the righteous God, who is Judge, to offer Him a sacrifice of thanksgiving and to call upon Him in the day of trouble that they may participate in His deliverance, His salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50442" data-verses="Psalms 50:1-15">vv. 1-15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50443" data-verses="Psalms 50:23">23</span>). To make a covenant with God by sacrifice is to make a covenant by Christ as our Mediator, as the “middleman” between us and God. If we pray to God in the name of the Lord Jesus, this means that we pray to God by Christ as our sacrifice. </p>
<p data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6fou-qfRrS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c"> In ancient times the people of Israel offered different kinds of offerings to God, such as the burnt offering, the meal offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, and the peace offering. Of all these offerings, the one that was the most touching to the hearts of the people was the peace offering. Because the peace offering touched the heart of the one who offered it, it became a thanksgiving offering. One could offer to God a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sin offering, or a trespass offering without much affection. This means that one could offer such an offering without his heart being touched. However, whenever a person, being thankful to God, offered a thanksgiving offering to God, that person’s heart was touched. </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW7n_vvpZA7ULO884Enn-HlvAm8UKndBtrUuO3Kkg1_Ay9Dcj0p0s6xSsEx_kZu_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50444" data-verses="Psalms 50:1">Psalm 50</span> tells us that some of the saints of God were offering burnt offerings and other kinds of offerings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50445" data-verses="Psalms 50:8-13">vv. 8-13</span>), but, because they were lacking in affection, they would not offer the thanksgiving offering. Thus the psalmist, speaking for God, indicated that what God wants is not the burnt offering but the thanksgiving offering. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50446" data-verses="Psalms 50:14">verse 14a</span> the psalmist says, “Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving.” Here the psalmist seemed to be saying, “God does not want your burnt offering. God wants you to offer Him your thanksgiving offering, an offering that is touching to both you and God, an offering full of affection.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="281" id="281">[281]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="cT8NrRFfPzsynu5lLu-OHbdRWoBuqjDuifVLWXa6H4_HpI5ahTZpRhf9TqTD8W_99"> We need to consider this in the light of our experience with the Lord. Many of us have prayed in this way: “O God the Father, I am a sinner. The Lord Jesus Christ is my burnt offering, sin offering, and trespass offering.” This is a prayer without affection, without tender feeling. This indicates that we can offer certain offerings without being touched in our heart. Suppose, however, that after passing through a time of trouble, you pray, “O God the Father, I would like to offer to You my thanksgiving.” Such a prayer touches your heart, fills you with affection, and causes you and God to become intimate. </p>

The last of these stations which we have covered thus far is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50468" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span>, and the next will be <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50469" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Psalm 68</span>. Between <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50470" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50471" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Psalm 68</span> there are twenty-two psalms. As we have seen, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50472" data-verses="Psalms 46:1">Psalms 46—48</span> are concerned with the city, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50473" data-verses="Psalms 49:1">Psalms 49—51</span> deal with three categories of persons regarding the enjoyment of God in Christ. Before we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50474" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Psalm 68</span>, we need to pass through sixteen psalms, and we will devote three messages to these psalms. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50475" data-verses="Psalms 52:1">Psalms 52—67</span> present us with a “marsh,” a kind of “muddy” situation that is hard for us to pass through. Nevertheless, we need to get through these sixteen psalms. In this message we will consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50476" data-verses="Psalms 52:1">Psalms 52—57</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPfbBHDneBjs_yEzYD3C3Vy_Td2UeNDPuK-ioxqWo82BpQ0oXABpY_L_3MbRH5kXR"> These psalms were treasured by God’s people in ancient times, with each psalm being valued as a “gem.” Otherwise, these six psalms would not have been included in the book of the Psalms. Although some have highly appreciated these psalms, I find it difficult to be impressed with them. Furthermore, because these psalms are very much alike, I also find it difficult to see how each of them differs from the others. Moreover, it is hard to say what they talk about. The sentiment here is surely strong, mixed, and complex. Therefore, these psalms may be considered the pious expressions of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="286" id="286">[286]</span> psalmists uttered out of their complex sentiments while enjoying God in His house. Let us now consider these psalms one by one. </p>

<p data-content-id="Na7WgVyV478pwtrSChkARzFKZl-MEQkas-bTZWuSFaQIaC0CuxOLAxx4JGiXrBoG3"> In the first seven verses the psalmist condemns the evil man, and in the last two verses the psalmist speaks concerning his enjoyment of God in His house. </p>

Who is this mighty one? Why, after referring to the mighty man, does the psalmist immediately go on to speak of God’s lovingkindness? There seems to be no connection here. </p>
<p data-content-id="nXSsIWvnEm9T-8mcYN30Mma7PZlKGh2ENS-aZbkA31Stn79c3XGP-e0fZ7Wcfl5i4"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50479" data-verses="Psalms 52:2-7">verses 2 through 7</span> it appears that David, the psalmist, is full of hatred for this mighty one. Although David does not say that God will curse this one, he says, “God will likewise bring you down forever; / He will take you and pluck you up from your tent, / And uproot you from the land of the living” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50480" data-verses="Psalms 52:5">v. 5</span>). David’s word here is very strong. How could a godly man pray in such a way concerning one of his persecutors? </p>

<p data-content-id="swd5PZucw8Weq5orQKdRzkqoypmNj9flJYCofaCPSu3vPBuDVlmeBwHc2dDffPws_"> What should we think of David? After reading such a psalm as this, will we continue to consider him to be perfectly spiritual? When I was young, I appraised David highly, but after studying the Bible for so many years, my appreciation of him has decreased. On the one hand, David enjoyed God in His house, even as an olive tree flourishing in the dwelling of God; on the other hand, in his prayer he condemned the evil man, saying that God would uproot him from the land of the living. How could David at the same time enjoy God and hate one of his enemies to the uttermost? Surely this mixture of hate for an enemy and praise to God for His enjoyment of God in His house is not right. How could a godly man mix together hatred to his enemy and praise to God in the same psalm? This is what David did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50482" data-verses="Psalms 52:1">Psalm 52</span>. </p>

Here the psalmist asked God to annihilate his enemies, while he himself was seeking to participate in the enjoyment of God in His help, sustenance, and salvation.

According to the psalmist, it was to be executed on his enemies, who were Gentiles. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtbcvCEgnrqy-dE42XrkBQcGehMyCDtcObPJRXsB2bnNVrU4zObvTu4Y4s7w2TT6w"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50493" data-verses="Psalms 54:2-3">Verses 2 and 3</span> continue, “O God, hear my prayer; / Give ear to the words of my mouth. / For strangers have risen up against me, / And those who terrorize seek my soul; / They do not set God before them.” The strangers here are Gentiles. For the Gentiles not to set God before them means that they do not fear God. To them, there is no God. </p>

<p data-content-id="uFsqFRd_NLv7RJd4aDXpwN2T5EDnkND2Dwws_fXkNmAQvidAcHcRx7M_n1Xj0Awsc"> It is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50495" data-verses="Psalms 54:5">verse 5</span> that the psalmist prays for the annihilation of his enemies, saying, “He will return the evil to those who lie in wait for me. / Annihilate them in Your faithfulness.” Instead of asking the Lord to have mercy on them in His faithfulness, the psalmist prays that God will annihilate them. This does not fit in with the psalmist David’s spirituality. In typifying Christ as the fighting victor, it is all right for David to ask God to annihilate his enemies. But in his spiritual living, in his spirituality, it is altogether not right for him to hate his enemies, to ask God to destroy, to annihilate, his enemies. This is against the nature of the spiritual life of God’s chosen people, and even against God’s holy word in the Old Testament, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50496" data-verses="Proverbs 25:21-22">Proverbs 25:21-22</span>, quoted by the apostle Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50497" data-verses="Romans 12:20">Romans 12:20</span>. Hence, we cannot admit that David’s spirituality is perfect. </p>

<p data-content-id="iTbtceJp8CRsXmWGS1xw1pULSn5u1SBErA31-m4XYfmciafaweXi21GVgQC5RY84s"> Throughout the centuries, many Christian readers of the Old Testament have not had the proper understanding of the Psalms. In order to have such an understanding, especially of the psalms written by David, we need to consider David’s situation regarding his fighting against the enemies and regarding his spirituality. </p>
<p data-content-id="1ushQ5QG2mm5vQ6JwR6FDX85wHlbYGuYon0k6S7Qrut04qLHEKfdtRUBEgUqfnP--"> David was raised up by God to defeat the nations, especially the Canaanites, surrounding Israel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50529" data-verses="Genesis 15:18">Genesis 15:18</span> God had promised to give to Abraham’s descendants “this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.” Later, in Deuteronomy, Moses charged the children of Israel to enter the land of Canaan, possess the land, and slaughter all the inhabitants of the land, clearing the land of idols. However, the children of Israel did not obey God. Instead, they possessed the land only in part and allowed most of the enemies to remain. As the book of Judges indicates, when Israel became weak, they were attacked by the nations. Various judges were raised up to defeat these nations, but the enemies were not utterly defeated until the time of David. David defeated the surrounding nations and prepared the land for the establishing of God’s kingdom, with Jerusalem as the center, the capital, and the place where the temple would be built. <span class="pg" data-page-id="296" id="296">[296]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="9MAUzofrAke3GqQ7OVH_bzPgWOfx6kgwnnDYK-CGhCzbB6sVxNA-LxpdL8yQCdNvA"> As such a person raised up by God, David was a type of the fighting Christ. While Christ was on earth, He was a fighting Christ, typified by David. But as the One at rest in the heavens after His ascension, He is the Christ of peace, typified by Solomon. </p>
<p data-content-id="jyiBgcfJaOuZcFp53JYhFSy8g4nLGYcTPPv0-djD3AT7nms9hwerC-8sv3vMX42bn"> David often prayed, in his psalms, concerning his enemies, even asking God to annihilate them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50530" data-verses="Psalms 54:5">54:5</span>). Insofar as he had been raised up by God to destroy the enemies of the kingdom of God, he was justified in praying this way. Furthermore, because he typified the fighting Christ, he should have defeated the enemies and slaughtered them, and he should have asked for God’s help in this matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="TFDIF40UiPk-cgxjaStqKj3AA_RCqdMXeSDN5VOxZEPCgCcaslOmgbIqwsUleJWh8"> However, we need to consider David not only in the aspect of his being a type of the fighting Christ but also in the aspect of his spirituality. David’s psalms indicate that his spirituality was not perfect. As far as spirituality is concerned, David’s prayers regarding his enemies actually violated the teaching not only of the New Testament, in which we are told to love our enemies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50531" data-verses="Matthew 5:43-48">Matt. 5:43-48</span>), but also of the Old Testament. Some might excuse David by saying that the Old Testament saints were not expected to love their enemies and were justified in hating them. This, however, is not true. To prove this, I would ask you to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50532" data-verses="Romans 12:20">Romans 12:20</span>. Here Paul says, “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head.” This verse is actually a quotation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50533" data-verses="Proverbs 25:21-22">Proverbs 25:21 and 22</span>. In both places “coals of fire” signifies burning love. Thus, even the saints in Old Testament times were charged to love their enemies. Yet in his psalms David prayed for his enemies to be annihilated, to be killed. It seems that his prayers contradict the word spoken by his son, Solomon, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50534" data-verses="Proverbs 25:21-22">Proverbs 25:21 and 22</span>. The atmosphere and spirit in David’s psalms are related not to loving the enemy but to hating him. From this we see that David, although he was spiritual, was not perfect in his spirituality. </p>
<p data-content-id="x3A_NVyRy-HcN2uaXwrKLw0fHcSNkQ1jqPzGJPy-vjJMMSTkeSMACaaj1wZdzKNhZ"> Let us now go on to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50535" data-verses="Psalms 58:1">Psalms 58—62</span>. In our study of these psalms, we will use the psalmists’ pious expressions uttered out of their complex sentiments as a background to know the spiritual things in the New Testament. <span class="pg" data-page-id="297" id="297">[297]</span> </p>

Then, writing very poetically, he goes on to liken them to a cobra, a most poisonous serpent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50540" data-verses="Psalms 58:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>). </p>

He continues by likening the wicked to water that runs off, to a snail that melts and goes away, and to a woman’s miscarriage (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50542" data-verses="Psalms 58:7-8">vv. 7-8</span>). Then he declares, “The righteous man will rejoice when he sees vengeance; / He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50543" data-verses="Psalms 58:10">v. 10</span>). Surely it is not a virtue to rejoice at seeing vengeance. David concludes this psalm, saying, “Men will say, Indeed there is fruit for the righteous man; / Indeed there is a God who judges on earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50544" data-verses="Psalms 58:11">v. 11</span>). Here “fruit” signifies a good result or some kind of just compensation. </p>
<p data-content-id="4Pl1H-TvAJj7lZqOZ3bWLXc6dXEYW2Yis2c6ZRGIY5fJcSQcdP3Ys4DBvkiP0VUqd"> How do you feel about the standard of spirituality in this psalm? I cannot have a high appreciation for this psalm. There is very little here that is good. Even the prayer and the praise are unpleasant.

<p data-content-id="L6zuCla4RL_Dfjmk9Gp2DyB5zvi7geOvYeyAJwwV7Ig0bDaJc2KxHtWDDozzngrax"> Our appreciation of the Bible, in particular of the Psalms, depends upon the kind of discernment we have. Just as the discernment and appreciation of a mature person differs from that of a child, so our appreciation of the Bible differs according to our degree of spiritual experience, understanding, and maturity. There is a vast difference between what an aged grandfather would value and appreciate and what a two-year-old child would value and appreciate. Let us suppose that a number of items are placed before them. Among these items the child may appreciate a small, beautiful, empty, round box, but to the grandfather this box and all the items he sees before him are worthless. What he appreciates and desires is a great diamond. This shows that we appreciate things according to our maturity and our capacity to discern what is of real value. Whereas some will appreciate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50589" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span>, a chapter on God’s eternal economy and the preaching of the unsearchable riches of Christ to the Gentiles according to God’s plan to produce the church, others may appreciate a portion such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50590" data-verses="Psalms 65:11-13">Psalm 65:11-13</span>, which speaks of God’s crowning the year with His goodness, His paths overflowing with fatness, the hills girding themselves with exultation, and the valleys shouting for joy and singing. </p>

As we <span class="pg" data-page-id="306" id="306">[306]</span> read these psalms, we need to exercise adequate discernment so that we may realize how these psalms compare to the standard of the teaching of the New Testament. </p>

On the one hand, the psalmist treasures the enjoyment of God; on the other hand, he also rejoices in God’s punishment of his enemies. </p>

However, we need to ask these questions: For what do we seek after God? For what do we thirst for God? In our seeking and thirsting, are we looking for something that is of great spiritual value? For what was the psalmist seeking God? For Christ? For the Divine Trinity or the life-giving Spirit? It seems that the psalmist was seeking mainly for God’s lovingkindness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50594" data-verses="Psalms 63:3">v. 3</span>). The poetic writing here is marvelous, but the contents are very limited. Nevertheless, some readers of these verses may highly appreciate them. </p>

The evildoers have sharpened their tongue like a sword and have aimed their arrow, their bitter word, to shoot in secret places at the perfect man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50601" data-verses="Psalms 64:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). The psalmist’s use of the words “perfect man” indicates that he considers himself perfect, one who should not be hated by anyone. Then the psalmist goes on to speak of his enemies, saying, “They firm up an evil matter; / They plan to lay snares secretly; / They say, Who will see them? / They devise injustices, saying: / We have completed a carefully sought out plan. / Indeed each man’s inward thought / And heart is deep” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50602" data-verses="Psalms 64:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). </p>

Literally, the Hebrew word translated “iniquities” means “instances of iniquities” or “matters of iniquities.” Here David is saying that God should remember the iniquities of David’s enemies but should propitiate his transgressions. The word <span class="pg" data-page-id="309" id="309">[309]</span> about dwelling in God’s courts and being satisfied with the goodness of His house is good, but once again we need to ask the question, “For what do we dwell in God’s courts?” </p>

Examples of this difficulty are found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50658" data-verses="Psalms 68:11-13">verses 11b through 13</span>. “The women who bear the glad tidings are a great host. / The kings of the armies flee. / They flee! / And she who abides at home / Divides the spoil. / Though you lie among the sheepfolds, / There are dove wings covered with silver, / And its pinions, with greenish yellow gold.” Who are the women who bear the glad tidings and are a great host? Who is she who abides at home and divides the spoil? There seems to be no antecedent for the pronoun “she” here. To whom does this pronoun refer? Furthermore, who is the “you” lying among the sheepfolds? We also need to inquire concerning the dove wings covered with silver and the pinions covered with greenish yellow gold. We must admit that it is difficult for us to know what these things mean and to understand them. </p>
<p data-content-id="fV0aAyMXuYdaoZynkbswCbWnfWNZmmM0Y8hBOvH-1E7ENHRl8MwaIW5bA5iMLvlPg"> As we will see, the dove, the silver, and the gold refer to the Triune God. The dove symbolizes the Spirit of God; in typology silver signifies Christ as the Redeemer who accomplished redemption for God’s salvation; and gold signifies God in His nature. Here the gold is greenish yellow, with green signifying the divine life and yellow, the divine glory. Hence, greenish yellow gold signifies God in His nature <span class="pg" data-page-id="316" id="316">[316]</span> glittering in His life and glory. Here we have the Triune God—the Spirit, Christ, and God—with all His accomplishments for us to enjoy. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVWYjeVlwsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50659" data-verses="Psalms 68:12">Verse 12</span> speaks of dividing the spoil. What is this spoil? It is something reaped as the result of fighting a battle. In His death, resurrection, and ascension, Christ fought the battle, and the spoil reaped by Him has become our enjoyment. Christ gained some spoil in every step of His fighting; He reaped spoil in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension, at which time, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50660" data-verses="Colossians 2:1">Colossians 2</span>, the evil ones tried to hold Him back. The spoil gained, reaped, by Christ is actually the Triune God. This means that the spoil in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50661" data-verses="Psalms 68:12">verse 12</span> is the Spirit as the dove, Christ the Son as the silver, and God the Father as the gold. </p>
<p data-content-id="oaKMapIqH0taB_HBBSgvpwZPDCm6qQIfo0VKLpq7SbpietHAMYoHv6iuAZG_bJfmq"> To illustrate further how hard it is to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50662" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Psalm 68</span>, let us also consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50663" data-verses="Psalms 68:25-27">verses 25 through 27</span>. “Singers go before; players after; / In the midst of virgins sounding the tambourines. / Bless God in the congregations, / Even Jehovah, O you who are of the fountain of Israel. / There are little Benjamin, who rules them, / And the princes of Judah in their company, / The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.” Do you understand all this? Why are the names of four of the twelve tribes mentioned—Benjamin, Judah, Zebulun, and Naphtali—but not the names of the other tribes? Once again, we must admit that this matter is difficult to understand. </p>
<p data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6fou6qfdtS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c"> An even more difficult matter to understand is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50664" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Psalm 68</span> was written. Why was this psalm written, and why was it composed in the way it was? In order to answer this question, we need to consider the way the psalm begins. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50665" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Verse 1</span> says, “Let God arise; let His enemies be scattered; / And let those who hate Him flee before Him.” This is a quotation of Moses’ prayer in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50666" data-verses="Numbers 10:35">Numbers 10:35</span>, uttered when the ark of the covenant set out from Mount Sinai. </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW7n_vvpZA7ULO884Enj-HplAm8UKndBtrUuO3Kkg1_Ay9Dcj0p0s6xSsEx_kZu_"> After Moses brought the children of Israel to Mount Sinai, they stayed there for quite a long time. During that time, God decreed His law to them through Moses. However, the main thing that happened at that time was not the decreeing of the law but God’s charging Moses to build the tabernacle with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="317" id="317">[317]</span> ark, the incense altar, the lampstand, the showbread table, the laver, the altar, and all the utensils. </p>
<p data-content-id="cT8NrRFfPzsynu5lLu-ODbddcoBuqjDuifVLWXa6H4_HpI5ahTZpRhf9TqTD8W_99"> What was God’s purpose in decreeing the law and in charging Moses to build the ark and the tabernacle with all its furnishings? The law was decreed for the purpose of exposing and subduing Israel. God intended to use the law to expose the people’s weakness, incapacity, defects, and shortages in order to make them realize that they were sinful and could do nothing for Him. Thus, the law was decreed to convince them of this and even to condemn them. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2o64HGRdUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50667" data-verses="Exodus 19:1">Exodus 19</span> speaks of the experience of the children of Israel at Mount Sinai. On the one hand, they were fearful, for they heard the thunder, saw the lightning and the thick cloud, and realized that God was present with them at the mountain. On the other hand, they were proud of all these things concerning God. When Moses laid before them all the words which God had commanded him, the people answered and said, “All that the Lord hath spoken we will do” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50668" data-verses="Exodus 19:8">v. 8</span>). Moses told the words of the people to the Lord, and then He came in to decree the law. Even before the law had been decreed to the children of Israel, they broke the Ten Commandments and committed sin by worshipping the golden calf. When Moses learned about this, he became angry and broke the two tablets of stone. The point here is that the law was given in order to expose the people of Israel, to convince, condemn, and subdue them, and to cause them to realize that they could not do anything to please God. This was God’s purpose in decreeing the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="E4td5kmomfAjeGazEU8_Ywkybjy28rxL8oQNM-rYLdkLIoLtHs8mIAM7ZuMPCTHuG"> Now we need to see God’s purpose concerning the building of the tabernacle. God wanted the children of Israel to build Him a tabernacle so that He could dwell among them and they could contact Him and even dwell with Him. However, because they were sinful, they needed an altar to take care of their sins. In addition, they needed the showbread table for spiritual food, the lampstand for spiritual light, and the incense altar for them to pray to the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="DTkPp079Cp66d6XMH5Nx3JFtwknnEno0ABS1nCLXQ91_Z47wAvbepEUjXUVIJrvBR"> The tabernacle built and erected at Mount Sinai was a type of Christ as the real tabernacle. This real tabernacle was set up through Christ’s incarnation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50669" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> tells us that <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> the Word, which is God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality. Whereas the tabernacle built up by Israel under Moses was a type, or a shadow, Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, is the real tabernacle for God’s dwelling on the earth and for God’s people to contact Him and dwell with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="SbdWgF4EAWEy9ge53uRDq8JkXE_958ZA6o2N5TfAmVLjMVdX55snzFO4ywV8-vS6R"> During their years in the wilderness, the children of Israel did nothing except deal with the law and the tabernacle with the altar, the laver, the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark. Whenever it was time for them to move on in their journey, they packed up the tabernacle and its furnishings and utensils and carried them with them in their move. Eventually they would stop, and the tabernacle and everything related to it would be set up again. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPfbBHDneBjs_yEzYD3C0VyiRd2UeNDPuK-ioxqWo82BpQ0oXABpY_L_3MbRH5kXR"> The people also had to present the various offerings to God. Otherwise, they would have been condemned by the law because of their sins in breaking God’s commandments. However, the blood of the sin offering that was sprinkled on the cover of the ark fulfilled the requirements of the law and enabled the people to be at peace and to contact God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ex-VBPE6iEBPGjLm6o1MCZdqPA6QdIW9p5b-_TOqQLTnIw18TKY2WJPOMgBwUFYmG"> Before the incarnation of Christ, God did not do anything for the accomplishment of His New Testament economy. In the Old Testament, God called Abraham, having chosen him and his descendants to be His people, His called race. Centuries later, God brought the people of Israel to Mount Sinai to train them and to help them to know their sinfulness and thereby to convince and subdue them. Whereas the law decreed through Moses was a reality, the tabernacle with all its furnishings and utensils was a type of Christ. Nevertheless, God could dwell in that tabernacle, and the people had a way to contact Him. Throughout the remainder of the Old Testament, in all the books of history and of the prophets, God continued to expose Israel. He exposed them in Joshua and in Judges; He exposed them in the books of Samuel and of the Kings; and He exposed them in Isaiah, Jeremiah, and all the other prophets, both major and minor. It seems that God did not move but rather did only one thing—expose the people of Israel. </p>

<p data-content-id="bqm-JyB7SIVXqnqTXQ7gAdfc3BBkuLKDq-WD-CusQJYOpzha7vmOWzhRlrUftDbwd"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50720" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Psalm 68</span> has two main sections. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50721" data-verses="Psalms 68:1-18">Verses 1 through 18</span> are the first section, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50722" data-verses="Psalms 68:19-35">verses 19 through 35</span> are the second section. As we will see, each section has a center. Before we explain what is the center of the first section, let us consider once again the matter of God’s move on the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="qf_Q-HCS9YUo9GMzE5AYdv_R4oKb3vFVaOmLANx-Rc98knFI2YImImMaqhN5dQJl3"> In the entire universe, God has only one move. The Old Testament time was actually not a time for God to move on the earth but rather a time of preparation for His move. God’s activities from Genesis to Malachi were all a part of this preparation. As an illustration, we may consider the preparation that is necessary for opening a store. The store may be built and furnished and yet not be open for business. All the preparations have been made, but the owner of the store has not yet started his business. In a similar way, the Old Testament time was a time of God’s preparation for opening the “business” of the divine economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="y_qtpCA_Os0zZ8Y1K0vwGo3rP9n24t68Y4eSGBoEmfCndK11UbLXrTHcfLFkGc3Th"> God’s economy is mainly to work Himself into His chosen and redeemed people in order to make Himself one with them and to make them one with Him. In His economy God even mingles Himself with His people to be one entity with them. Concerning this, the Bible says that we who are joined to the Lord are one spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50723" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). He is the Spirit; He has made a spirit within us; and now the divine Spirit and the regenerated human spirit have been mingled together to be one spirit. How marvelous! Such a mingling did not take place in the Old Testament, for the Old Testament time was the time <span class="pg" data-page-id="328" id="328">[328]</span> of God’s preparation. He prepared the heavens for the earth, the earth for man, and man with a spirit for God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50724" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zech. 12:1</span>). In this way, man was prepared by God for the carrying out of the business of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="8ENujLHBaosPnjKTCIaX7H-euTk0bRCtyxH-7F3HoVERIgtsLU3NTyz-xJOwN2Xhu"> God took about two thousand years—the period of time from Abraham to the coming of Christ—to prepare the people of Israel. Consider all the work God did with Israel throughout the Old Testament. Beginning with Abraham in Genesis and continuing to the end of Malachi, God engaged in many activities to make everything ready for Him to carry out His economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="vBfgOzkctJI64y2wITHICymWk_4dy56NbUV4FCRoxvXeePiesyP8cinOML7yllUh0"> The carrying out of God’s economy actually began with the incarnation of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50725" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span> says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. This indicates that the incarnation brought in the real and living tabernacle, which was Christ Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God. The physical tabernacle erected by Moses was a type, a shadow; it was not the real tabernacle. Both the tabernacle and the ark were types of Christ. However, without that type, God could not have had, with the children of Israel, a type of His move on the earth in Christ. God’s move in the tabernacle with the ark from Mount Sinai to Mount Zion was a type of His move in Christ from the incarnation to the ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtbcvCEgnrqy-dE42XrkNQcKYhMyCDtcObPJRXsB2bnNVrU4zObvTu4Y4s7w2TT6w"> At Sinai God prepared the children of Israel for His move in the tabernacle with the ark. God had sent Moses to Egypt to bring them out of Egypt to Sinai, and there at Sinai God gave them a training which lasted quite a long time. First, God decreed the law in order to test them, expose them, convince them, convict them, and subdue them. Eventually, after they were subdued, they were trained to be a holy people, a people sanctified to God so that He could dwell among them and move with them. </p>
<p data-content-id="2FPleOiE4aUvfE8GzHzDIEHaZIW1AzsIZaZoPhLsk6jHm_KkdS_Ik8gSZ9f6uN5g1"> By the time the tabernacle was set up, the people had been trained and prepared, even as an army, for God’s move. Thus Moses, the representative of Israel, prayed, saying, “Let God arise; let His enemies be scattered; / And let those who hate Him flee before Him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50726" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Psa. 68:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50727" data-verses="Numbers 10:35">Num. 10:35</span>). Immediately, God began to move with His people through the wilderness. Eventually, the ark ascended Mount Zion and was placed in <span class="pg" data-page-id="329" id="329">[329]</span> the temple, which had been built to replace the tabernacle. This was God’s move in the Old Testament, a type indicating that one day God would move on the earth in Christ as the real tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="uFsqFRd_NLv7RJd4aDXp8N2fzEDnkND2Dwws_fXkNmAQvidAcHcRx7M_n1Xj0Awsc"> After being on earth for thirty-three and a half years, Christ was crucified, was resurrected, and ascended to the heavens. As the ascended One, Christ is still working on us, the people of God, to make us a new creation, that is, to work the new creation out of the old creation. This is not a simple matter, and it cannot be done in a short time. Many of us can testify that, even though we have been in the Lord for many years, we are not that spiritual and are still being renewed, sanctified, and transformed. We still need Christ to work on us by His heavenly ministry. Even Paul had to wait until the end of his life before he could say, “I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50728" data-verses="2Timothy 4:7">2 Tim. 4:7</span>). I hope that one day we all will be able to say this. At present, the Lord is still moving on in the heavens to make us the new creation in full and to bring us from the earth to the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="fV0aAyMXuYdaoZynkbswNbWCRWNZmmM0Y8hBOvH-1E7ENHRl8MwaIW5bA5iMLvlPg"> Let us now endeavor to explain what is the center of the first section of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50729" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Psalm 68</span>. The center of this section is the dove wings gilded with silver and the dove pinions gilded with greenish yellow gold (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50730" data-verses="Psalms 68:13">v. 13</span>). The dove wings signify the moving power of the Spirit; the silver signifies Christ in His redemption for our justification; and the greenish yellow gold signifies God in His nature glittering in His life and glory. Here we have the Triune God with all His accomplishments for our enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVWXje0qwsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> The dove wings gilded with silver and the pinions gilded with greenish yellow gold are the spoil mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50731" data-verses="Psalms 68:12">verse 12</span>. Some may wonder how the Triune God could be such spoil. To understand this we need to realize that by spoil we mean something gained, or reaped, as the result of fighting and winning a battle. Christ fought the battle in His death, resurrection, and ascension, and surely He has gained some spoil as a result. What has He reaped through His victory? He has reaped the riches of the Triune God for us. At the very time we confessed our sins and believed in Christ, we received the <span class="pg" data-page-id="330" id="330">[330]</span> Spirit with God, Christ, and the divine life—the riches, the spoil, gained by Christ through His victory. </p>
<p data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWw-AGDWrao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ"> As those who have believed in the Lord Jesus, we gain what He has gained. We gain God; we gain the Spirit; we gain the divine life; and we gain the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. This means that in Christ we gain the processed and consummated Triune God as the spoil for our enjoyment. Now day by day we are enjoying the dove, the silver, and the gold. This is the center of the first section of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50732" data-verses="Psalms 68:1">Psalm 68</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xcf_6qhqmuUpIGfe8JxyfOr16ZlCW67PmCtIfSUeGYkLK3j9subuJKvpbUUJeUzlR"> Let us now go on to consider the second section of this psalm. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kVUJkTRCD2ceWNANfSpubXqjETkTgrwo3WzP5v2H-gzE3CDAPM4O-xZzgNga2L9ku">VI. THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN HIS HOUSE</h2><p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHjSJpVCE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> In the first section five matters are covered: God’s move on the earth, God’s victory in Christ, Christ’s ascension, Christ’s receiving the gifts, and Christ’s building up the house of God. This brings us to the first item in the second section—the enjoyment of God in His house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50733" data-verses="Psalms 68:19-23">vv. 19-23</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AoiD9xs4iYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8">A.

This good, as the “good” mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50736" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Romans 8:28</span>, does not refer to material things such as a nice home or a new car; rather, it refers to the Triune God—to the dove wings gilded with silver and the pinions gilded with gold.

For instance, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50876" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">verse 1</span> says, “In the beginning God created....” The Hebrew word for “God” here is <em>Elohim,</em> which means the “faithful, mighty One.” From this word we can realize that God is faithful and also mighty. Furthermore, this word, a proper noun, is not singular but plural; however, the predicate “created” is singular. This is an indication that God is triune, three-one. This surely is something of the divine revelation that progresses throughout the Bible until the last chapter of Revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2o-_HGMTUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50877" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">Colossians 1:25</span> Paul tells us that the stewardship of God was given to him “to complete the word of God.” The word of God is the divine revelation, which had not been completed before the New Testament was written. In the New Testament the apostles, especially Paul in his fourteen Epistles, completed the word of God. It is clear, therefore, that the word of God had not been completed at the time of Job or David or Malachi or even at the end of the book of Acts. </p>
<p data-content-id="E4td5kmomfAjeGazEU87fwkrUjy28rxL8oQNM-rYLdkLIoLtHs8mIAM7ZuMPCTHuG"> Some mistakenly think that orthodox doctrine consists only of what the Lord Jesus taught the twelve apostles. Those who hold this concept need to consider the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50878" data-verses="John 16:12-15">John 16:12-15</span>: “I have yet many things to say to you, but you <span class="pg" data-page-id="350" id="350">[350]</span> cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.” The disciples had to wait for the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of reality to reveal more things to them. From this we see that the word of God had not been completed even when the Lord Jesus was on earth, but still needed to be completed through the speaking of the Spirit of reality. Surely Paul was a person to whom the Holy Spirit revealed many things, and he wrote concerning these things in his Epistles, indicating, as we have seen, that he had been commissioned by God to complete the word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="DTkPp079Cp66d6XMH5N1wJFI8knnEno0ABS1nCLXQ91_Z47wAvbepEUjXUVIJrvBR"> In particular, Paul completed the word of God in regard to the mystery of God, which is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50879" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Col. 2:2</span>), and the mystery of Christ, which is the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50880" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4">Eph. 3:4</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50881" data-verses="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</span> he says, “To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” There is not such a word in Genesis or in the Psalms or fully in the four Gospels. This is an example of the fact that the divine revelation in the Bible is progressive and that it is not completed until the end of Revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="SbdWgF4EAWEy9ge53uRHt8JFaE_958ZA6o2N5TfAmVLjMVdX55snzFO4ywV8-vS6R"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50882" data-verses="Revelation 22:18-19">Revelation 22:18 and 19</span> tell us that, since the divine revelation has been completed, no one is allowed to add to it or take away from it. In other words, the Bible itself makes it clear that the entire revelation has been completed and closed, and no one is permitted to claim, as the Mormons do, that additional revelation has been given to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="kVUJkTRCD2ceWNANfSpqTXqjMTkTgrwo3WzP5v2H-gzE3CDAPM4O-xZzgNga2L9ku"> The teaching of the New Testament as a whole is called the apostles’ teaching (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50883" data-verses="Acts 2:42">Acts 2:42</span>). The apostles’ teaching began with the teaching of the Lord Jesus and continued with Peter, John, Paul, and the other apostles. We praise the Lord that we have in our hand the complete divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHnaJpVKE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> As we read the Bible, we need to learn the principles of the Bible. Especially we need to keep in mind the basic principle <span class="pg" data-page-id="351" id="351">[351]</span> that the divine revelation in the Bible is progressive. If we are clear concerning this, we will realize that the speaking of Job’s three friends is a matter not of divine revelation but of human opinion. How, then, can we regard their opinion as divine revelation? </p>
<p data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AomL9xg6iYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8"> We face a similar situation when we come to the Psalms. I appreciate the comment of John Nelson Darby that the Psalms are the expressions of the psalmists uttered out of their complex sentiments. We should not regard every aspect of the psalmists’ sentiments as the divine revelation. It would be very unwise for us to do this. On the one hand, the psalmists received a certain amount of the divine revelation; on the other hand, their receiving of this revelation caused them to have various sentiments, including sentiments related to hating their enemies, to doing good, and to keeping the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_hFM3FYAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV"> Many Christians appraise the Psalms very highly and even exalt them. On the contrary, I have been helped by Darby to see that some of the expressions in the Psalms are not the direct expression of the divine revelation but the expression of the complex sentiments of the psalmists. The psalmists who uttered these expressions were pious; they loved God, feared God, and tried their best to please God, trust God, and keep the law. With the exception of trying to keep the law, all these things are good. Trying to keep the law is contrary to one of the principles of the Bible. The law was not given for God’s people to keep; rather, the law was given to try them, to prove them, and to convince them that they were unable to keep the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="bqm-JyB7SIVXqnqTXQ7kIdfB5BBkuLKDq-WD-CusQJYOpzha7vmOWzhRlrUftDbwd"> Today’s Christians commonly say that every word of the Bible from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50884" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50885" data-verses="Revelation 22:21">Revelation 22:21</span> is the word of God. I believe that the Bible is wholly inspired by God but not that every word in the Bible is a word by God. Surely, the word of the serpent to Eve in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50886" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> is not a word by God, and it would be a great mistake to say that it is. In the Bible there are many words uttered by God’s enemies, for instance, the words uttered by the chief priests and the scribes in their mocking of the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50887" data-verses="Mark 15:31">Mark 15:31</span>). My point here is that we need to differentiate between the word spoken by God and the word spoken by others. No doubt, every word out of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="352" id="352">[352]</span> mouth of the Lord Jesus is a word out of the mouth of God, and such a word is the divine revelation directly given. However, in the Bible there are many words that are not the words of God. Without those words we would not have the proper background for the showing of the divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="qf_Q-HCS9YUo9GMzE5AcVv_I3oKb3vFVaOmLANx-Rc98knFI2YImImMaqhN5dQJl3"> In the fifty chapters of Genesis we have a history of a number of people from Adam to Joseph, but in this book there is very little teaching or doctrine, if any. Without teaching or doctrine how can there be much revelation? In this matter, Romans is very different from Genesis. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50888" data-verses="Romans 1:1">Chapters one through fifteen</span> of Romans are filled with Paul’s teaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="y_qtpCA_Os0zZ8Y1K0v0Oo3OD9n24t68Y4eSGBoEmfCndK11UbLXrTHcfLFkGc3Th"> What do we have in the Psalms? Do we have history and doctrine? No, in the Psalms we have the expressions of sentiments. How much of the divine revelation is unveiled in a particular expression depends on the kind of sentiment conveyed by that expression. Certainly David’s expression of his sentiment of hatred for his enemies should not be considered something of the divine revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="8ENujLHBaosPnjKTCIaTzH-_jTk0bRCtyxH-7F3HoVERIgtsLU3NTyz-xJOwN2Xhu"> I hope that this opening word will help to give you, especially the young generation, a proper foundation for understanding the Bible. In particular, I hope that this word will help you to understand what I am endeavoring to do in these messages on the Psalms. In our reading of the Psalms, we need to realize that certain expressions are not of the divine revelation but of the psalmists’ complex sentiments. </p>

In the divine arrangement, the psalms that we will cover in this message—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50943" data-verses="Psalms 77:1-83">Psalms 77 through 83</span>—form a cluster that may be according to both history and doctrine. These psalms cover the devastation of three holy things—the holy temple, the holy city, and the holy people. In particular, these psalms reveal the way of restoration, showing us that the way to be restored is to exalt Christ. The more Christ is exalted, the more restoration there will be. </p>
<p data-content-id="U3SJ7x2XZmwE-vT9C-B4mEq_AtOBuETEkreZHMxUhbPpeAsVz1iLkblSuDuEcWpye"> These seven psalms were written by Asaph, a Levite who had served in the temple. The fact that these psalms speak of the desolation of the temple, the city of Jerusalem, and the people indicates that they were written after the children of Israel had been taken captive to Babylon. </p>
<p data-content-id="M7fCqdO3rsw64DHJPn8hMVw-l6VwUJRZ3yHZlLdZbQwfTUGFzmgEUPSGaDO0Z7qHX"> According to the history recorded in these psalms, the ark of God was captured once and was probably lost eventually. First, it was captured before the temple was built. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50944" data-verses="Psalms 78:60-61">Psalm 78:60 and 61</span> refer to this: “He forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, / The tent that He had established among men; / And He gave over His strength [His ark] into captivity, / And His glory into the hand of the adversary.” The ark had been in the tabernacle at Shiloh. One day, when the people of Israel went out to fight against the Philistines, they brought with them the ark of the covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50945" data-verses="1Samuel 4:1-5">1 Sam. 4:1-5</span>). In that battle the people of Israel were defeated, and the ark of God was <span class="pg" data-page-id="360" id="360">[360]</span> captured by the Philistines (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50946" data-verses="1Samuel 4:11">v. 11</span>). God, however, came in to protect the ark, and it was returned (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50947" data-verses="1Samuel 5:1">1 Sam. 5—6</span>). Eventually, David defeated the enemies of Israel and prepared both the site and the materials for the building of the temple, even giving the design of the temple to his son Solomon. Under Solomon the temple was built, and the ark was placed in it. That temple remained about four hundred years until it was destroyed by the Babylonians in 606 B.C. At that time the ark was lost without a trace. This is part of the history recorded in these psalms, which we will now consider one by one. </p>

The word “muse” conveys a sense of sweetness, even of enjoyment. When the psalmist could not sleep during the night, he mused upon the great things God had done for His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="TFDIF40UiPk-cgxjaStuOj3hP_RCqdMXeSDN5VOxZEPCgCcaslOmgbIqwsUleJWh8"> The psalmist went on to relate the story of God’s saving Israel from Egypt, recalling how God made His strength known among the peoples and redeemed His people with His arm (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50957" data-verses="Psalms 77:14-15">vv. 14-15</span>). He remembered that the waters saw Him and were afraid, that the depths trembled, that the clouds poured forth water, that the sound of His thunder was in the whirlwind, that lightning illuminated the world, that the earth trembled and quaked, and that He led His people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="50958" data-verses="Psalms 77:16-18">vv. 16-18</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="50959" data-verses="Psalms 77:20">20</span>).

Many Christians neglect the matter of the spirit. Some do not even realize that they have a human spirit. Likewise, many do not have a proper understanding concerning the church. Without paying attention to our spirit and to the church, we cannot know God’s way, which is revealed in His sanctuary. I thank the Lord that we in the Lord’s recovery know both the spirit and the church. When we were in Elden hall, we had a slogan: “In spirit, on the ground.” In this slogan the word “spirit” refers to our regenerated human spirit, and the word “ground” denotes the ground of the church. Today we have a twofold sanctuary: a private sanctuary—the spirit—and a public sanctuary—the church. </p>

Book 3 of the Psalms has much to say about God’s dealing and stripping. For example, the psalmist in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51011" data-verses="Psalms 73:1">Psalm 73</span> was puzzled by God’s dealing and stripping and did not become clear concerning this until he entered into the sanctuary of God. The situation of the psalmists in such psalms was nearly the same as Job’s. The main difference is that whereas the psalmists experienced God’s dealing and stripping, Job also experienced God’s consuming. </p>
<p data-content-id="wz9YZjJszQSaVqUbb2ieWhIRstrzM6eJbBJ9AgWWAfl9SPNOQr15VHqMpSEz2Zobj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51012" data-verses="Psalms 84:1">Psalm 84</span> uses a special term—“the valley of Baca.” “Baca” means “weeping.” Hence, the valley of Baca is the valley of weeping. This special term indicates that the psalmist had been dealt with by God and had been stripped by Him. </p>

The psalmist was not yet in God’s habitations, but he longed to be there. His longing was so great that he even fainted. This indicates to what extent the psalmist loved God’s habitations. </p>

These two altars are the golden altar for incense and the brass altar of burnt offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51016" data-verses="Exodus 40:5-6">Exo. 40:5-6</span>). The brass altar, on which all kinds of offerings were offered, was in the outer court before the door of the tabernacle. The laver was also in the outer court. In the Holy Place were the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the golden altar for incense. </p>

At this altar all the negative things have been dealt with by the offerings, which typify Christ. At the cross Christ took away our sins, crucified the old man, destroyed Satan, judged Satan’s cosmos, and terminated the old creation and all the negative things. It was at the cross, therefore, that all our problems were solved, and it was at the cross that we first believed in the Lord Jesus. At the cross we confessed our sins, and at the cross we were forgiven. This qualified us to enter into the Holy Place and to come to the showbread table to receive food, to the lampstand to receive light, and to the golden altar to experience Christ as our incense acceptable to God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="371" id="371">[371]</span> </p>

This incense typifies the resurrected Christ in His ascension as the acceptance to God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51017" data-verses="Revelation 8:3">Rev. 8:3</span>). As our incense Christ is fragrant, pleasant, and acceptable. Apart from Christ we cannot be accepted by God. Christ is our acceptance. On the negative side, at the brass altar our problems were solved by the crucified Christ; on the positive side, at the golden altar we become acceptable to God in the resurrected Christ in His ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="lnStf6w0mGYlfBdHZPgnL2mwi4W_Vp4Xr-bbSzE8X4PBExpGgaJ9ExBbKKISN9aOg"> Before Christ’s death there was a veil separating the Holy of Holies, where the ark was, from the Holy Place, where the golden altar was. Thus, there was a veil between the ark and the golden altar. Whereas some verses say clearly that the golden altar was outside the veil, other verses indicate that the golden altar belonged to the Holy of Holies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51018" data-verses="Hebrews 9:4">Heb. 9:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51019" data-verses="1Kings 6:22">1 Kings 6:22</span>, ASV). When Christ died He rent the veil that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51020" data-verses="Matthew 27:51">Matt. 27:51</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51021" data-verses="Hebrews 10:20">Heb. 10:20</span>), so now there is no longer a veil, a separation, between the ark and the golden altar. </p>
<p data-content-id="OStP7wKqw4XofP1Nzz4kam4Z3ivn3tW4ba4lk0uKaZVu2pdBrTzyGBK2L-ogLSmdV"> The fact that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51022" data-verses="Exodus 40:5-6">Exodus 40:5 and 6</span> mention the golden altar together with the brass altar indicates that these two altars are closely related. They are closely related also in our experience. First, we come to the altar of brass, to the cross, where all negative things are dealt with. As a result of our experience at this altar, we are clean and are qualified to enter into the tabernacle to contact God at the incense altar. </p>

What is the difference between a home and a nest? Whereas a home is a place of rest, a nest is a place of refuge. <span class="pg" data-page-id="372" id="372">[372]</span> For us today, the brass altar is a refuge. We hide ourselves under the cross, escaping our troubles, and thus we are covered and have refuge. Then at the golden altar we contact our Christ in the heavens. This contact is not for refuge—it is for rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6foq_qfRvS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c"> A swallow is small and weak and is troubled by storms and by many other things. But a swallow has a nest, a refuge. Like a swallow coming to the nest where she may lay her young, we may come to the cross of Christ as our refuge. Here we may bring our “young,” those whom we contact in our preaching of the gospel. Spiritually speaking, at the “nest” of the cross we should “lay” our young, our spiritual children. To lay the young is to produce them through the preaching of the gospel. To do this we need to bring sinners to the cross of Christ. It is here, at the cross, that we have our nest, our refuge, and it is here that we “lay our young,” that is, produce our spiritual children. Before contacting the cross they were sinners, but by contacting the cross they become believers, young children in the Lord. As we teach our young to call on the Lord, they will learn to offer prayer to God at the altar of incense. Then in their experience these two altars will be closely related. </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW7n_vvpZA7ULO884Ejm-HljAm8UKndBtrUuO3Kkg1_Ay9Dcj0p0s6xSsEx_kZu_"> We have pointed out that this psalm on the psalmist’s love for the house of God with Christ speaks of God’s tabernacles and God’s house. In type, the tabernacles, the habitations, are the local churches, and the house is the church as a totality. When we come to the church, the house of God, we are attracted by the two altars, both of which are very striking. At the first altar, the brass altar, we confess our sins, failures, and defects. Here at the cross our problems are solved, and we are qualified to enter into God. Then we may come to the golden altar to contact God. </p>
<p data-content-id="cT8NrRFfPzsynu5lLu-KGbdRaoBuqjDuifVLWXa6H4_HpI5ahTZpRhf9TqTD8W_99"> At the brass altar we meet the crucified Christ, but at the golden altar the crucified Christ becomes the ascended Christ. In His ascension Christ becomes our acceptance. No matter how good or pure we may seem to be in ourselves, we cannot be acceptable to God apart from Christ. We can be acceptable to God only in Christ. This is what it means for Christ to become our incense. <span class="pg" data-page-id="373" id="373">[373]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2o-9HGdfUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51024" data-verses="Revelation 8:3">Revelation 8:3</span> indicates that in order for our prayer to be accepted by God, it must have Christ as the incense added to it. This is why we need to pray in the Lord’s name. Sometimes we may conclude our prayer with the words “in the name of the Lord Jesus.” If we pray in our own name, we will not be acceptable to God. Only when we are in the Lord’s name will we be acceptable to God, for then Christ as the incense, as a pleasant fragrance, will be our acceptance. In Him we will be not only acceptable to God but also fragrant and pleasant to Him. </p>

Recently, the Lord has opened up the intrinsic content of this short psalm. The intrinsic content of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51053" data-verses="Psalms 84:1">Psalm 84</span> is the secret revelation concerning the enjoyment of the incarnated Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="-vxlXU6cmTLDZeIgsltdmW7I4fk9PR4omIpgyX1cWz_fCQS9vCp2fzq9vYNGAYAbP"> The Old Testament indicates that God is triune (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51054" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Gen. 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51055" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51056" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1-3">Isa. 6:1-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51057" data-verses="Isaiah 6:8">8</span>), but the God unveiled in the Old Testament is not the incarnated Triune God. In the Old Testament the incarnation of the Triune God was a hidden mystery. However, the very first chapter of the New Testament, a chapter on the genealogy of Christ, speaks of God being born into a virgin to become a man in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51058" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">Matt. 1:20</span>). This is the Triune God coming into man to make Himself one with man, to make Himself humanly divine as the God-man named Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51059" data-verses="Matthew 1:21">vv. 21</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51060" data-verses="Matthew 1:23">23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="pOSFl8c_X-HYWYsp6UJQ11nm6h2lwww2mnDf2YZn0tCbZM12hbPXMVxewp8ZD97ww"> The Lord Jesus lived and walked on earth in a divine-human way for thirty-three and a half years, and then He died on the cross to consummate an all-inclusive, vicarious death, a death that solved all the problems between God and man. His death on the cross is signified by the first of the two altars mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51061" data-verses="Psalms 84:1">Psalm 84</span>. This altar is the bronze altar for the offering of the sacrifices. </p>
<p data-content-id="vBfgOzkctJI64y2wITHMJymzu_4dy56NbUV4FCRoxvXeePiesyP8cinOML7yllUh0"> After Christ passed through death, He entered into resurrection. In resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51062" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51063" data-verses="Romans 1:3-4">Rom. 1:3-4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51064" data-verses="Romans 8:29">8:29</span>). Prior to that time He was the only begotten Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51065" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51066" data-verses="John 3:16">3:16</span>). As the only begotten Son, Christ had divinity, but He did not have <span class="pg" data-page-id="380" id="380">[380]</span> humanity. However, as the firstborn Son of God, begotten in resurrection, He has humanity as well as divinity, the human nature as well as the divine nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtbcvCEgnrqy-dE42XrgGQcrThMyCDtcObPJRXsB2bnNVrU4zObvTu4Y4s7w2TT6w"> Furthermore, in His wonderful resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51067" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). The Spirit of God was there in the Old Testament, but at that time the Spirit of God did not have the capacity to give the divine life to humanity. For this reason, certain ones of the descendants of Adam received the power of God but not the life of God. Samson is a typical example of one who received the power of God from the Spirit of God but did not have anything related to God’s life. Many others in the Old Testament, such as Job, were quite godly and pious, but we cannot say that they were spiritual, that they were filled with the spiritual, divine life. It was only since the resurrection of Christ, who is the incarnated Triune God, that the Spirit of God began to have the capacity to give the divine life to human beings, for it was in resurrection that Christ Himself became the life-giving Spirit. Also, in the resurrection of Christ all of God’s chosen people were regenerated, born again (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51068" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). In the resurrected Christ, who is the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit, we, God’s chosen people, were regenerated to become the new creation, the new man. </p>
<p data-content-id="RF99mNghJcAjqAzGSAk8f2VDWbTnyYTK8F_bH0457aEcoqMtCJBP6MvoDLWTtZiuq"> Following His resurrection, Christ ascended. When He ascended to the heavens, another altar was established, the golden altar of incense for God to accept what Christ has brought to Him. The two altars—the bronze altar for the sacrifices and the golden altar of incense—are the leading consummations of the work of the incarnated Triune God, who is Christ as the embodiment of God for His increase. This is the intrinsic content of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51069" data-verses="Psalms 84:1">Psalm 84</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="swd5PZucw8Weq5orQKdV0kqo2pmNj9flJYCofaCPSu3vPBuDVlmeBwHc2dDffPws_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51070" data-verses="Psalms 84:1">Psalm 84</span> bears four aspects. The first aspect is the loveliness of the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51071" data-verses="Psalms 84:1">v. 1</span>). The second aspect is the longing of the psalmist to enter into God’s house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51072" data-verses="Psalms 84:2">v. 2</span>). Third, there is the aspect of the highways to the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51073" data-verses="Psalms 84:5">v. 5b</span>). The fourth aspect consists of the blessings of dwelling in the house of God to enjoy God as the sun, the shield, the grace, and the glory. In such a house we enjoy the incarnated and consummated Triune God as our sun to supply us with life, as <span class="pg" data-page-id="381" id="381">[381]</span> our shield to protect us from God’s enemy, as grace for our enjoyment, and as glory for the manifestation of God. Let us now consider this psalm in more detail. </p>

Although many Christians talk about and even debate regarding the Trinity, not many enjoy the incarnated Triune God. We thank the Lord that in the recovery, in the church life, the Christ we enjoy is the incarnated Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="m0i-wy-RG-xPsDhHONkZZyTp4aEHJYJZEFR9UfXFGxjnD7XcVM08W-VxUhCdMTvok"> We need to see that Christ is not only the embodiment of God but also that Christ is the incarnated Triune God. In this Christ we have God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and also coinhere, that is, they dwell in one another. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. The Father and the Son are in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Father and in the Son. In this way the three of the Triune God coinhere. Furthermore, in Christ the Triune God has passed through a long process to become the processed and consummated Triune God. This is Christ as our enjoyment and as our portion allotted to us by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51075" data-verses="Colossians 1:12">Col. 1:12</span>). </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="F2xyP711-ImVwCRnTxPRdF4wxOzRP_L_Fsgt0ia8aB6yvP3rASXANWKWp8ji3KpUG">B. A Diagram of the Layout<br/>of the House of God</h2><p data-content-id="C0vZoeE_Tq6zu9_FulgwNRW72dNTgG7cDJrnlW3MlPGUBMuWsC2B7F32iItZg_FXY"> At this point, I would ask you to consider the diagram of the layout of the house of God printed on the next page. In this diagram we see the main items of our enjoyment of Christ as the incarnated Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="382" id="382">[382]</span> </p>
<p class="image" data-content-id="PdqflOTfa_fEqM2Whps1JbYU3E82eUf_xHvz09sRCXeut0OLr1OkE4g8-OxoH5y1Y"> <img alt="chart" src="https://www.ministrybooks.org/assets/img/charts/LS01-19Psalms33_chart.jpg"/> <span class="pg" data-page-id="383" id="383">[383]</span></p>
<p data-content-id="-vxlXU6cmTLDZeIgsltdmW7Zyfk9PR4omIpgyX1cWz_fCQS9vCp2fzq9vYNGAYAbP"> The diagram shows us that in the outer court there are two items: the first altar, the bronze altar, for the offering of the sacrifices, and the laver, a large basin containing water for washing. At the first altar, all of our problems before God are solved through the sacrifices, and we are saved. Why, then, do we still need the laver? To answer this question we need to see that God’s goal is not to solve our problems; God’s goal is to make us, the old creation, the new creation. In order to become the new creation, we need to be washed. Our old creation was made of the dust of the earth, and this dust needs to be washed away in the laver. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51081" data-verses="Titus 3:5">Titus 3:5</span> says that God has saved us “through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.” After we have experienced the altar and the laver, we are qualified to enter into the incarnated God, signified by the tabernacle. </p>
<p data-content-id="pOSFl8c_X-HYWYsp6UJQ11nzxh2lwww2mnDf2YZn0tCbZM12hbPXMVxewp8ZD97ww"> In the Old Testament no one could enter into God. But in His incarnation God has become enterable. However, many of today’s Christians, not realizing that God is enterable, do not proceed from the first altar to the laver, and they do not enter into God. They may speak of fearing God, of exalting God, and of loving God but not of entering into God. Have you entered into God? We all need to pass through the first altar, come to the laver, and then enter into God. </p>
<p data-content-id="vBfgOzkctJI64y2wITHMJymam_4dy56NbUV4FCRoxvXeePiesyP8cinOML7yllUh0"> Do you know who the enterable God is? Our enterable God is Christ, the God-man, the incarnated Triune God and the embodiment of the Triune God. When we enter into Him, we have the showbread table for the life supply and the lampstand for the light of life. This enables us to live and walk in the incarnated Triune God. I can testify that in these days I have been living and walking in the incarnated Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtbcvCEgnrqy-dE42XrgGQcGahMyCDtcObPJRXsB2bnNVrU4zObvTu4Y4s7w2TT6w"> In the incarnated Triune God we have not only the showbread table and the lampstand but also the second altar, the incense altar, for the offering of the incense. The incense signifies Christ as our acceptance. At the first altar our problems before God are solved through Christ as the sacrifices. At the second altar Christ is the incense for us to be accepted by God. </p>

<p data-content-id="Xcf_6qhqmuUpIGfe8Jx2TOrk3ZlCW67PmCtIfSUeGYkLK3j9subuJKvpbUUJeUzlR"> In this message we will cover <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51106" data-verses="Psalms 85:1-89">Psalms 85 through 89</span>. In order to enter into the intrinsic significance of these five psalms, we need to realize that the aim of the entire book of Psalms is to turn God’s people from so many things which they regard as positive to Christ. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51107" data-verses="Psalms 1:1-2">Psalms 1 and 2</span> indicate that we need to be turned to Christ from certain things that in our eyes are very positive. Of the five psalms which we will consider in this message, three psalms (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51108" data-verses="Psalms 85:1">Psa. 85</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51109" data-verses="Psalms 86:1">86</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51110" data-verses="Psalms 88:1">88</span>) show us a particular background, and the other two (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51111" data-verses="Psalms 87:1">Psa. 87</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51112" data-verses="Psalms 89:1">89</span>) show us the way to go on from this background. </p>
<p data-content-id="kVUJkTRCD2ceWNANfSpqXXq-GTkTgrwo3WzP5v2H-gzE3CDAPM4O-xZzgNga2L9ku"> The background in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51113" data-verses="Psalms 85:1">Psalms 85</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51114" data-verses="Psalms 86:1">86</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51115" data-verses="Psalms 88:1">88</span> involves three things: the restoration of God’s people, personal salvation, and release from sufferings. Throughout the centuries, God’s people have been praying for revival, for corporate restoration. God’s people have also been concerned about personal salvation, not only from eternal perdition but also from various bothering and entangling things in their daily life. Furthermore, all Christians pray about their sufferings, asking God to release them from their sufferings. In our eyes these three matters are positive, but in God’s eyes they are not positive. </p>
<p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHneJpMBE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51116" data-verses="Psalms 87:1">Psalms 87</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51117" data-verses="Psalms 89:1">89</span> present Christ with God’s saints, God’s house, God’s city, and God’s earth. The Christ unveiled in these psalms is versus the restoration of God’s people, personal salvation, and the release from sufferings spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51118" data-verses="Psalms 85:1">Psalms 85</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51119" data-verses="Psalms 86:1">86</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51120" data-verses="Psalms 88:1">88</span>. For this reason, I have entitled this message “Christ versus Restoration of God’s People, Personal <span class="pg" data-page-id="390" id="390">[390]</span> Salvation, and Release from Sufferings.” Today many Christians do not care for anything concerning God. If they do care for God, their concern is related mainly to restoration, personal salvation, and release from sufferings. </p>
<p data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AomP9xFyiYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8"> Let us now go on to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51121" data-verses="Psalms 85:1-89">Psalms 85 through 89</span> one by one. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="a06WdpJdIKUZwbONsP_hBM3kRAMz73tbO5PxpB_sq7aozdQZwjuJCrguwDvyaVlyV">I. THE SEEKING OF THE SONS OF KORAH<br/>FOR THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL</h2><p data-content-id="K1eAihiqzvOD_ioDc2UFXRf_DEn8sDcLTtT8TGFcTdIl76OxcXwPf6jwTsqT2wjk7"> The subject of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51122" data-verses="Psalms 85:1">Psalm 85</span> is the seeking of the sons of Korah for the restoration of Israel. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51123" data-verses="Psalms 85:4">verse 4</span> the psalmist prays, “Restore us, O God of our salvation, / And cause Your indignation toward us to cease.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51124" data-verses="Psalms 85:6">verse 6</span> he goes on to ask, “Will You not again revive us, / That Your people may rejoice in You?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51125" data-verses="Psalms 85:8-11">verses 8 through 11</span> the psalmist writes about Jehovah’s speaking peace to His people, about His salvation being near to those who fear Him, and about glory, lovingkindness, truth, and righteousness. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51126" data-verses="Psalms 85:12-13">Verses 12 and 13</span> conclude, “Indeed Jehovah will give what is good, / And our land will give its increase. / Righteousness will go before Him / And make His footsteps a way to walk in.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lnStf6w0mGYlfBdHZPgnN2mwq4W_Vp4Xr-bbSzE8X4PBExpGgaJ9ExBbKKISN9aOg"> This seeking for the restoration of Israel was based upon God’s promise to Israel’s forefathers to give land, peace, and many other good things to their descendants. Eventually, however, the sons of Korah experienced God’s punishment and the desolation and degradation of God’s people. Hence, in their seeking as recorded in this psalm they prayed for restoration. Surely this was good and also important, but we need to see what God would say about it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OStP7wKqw4XofP1Nzz4kcm4V1ivn3tW4ba4lk0uKaZVu2pdBrTzyGBK2L-ogLSmdV">II. THE SEEKING OF DAVID<br/>FOR HIS PERSONAL SALVATION</h2><p data-content-id="4Pl1H-TvAJj7lZqOZ3bSKXc6ZXEYW2Yis2c6ZRGIY5fJcSQcdP3Ys4DBvkiP0VUqd"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51127" data-verses="Psalms 86:1">Psalm 86</span> is concerned with the seeking of David for his personal salvation. As we read this psalm we need to pay special attention to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51128" data-verses="Psalms 86:2">verses 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51129" data-verses="Psalms 86:11-13">11-13</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51130" data-verses="Psalms 86:15-16">15-16</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51131" data-verses="Psalms 86:2">verse 2</span> David prayed, “Keep my soul; for I am godly; / Save Your servant who trusts in You, O You who are my God.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51132" data-verses="Psalms 86:16">verse 16</span> he said, “Turn to me and be gracious to me; / Give Your strength to Your servant, / And save the son of Your <span class="pg" data-page-id="391" id="391">[391]</span> maidservant.” David’s seeking for his personal salvation was important; however, it was important not for itself but for something else. We may use eating as an illustration. Eating is important not for its own sake but for something else. Likewise, it is important to be saved, but salvation is for something else, not for itself. </p>

THE DESIRE OF GOD FOR ZION WITH CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6foq5qfdpS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c"> Whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51133" data-verses="Psalms 85:1">Psalm 85</span> is on the seeking of the sons of Korah for restoration and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51134" data-verses="Psalms 86:1">Psalm 86</span> is on the seeking of David for salvation, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51135" data-verses="Psalms 87:1">Psalm 87</span> is on the desire of God for Zion with Christ. In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, Zion always implies God’s house and God’s city. “Zion” is a poetic title of the church in the universal sense and also in the local sense (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51136" data-verses="Hebrews 12:22">Heb. 12:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51137" data-verses="Galatians 4:26">Gal. 4:26</span>). Therefore, Zion signifies the church universally and locally. The heavenly Zion is the final resting place of the overcomers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51138" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Rev. 14:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW7n_vvpZA7ULO884Ejg-HphAm8UKndBtrUuO3Kkg1_Ay9Dcj0p0s6xSsEx_kZu_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51139" data-verses="Psalms 87:1">Psalm 87</span> firstly refers to Zion’s foundation, which is called “His [God’s] foundation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51140" data-verses="Psalms 87:1">v. 1</span>). This divine foundation, typifying Christ as God’s unique foundation for the building up of His house, the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51141" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:11">1 Cor. 3:11</span>), is built in the “holy mountains,” which typify the local churches. Jerusalem was built on these holy mountains, and among these mountains the highest peak is the one on which Zion was built, which typifies the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="cT8NrRFfPzsynu5lLu-KAbddYoBuqjDuifVLWXa6H4_HpI5ahTZpRhf9TqTD8W_99"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51142" data-verses="Psalms 87:2">Psalm 87:2</span> says, “Jehovah loves the gates of Zion / More than all the dwellings of Jacob.” The gates are for coming in and going out, signifying fellowship. The fact that the New Jerusalem will have twelve gates indicates that God’s holy city will be full of fellowship. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2o-7HGRRUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> Recently, for the sake of fellowship among the churches, the Lord has led us to practice the clustering and the blending. However, some saints care only for the jurisdiction of their local church, and they do not want anyone to come to them and touch anything related to their local church. This means that they close the gate. In Brother Nee’s words, they make their local church a “native church” and a “small empire.” This is not Zion, for Zion has many gates for fellowship. <span class="pg" data-page-id="392" id="392">[392]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="E4td5kmomfAjeGazEU87bwkyXjy28rxL8oQNM-rYLdkLIoLtHs8mIAM7ZuMPCTHuG"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51143" data-verses="Psalms 87:1">Psalm 87</span> unveils Christ with all the saints to be God’s house for God’s city and for God to gain the whole earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51144" data-verses="Psalms 87:5-6">Verses 5 and 6</span> say, “Of Zion it will be said, / This one and that one were born in her, / And the Most High Himself will establish her. / Jehovah will count / When He records the peoples: / This One was born there.” The word about “this one” and “that one” being born in Zion indicates that Zion is full of saints. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51145" data-verses="Psalms 87:6">Verse 6</span> tells us that “this One”—Christ, the unique One—was born there. Christ Himself and all the saints were born in Zion. </p>
<p data-content-id="DTkPp079Cp66d6XMH5N10JFh2knnEno0ABS1nCLXQ91_Z47wAvbepEUjXUVIJrvBR"> In addition to those born in Zion, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51146" data-verses="Psalms 87:1">Psalm 87</span> speaks of people born in five other places: Rahab, Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, and Cush. “Rahab” is a poetic title given to Egypt. In the Bible Egypt stands for a place rich in resources, a place where it is easy for one to make a living and where it is possible for one to make a fortune for his enjoyment. When there was a famine in Canaan and people were short of food, they went down to Egypt, a land of riches signifying today’s world. </p>
<p data-content-id="SbdWgF4EAWEy9ge53uRHp8JoRE_958ZA6o2N5TfAmVLjMVdX55snzFO4ywV8-vS6R"> Babylon was famous in the realm of human success and glory. It was the continuation of Babel, where man endeavored to glorify himself by building a tower to heaven. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, built a great and powerful empire, a monument to man’s success and glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="gPfbBHDneBjs_yEzYD3G3Vyubd2UeNDPuK-ioxqWo82BpQ0oXABpY_L_3MbRH5kXR"> Philistia was very close to the holy land. According to the Bible, the Philistines were clever in handling the holy things in a human way. When the ark of God was captured and brought into their country, they devised a way to deal with it. Having contacted the holy land and having learned about the holy things from the holy land, the Philistines became adept in handling holy things according to human wisdom. Today there are many people who are not in the holy things but are very close to these things and have their human way to handle them. </p>
<p data-content-id="ex-VBPE6iEBPGjLm6o1IBZdmFA6QdIW9p5b-_TOqQLTnIw18TKY2WJPOMgBwUFYmG"> According to the Bible and to history, Tyre was a commercial country, a country of merchandise and of high civilization. Their traffic in commerce was their glory. There are many “Tyres” on earth today. </p>
<p data-content-id="5KAH-UmAtuU3gKpaATqwPVxAe4YWsT4usc1Ic-G4s86Oc-dA28nxZLaHM68xJ5WC1"> The last place was Cush (Ethiopia). Cush was a place from which people came to learn of the holy land. The queen of <span class="pg" data-page-id="393" id="393">[393]</span> Sheba, for example, came from Ethiopia to learn of Solomon. The Ethiopian eunuch in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51147" data-verses="Acts 8:1">Acts 8</span> also came to the holy land to learn. Hence, in history, Cush, or Ethiopia, also had a name and a reputation. </p>

Book 1 is composed of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51175" data-verses="Psalms 1:1-41">Psalms 1 through 41</span>; Book 2, of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51176" data-verses="Psalms 42:1-72">Psalms 42 through 72</span>; Book 3, of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51177" data-verses="Psalms 73:1-89">Psalms 73 through 89</span>; Book 4, of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51178" data-verses="Psalms 90:1-106">Psalms 90 through 106</span>; and Book 5, of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51179" data-verses="Psalms 107:1-150">Psalms 107 through 150</span>. The division of the Psalms into these five books is not according to chronological order, that is, it is not according to the time of writing. Neither is the arrangement of the books according to the nature of the teaching found in these books. In each book there are psalms that are a mixture of the revelation concerning Christ and the complex sentiments of the psalmists, sentiments that are according to the writers’ thought regarding good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="_Kg3rgsrWaIDsgfCFJ229uSo_FR7I4zgAOVRYaoYrTK7cWtwrlBYbr6bIuzFYwU_s"> In this message we come to Book 4, which, like Book 3, has seventeen psalms. The seventeen psalms in Book 4 are in three categories. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51180" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalms 90—92</span> are in one category; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51181" data-verses="Psalms 93:1">Psalms 93—101</span> are in a second category; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51182" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalms 102—106</span> are in a third category. </p>
<p data-content-id="Blqqdh81kLssrkuFxB4qkg62LoAGD5eM2eD35Njpagb8MS9jmxPe2PiUpxlR9O2AT"> It is hard to say how the Psalms were divided into five books, but we can be sure that this arrangement was not made by the human mind. Of course, certain persons made the arrangement, but the Spirit was also involved. As the Lord showed us during our study of the Psalms in 1969, the five books of the Psalms were divided by the Spirit according to four crucial words: Christ, house, city, earth. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51186" data-verses="Psalms 27:4">Psalm 27:4</span> we have a word concerning the house: “One thing I have asked from Jehovah; / That do I seek: / To dwell in the house of Jehovah / All the days of my life, / To behold the beauty of Jehovah, / And to inquire in His temple.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51187" data-verses="Psalms 36:8">Psalm 36:8</span> speaks of being saturated with the fatness of God’s house and of drinking of the river of His pleasures, for with Him is the fountain of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51188" data-verses="Psalms 36:9">v. 9a</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51189" data-verses="Psalms 46:4">Psalm 46:4a</span> says, “There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51190" data-verses="Psalms 48:1">Psalm 48</span> we find expressions such as “the city of our God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51191" data-verses="Psalms 48:1">v. 1</span>) and “the city of the great King” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51192" data-verses="Psalms 48:2">v. 2</span>).

As we read these psalms, we need to seek what they reveal about the deeper experience of God and about the identification with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="C0vZoeE_Tq6zu9_FulgwLRW7-dNTgG7cDJrnlW3MlPGUBMuWsC2B7F32iItZg_FXY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51197" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90</span> opens with a word concerning God as our dwelling place: “O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.” To be sure, the Bible is the only book that tells us that God can be our dwelling place. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51198" data-verses="Psalms 42:1">Psalm 42:1</span> speaks of panting after God as a hart pants after streams of water. In preaching the gospel, we may tell others that they can drink, eat, and breathe the Lord Jesus, but have you ever told others that they can dwell in the Lord? Dwelling in the Lord is deeper than drinking Him. Many of us, after coming into the church life, can testify of drinking, eating, and breathing Christ, but have you ever had the thought of dwelling in Christ? </p>
<p data-content-id="PdqflOTfa_fEqM2Whps1PbYU_E82eUf_xHvz09sRCXeut0OLr1OkE4g8-OxoH5y1Y"> Psalms is not a book on good and evil. Psalms is a book on Christ—a book on drinking Christ, eating Christ, breathing Christ, and dwelling in Christ. Christ is the living water to quench our thirst. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51199" data-verses="Psalms 36:1">Psalm 36</span> the river of God’s pleasures is for our drinking, and the fatness of God’s house is for our <span class="pg" data-page-id="399" id="399">[399]</span> eating. We can drink, eat, and breathe the Lord. Now in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51200" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90</span> we see that we can also dwell in the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="-vxlXU6cmTLDZeIgsltdgW7Vwfk9PR4omIpgyX1cWz_fCQS9vCp2fzq9vYNGAYAbP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51201" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90</span> was written by Moses, the one who gave the law with all the statutes and ordinances. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51202" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">verse 1</span> this lawgiver, who was quite old, proclaimed that God is our dwelling place in all generations. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51203" data-verses="Psalms 90:2">verse 2</span> he went on to say, “Before the mountains were brought forth, / And before You produced the earth and the world, / Indeed from eternity to eternity, You are God.” This was a new thought, something altogether unprecedented. Have you ever considered this matter of God’s being our dwelling place? </p>
<p data-content-id="pOSFl8c_X-HYWYsp6UJQz1n_zh2lwww2mnDf2YZn0tCbZM12hbPXMVxewp8ZD97ww"> From my youth I was taught by Bible teachers regarding the abiding in Christ mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51204" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>. The Lord Jesus said, “Abide in Me and I in you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51205" data-verses="John 15:4">v. 4a</span>). At that time I understood the word “abide” as meaning to stay or to remain, not to dwell. But eventually I learned that the Greek word translated “abide” means not simply to remain but also to dwell. To abide in Christ is to dwell in Him, not just remain or stay in Him. When we dwell in our house, we have our life and our living there. This means that our life and living are altogether wrapped up with our dwelling place. We spend more money on our house than on anything else. Some people really love their house and all the furniture in it. Furthermore, our house indicates the kind of person we are. In Scotland, for example, the people are known for the excellent way they care for their houses. </p>
<p data-content-id="vBfgOzkctJI64y2wITHMPymWg_4dy56NbUV4FCRoxvXeePiesyP8cinOML7yllUh0"> According to Moses’ word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51206" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90:1</span>, our house, our dwelling place, is the Triune God as our Lord. Dwelling in God is the deeper experience of God. When we experience the Triune God to the degree that we take Him as our dwelling place, we have the deeper experience of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtbcvCEgnrqy-dE42XrgAQcKchMyCDtcObPJRXsB2bnNVrU4zObvTu4Y4s7w2TT6w"> As we have indicated, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51207" data-verses="Psalms 90:1-92">Psalms 90 through 92</span> are about the saints’ deeper experience of God in the identification with Christ. We have seen that the deeper experience of God is to dwell in God, but what is revealed in these psalms concerning the identification with Christ? To answer this question we need to read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51208" data-verses="Psalms 91:9">91:9</span>: “You have made Jehovah, who is my refuge, / Even the Most High, Your habitation.” Moses, the writer of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51209" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90</span>, took Jehovah as his dwelling place, and the writer <span class="pg" data-page-id="400" id="400">[400]</span> of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51210" data-verses="Psalms 91:1">Psalm 91</span> did the same thing. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51211" data-verses="Psalms 91:11-12">Verses 11 and 12</span> indicate that “You” and “Your” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51212" data-verses="Psalms 91:9">verse 9</span> refer to Christ. These verses are quoted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51213" data-verses="Matthew 4:6">Matthew 4:6</span> and applied to Christ. This reveals that not only Moses took God as his dwelling place, but even the Lord Jesus, while He was on earth, took God the Father as His habitation. Moses, the lawgiver, and Christ, the grace-giver, were the same in taking God as their dwelling place, as their habitation. </p>
<p data-content-id="2FPleOiE4aUvfE8GzHzHFEHadIW1AzsIZaZoPhLsk6jHm_KkdS_Ik8gSZ9f6uN5g1"> To take God as our habitation, our dwelling place, is the highest and fullest experience of God. To take God as our dwelling place is to experience Him to the fullest extent. Probably no one among us would dare to say that he dwells in God all the time. But this is what Christ did. When He was living His human life on earth, He continually took God the Father as His habitation. </p>
<p data-content-id="uFsqFRd_NLv7RJd4aDXtxN2f3EDnkND2Dwws_fXkNmAQvidAcHcRx7M_n1Xj0Awsc"> To be identified with Christ is to be identified with Him not only in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension but also in His taking God as His habitation. We are identified with Christ to such an extent. A number of good books have been written on our identification with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension. Jessie Penn-Lewis emphasized the identification with Christ in His death; T. Austin-Sparks, the identification with Christ in His resurrection; and Brother Nee, the identification with Christ in His ascension. If we would be identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension, we need to abide in Christ. If we do not abide in Christ, we are separated from Him and thus are not identified with Him. The only way that we can be identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension is to abide in Christ, and to abide in Christ is not only to remain in Him but also to dwell in Him, taking Him as our everything. </p>

If you read these nine psalms carefully, you will see that the first eight of them are very similar. They are like one psalm, for they speak about the same thing with the same voice, tone, and emphasis. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51249" data-verses="Psalms 101:1">Psalm 101</span> is the conclusion to this cluster of psalms, showing how Christ will reign and judge in His kingdom. These psalms are on God’s recovery of His title and right over the whole earth through the reign of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="oaKMapIqH0taB_HBBSgrowZSJCm6qQIfo0VKLpq7SbpietHAMYoHv6iuAZG_bJfmq"> Teachers and students of the Bible agree that the Bible is centered on Christ. If we have an intrinsic understanding of Genesis, for example, we will see Christ in this book. Likewise, Christ is unveiled in the book of Leviticus. Dr. Scofield has pointed out that every page of Leviticus shows us Christ. However, in order to see Christ in Leviticus, we need a proper guide who can give us the necessary teaching. In this matter we are like the Ethiopian eunuch in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51250" data-verses="Acts 8:1">Acts 8</span> who was reading Isaiah the prophet. Philip asked him, “Do you really know the things that you are reading?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51251" data-verses="Acts 8:30">v. 30</span>). The eunuch replied, “How could I unless someone guides me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51252" data-verses="Acts 8:31">v. 31a</span>). If we would clearly see Christ in the Psalms, we need a proper guide. </p>
<p data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6foq7qfEmS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c"> We need to realize that the Psalms is a book which is very strong concerning the unveiling of Christ in God’s economy. However, in our reading of the Psalms, it is easy for us to think that the Psalms help us to be godly and pious, to worship, praise, and thank God, and to behave ourselves. Actually the Psalms are not for such things. Rather, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="408" id="408">[408]</span> Psalms use these things as a background for the revelation concerning Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="GUW7n_vvpZA7ULO884Eji-HMtAm8UKndBtrUuO3Kkg1_Ay9Dcj0p0s6xSsEx_kZu_"> In Book 1 of the Psalms we see Christ with some stress on God’s house (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51253" data-verses="Psalms 27:4">27:4</span>). In Book 2 we see Christ with God’s house and God’s city. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51254" data-verses="Psalms 48:1">Psalm 48</span> the city is strongly emphasized. In Book 3 we have not only Christ, the house, and the city but also the earth. The last psalm in Book 3, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51255" data-verses="Psalms 89:1">Psalm 89</span>, says that Christ will come to reign and to possess the whole earth from the sea (the Mediterranean) to all the rivers, indicating all the places, of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51256" data-verses="Psalms 89:25">v. 25</span>). We have pointed out that the seventeen psalms in Book 4 are in four groups. The first group, which includes <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51257" data-verses="Psalms 90:1-92">Psalms 90 through 92</span>, is on the deeper experience of God in the identification with Christ in taking God as our habitation. The second group, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51258" data-verses="Psalms 93:1-101">Psalms 93 through 101</span>, shows us that God will recover His full title and right over the earth through the reign of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="cT8NrRFfPzsynu5lLu-KCbd8VoBuqjDuifVLWXa6H4_HpI5ahTZpRhf9TqTD8W_99"> The front page of the daily newspaper indicates that today’s world is filled with darkness and sinfulness, with person fighting against person, society against society, and nation against nation. But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51259" data-verses="Psalms 93:1-101">Psalms 93 through 101</span> shout joyfully that God will recover His title and right over the whole earth. God has the right over the earth because the earth with all its fullness—all the different peoples, regardless of race or color—was created by Him. Thus, He is the Possessor of the earth and holds the title deed. He has the full right to claim the earth, and He will do it through the reign of Christ. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51260" data-verses="Psalms 101:1">Psalm 101</span>, Christ will reign and judge in lovingkindness and justice. </p>
<p data-content-id="YNZIoQYjPYoCa9MpR2o-5HGRZUlZvNqGSe7CvHp9J9EFBLBDj9RbsZrLSirV3uler"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51261" data-verses="Psalms 94:15">Psalm 94:15a</span> says, “Judgment will return unto righteousness.” This indicates that on earth today judgment has gone astray from righteousness, but when Christ comes back to reign, He will bring in justice and will cause judgment to return to righteousness. Christ is with us in the church, but today’s world is without Christ, and for this reason the world is evil, dark, and sinful. However, the coming reign of Christ will make a great difference throughout the earth. Instead of injustice and unrighteousness, there will be justice and righteousness. </p>

Christ’s placing His feet on the sea and on the land is His treading on them, and to tread on them is to take possession of them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51265" data-verses="Deuteronomy 11:24">Deut. 11:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51266" data-verses="Joshua 1:3">Josh. 1:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51267" data-verses="Psalms 8:6-8">Psa. 8:6-8</span>).

<p data-content-id="ex-VBPE6iEBPGjLm6o1ICZd7MA6QdIW9p5b-_TOqQLTnIw18TKY2WJPOMgBwUFYmG"> At the beginning of our study of the Psalms, we pointed out that the Psalms were written by godly saints. These saints were very close to God, and they had much thought and consideration concerning God and God’s interest. Many of the psalms were written during times of suffering. When, as they were suffering, the psalmists were expressing certain of their feelings and complex sentiments, some high thoughts came forth mainly related to Christ, God’s house, God’s city, and God’s recovery of His title over the earth. In the Old Testament this recovery is called the restoration, referring to the millennium. God’s house denotes God’s home and also His family, His household; God’s city refers to His kingdom; and the coming restoration refers to the millennium. These four matters—Christ, God’s house, God’s city, and the coming restoration—are the essential elements, the inner essences, of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="5KAH-UmAtuU3gKpaATqwMVxRQ4YWsT4usc1Ic-G4s86Oc-dA28nxZLaHM68xJ5WC1"> We may say that the Psalms are an extract of the entire Bible. The Bible begins with God’s existence and then goes on to speak of God’s creation, which has certain indications concerning Christ. Out of Christ there issues the church, which is God’s house. When the church as God’s house is strengthened and enlarged, it becomes the city, that is, the kingdom of God. Eventually, the kingdom of God will bring in the restoration of the earth during the millennium, which will consummate in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem—the consummation of God’s house and God’s kingdom—as the center. This extract of the Bible in the Psalms is a key that opens the whole Bible. <span class="pg" data-page-id="416" id="416">[416]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Na7WgVyV478pwtrSChkESzFyZl-MEQkas-bTZWuSFaQIaC0CuxOLAxx4JGiXrBoG3"> In this message we come to another group of psalms, consisting of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51307" data-verses="Psalms 102:1-106">Psalms 102 through 106</span>, which is somewhat hard to understand. In this group we first see Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51308" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> is a psalm on Christ. Strong evidence of this is the quotation of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51309" data-verses="Psalms 102:25-27">verses 25 through 27</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51310" data-verses="Hebrews 1:10-12">Hebrews 1:10-12</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="tQ24bEsDAJrapHMLOR8YfXfuAzVeA2NL9qpON8dWnjClKumw-BgbGeVcZwAx4ViCq"> The title of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51311" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> tells us that it is a prayer of an afflicted one, one who was suffering. The psalmist, a godly one, was suffering because of the destruction and devastation of Zion with the temple and the holy city. He suffered to such an extent that he was fainting. In this matter he was somewhat like Jeremiah who, after the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, sat on a mountain outside the city, looked at the devastation of the temple and the city, and wrote the book of Lamentations, probably fainting as he did so. The godly one who wrote <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51312" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> was also afflicted by the destruction of the temple and the city. Fainting because of his suffering, he prayed to God and poured out his complaint. The word “complaint” in the title of this psalm does not mean that the psalmist was complaining to God; rather, here this word denotes a miserable situation—the suffering caused by the destruction of the temple and the city of Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="hkLfpjCNovaGmCzIPtjUL9QGIk3mtR0lr9YKIdhUAkLiGtbw24ZWzZYjCzQ5ensMw"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51313" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> has three sections. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51314" data-verses="Psalms 102:1-11">Verses 1 through 11</span> are the first section, concerned with suffering and affliction; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51315" data-verses="Psalms 102:12-22">verses 12 through 22</span> are the second section, concerned with the rebuilding of Zion, the restoration of the destroyed temple and holy city; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51316" data-verses="Psalms 102:23-28">verses 23 through 28</span> are the third section, unveiling the Lord as the One who is everlasting in His resurrection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51317" data-verses="Revelation 1:18">Revelation 1:18</span> Christ, the living One, says, “I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever.” Resurrection is the lengthening of the Lord’s days; He will exist forever and ever in His resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="fV0aAyMXuYdaoZynkbs0CbWCVWNZmmM0Y8hBOvH-1E7ENHRl8MwaIW5bA5iMLvlPg"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51318" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span>, the restoration of Zion and Jerusalem turns the nations to God. For this reason, I have entitled this message “The Earth Turning to the Lord through Zion.” Zion here is the Zion that has been rebuilt after its devastation. Thus, the second section of this psalm presents us a picture of the restoration of the destroyed and devastated temple and city of Jerusalem. This rebuilding turns the entire earth with the peoples of all the nations to the Lord. <span class="pg" data-page-id="417" id="417">[417]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVSYje0uwsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> In typology, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51319" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> first refers to Christ’s suffering, especially to His death. Christ’s suffering consummated in His death, and through His death the church, God’s house, came into existence. Eventually, the church as God’s house becomes God’s city, God’s kingdom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51320" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19">Ephesians 2:19</span>, therefore, refers both to the household of God and to the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWw6PGDWvao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ"> The history of Israel is a picture of the history of the church. Israel passed through a time of destruction and devastation, and the people of Israel were captured and carried away to captivity in Babylon. Likewise, in the book of Revelation we see that Babylon the Great is versus the church. Eventually, Babylon the Great will fall, and the church will be fully established. That rebuilding of the church will turn all the nations to the Lord, and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of God and of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51321" data-verses="Revelation 11:15">Rev. 11:15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Xcf_6qhqmuUpIGfe8Jx2QOr1-ZlCW67PmCtIfSUeGYkLK3j9subuJKvpbUUJeUzlR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51322" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> unveils Christ’s death and His existence in His resurrection. The product of Christ’s death and resurrection is Zion with God’s house and God’s city. Therefore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51323" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> we have Christ’s death, Christ’s resurrection, and Zion. </p>
<p data-content-id="kVUJkTRCD2ceWNANfSpqUXqjITkTgrwo3WzP5v2H-gzE3CDAPM4O-xZzgNga2L9ku"> <em>Zion</em> is a total title of the church. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51324" data-verses="Galatians 4:26">Galatians 4:26</span> says that the “Jerusalem above” is our mother, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51325" data-verses="Hebrews 12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span> tells us that we have come to “Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.” Furthermore, in our study of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51326" data-verses="Psalms 84:1">Psalm 84</span> we saw that the “highways to Zion” mentioned in this psalm (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51327" data-verses="Psalms 84:5">v. 5</span>) are the highways of the church life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51328" data-verses="Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14</span> shows us that the one hundred and forty-four thousand will be raptured to Mount Zion. Today we are heading to Zion, the highest peak of God’s mountains. This Zion is the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="JTusczmwwhCl4KPbnBHndJpVOE7JMXKdwqsa3jZYRVqQq1_CDSNDQz8-wGf5PkIgq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51329" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> is very deep, containing some hidden secrets. If we have insight into this psalm, we will see that Christ’s suffering and death are not only for redemption but also for restoration. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51330" data-verses="Psalms 102:1-11">Verses 1 through 11</span> speak of suffering; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51331" data-verses="Psalms 102:12-22">verses 12 through 22</span>, of restoration; and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51332" data-verses="Psalms 102:23-28">verses 23 through 28</span>, of Christ’s continued existence in His resurrection. Christ’s suffering is for redemption, and His redemption is to produce the church as the house of God and the city of God, which will consummate in the restoration. It is in Christ’s resurrection, by Christ’s resurrection, and through Christ’s resurrection that <span class="pg" data-page-id="418" id="418">[418]</span> the church will consummate in the restoration. Christ’s death produced the church, and His resurrection prolongs the existence of the church. Having been produced through Christ’s death, the church has its continued existence in Christ’s resurrection. This is the revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51333" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="zn3Ep8HYGmknZmDP3AomM9xg-iYzSSNwNx-Ls6xc9t-_McCQfuyD1jjqf7LbmY1p8"> We should not study <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51334" data-verses="Psalms 102:1-106">Psalms 102 through 106</span> in a superficial way, in a natural way, or in the way of paying attention only to the letters in black and white. We need to study these psalms, as well as all the psalms, with much prayer and with much consideration of the Holy Word. If we study the Psalms in this way, we will realize that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51335" data-verses="Psalms 102:1-106">Psalms 102 through 106</span> are a group. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51336" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span>, the prayer of an afflicted saint, is the foundation of this group. We have emphasized the fact that this psalm shows us Christ’s sufferings, the church produced by His sufferings, and the continued existence of the church in Christ’s resurrection due to Christ’s unchanging existence in His resurrection. As we will see, the four other psalms in this group are a narration of God’s history and that three of these four psalms—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51337" data-verses="Psalms 104:1">Psalms 104</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51338" data-verses="Psalms 105:1">105</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51339" data-verses="Psalms 106:1">106</span>—are “hallelujah psalms.” With these three psalms we have the beginning of the “hallelujahs” in the Psalms. </p>

<p data-content-id="9MAUzofrAke3GqQ7OVH7WzPoWOfx6kgwnnDYK-CGhCzbB6sVxNA-LxpdL8yQCdNvA"> The Psalms is a very hard book for us to read because in our reading of it we can easily be seduced to care for things such as godliness and comfort. Christians read the Psalms mainly for godliness and comfort. They appreciate this book because, in their view, it teaches them how to be godly and it offers them comfort concerning the sufferings in human life. We all need comfort, and in the Psalms there are many verses that are words of divine comfort. This may be the reason that Bible societies often print the New Testament together with the Psalms. In our reading of the Psalms, it is difficult for us to stay away from the godliness and the comfort that we see in this book. This was my situation when I was young. I wanted to be godly, but I did not know how to be godly. I wanted to be comforted, but I did know where to find comfort. Thus, I passed through the experience of regarding the Psalms as a book concerned with godliness and comfort. </p>
<p data-content-id="jyiBgcfJaOuZcFp53JYlISyEg4nLGYcTPPv0-djD3AT7nms9hwerC-8sv3vMX42bn"> If we read the Psalms in the way of seeking godliness and comfort, our reading of this book will not consummate in hallelujahs. Can you tell me of anyone who read the Psalms for godliness and comfort whose reading consummated in hallelujahs? I doubt that there has ever been such a person. The Psalms consummates in hallelujahs because this is a book with the highest revelation concerning Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51384" data-verses="Luke 24:44">Luke 24:44</span> the Lord Jesus said, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.” </p>
<p data-content-id="TFDIF40UiPk-cgxjaStuHj34A_RCqdMXeSDN5VOxZEPCgCcaslOmgbIqwsUleJWh8"> We should not think that the Psalms is a book of godliness or a book of comfort. Yes, there are many verses in the Psalms <span class="pg" data-page-id="426" id="426">[426]</span> concerning godliness, and there are many verses through which we may find comfort. But we should not seek godliness and comfort apart from Christ. Without Christ we cannot have genuine godliness, and without Christ there is no real comfort. If we care only for godliness and comfort but not for Christ, we will have nothing. But if we have Christ, even though we do not think about godliness and comfort, we will enjoy godliness and we will participate in much comfort. I can testify that whenever I care for Christ, I am filled with godliness, holiness, comfort, and happiness. </p>
<p data-content-id="nXSsIWvnEm9T-8mcYN3wAmaeHZlKGh2ENS-aZbkA31Stn79c3XGP-e0fZ7Wcfl5i4"> There are two ways to study the Bible: the natural, human way and the divine, spiritual way. To study the Psalms in the natural way is to gain godliness and comfort. To study the Psalms in the spiritual way is to gain Christ with the house, that is, the church, and with the city, that is, the kingdom, to bring in the restoration to the whole earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="6UcEf2xoIcCLjOF3SwXGcjTocwO3uC2fFkYMo08kyKe5uy4FS6utSCxH9zoYoGimB"> The Bible is not mainly for godliness or comfort. Rather, the Bible teaches us that Christ is the centrality of God’s eternal economy to produce the church, first as God’s house and then as God’s kingdom, issuing in the millennial kingdom with full restoration for all the creation, which will consummate in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. Have you ever thought that the Psalms is a book not mainly on godliness and comfort but on Christ with the house of God and the city of God leading to the restoration of the universe during the millennium and ushering us into the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem? In our reading of the Psalms, our preoccupation with godliness and comfort should be replaced with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="tQ24bEsDAJrapHMLOR8YQXfLKzVeA2NL9qpON8dWnjClKumw-BgbGeVcZwAx4ViCq"> The Psalms were composed not only by David but by a number of different writers, including Moses and some of the sons of Korah. Eventually, the one hundred fifty psalms were arranged in their present order. I believe that this arrangement was made after the time of Malachi, approximately 400 B.C. The sequence of this arrangement is very meaningful. For example, it surely is significant that immediately after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51385" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span>, which is on the Law, we have <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51386" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>, which is on Christ, the Son of God and His anointed One. </p>
<p data-content-id="hkLfpjCNovaGmCzIPtjUE9QnDk3mtR0lr9YKIdhUAkLiGtbw24ZWzZYjCzQ5ensMw"> It is not a simple matter to see how the psalms may be put <span class="pg" data-page-id="427" id="427">[427]</span> into groups. In the foregoing message we considered the group consisting of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51387" data-verses="Psalms 102:1-106">Psalms 102 through 106</span>. We have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51388" data-verses="Psalms 102:1">Psalm 102</span> unveils Christ as the key that turns the earth to the Lord and that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51389" data-verses="Psalms 103:1-106">Psalms 103 through 106</span> are a narration of God’s history in His forgiving our sins, in His greatness in the creation of the universe and its fullness, in His dealing with Abraham and his descendants according to His covenant, and in His dealing with Israel in the wilderness and in the promised land. In this message we will consider another group of psalms—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51390" data-verses="Psalms 107:1-110">Psalms 107 through 110</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51391" data-verses="Psalms 107:1">Psalm 107</span> there is a change of tone, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51392" data-verses="Psalms 110:1">Psalm 110</span> there is the highest revelation of Christ. Here the revelation of Christ reaches the peak. I believe that it was Martin Luther who said that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51393" data-verses="Psalms 110:1">Psalm 110</span> is the highest among all the psalms. </p>
<p data-content-id="U3SJ7x2XZmwE-vT9C-B4vEqiItOBuETEkreZHMxUhbPpeAsVz1iLkblSuDuEcWpye"> In the preceding psalms Christ is revealed in many different aspects. In a forthcoming message we will see that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51394" data-verses="Psalms 118:1">Psalm 118</span> we have a further revelation of Christ, an unveiling of Christ as the cornerstone (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51395" data-verses="Psalms 118:22">v. 22</span>) for the building of God. As the cornerstone, Christ joins the two walls, one wall being the Jewish believers and the other, the Gentile believers. Christ is therefore the One who joins the Jews and the Gentiles for the building of God’s house. Christ is the cornerstone for God’s building, and God’s building is the church today as God’s house and God’s kingdom, and ultimately God’s building is a new city, the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="M7fCqdO3rsw64DHJPn8hFVwns6VwUJRZ3yHZlLdZbQwfTUGFzmgEUPSGaDO0Z7qHX"> As we will see, Christ is unveiled also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51396" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>. We may think that this psalm is on the law, but it is actually on the testimony of God and the word of God. According to the Bible as a whole, the testimony of God is Christ, and the word of God is also Christ. Christ’s being the testimony of God depends on His first being the cornerstone. If He were not the cornerstone, He could not be the adequate, qualified testimony, or witness, of God. If we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51397" data-verses="Psalms 118:1-2">Psalms 118 and 119</span> together, we will see that Christ is both the cornerstone and the testimony of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="VRhjPpz4JdnWROtHhxAS_OT_uFNWmZKbLuiblGSkCvPkgGcqezXq0pmSA19ZCDN-R"> As we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51398" data-verses="Psalms 107:1-110">Psalms 107 through 110</span>, we need to realize that the last psalm in this group, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51399" data-verses="Psalms 110:1">Psalm 110</span>, is on Christ in the highest way. However, in order to have the highest revelation of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51400" data-verses="Psalms 110:1">Psalm 110</span>, we need the three psalms that <span class="pg" data-page-id="428" id="428">[428]</span> come immediately before it. Let us now go on to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51401" data-verses="Psalms 107:1-110">Psalms 107 through 110</span> one by one. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="iTbtceJp8CRsXmWGS1x04pUadn5u1SBErA31-m4XYfmciafaweXi21GVgQC5RY84s">I. GOD’S CARE AND DELIVERANCE<br/>OF HIS REDEEMED IN CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="1ushQ5QG2mm5vQ6JwR6BOX8k8HlbYGuYon0k6S7Qrut04qLHEKfdtRUBEgUqfnP--"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51402" data-verses="Psalms 107:1">Psalm 107</span> is on God’s care and deliverance of His redeemed in Christ. No doubt, God takes care of us every day, always delivering us, rescuing us, and saving us. When some hear this, they may say that this is comfort. Yes, it is comfort, but it is the divine comfort in Christ. When we speak of the comfort in this psalm, we have to say that this is the comfort in Christ. Then we will say, “Hallelujah!” However, if we speak of divine comfort without seeing that this comfort is in Christ, we will not say, “Hallelujah.” Christ is the One who induces us to speak hallelujahs and to praise the Lord not for comfort, care, or deliverance but for Christ, in whom we are. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9MAUzofrAke3GqQ7OVH7WzP5bOfx6kgwnnDYK-CGhCzbB6sVxNA-LxpdL8yQCdNvA">A.

The word “redeemed” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51404" data-verses="Psalms 107:2">verse 2</span> implies Christ, for He is our Redeemer and even our redemption. This gives us the ground to say that the comfort in this psalm is in Christ. In Christ we enjoy God’s care and deliverance, which imply His rescue and saving every day. </p>
<p data-content-id="TFDIF40UiPk-cgxjaStuHj3hD_RCqdMXeSDN5VOxZEPCgCcaslOmgbIqwsUleJWh8"> Furthermore, the gathering out of the lands, from the east, west, north, and south, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51405" data-verses="Psalms 107:2">verse 2</span> corresponds to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51406" data-verses="Revelation 5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>, which speaks of those purchased for God by Christ’s blood “out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation.” In this matter we once again use the New Testament to interpret the Old Testament. </p>

<p data-content-id="ZoqnkBJsv_ave8S39rvUxQRnapXvjyoKcjH_ufhMTX22UVAGWPYGMDioB-HdgCp6h"> In this message we come to the hardest point in the Bible—Christ as the cornerstone. Who would think that Christ would be the cornerstone? Prior to the Psalms there is not a verse which speaks of Christ as the cornerstone. Then, all of a sudden, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51478" data-verses="Psalms 118:22">Psalm 118:22</span> says, “The stone which the builders rejected / Has become the head of the corner.” </p>
<p data-content-id="A-hYX8zK16VtRI8Qvi6FKs7nIA5IMzgSzJYENfWXzvBiO6IqbYJRxuTolost_F3Qd"> Once again I would call your attention to the arrangement of the Psalms into five books. Book 5 begins with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51479" data-verses="Psalms 107:1">Psalm 107</span>. The main psalms in Book 5 that unveil Christ are <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51480" data-verses="Psalms 110:1">Psalm 110</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51481" data-verses="Psalms 118:1">Psalm 118</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="F2xyP711-ImVwCRnTxPRXF4p8OzRP_L_Fsgt0ia8aB6yvP3rASXANWKWp8ji3KpUG"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51482" data-verses="Psalms 110:1">Psalm 110</span> is on Christ as the exalted One, as the One who in His ascension has been uplifted to the right hand of God in heaven. In this psalm there are two matters which are difficult to understand adequately—“the dew from the womb of the morning” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51483" data-verses="Psalms 110:3">v. 3</span>) and “the brook by the way” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51484" data-verses="Psalms 110:7">v. 7</span>). Whereas the brook is for drinking, the dew is for watering. As Christ is on His way to carry out God’s economy, He needs to be watered, and He needs something to drink. Christ is watered by those who offer themselves willingly to Him. Whoever volunteers himself to Christ as an offering is a young man likened to the dew conceived in the womb of the morning for watering Christ. When we are thirsty from working or from running a race, dew is not adequate. We need water to drink. Christ also needs something to drink. Thus, in addition to the dew, which is moisture for comforting, Christ needs to drink of the brook flowing by the way. <span class="pg" data-page-id="440" id="440">[440]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="C0vZoeE_Tq6zu9_FulgwHRWe0dNTgG7cDJrnlW3MlPGUBMuWsC2B7F32iItZg_FXY"> As we will see, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51485" data-verses="Psalms 118:1">Psalm 118</span> is on Christ as the cornerstone. When we come to this psalm, we will consider a number of verses related to Christ as the cornerstone for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="PdqflOTfa_fEqM2Whps1DbY10E82eUf_xHvz09sRCXeut0OLr1OkE4g8-OxoH5y1Y"> After <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51486" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> the revelation concerning Christ in the Psalms is closed. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51487" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>, a particular psalm, is followed by fifteen psalms which are called songs of ascents. After these psalms, we have the last sixteen psalms. In these thirty-one psalms we cannot find anything concerning Christ, for Christ has been revealed to us adequately beginning with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51488" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span> and ending with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51489" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="bqm-JyB7SIVXqnqTXQ7kBdfB9BBkuLKDq-WD-CusQJYOpzha7vmOWzhRlrUftDbwd"> In the next message we will see that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51490" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> is on Christ’s being the reality of the law as the testimony and the word of God. The one hundred seventy-six verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51491" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>, arranged in twenty-two sections of eight verses each, are on Christ as the law. Toward the beginning of the Psalms, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51492" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>, the Spirit turns the reader of the Psalms from the law to Christ. After all the revelations of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51493" data-verses="Psalms 2:1-118">Psalms 2 through 118</span>, the Spirit gives us <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51494" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>, indicating or implying that Christ is the real, actual, and practical law of God. In the Old Testament, the law was put in the ark, which is a type of Christ. Therefore, the entire law of God is in Christ, making Christ the reality of the law of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="qf_Q-HCS9YUo9GMzE5Accv_IzoKb3vFVaOmLANx-Rc98knFI2YImImMaqhN5dQJl3"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51495" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> speaks directly about the law. In this psalm the word “testimonies” is used twenty-two times, and the word “testimony” is used once. This psalm also speaks many times about the word. It is true to say that the law typifies Christ as a portrait of God. This is why the law is called the testimony of God. The law is a portrait of God, and eventually this portrait is not merely the Ten Commandments but a living person, Christ. Christ is the law of God, the portrait of God. Christ is also the word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="y_qtpCA_Os0zZ8Y1K0v0Ho3OH9n24t68Y4eSGBoEmfCndK11UbLXrTHcfLFkGc3Th"> After <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51496" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span>, which closes something and also opens something, there is no further revelation in the Psalms concerning Christ. After we see Christ, we should ascend. Hence, after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51497" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> we have the psalms of ascents, indicating that the Christian life is a life of ascending. </p>
<p data-content-id="8ENujLHBaosPnjKTCIaT6H-_nTk0bRCtyxH-7F3HoVERIgtsLU3NTyz-xJOwN2Xhu"> What kind of interest do you have in knowing the Psalms? Are you interested in coming to the Psalms to learn about godliness or to find comfort? Many Christians love the <span class="pg" data-page-id="441" id="441">[441]</span> Psalms because they contain instruction concerning godliness and words of comfort. Sixty years ago I also loved the Psalms in this way, but today my love for the Psalms is different. I love the Psalms because this book is full of revelation concerning Christ which we cannot see in other books of the Bible. The four Gospels give us a fourfold record of what Christ is and of what He has done. However, the Gospels do not reveal Christ as much as the Psalms do. Sometimes the Psalms are quoted in the Gospels. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51498" data-verses="Psalms 118:22-23">Psalm 118:22-23</span> is quoted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51499" data-verses="Matthew 21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51500" data-verses="Psalms 110:1">Psalm 110:1</span> is quoted in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51501" data-verses="Matthew 22:44">Matthew 22:44</span>. Without the Psalms we cannot have a clear view concerning Christ. If you consider all the points regarding Christ in the Psalms, you will see that the Psalms present us a particular picture of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="06PDAD4GrV_FKIhpCfMbvD3fs1CIPlVFrY5NJoIo2UG9xThAvlhoVRVjeam3mHMdS"> The title of this message on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51502" data-verses="Psalms 111:1-118">Psalms 111 through 118</span> is “The Praise of God’s Elect Consummating in the Particular Position of Christ.” This group of psalms may be called “psalms of hallelujahs.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51503" data-verses="Psalms 111:1">Psalms 111</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51504" data-verses="Psalms 112:1">112</span>, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51505" data-verses="Psalms 113:1">113</span> all begin with the word “Hallelujah.” These psalms, therefore, are psalms of praises to God, and these praises consummate in a particular position of Christ. This means that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51506" data-verses="Psalms 118:1">Psalm 118</span> does not come out of nothing but is the issue of the praises of God’s elect. As we consider these psalms, we will see that the praises in them are different from the praises in the foregoing psalms. </p>

This psalm does not have a title telling us who wrote it, but it is commonly understood by Bible teachers that this psalm was written by David. </p>
<p data-content-id="fV0aAyMXuYdaoZynkbsoFbWffWNZmmM0Y8hBOvH-1E7ENHRl8MwaIW5bA5iMLvlPg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51592" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> is one of the alphabetical, or acrostic, psalms. The first letters of each group of eight verses in this psalm follow the order of the Hebrew alphabet. The twenty-two sections of this psalm thus correspond to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Furthermore, all the verses in a particular section begin with the same Hebrew letter. For example, in the Aleph section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51593" data-verses="Psalms 119:1-8">vv. 1-8</span>) every verse starts with the Hebrew letter Aleph. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2lMI0k0NKNPd2UppWVOfjetlwsGp8TRPA3gD8vSlA55p19WzTXOYcC-h7S6KPQgy"> The title of this message is “Christ—the Reality of the Law as the Testimony and the Word of God.” In both the Old Testament and the New Testament there is a strong basis for saying that the law in its reality is Christ. If we would see that Christ is the reality of the law, we need to regard the law, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51594" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> does, as the testimony of God and as the word of God. This psalm does not contain the word “Christ,” but it does contain a number of synonyms of Christ, such as “testimony” and “word,” which are also synonyms of “law.” We should not consider the law merely as commandments, regulations, and ordinances. Rather, we should consider the law as God’s testimony. The law was given on Mount Sinai, but it was put into a little ark called “the ark of the testimony” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51595" data-verses="Exodus 25:16">Exo. 25:16</span>). The ark was then placed into “the tabernacle of testimony” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51596" data-verses="Exodus 38:21">38:21</span>). Thus, the law was in the ark of the testimony, <span class="pg" data-page-id="452" id="452">[452]</span> and the ark of the testimony was in the tabernacle of testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="HnNeFFRRTRimM1tPrWwmIGDznao3MIHv7O7jUT6PzB8h8jlRdks9fiAOiyBsXLPxQ"> At this point we need to ask a very particular question: In typology, who is the law? This is a question not about <em>what</em> the law is but about <em>who</em> the law is. We cannot answer the question concerning who the law is by saying that the law is the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments are not a person, but they are a portrait of a person. A law is always a picture of the person who makes it. The laws passed by today’s legislators are pictures of the legislators. The principle is the same with the law of God. The law of God—the Ten Commandments with the many statutes, ordinances, and judgments—is a portrait of the person of God. </p>

The testimony of God signifies Christ as the living portrait of what God is (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51597" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51598" data-verses="Colossians 1:19">1:19</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="nXSsIWvnEm9T-8mcYN3sIma7PZlKGh2ENS-aZbkA31Stn79c3XGP-e0fZ7Wcfl5i4"> The Ten Commandments are brief, but they give us a portrait of God. They show us that God is a jealous God, that He cannot tolerate other gods. In this matter, He is like a husband who is jealous concerning his wife. Also, God is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Here we have five crucial words—jealous, love, light, holiness, and righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="6UcEf2xoIcCLjOF3SwXaUjTJVwO3uC2fFkYMo08kyKe5uy4FS6utSCxH9zoYoGimB"> The Ten Commandments were written on two tablets, with each tablet containing five commandments. In this way, the Ten Commandments were divided into two groups of five. The first three commandments are concerned with God. The first commandment says that the Lord is God and that we should not have any gods before Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51599" data-verses="Exodus 20:2-3">Exo. 20:2-3</span>); the second commandment, that we should not make idols or worship idols (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51600" data-verses="Exodus 20:4-6">vv. 4-6</span>); and the third commandment, that we should not take the name of God in vain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51601" data-verses="Exodus 20:7">v. 7</span>). The fourth commandment requires that we keep the Sabbath (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51602" data-verses="Exodus 20:8-11">vv. 8-11</span>). This <span class="pg" data-page-id="453" id="453">[453]</span> commandment indicates that God is love. Because He loves us, He wants us to have a day of rest. The fifth commandment is the commandment to honor our parents (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51603" data-verses="Exodus 20:12">v. 12</span>). This commandment is ranked with the first four commandments, which are related to God. The reason for this ranking involves our source as human beings. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51604" data-verses="Luke 3:1">Luke 3</span> the human generations are traced all the way back to Adam, and then to God. This indicates that when we honor our parents, we honor our source, which, ultimately, is God Himself. When we honor our parents, we recognize the fact that, through them, we can trace our source back to God. Those who do not respect their parents do not respect God. </p>
<p data-content-id="RF99mNghJcAjqAzGSAkgc2VDSbTnyYTK8F_bH0457aEcoqMtCJBP6MvoDLWTtZiuq"> The five commandments in the second group are all related to humanity. These are the commandments about not killing, not committing adultery, not stealing, not lying, and not coveting. We may use five words to summarize these five commandments: murder, adultery, stealing, lying, and covetousness. Anyone who does not murder, commit fornication, steal, lie, or covet is a perfect person. </p>
<p data-content-id="swd5PZucw8Weq5orQKdJ3kqoypmNj9flJYCofaCPSu3vPBuDVlmeBwHc2dDffPws_"> We have pointed out that the Ten Commandments portray God as the One who is a God of jealousy, love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The last five commandments are related to God’s holiness and righteousness. For example, a person who steals or lies is not righteous. </p>
<p data-content-id="wz9YZjJszQSaVqUbb2iCUhI0gtrzM6eJbBJ9AgWWAfl9SPNOQr15VHqMpSEz2Zobj"> The God who is jealous, who is love and light, and who is holy and righteous is embodied in Christ. For this reason, Christ is God’s testimony. Christ is jealous, loving, and full of light. He is also holy and righteous. He is the reality of the law, which is a portrait of God. </p>

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51608" data-verses="Revelation 19:13">Revelation 19:13b</span>, when Christ comes back to judge, His name will be called “the Word of God.” The Ten <span class="pg" data-page-id="454" id="454">[454]</span> Commandments, with all their statutes, ordinances, and judgments, are also called the word of God. A literal rendering of the Hebrew translated “ten commandments” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51609" data-verses="Exodus 34:28">Exodus 34:28</span> would be “ten words.” The Ten Commandments are thus God’s words, breathed out by Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="A-hYX8zK16VtRI8Qvi6ZDs72CA5IMzgSzJYENfWXzvBiO6IqbYJRxuTolost_F3Qd"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51639" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> is a psalm of one hundred seventy-six verses describing Christ, who is the reality of the law, the commandments, the ordinances, the statutes, the precepts, and the judgments. In total, He is the Word of God. The words of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51640" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> are the written words of God, but Christ is the living Word of God.

<p data-content-id="F2xyP711-ImVwCRnTxPNeF483OzRP_L_Fsgt0ia8aB6yvP3rASXANWKWp8ji3KpUG"> Now we can see not only what the law is but also who the law is. Who is the law? The law is the person of Christ, and the person of Christ is the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of whatever God is. Hence, as the Spirit Christ is the reality of the law. Eventually, this law, this person, consummates in the way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51641" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>). When we have Him, we have not only love and light but also the way. This is Christ being the reality of the law as the testimony and the word of God. </p>

<p data-content-id="y_qtpCA_Os0zZ8Y1K0voPo3TP9n24t68Y4eSGBoEmfCndK11UbLXrTHcfLFkGc3Th"> In this message we will begin to consider a particular group of psalms, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51749" data-verses="Psalms 120:1-134">Psalms 120 through 134</span>, which are known as the Psalms of Ascents. </p>
<p data-content-id="8ENujLHBaosPnjKTCIaPyH-muTk0bRCtyxH-7F3HoVERIgtsLU3NTyz-xJOwN2Xhu"> Whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51750" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> talks about the law, in these fifteen psalms the law is not mentioned. Instead of speaking concerning the law, these psalms refer to the matter of captivity. The people of Israel loved the law, but they did not live according to the law. After they received the law, their sins, offenses, and transgressions increased. They even went so far as to turn from God and worship idols. For instance, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51751" data-verses="Judges 17:1">Judges 17</span> tells us of a man who set up idols in his home, who appointed one of his sons to be his priest, and who later hired a Levite to be a priest in his house. Since the people of Israel wanted to worship idols, God caused them to go into captivity in a land of idols. As the people were suffering in captivity, they forgot many things, but they could not forget Zion and Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="06PDAD4GrV_FKIhpCfMHnD36i1CIPlVFrY5NJoIo2UG9xThAvlhoVRVjeam3mHMdS"> At that time, Mount Zion and Jerusalem, which was built on Zion, were the only signs left on earth of God. Zion was the place where Abraham offered his son Isaac; it was also the place chosen by David. God is invisible, mysterious, and very deep. No one has seen Him. Nevertheless, Zion and Jerusalem were earthly signs of God’s existence. As indicated by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51752" data-verses="Psalms 120:1-134">Psalms 120 through 134</span>, Zion, the center, and Jerusalem, the circumference, remained deeply in the consideration of the people of Israel. For this reason, I have entitled the two messages on these psalms “The Preciousness of Zion and Jerusalem in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="466" id="466">[466]</span> Experiences and Praises of the Saints.” Because of their experiences, the saints could not forget Zion and Jerusalem, and in their praises they did not neglect them. The saints were concerned not for godliness or comfort but for the fate of Zion and Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="7fIo7B_PtuxVHXWcNo-OGFVTPgZW-4YJzsHxBU9VHS6r_ObuAQxI8_Q5fJE47Frz7"> Israel was first invaded by the Assyrians and later by the Babylonians. Unlike the Babylonians, the Assyrians did not destroy the city of Jerusalem or devastate the temple. When the Psalms of Ascents were written, both the city and the temple remained, and the saints in captivity remembered them as signs, as symbols, of the very God whom they worshipped. </p>
<p data-content-id="x3A_NVyRy-HcN2uaXwrSPw0fHcSNkQ1jqPzGJPy-vjJMMSTkeSMACaaj1wZdzKNhZ"> Why are these fifteen psalms called Songs of Ascents? To answer this question we need to see that when the people of Israel were captured, they were in a downward situation. To return to Jerusalem and to Zion was to be in an upward situation. Furthermore, they had to climb, to ascend, the hill of Zion, and as they were ascending they sang a song of ascents, a song of degrees. </p>
<p data-content-id="rrxK-XF2yr3YMWZDIfZXyrKk_jZpP7YHo3mw07NHikAb8Knk8XK9RdNnxWk8yUOYV"> When we were saved, we were in an upward situation and thus could not sing a song of ascent. However, we may eventually become “down” or “low” for a period of time. At such a time we are in a kind of captivity. But when the Lord gains us again and we are revived, we will sing a song of ascent. As a result of our experiences of the ups and the downs, we will no longer uplift the law, appreciating it in a natural way. We will realize that the law does not help us. Rather, the things that truly help us are Zion and Jerusalem. </p>

Meshech was a place far to the north in Assyria, and Kedar was a place to the south in Arabia (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51757" data-verses="Isaiah 21:13">Isa. 21:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51758" data-verses="Isaiah 21:16">16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51759" data-verses="Ezekiel 27:21">Ezek. 27:21</span>). Both may refer to the places in which the psalmist was captured in the Assyrian invasion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51760" data-verses="2Kings 18:11">2 Kings 18:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51761" data-verses="2Chronicles 32:1">2 Chron. 32:1</span>). This indicates that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51762" data-verses="Psalms 120:1">Psalm 120</span> is related to the Assyrian invasion. The Assyrians invaded Israel and took the capital of Israel, Samaria. The writer of this psalm was among the captives in Meshech and Kedar. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="3esfdm4Cqvt3IfSl6fo28qfdlS-cJQo6113k3O3rIDipd0k6DnYNGb5GoUig99J5c">C.

The answer must be that the psalmist was among the godly Jews who had been taken into captivity by the Assyrians. The “distress” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51763" data-verses="Psalms 120:1">verse 1</span> may refer to the suffering of afflictions in the psalmist’s captivity. Here the psalmist said, “In my distress I called out to Jehovah, / And He answered me.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51764" data-verses="Psalms 120:6">Verse 6</span> may indicate that his captivity was for a long time: “Long has my soul had its dwelling / With him who hates peace.” Those who hated peace were first the Assyrians and later the Babylonians and the Persians, both of whom invaded Israel. The invading Assyrians were not for peace but for war. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51765" data-verses="Psalms 120:7">verse 7</span> the psalmist went on to say, “I am for peace; but when I speak, / They are for war.” Because these invaders also were liars, the psalmist prayed, “O Jehovah, deliver my soul from lying lips, / From a tongue of deceit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51766" data-verses="Psalms 120:2">v. 2</span>). The first of the Psalms of Ascents, therefore, describes the suffering of the psalmist in his captivity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="468" id="468">[468]</span> </p>

I had been asked by the co-workers to return from Hangkow in central China to my home town of Chefoo, on the tip of the Shantung Peninsula. This involved a long, complicated trip by train. The country was in confusion, and because of the threat of attack by Japanese airplanes, it was a fearful thing to travel by train. When the sky was clear, the airplanes could attack either during the day or at night. Whenever the alarm sounded, we had to leave the train and hide in the field. The passengers were relieved that the sky was cloudy during the day. However, at night the sky was clear, the moon was bright, <span class="pg" data-page-id="469" id="469">[469]</span> and the people were afraid. At that very time, I happened to be reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51774" data-verses="Psalms 121:1">Psalm 121</span>, and I praised the Lord for His word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51775" data-verses="Psalms 121:6">verse 6</span>. Then I testified to the other passengers, saying, “I am a Christian and I have just read in the Bible, the Word of God, that the sun will not strike you by day nor the moon by night. I believe that God will keep me safe. All those who are traveling with me will also be safe. Be at peace.” Some of them laughed at me. But after we safely made the long trip to the capital of Shantung Province without any alarms, I asked them about what I had said, and they admitted that it was true. In that situation I, like Hezekiah, experienced God as my Keeper. </p>

<p data-content-id="K1eAihiqzvOD_ioDc2UZRRfiJEn8sDcLTtT8TGFcTdIl76OxcXwPf6jwTsqT2wjk7"> In the previous message we covered the first eight of the Psalms of Ascents. In this message we will consider the remaining seven, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51822" data-verses="Psalms 128:1-134">Psalms 128 through 134</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="lnStf6w0mGYlfBdHZPg7L2mph4W_Vp4Xr-bbSzE8X4PBExpGgaJ9ExBbKKISN9aOg"> The sequence of these seven psalms is significant. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51823" data-verses="Psalms 128:1">Psalm 128</span> speaks of Jehovah’s blessing to Israel from Zion and the prosperity of Jerusalem in Israel’s enjoyment. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51824" data-verses="Psalms 129:1">Psalm 129</span> concerns God’s righteous dealing with the persecutors of Israel and the haters of Zion. On this earth there is a people chosen by God as His elect, and this people is always persecuted. This is true of the believers today, who may be persecuted for preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible. Furthermore, Zion, the highest peak of that range of mountains, signifies the overcomers in the church, the higher ones among the believers. Just as Zion was hated, so the overcomers also are hated. But God comes in to deal righteously with those who persecute Israel and hate Zion. Israel is God’s elect, and God deals with those who persecute His people, but this does not mean that Israel is perfect and sinless. On the contrary, Israel has many sins and iniquities. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51825" data-verses="Psalms 130:1">Psalm 130</span> we have a psalm of forgiveness and redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="OStP7wKqw4XofP1Nzz44am4w9ivn3tW4ba4lk0uKaZVu2pdBrTzyGBK2L-ogLSmdV"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51826" data-verses="Psalms 131:1">Psalm 131</span> indicates that after we experience God’s forgiveness, we become humble. Formerly, we were proud and even haughty, thinking that we alone were right and that others were wrong. But after we are enlightened concerning our real situation, make a thorough confession, and receive God’s forgiveness, we become humble. We humble our heart, <span class="pg" data-page-id="478" id="478">[478]</span> lower our eyes, and our soul becomes quiet “like a weaned child with its mother” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51827" data-verses="Psalms 131:2">v. 2</span>). I have had this experience many times, realizing that I am nothing, that I have nothing, and that I can do nothing. When our heart is humbled and our soul is quiet, we are in a condition that is suitable for God to come in to rest. In such a situation God can have a resting place, a dwelling. However, when we are proud and our eyes are haughty, God has no rest, no dwelling place, in us. Only when we are humble, calm, and quiet is the situation right for God to rise up, enter into us, and take us as His resting place. This is Zion becoming God’s habitation, His resting place, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51828" data-verses="Psalms 132:1">Psalm 132</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="4Pl1H-TvAJj7lZqOZ3bOMXcbQXEYW2Yis2c6ZRGIY5fJcSQcdP3Ys4DBvkiP0VUqd"> Next, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51829" data-verses="Psalms 133:1">Psalm 133</span> shows us that Zion is the unique place where the brothers can come together in unity. Zion is the uniting center. In any other place we are scattered and divided. When God has His rest, His dwelling place, in Zion, we can come to Him in Zion and dwell there in unity with the brothers. How good and how pleasant this is! It is like the fine oil, signifying the anointing, upon Aaron, and it is also like the morning dew, signifying grace, that descends from Mount Hermon to the mountains of Zion. This indicates that, as God’s people, we need both the anointing and the watering. Moreover, in Zion God has a place where He can command His blessing. Therefore, in Zion we receive the commanded blessing of God, even life forever. </p>
<p data-content-id="m0i-wy-RG-xPsDhHONkFYyTp8aEHJYJZEFR9UfXFGxjnD7XcVM08W-VxUhCdMTvok"> Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51830" data-verses="Psalms 134:1">Psalm 134</span> the children of Israel first charge the priests to praise God in the night, and then they bless the priests. Whereas the priests taught and blessed the children of Israel, here the children of Israel teach and bless the priests. This indicates that the children of Israel have become higher than the priests. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZoqnkBJsv_ave8S39rvI6QR2RpXvjyoKcjH_ufhMTX22UVAGWPYGMDioB-HdgCp6h"> The sequence of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51831" data-verses="Psalms 128:1-134">Psalms 128 through 134</span> is logical and reasonable. We enjoy God’s blessing from Zion and the prosperity of Jerusalem, and then God deals with those who persecute us and hate us. Nevertheless, we are sinful and need God’s forgiveness. When we receive His forgiveness, we become humble, calm, and quiet, and God comes in to rest, to dwell, in us. Then we come up to Him to dwell in unity. As a result, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="479" id="479">[479]</span> become Mount Zion; that is, we become the highest people, those who are even higher than the priests. </p>

<p data-content-id="DTkPp079Cp66d6XMH5NpzJFw8knnEno0ABS1nCLXQ91_Z47wAvbepEUjXUVIJrvBR"> The first one hundred nineteen psalms talk about the law. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51875" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> is on the law, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51876" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> also is on the law. Regarding the law, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51877" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> is an excellent beginning, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51878" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> is an excellent ending. In speaking about the law, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51879" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> uses seven synonyms of the word <em>law:</em> testimony or testimonies, word, statutes, ordinances, precepts, judgments, and commandments. These seven synonyms issue in the way. </p>
<p data-content-id="SbdWgF4EAWEy9ge53uRbu8J9aE_958ZA6o2N5TfAmVLjMVdX55snzFO4ywV8-vS6R"> In particular, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51880" data-verses="Psalms 119:1">Psalm 119</span> is on the law as the testimony of God. According to the Bible this testimony is the testimony of what God is. The law is a type, a symbol, of Christ as the testimony of God. In order to understand this, we need to consider another type of Christ—the ark of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51881" data-verses="Exodus 25:10-11">Exo. 25:10-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51882" data-verses="Exodus 25:16">16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51883" data-verses="Exodus 25:21-22">21-22</span>). The ark of the testimony was put into the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle, which is called the tabernacle of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51884" data-verses="Exodus 38:21">Exo. 38:21</span>). The Bible does not say that the law was put into the ark; rather, the Bible tells us that the testimony was put into the ark (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51885" data-verses="Exodus 40:20">Exo. 40:20</span>). The law contained, or concealed, in the ark is called the testimony. </p>

Each of these psalms has a striking point or significance. The striking point of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51896" data-verses="Psalms 135:1">Psalm 135</span> is the praise of Jehovah for His virtues. The striking point of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51897" data-verses="Psalms 136:1">Psalm 136</span> is Jehovah’s everlasting lovingkindness. The second part of every verse in this psalm says, “For His lovingkindness is forever.” The striking point of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51898" data-verses="Psalms 137:1">Psalm 137</span> is the remembrance of Zion and the non-forgetting of Jerusalem. The psalmist said that the captives wept by the rivers of Babylon when they remembered Zion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51899" data-verses="Psalms 137:1">v. 1</span>). The psalmist went on to say that he could not forget Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51900" data-verses="Psalms 137:5">v. 5</span>). The striking point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51901" data-verses="Psalms 138:1">Psalm 138</span> is the thanking of Jehovah in the worship of His holy temple. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51902" data-verses="Psalms 139:1">Psalm 139</span> speaks of God’s omniscience and omnipresence. However, the striking point of this psalm is neither God’s omniscience nor His omnipresence but the psalmist’s asking Jehovah for His searching and trying. Here the psalmist seemed to be saying, “O Jehovah, search me and try me to see what is within me. Only You can search me in this way because only You are omniscient and omnipresent. Only You are qualified to search me and try me.” </p>

However, concerning God’s economy these things are not crucial. Matters <span class="pg" data-page-id="489" id="489">[489]</span> such as weeping and hanging harps on the willows have nothing to do with God’s economy. Thus, our saying that there is nothing crucial in these psalms is based on the principle of God’s economy. </p>

Thus, these psalms are the expressions of the sentiments of writers who were very close to God. These sentiments are expressed from different directions. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51911" data-verses="Psalms 137:1">Psalm 137</span> was written from the direction of one sitting by the rivers of Babylon, whereas <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51912" data-verses="Psalms 139:1">Psalm 139</span> was written from the direction of God’s searching and trying. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51913" data-verses="Psalms 139:23-24">139:23-24</span> David prayed, “Search me, O God, and know my heart; / Try me, and know my anxious thoughts; / And see if there is some harmful way in me, / And lead me on the eternal way.” Such a prayer can be uttered only by a person who is very close to God, even face to face with Him. </p>

In these psalms there is nothing crucial related to God’s economy. Nevertheless, these psalms reveal that the writers were very close to God. We need to keep this point in mind as we consider each of these five psalms. </p>

This psalm could have been written only by someone who was close to the Lord and concerned for the Lord’s interest and for the serving priests. I believe that the writer of this psalm was not a priest but a common citizen among the Israelites. Because he was close to the Lord and because he had an intimate concern for the worship of God and for the priests, he charged the priests to worship God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="490" id="490">[490]</span> </p>

Certain of the saints among us in the church who are very close to the Lord may be concerned for all these ones, watch over them, and pray for them. For instance, a particular co-worker is serving the Lord full-time, but he may not be very desperate with the Lord. Some of the older saints, bothered about the situation, may then pray for this co-worker. </p>

Isaac had two sons: Esau, the well-behaved one, and Jacob, the naughty one. Isaac chose Esau, who did things to please him, but God chose Jacob for Himself. God’s economy needed this naughty one.

As we sing this hymn, our heart is touched and we feel that the Lord is close to us and that we are close to Him. We have the sense not mainly of the Lord’s coming or of His being the King but of His nearness and dearness. We also have the feeling that the writer of this hymn was very intimate with the Lord. For instance, the third stanza says, “My heart is always with Himself, / My eyes are heavenward, / My lips would utter nothing else / Than meeting with my Lord. / The coming of the Lord draws nigh, / His coming is for me; / His promise ever standeth firm / And soon fulfilled I’ll see.” The writer addresses the Lord as “my King,” an expression that indicates dearness and nearness. The more we sing or read this hymn, the greater is our sense of how dear and near the Lord is to us and we to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="VRhjPpz4JdnWROtHhxAOzOTigFNWmZKbLuiblGSkCvPkgGcqezXq0pmSA19ZCDN-R"> This word about <em>Hymns,</em> #960 may help us to appreciate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51960" data-verses="Psalms 140:1-145">Psalms 140 through 145</span>. These six psalms are not great or important, and they do not have any particular taste. Although these psalms are common, they nevertheless show us one striking thing—that David, the writer, was very close to God. Thus, the sense of nearness to the Lord in these psalms is very similar to the sense in <em>Hymns,</em> #960. </p>
<p data-content-id="iTbtceJp8CRsXmWGS1xo0pUDSn5u1SBErA31-m4XYfmciafaweXi21GVgQC5RY84s"> Concerning the arrangement of the one hundred fifty psalms, we have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51961" data-verses="Psalms 1:1-119">Psalms 1 through 119</span> are on the law and that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51962" data-verses="Psalms 120:1-134">Psalms 120 through 134</span> are Songs of Ascents. The last sixteen psalms, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51963" data-verses="Psalms 135:1-150">Psalms 135 through 150</span>, are in three clusters: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51964" data-verses="Psalms 135:1-139">Psalms 135 through 139</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51965" data-verses="Psalms 140:1-145">Psalms 140 through 145</span>, <span class="pg" data-page-id="500" id="500">[500]</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51966" data-verses="Psalms 146:1-150">Psalms 146 through 150</span>.

<p data-content-id="1ushQ5QG2mm5vQ6JwR6dCX8BwHlbYGuYon0k6S7Qrut04qLHEKfdtRUBEgUqfnP--"> We have also seen that the Psalms are the expression of the complex sentiments of the psalmists. Because the psalmists were close to the Lord, often while they were writing their sentiments, a revelation regarding Christ would break forth. We see such a revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="51967" data-verses="Psalms 2:7">Psalm 2:7</span>: “You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You.” We may compare the breaking forth of the revelations of Christ in the Psalms to Christ’s sudden, unexpected transfiguration on the mountain (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51968" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-2">Matt. 17:1-2</span>) and to His surprising ascension (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="51969" data-verses="Acts 1:9-11">Acts 1:9-11</span>). Although revelations concerning Christ burst out in many different psalms, no such bursting out takes place in the last sixteen psalms. </p>

Therefore, I have entitled this message “Final Prayers of David to Jehovah.” Let us now look into the content of these prayers. These psalms do not contain great or important things, but, as we will see, they are full of intimacy. </p>

Often when we come to the Lord we are too quick in our speaking. Can you stay with the Lord for five minutes without speaking? You may find it difficult to be quiet when you are with the Lord. We make mistakes in our prayer because we are too fast in our talking. Therefore, like David, we need God to set a watch before our mouth and to keep the door of our lips. </p>

Here David seemed to be saying, “In spite of the evil things that come to me, I am still praying. I do not do anything except pray against these evil deeds.” Our situation, however, is often quite different. When bad things happen to us, we may forget to pray. For instance, when a brother and his wife are exchanging words, he may forget to pray. How much better it would be if the brother, instead of arguing with his wife, would pray against that thing. We need to learn of David to pray against evil deeds. <span class="pg" data-page-id="502" id="502">[502]</span> </p>

Here we see that God was many things to David: a rock, a fortress, a high tower, a shield, and a refuge. A rock is something on which to stand; a fortress is for protection; a high tower is for being lifted up above the enemies; and a shield is for protecting the face and the breast. In addition, to David God was a Deliverer and the One in whom he took refuge. </p>

Because each of these psalms begins and ends with the word “Hallelujah,” these five psalms are called Hallelujah psalms. The Septuagint says that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52020" data-verses="Psalms 146:1-149">Psalms 146 to 149</span> were written by Haggai and Zechariah after their return from captivity.

<p data-content-id="wz9YZjJszQSaVqUbb2iCRhIpstrzM6eJbBJ9AgWWAfl9SPNOQr15VHqMpSEz2Zobj"> Some expositors say that the five books of the Psalms correspond to the five books of the law written by Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Other expositors say that the Psalms are an abstract of the entire Bible. Certain expositors exalt <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52021" data-verses="Psalms 146:1-150">Psalms 146 through 150</span>. However, these psalms reveal very little concerning God’s economy and dispensing, for when they were written the “spiritual civilization” was still quite primitive. Since the book of Psalms was written, the divine revelation in the Scriptures has progressed very much. For this reason, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52022" data-verses="Psalms 146:1-150">Psalms 146 through 150</span> cannot compare with the book of Ephesians. </p>
