<p data-content-id="rTSxy6ufSYY0cJBRx2jNdxDZR-PkGj6zjpNjnSLueU-tMdGQu5_MrjbAjwXzSYNvV"> The book of Isaiah is the first of the books of the prophets. Isaiah’s ministry, which began in 760 B.C., lasted more than sixty years. He served four generations of kings. History tells us that he was martyred in a very cruel way by being sawn in two (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52990" data-verses="Hebrews 11:37">Heb. 11:37</span>). He was utterly faithful. </p>
<p data-content-id="ddB4lVkVmyJ68CnsJyJfbGTfRUEqFgq-k0BZRd94yrfre8l1WideKLwaD17JxG7L9"> Isaiah’s prophecy has a spiritual essence, and the essence is this: The Christ processed for the divine purposes being the centrality and the universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity for the divine dispensing of Himself into His elect. Although the term <em>great wheel</em> cannot be found in Isaiah, this book does in fact speak of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity. Each of the books of prophecy unveils a part of God’s universal move. Whereas Ezekiel uses the word <em>wheel</em> to describe God’s universal move on earth for the fulfillment of His eternal economy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52991" data-verses="Ezekiel 1:15">Ezek. 1:15</span>), Isaiah takes the lead to prophesy concerning God’s move. </p>
<p data-content-id="QitwyRAi-BSyEqDN1P_sSBFDUbCY_fx4QXG-tNSwIQCcZx2gydXf2eVhMxTRLWMCr"> The book of Isaiah is full of the aspects of God’s eternal economy. This book shows us how God, for the fulfillment of His eternal economy, has chosen a people, Israel, to be His elect and His beloved. Around Israel are the Gentile nations. In a sense, Israel has been chosen by God, and the nations have been set aside by Him. Nevertheless, in His move God cannot neglect the nations. Therefore, both Israel, God’s chosen and beloved people, and the nations are very much involved in Isaiah’s prophecy. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ks0-CsfGps88CTf9Bvjl9SMqjO8piKeoiwr1F8Bi_ombalAGWQaduu3FhVvFEPu8l"> It is not easy for us to know any book of the Bible. In the New Testament, the most difficult book to enter into and to <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> understand is Ephesians. In the Old Testament, the most difficult book to enter into and to understand is Isaiah. As a book concerning God’s economy, Isaiah has its appearance, contents, and depths. Furthermore, this book involves God’s dealing with many nations for a definite purpose. Thus, it is hard for us to enter into this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="lRnGBbKnFFwheo_id-woCHnZoZ8gVcFhd5jkSJRN7ha8wanPDUFPhcvoB8-OKcwsT"> The book of Isaiah, which has sixty-six chapters, is a representative of the Bible, which has sixty-six books. In these messages on the book of Isaiah, we will not cover this book chapter by chapter and verse by verse, for this would lead us into a “forest.” We will cover Isaiah in the way of a life-study, not for knowledge or theology but for life. </p>
<p data-content-id="VG1BawJMM7x2I8Q1-xnQK7gmkEg3yJ32rYr_aqOpNv8d2Qc_Ih4-0lnhtsdV5yxzA"> The best way to study Isaiah is to learn the secret and mysterious points of this book. Many of these secret points are related to Christ. Every aspect of what Christ is and of what He has done, is doing, and will do involves a secret. Some of these secrets are in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52992" data-verses="Isaiah 7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52993" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">9:6</span>; others are in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52994" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">chapter fifty-three</span>.

Hence, the content of Isaiah covers God’s entire economy of the New Testament, from the incarnation to the new heaven and new earth, with the Old Testament background of God’s dealing with Israel and His judgment upon the nations. </p>

THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</h2><p data-content-id="RWFHKesiQFgZazxZPJ6x8RKYjCVsdgryCSllUbbuvWm2lmnZkYhSqmHn7Gi_Xa-di"> The central thought of Isaiah is: Christ is God incarnated in humanity to be the Savior of man, that all the God-created universe, which is fallen, might be restored and consummate in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. This book, like the New Testament, covers from beginning to end all the things God has ordained according to His economy. The beginning is the incarnation, and the end is the new heaven and new earth. The New Testament begins with Christ’s incarnation and birth and ends with the new heaven and new earth. Since Isaiah covers the same matters, we see once again that the book of Isaiah is the representative of the entire Bible, especially of the New Testament. </p>

This section reveals that the action of God in His economy first will benefit Israel and then will bring in the wonderful Christ to meet the need of every situation. By accomplishing God’s economy, Christ will meet God’s need, and in His salvation He will meet man’s need. We should keep these points in mind as we read Isaiah. </p>

These two matters involve two classes of people—Israel and the Gentiles, the nations. Both are related to God because they were created by Him. Israel is God’s elect, His chosen people, and the nations are those who were apparently given up by God. Actually, God has not given up the nations, for among them there are many who have been chosen by Him. In the Old Testament Israel was God’s chosen people, but most of the chosen ones in the New Testament are from the Gentiles. Hence, although God gave up the nations temporarily, He would not do this for the long run, because He has chosen many from the Gentiles to be believers and to constitute the Body of Christ, which is much more crucial to God than Israel is. </p>
<p data-content-id="rTSxy6ufSYY0cJBRx2jNexDIe-PkGj6zjpNjnSLueU-tMdGQu5_MrjbAjwXzSYNvV"> Both Israel and the nations, the Gentiles, are dealt with by God, but in different ways. God’s dealing with Israel, His beloved people, is always in love. For this reason, I consider this dealing not as judgment but as chastisement. God’s dealing with Israel is like a father’s dealing with his children to correct them, to improve them, and to bring them onto the right track. This is chastisement. </p>
<p data-content-id="ddB4lVkVmyJ68CnsJyJfYGTCdUEqFgq-k0BZRd94yrfre8l1WideKLwaD17JxG7L9"> In the book of Isaiah, God’s love toward Israel is exercised in a threefold way, as a Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53040" data-verses="Isaiah 1:2-3">1:2-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53041" data-verses="Isaiah 63:16">63:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53042" data-verses="Isaiah 64:8">64:8</span>), as a nursing Mother (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53043" data-verses="Isaiah 66:13">66:13</span>), and as a Husband (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53044" data-verses="Isaiah 54:5">54:5</span>). God was Israel’s Father, Mother, and Husband. Since God dealt with His beloved Israel in a loving way, His dealing with them was not a matter of judgment but of chastisement. </p>
<p data-content-id="QitwyRAi-BSyEqDN1P_sRBFaZbCY_fx4QXG-tNSwIQCcZx2gydXf2eVhMxTRLWMCr"> God’s dealing with the nations, however, is a matter of judgment. This judgment is not based on God’s love; it is based on God’s righteousness, on His justice. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ks0-CsfGps88CTf9Bvjl-SMPhO8piKeoiwr1F8Bi_ombalAGWQaduu3FhVvFEPu8l"> When God comes to deal with people, He deals with them according to what He is. The Bible reveals that God is holy <span class="pg" data-page-id="7" id="7">[7]</span> and righteous. He is the Holy One and the Righteous One. As the Holy One, He deals with His people, and as the Righteous One, He deals with the nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="lRnGBbKnFFwheo_id-woBHn4rZ8gVcFhd5jkSJRN7ha8wanPDUFPhcvoB8-OKcwsT"> God deals with His elect in love that they may be holy. Because the children of Israel were called by God and separated unto God, they must be holy, as God is holy. God’s chastisement of Israel was for holiness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53045" data-verses="Hebrews 12:10">Heb. 12:10</span>). Since they had become common, worldly, and completely unlike God in His holy nature, He came in to chastise them. His chastisement of Israel was that they might learn the lessons of holiness and be holy. </p>
<p data-content-id="Owq2f2I7NIYFk__C2yw8Ppo9X1kxR__Fg1-1HGnPDzxmpjvxRJoOnponCYjgQHroH"> God’s dealing with the nations is different from His dealing with Israel. Whereas God chastises Israel according to His holiness, He judges the nations according to His righteousness. God judges the nations because they are not just and righteous. Therefore, based upon what God is in His righteousness, He comes in to judge the nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="42lYhddcih55Tpki1290f8oFMJQYZYNlC_L9wpOqJcbvARzvSLoTKgjzo7LRsbZQU"> As we read the book of Isaiah, we need to keep in mind that God’s dealing with people is in two aspects—the aspect of His holiness and the aspect of His righteousness. Holiness is God’s requirement for His chosen people, and righteousness is God’s requirement for the nations. God wants His people to be holy, and He wants the nations to be righteous. Based upon His holiness and righteousness, God deals respectively with these two classes of people. He chastises Israel in love for holiness, and He judges the nations for righteousness. </p>

To have no ruler is God’s chastisement. If a family does not have a ruler, that family will be in chaos. In such a family there would be neither father nor mother, neither elder brother nor elder sister. No one would be able to exercise any ruling, and the family would be in a pitiful situation. Likewise, if in a church there were no leading ones, that church would be in chaos. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2AlQGFEtbY3V68hEJdcu7sypDnm-QbOPj1PY3loDh0BSFBk1Q1m_bAmK-r0giaBC"> It is significant that Isaiah links the ruler with the food supply. To be a ruler, you must feed the people. If you do not feed them, they will rebel. In the church, if there is no feeding, there is no ruling; and no ruling results in no food. Ruling and feeding go together as a pair. Ruling produces feeding, and feeding issues in ruling. If a church is well nourished, there surely must be proper ruling in that church. But when there is fighting in the church, this indicates that there is a shortage of food and of ruling. Ruling and feeding are not only a pair—they also work together in a cycle and give rise to each other. Thus, if there is feeding, there is ruling; and if there is ruling, there is feeding.

These two points, which are much higher than the matters covered in the previous messages, are related to Christ as the God-man and to Israel. As we will see, Jehovah’s humiliating judgment ushers in the God-man, Christ, and issues in the restoration of the nation of Israel. Both the ushering in of Christ and the restoration of Israel come from Jehovah’s righteous judgment on the nations. The more God judges the nations, the more Christ is ushered in; and the more Christ is ushered in, the more the restoration of Israel issues out. The ushering in of Christ and the restoration of Israel will result in the millennial kingdom.

In order to understand this, we need to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53190" data-verses="Isaiah 4:1-2">Isaiah 4:1 and 2</span> and the connection between these verses. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53191" data-verses="Isaiah 4:1">Verse 1</span> says, “Seven women will grasp / One man in that day, / Saying, We will eat our own bread / And wear our own clothes; / Just let us bear your name; / Take our reproach away.” These women are in reproach because they do not have a husband. They do not have a man to lead them, and they want to bear the name of a man so that their reproach might be taken away. When I read this verse in my early days, I wondered about its meaning. What is the significance of this word? Its significance is that it is a link between God’s judgment and Christ. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53192" data-verses="Isaiah 4:2">verse 2</span> indicates, the lack with these women is not that they are short of a leader but that they are short of Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and as the Fruit of the earth. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53193" data-verses="Isaiah 4:2">Verse 2</span> reveals that to these women who have escaped, Christ as the Shoot <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> of Jehovah will be beauty and glory and Christ as the Fruit of the earth will be excellence and splendor.

<p data-content-id="v8bXBUaOMzEw-TiNL5ZmqXlkX97nmg86AjAc50n7OsvDdfqaWEWKpdyEo4hVS0NFL"> Now I would like to go on to give a further explanation of the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth. </p>

The term <em>the Shoot of Jehovah,</em> which refers to Christ’s deity, denotes the riches and the refreshing of life. A shoot out of any plant indicates that the life of that plant is vigorous, growing, and productive. The principle is the same with Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah. As such a Shoot, He embodies the riches, the refreshing, the vigor, the growth, and the productive power of the divine life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PKUKLH45yBJtdHW2HQznPav_4ma_4HlFtt1ofnLxcnhYFoycnBqCFUmBqa3kjcWVb">CHRIST AS THE FRUIT OF THE EARTH</h2><p data-content-id="-waEYRv93EhPN6GvKzVWFqUE7US28tMkU59WnoJRQOgj-h7qhd8NKNqqlIlNCrxzR"> The term <em>the Fruit of the earth,</em> which refers to Christ’s humanity and indicates that He grew up out of the earth, denotes the produce brought forth, carried out, and expressed in Christ’s humanity. Of course, in order for this reproduction to take place, there must be the divine life. However, humanity is also needed. Suppose our Lord did not become a man through incarnation but remained simply in His divinity. What could have been produced out of Him as a fruit? The answer is that there could not have been any fruit. I would emphasize the fact that all of Christ’s different kinds of fruits come out of the divine life, which is signified by the Shoot of Jehovah. But without Christ’s humanity, it would have been impossible for the divine life to be productive in bringing forth fruit. The four Gospels show us that all the fruit borne by Christ came out of the divine life, but it was produced in Christ’s humanity. Therefore, the Shoot of Jehovah denotes the divine life in its riches, and the Fruit of the earth denotes the fruit produced by this life in humanity. </p>

In Him God and <span class="pg" data-page-id="33" id="33">[33]</span> man live together as one. The New Testament is a revelation of this very thing: it shows us God and man living together, with God as the life inwardly and man as the fruit outwardly. </p>
<p data-content-id="WJ5aP-FOAwwmtqgyigv5nzgpez5_2hxzBbpu9V9IDxIMpTzB5bTDMszy1Pz0KJtzc"> As believers in Christ today, we need both the divine life and the human life. If we do not have the divine life, we do not have life. But if we do not have the proper human life to match the divine life, we will have no fruit. The New Testament reveals that, as those chosen and predestinated by God, we need to have the divine life expressed in our human living. If we have this, then in our experience we will have Christ both as the Shoot of Jehovah and as the Fruit of the earth. </p>

And there will be a tabernacle as a daytime shade from the heat and as a refuge and a cover from storm and rain” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53196" data-verses="Isaiah 4:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>).

<p data-content-id="fR3FSAPwpELEt7o898BfjbnSJcIjkJG41RF-XGMr8wANynIdYRkLxYxdC1pZYDojA"> God has a great move on earth, and this move involves many things. As we have pointed out, Christ is the centrality and the universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity. The Christ who is the centrality and universality of God’s move is also the canopy to cover the totality of this move. The crucial point is that in addition to being the reality of the great move of God on earth, Christ is also the canopy to cover God’s move and all that is involved with it. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2AlQGFEtbY3V68hEJdco7s-nDnm-QbOPj1PY3loDh0BSFBk1Q1m_bAmK-r0giaBC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53197" data-verses="Isaiah 4:5">verse 5</span> Isaiah speaks of the canopy, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53198" data-verses="Isaiah 4:6">verse 6</span> he speaks of a tabernacle. Christ is not only the canopy to cover all the things in God’s move but also a tabernacle to overshadow God’s chosen people. The God-man, Christ, who is our canopy, is also a tabernacle as a shade in the day to keep us from the heat and a refuge and a cover to keep us from any kind of storm and rain. <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Hm7MzKBVNqPZvSZnxKZR_9T_otp-xXbkrNr2Q-9EvAjIvq579v1RiiagtxjY2sjVC"> I can testify in the two months prior to the time I began to give these messages on the life-study of Isaiah, I experienced Christ as my canopy. These two months were months of fighting—fighting to be able to carry out this life-study. I realized that the enemy, Satan, was not happy to see that, at the end of this age, the Christ revealed in Isaiah would be unveiled to God’s children. Therefore, I began to fight concerning this. During this time of fighting, I took the Lord Jesus as my covering. I prayed, saying, “Lord, hide me under Your precious blood. I hide myself in You. I ask You, Lord, to cover me and everything related to me.” Today we all need Christ as such a canopy, and we need Christ also as the overshadowing tabernacle to shade us from the heat and as a refuge and cover to protect us from any storm and rain. </p>

We need to see this rich Christ and know Him as the Shoot of Jehovah, the Fruit of the earth, the canopy, and the tabernacle. Perhaps you have been a Christian for many years, but before now you had not seen Christ in these items of what He is to us. Had you ever seen that Christ, the God-man, is the Shoot of Jehovah in His divinity and the Fruit of the earth in His humanity? Had you ever heard that Christ is the canopy that covers all God’s interests on the earth and a tabernacle that overshadows God’s people from everything that could bother them? Christians know that because God loved the world He gave His only begotten Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53199" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>), but few, if any, see Christ and know Christ as He is revealed in Isaiah. Therefore, I urge you to spend your time, ability, and energy to study this book in order to see and know the wonderful Christ revealed in it. </p>

<p data-content-id="DSgijqH7I3eza2ivBfoP7nHh6aCyUwpg7PL2m3xGMv7aVYPK1L11f4RkD4W1mOBaY"> When Isaiah looked at the situation among the children of Israel, he became very disappointed. For this reason, in the first five chapters of his prophecy, he had very little to say that was good about the children of Israel. It was at this point that the Lord brought him into a vision so that he could see <span class="pg" data-page-id="36" id="36">[36]</span> the Lord of glory sitting on the throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53212" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">v. 1</span>). The Lord seemed to say to Isaiah, “Don’t look down at the situation. If you look down, you will be disappointed. Look up at Me. I am still here. There may be nothing good there, but everything is good here. I am the unique good thing in the universe. Look at Me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="SmYb8X5DkMX1is5fBiy_MEGb2TJreiRZgwNut5F5ur9fZrkZrs1dBJeO_jB-pFaTl"> At the beginning of your church life, you might have experienced a church “honeymoon.” But after a period of time, what was so sweet to you might have become bitter like vinegar. Then instead of a honeymoon you have a “vinegarmoon.” In your disappointment with the church life, you may think that it would be better if you moved to another locality. However, I can assure you that you cannot find a church that experiences a continual honeymoon. In every church there is some vinegar. Therefore, in the church life, we need to learn not to look down at the situation but to look up to Christ. We should not look at anything or anyone other than Christ. The Christ whom we look up to is no longer on the cross; today Christ is on the throne. </p>

By this <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> we can see that we must pay attention to our lips, to our speaking. Every day we talk too much. A great percentage of the words we speak are evil, because most of our words are words of criticism. Nearly every word that we speak concerning any matter or any person is a word of criticism. This is the reason that our lips are unclean. Unclean things such as gossip, murmuring, and reasoning make the church life taste like vinegar. If we eliminate gossip, murmuring, and reasoning, we may find that we have very little to talk about. Like Isaiah, we need to realize that our lips are unclean. </p>

When our conscience is cleansed and is void of offense, we are able to contact God. According to our enlightened conscience, we are clean, but according to the actual facts of our situation in the old creation, we are not clean. How could the old creation be clean? As long as we remain in the old creation, we can never be completely clean, for the old creation is unclean. We need the redemption of our body. Once our body is redeemed, we will get out of the old creation. At that time, we will be completely clean. </p>

On the contrary, the sign of Immanuel is still being fulfilled today. Where is Immanuel? According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53274" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span>, Immanuel, full of the splendor of His human virtues, is in the heavens sitting on the throne. The real strategy concerning the Middle East is in His hand, and He knows what the outcome will be. </p>

We will consider this sign in relation to Satan’s use of Babylon to oppose God and God’s economy. The New Testament begins with the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son, whose name is called Immanuel, God with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53294" data-verses="Matthew 1:22-23">Matt. 1:22-23</span>). As we will see, this great sign covers the entire Bible from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53295" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53296" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>. </p>

God’s plan, God’s economy, is to gain for Himself a people from among the human beings created by Him. God’s calling of Abraham was part of the fulfillment of God’s desire to have a people for Himself, a people who were chosen, called, and separated to be God’s treasure. With the coming of Christ, God took a further step to gain another people—the church. To God, the church is a great treasure. Therefore, God has two elect peoples: Israel in the Old Testament and the believers in the New Testament. In totality, the believers are the church, God’s elect in the New Testament. For the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, God desires to gain these two elect peoples. </p>

<p data-content-id="U9URzQvxl-2lbh8eBc0kFULmZVKDDr1W7UKzDtFOt5gwiv1E1oQCE1BiF2e8JjzZg"> The divine revelation always has its own principle, and according to the principle of the divine revelation, the first nation used by Satan to frustrate God from accomplishing His eternal economy was Babel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53297" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span>. <em>Babel</em> was an ancient name for <em>Babylon.</em> At Babel rebellious people built a tower and a city in order to make a name for themselves (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53298" data-verses="Genesis 11:4">Gen. 11:4</span>). Eventually, after many centuries, Babel was enlarged to become Babylon. According to the Old Testament, all the Gentile nations used by Satan against God began from Babylon. This human opposition to God is signified by the human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53299" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>. This image includes Babylon (the head of gold), followed by the Medo-Persians (the breast and arms of silver), the Greeks (the belly and thighs of brass), and the Romans (the legs of iron). </p>
<p data-content-id="MtvmNOQoEXWPJrXLSOVZvla9Z4o0Rx1dcmIVN6QiUkC-QwmmcWMvUGGb6XF0aziH7"> History shows us that the center of many of the wars fought between nations has been the Middle East, in particular the area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Euphrates River. The land of Immanuel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53300" data-verses="Isaiah 8:8">Isa. 8:8</span>) is in this area. This is the land which Christ will inherit for the establishing of His millennial kingdom with two peoples—chosen Israel as His earthly people and the chosen believers as His heavenly people. The fighting over this land is still taking place, for in the twentieth century the world situation has been centered in the Middle East. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="VG1BawJMM7x2I8Q1-xnQD7gmgEg3yJ32rYr_aqOpNv8d2Qc_Ih4-0lnhtsdV5yxzA">Babylon in the New Testament</h2><p data-content-id="iwT5Yy0cX4eU-alBW_shAHXqHtH3G3v4KvJAkK1R0Bp2b4WRH-eqJZg0tSj0qYchX"> In the Old Testament, those who invaded the land of Immanuel were physical invaders, such as the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. In the New Testament, the invaders, although still from Babylon, are spiritual invaders. The Babylon in the Old Testament was physical, but the <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> Babylon in the New Testament is spiritual. Toward the end of the New Testament, there is a revelation of this Babylon in its two aspects—the religious aspect (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53301" data-verses="Revelation 17:1-18">Rev. 17:1-18</span>) and the material aspect (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53302" data-verses="Revelation 18:1-24">Rev. 18:1-24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="1ATOEVfKwdlLTMhjSp8c7czuTmQpQkhEIEZAadL-BjklqdI_9Tr4YS71F0zEh2Wky"> If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that the warfare between Satan and God will be ended by the fighting between Christ with His faithful followers and Antichrist with his followers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53303" data-verses="Revelation 17:12-15">Rev. 17:12-15</span>). Antichrist, the coming Caesar of the Roman Empire, will be the one who will form an alliance with the ten toes of the image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53304" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span> and be their leader. In a spiritual sense, Antichrist will be a part of Babylon. The head is Babylon, and the leader of the toes is also Babylon. This indicates that the opposition to God began with Babylon and that it will end with Babylon. When Babylon has been terminated and destroyed, the kingdom will come. This kingdom will be composed of the two elect peoples of God, Israel and the believers. </p>
<p data-content-id="9TrCf1KejPoZVajTCqV7YOt39P6YYza-lMQd7ygpmSZCaXclF4ZegVoF3Vug8RryN"> We need to see clearly that the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son covers the Bible from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53305" data-verses="Genesis 11:1">Genesis 11</span> to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53306" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>. Today we are still in the stage of the fulfillment of this sign, the sign of a son consummating in Immanuel. As this sign continues to be fulfilled, the war between Babylon and Jerusalem is still raging. Today’s Babylon has two sides: the spiritual, or religious, side, which is the Roman Church, and the material side, which will be the city of Rome. </p>

Eventually, this Christ becomes the center of an all-inclusive sign—the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son. </p>
<p data-content-id="ntO50bOijJMzmNkskqp3F6uNl2FSqqc2Bgx_sLnuTf1bUIyGc52QX8pB5QylzmI4x"> The real fulfillment of this sign was the Lord’s incarnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53311" data-verses="Matthew 1:20-23">Matt. 1:20-23</span>). When Christ came, He was Immanuel, which means God with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53312" data-verses="Matthew 1:23">Matt. 1:23</span>). Christ is God with us. This is revealed not only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53313" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1</span> but also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53314" data-verses="Matthew 28:1">Matthew 28</span>, where the Lord Jesus says, “Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53315" data-verses="Matthew 28:20">v. 20</span>). Actually, <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> the entire New Testament is an Immanuel, and we are now a part of this great Immanuel that will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. </p>

This sanctuary is the place where we may live, dwell, and worship God. We are God’s priests, His worshippers, and the sanctuary is the place where we dwell with God. When Christ was incarnated, He became a tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53316" data-verses="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>). <em>Tabernacle</em> is a general term used to denote the sanctuary. For us today, the sanctuary is the innermost part of the temple where we as God’s priests worship God, serve God, and dwell with God. </p>

These nations compose the image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53317" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>. To them, Christ will be the smiting stone. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53318" data-verses="Daniel 2:34-35">Daniel 2:34 and 35</span>, He will be the stone that smashes the image into pieces. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQhDs-iNd9dq5o_tTmhHoPDcgkq7ZljdgsiBluha_pnPIx6DSXOLgZBEdGTR9gpyK"> In the four Gospels we can see that when Christ was on earth, He was opposed by another category of people. Those in this category included the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Herodians, the scribes, the elders, and certain of the priests. To those in this category Christ was a rock of stumbling (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53319" data-verses="Isaiah 8:14">Isa. 8:14b</span>). The ones who fell upon this rock were broken to pieces. </p>
<p data-content-id="mXH6jwyIvlIyW-cyafhjt1XsG-33SIuk3R5HgJphRIFLi_LVDUGLN4j-Olw06YPmP"> Furthermore, many of those who opposed Christ were cunning and subtle, and in their subtlety they tried to trap or to snare the Lord Jesus. During the Lord’s last visit to Jerusalem, the Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, scribes, and others tried over a period of four days to trap Him, to snare Him. Instead, they were eventually trapped and snared by Him. To them, Christ was a trap and a snare (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53320" data-verses="Isaiah 8:14">Isa. 8:14c</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ZQ5ZOI_t6lKDRPvgSN9a8lypzAC8cJuDm5UqbcECOt5pUvu52v_X7zsCFrdRWWuEC"> We thank the Lord that to us who believe in Him, He, as Immanuel, is our sanctuary. In Him we have God’s presence, and God’s presence is our dwelling, the place where we worship God and serve Him. </p>

Israel was once a single nation, but after the time of Solomon, the nation was divided into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. Because the kingdom of Israel had fallen to the extent that it was on the level of the Gentile nations, even becoming an ally to the king of Aram, Israel was not only under God’s chastisement but also under His judgment. God’s chastisement on Israel became His judgment on Israel. For this reason, it is correct now to speak not only of God’s chastisement on Israel but also of His judgment on Israel. Furthermore, the two judgments in this chapter—the judgment on Israel and the judgment on Assyria—are actually one (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53380" data-verses="Isaiah 10:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>).

Israel, especially the house of David, was like a tall tree. However, because of Israel’s degradation, that tree was cut down to the very root. This was the situation with the descendants of David. Both Mary and her engaged husband, Joseph, were descendants of David’s sons. They were part <span class="pg" data-page-id="70" id="70">[70]</span> of the royal family, but they had become poor and were people of a low class, living in Nazareth, a despised city, in Galilee, a despised region. This shows that the house of David had been cut down to the root. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ks0-CsfGps88CTf9Bvjh9SMPtO8piKeoiwr1F8Bi_ombalAGWQaduu3FhVvFEPu8l"> One day, a twig came forth from the remaining part. Christ as a twig came forth from the stem, the stump, above the earth, signifying that restoration is by life and of life. Also, Christ as a branch came forth from the root underneath the earth, signifying the depths of the restoring life, to branch out God and bear much fruit. </p>
<p data-content-id="lRnGBbKnFFwheo_id-wsCHn4nZ8gVcFhd5jkSJRN7ha8wanPDUFPhcvoB8-OKcwsT"> The branch and the twig are one. In His birth Christ was a twig. As He grew up, He was a branch. Because of His branching out, the whole world is filled with the fruit of this branch. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="Owq2f2I7NIYFk__C2yw4MpoxR1kxR__Fg1-1HGnPDzxmpjvxRJoOnponCYjgQHroH">a. The Spirit of Jehovah Resting upon Him</h2><p data-content-id="42lYhddcih55Tpki129wc8oJKJQYZYNlC_L9wpOqJcbvARzvSLoTKgjzo7LRsbZQU"> Concerning Christ as the twig and the branch, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53422" data-verses="Isaiah 11:2">verse 2</span> goes on to say, “The Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him, / The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, / The Spirit of counsel and might, / The Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah.” The Spirit of counsel and might here equals the wisdom and power in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53423" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>, which tells us that Christ is God’s wisdom and God’s power. He is the wisdom which gives counsel and the power which gives might. </p>
<p data-content-id="ok4KA4atXxC4_GGUgoqfRJdGLSzicZp2Ck3w9wYZEOloEhZlx-sLpr5qWuMH_IR_Y"> The branching out of Jehovah is altogether a matter of the Spirit. Christ was born of the Spirit, meaning that He was constituted of the Spirit. Then He was baptized, anointed, with the Spirit. The Spirit was with Him all the time and was one with Him. He walked by the Spirit and lived a life in, with, by, and through the Spirit. Thus, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53424" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> reveals, the Spirit is the reality of Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="3BADcAnW9OEC5k8Yd7Umrj5KU5egJ3xQPJp_FOL39Tr6GcaslKhpsLMjyFet50hDV">b. Savoring the Fear of Jehovah</h2><p data-content-id="GJDDUPDDLX0o4Er94zmPyXfIEmpDzlv3f1-hon_Kz_82lAUhb8Q4Ir7xA9OciutNq"> “He will savor the fear of Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53425" data-verses="Isaiah 11:3">Isa. 11:3a</span>). The word <em>savor</em> indicates that Christ will delight in the fear of Jehovah. Moreover, “He will neither judge by what His eyes see, / Nor decide by what His ears hear. / But He will judge the poor in righteousness, / And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53426" data-verses="Isaiah 11:3-4">vv. 3b-4a</span>). Unlike today, there will be no shortage of righteousness and equity. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53427" data-verses="Isaiah 11:4">Verse 4b</span> continues, “And He will <span class="pg" data-page-id="71" id="71">[71]</span> strike the land with the rod of His mouth, / And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked.” Here, as is common in Isaiah’s poetic writing, we have a pair: the rod of His mouth and the breath of His lips. </p>

Girding the loins gives one the strength to move, act, and especially to fight. Righteousness and faithfulness are two of Christ’s virtues for standing and fighting. He stands with faithfulness and fights with righteousness. </p>

Where He rests, there the glory is. Glory is God’s expression. Where Christ is, there is God’s expression. The expressed God is Christ’s resting place. </p>
<p data-content-id="SmYb8X5DkMX1is5fBiy7LEGXwTJreiRZgwNut5F5ur9fZrkZrs1dBJeO_jB-pFaTl"> On the one hand, Christ as the twig, the branch, and the root of Jesse is connected to humanity. On the other hand, Christ is very much related to God, because where He is, God’s expression is. This picture depicts Christ as both God and man, as the God-man. </p>

I believe that although God did not create the beasts with a negative element in them, as a result of the fall, a negative factor entered into them. When Adam fell, sin entered into him. Since he, the head of all the creatures, became fallen, something of Satan also entered into them. In the restoration this negative factor will be removed, causing a change not only in outward action but also in nature. The reason for this change is given in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53435" data-verses="Isaiah 11:9">verse 9</span>—the knowledge of God, that is, the knowing of God, will fill the earth. Christ’s restoring power will deliver all the creatures from the poisonous element of Satan, and as a result the situation among them will be pleasant, peaceful, and loving. </p>

These chapters show us one major point—that the nations are used by God’s enemy to disturb God’s chosen people and to frustrate God from carrying out His economy.

For instance, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53532" data-verses="Isaiah 1:18">1:18</span> speaks concerning our being cleansed from our sins: “Come now and let us reason together, / Says Jehovah. / Though your sins are like scarlet, / They will be as white as snow; / Though they are as red as crimson, / They will be like wool.” This word is related to the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53533" data-verses="Isaiah 38:17">38:17</span>: “You have cast behind Your back / All my sins.” God has forgiven our sins and has cast them behind His back.

This verse says, <span class="pg" data-page-id="86" id="86">[86]</span> “Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.” This sign covers not only the past and the present but also eternity.

This chapter shows us how to receive God Himself as our salvation and enjoy Him as salvation. We enjoy God as our salvation, drawing water with rejoicing from the springs of salvation, by praising the Lord, calling upon His name, crying out, and giving a ringing shout (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53537" data-verses="Isaiah 12:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53538" data-verses="Isaiah 12:6">6</span>).

If Isaiah’s prophecy ended with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53540" data-verses="Isaiah 12:1">chapter twelve</span>, we might feel that it was sufficient.

Here God considered Israel the same as the nations. The key to this section of Isaiah is God’s “firing” and Christ’s replacing. In His judgment God discharged, or “fired,” everyone and everything. According to Isaiah, all of God’s chastising and judging is a firing. All the kings of the nations, including the kings of Babylon and Assyria, were raised up by God. He appointed them, or hired them, and eventually He also fired them. They were appointed by Him, but they proved to be unqualified and made many <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> mistakes. Thus, the time came when God intervened to fire them. After this hiring and firing, there is the replacing. Who is the replacement? The replacement is Christ, Immanuel. </p>
<p data-content-id="DSgijqH7I3eza2ivBfoL-nHh-aCyUwpg7PL2m3xGMv7aVYPK1L11f4RkD4W1mOBaY"> God not only fired the kings of the nations, but He also fired Shebna, a steward in the house of the king (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53542" data-verses="Isaiah 22:15">22:15</span>), and replaced him with Eliakim, a type of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53543" data-verses="Isaiah 22:20-24">vv. 20-24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53544" data-verses="Revelation 3:7">Rev. 3:7</span>). God also fired all the utensils and vessels, all the bowls and jars (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53545" data-verses="Isaiah 22:25">Isa. 22:25</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="SmYb8X5DkMX1is5fBiy7JEGbyTJreiRZgwNut5F5ur9fZrkZrs1dBJeO_jB-pFaTl"> What we have here is a picture showing us that in the entire universe everything in God’s house and outside God’s house should be fired and replaced with Christ. The nations, the steward, and all the bowls and jars in the king’s house needed to be replaced. God replaced all of them with Immanuel. He replaced everyone and everything with Christ. This is the reason Christ is unveiled as a Father, a Steward, a throne of glory, and a peg (a nail) driven into a sure place (a wall), on which hang all the utensils and vessels—all the things that belong to God for His people to enjoy Him. Here we see that whatever or whoever is not Christ, God fires. </p>
<p data-content-id="gscF4m7-lUlMCcyyYPNn7PRtqnyTDtR8LWYqxUMZF3D3BVVmY2BWD0HZjB0SqwQxg"> In these messages on Isaiah, we need to see not only the way to enjoy God as our salvation, but also see that we have been fired by God and replaced with Christ. God created us to be a man, but He has fired us, discharged us, from being a man. Although we have been fired, we may still keep our post as a man and go on trying to be a man. We need to see that when God created us, He hired us, and that when He put us on the cross, crucifying us with Christ, He fired us. We all have been fired by God. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53546" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> says, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” God fired everyone on the cross, and He is replacing everyone with Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="evZWGvKilH-_j1AxvIVmnseDS7V6_icIqi73-4obRHEd5xAVW1XeP2quVKqJ44fBo">THE REAL CHURCH LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="5cfSks8f9T4wzhajEBGSygl_HKabj3mMDfXnmEjpE8oTiQFZRNSodjL8n4i8NSKGW"> After God’s firing and replacing of everyone and everything with Christ, there will first be the restoration for the kingdom, and then there will be the restoration for the new heaven and new earth for the New Jerusalem. That will be the real church life. The real church life is a life in which all the saints are fired and replaced with Christ. This will make <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> Christ everything in the church. This is the vision of God’s economy hidden in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53547" data-verses="Isaiah 1:1">Isaiah 1—23</span>, and I hope that we will all see it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="N-FUGiukulHdfeeBKJWouUWE8C3Vtiyq3naFoqKsOXoQOjoaDnKgOEo_CqDPuh31a">NOT EXCHANGE BUT REPLACEMENT</h2><p data-content-id="t8bnQrQm6FdShy-EgcXnVYG67TTSXQfcZGteWHR3UQg52r_TcQ6cbm7M6CShPFDoa"> In Christianity it is stressed very much that Christ is our substitute, who died a substitutionary death for us on the cross, bearing the judgment that we should have received. Although it is true that in the divine revelation concerning God’s salvation Christ is our substitute, He is more than our substitute. Christ unites Himself with us and replaces us. This is something which goes further than the substitutionary death of Christ on the cross. Because Christ joined Himself to us, uniting Himself with us, when He died on the cross, we died with Him and were terminated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53548" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="hzY1tM_vwP6yiexhKU0wzWcHQ00OQ2FHJHueHLL0JnTSgM-pFcVRMqavXK50VgQkc"> Regarding this matter, the inner-life Christians use the term <em>exchanged</em> instead of <em>replaced,</em> saying that Christ’s life is exchanged for our life. However, if one thing is exchanged for another, there is no uniting of the two. The teaching concerning an exchanged life is not accurate according to the truth. Replacing demands union, whereas exchanging annuls union with Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="U9URzQvxl-2lbh8eBc0gOULqfVKDDr1W7UKzDtFOt5gwiv1E1oQCE1BiF2e8JjzZg">A Grafted Life</h2><p data-content-id="MtvmNOQoEXWPJrXLSOVdklaxf4o0Rx1dcmIVN6QiUkC-QwmmcWMvUGGb6XF0aziH7"> In the New Testament, Christ’s replacing of us is altogether a matter of a grafted life. This grafted life is the highlight of God’s salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53549" data-verses="John 15:1">John 15</span>. Christ is the vine, and we are the branches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53550" data-verses="John 15:5">v. 5</span>). As wild olive branches, we have been grafted into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53551" data-verses="Romans 11:17">Rom. 11:17</span>). Thus, we are united with Christ, and in this union Christ replaces us. He replaces us by living in us, with us, by us, and through us. We live, yet not we, but Christ lives in us, and we live by the faith of the Son of God. This indicates a union with Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="VG1BawJMM7x2I8Q1-xnUI7gqiEg3yJ32rYr_aqOpNv8d2Qc_Ih4-0lnhtsdV5yxzA">The Struggle concerning Replacement</h2><p data-content-id="iwT5Yy0cX4eU-alBW_slLHXmFtH3G3v4KvJAkK1R0Bp2b4WRH-eqJZg0tSj0qYchX"> In the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, there is a struggle between God and man. Man likes to replace God. In his reaction to God, man tries to replace God, to put God aside, to expel God. But in His reaction to man, God does not <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> put man aside or expel man; rather, He puts man in a terminated position so that man can live by another person, Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="1ATOEVfKwdlLTMhjSp8YwczidmQpQkhEIEZAadL-BjklqdI_9Tr4YS71F0zEh2Wky"> Although God desires to replace man, man does not agree with this, because Satan is behind man. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53552" data-verses="Isaiah 14:12-14">Isaiah 14:12-14</span>, Satan was the first one to attempt to replace God, to expel God and take God’s place, by uplifting his throne and making himself like the Most High. Now Satan is behind man, trying to do away with God and expel God. Even when man wants to do something for God, he does it by putting God aside. This is a crucial matter that we all need to realize. </p>

God may tell us that we should love Him, and we may respond by saying that we are not able to love Him. Then God may say that He will be the strength for us to love Him, but we may say that we do not know how to apply this strength. This cycle of action and reaction can be stopped only by our realizing that we are not the head. We are not the one who has the right to say yes or no. This is submission. </p>

This indicates that while the Lord is judging, we should wait for Him in the path of His judging. While the Lord is chastening us, we need to learn something of Him and find out the lesson that the Lord would give us. However, some saints, after being chastened by the Lord, seem to learn nothing. They waste both their time and the Lord’s chastening. Whenever we are chastened by the Lord, we need to learn something of Him. This is to wait for Him in the path of His judgment. </p>

The northern kingdom is often represented by Ephraim, and the southern kingdom by Jerusalem. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53633" data-verses="Isaiah 28:1">chapter twenty-eight</span> we see that Jehovah’s judgment over Ephraim’s drunkards issues in Jehovah’s restoration and ushers in the trustworthy Christ.

With the hypocritical worship spoken of in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53640" data-verses="Isaiah 29:1">Isaiah 29</span>, there is vanity but no reality, blindness but no wisdom. Through His incarnation Christ brought to us the very reality of the universe—the Triune God, the Divine Trinity, embodied in a person, Jesus Christ. If we removed the Divine Trinity from the universe, it would become nothing. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> the entire universe, only the Divine Trinity is real, and the Divine Trinity has been embodied in a man named Jesus.

This wisdom is the embodied reality—the Divine Trinity in Christ—in our realization. When we realize the embodied Divine Trinity in Christ, this brings us wisdom.

<p data-content-id="sAUuh7LlqXNG6AROi1cs69k6b5DZjzfI_chqB-doKR4QVigm2H8Zow2WVVIv3a7pb"> Isaiah had a divine way of thinking, a divine philosophy, within him when he wrote his book. This divine philosophy included God’s chastisement of Israel, His judgment upon the nations, the restoration of Israel, the restoration of the created yet fallen things, and the ushering in of the all-inclusive Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="wl8xsYLSuZClCRTKGBd4nFHQIlHmYEkQnLlaHP7tDTdBXGw5RHixpzekYzX350c8O"> At first, God “hired” Israel to be His testimony, His witness. But Israel failed God. Then God hired the many nations around Israel to chastise His chosen people. However, they did not do this according to what God had in His heart. They chastised Israel excessively, and this offended God. As a result, God came in to “fire” both the children of Israel and the surrounding nations. This matter was deeply impressed upon Isaiah. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQhDs-iNd9dq5o_tTmhDnPDJvkq7ZljdgsiBluha_pnPIx6DSXOLgZBEdGTR9gpyK"> God’s chastisement of Israel and His judgment upon the nations who exercised excessive action upon Israel issues in three things: 1) Israel is brought back to God; 2) the created things are restored; and 3) the all-inclusive Christ is ushered in. The restoration of the created yet fallen things goes along with Israel’s return to God. God intends to restore the created and fallen things, but there is the need for Israel to usher in this restoration. When Israel turns to God, there will be the restoration of all things. Then the all-inclusive Christ will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> ushered in. This is the divine philosophy in the book of Isaiah. </p>
<p data-content-id="mXH6jwyIvlIyW-cyafhni1XFK-33SIuk3R5HgJphRIFLi_LVDUGLN4j-Olw06YPmP"> This divine philosophy applies to us today. No matter who we are and what our race, culture, or nationality may be, we all are utter failures as far as God is concerned. This kind of realization will cause us to turn to God. Our success never causes us to turn to God. But when we look at our failures, we are humbled, we realize that we have a need, and we repent, confessing that we are hopeless. Although we may not know what we need, we know that we need something. Eventually, the all-inclusive Christ comes in to meet our need. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZQ5ZOI_t6lKDRPvgSN9ezlyE-AC8cJuDm5UqbcECOt5pUvu52v_X7zsCFrdRWWuEC"> Especially in the first thirty-nine chapters of his prophecy, Isaiah’s thought is focused on God’s chastisement issuing in a return to God and bringing in the restoration and the all-inclusive Christ. This is the logic, the spiritual and heavenly philosophy, that dominates the book of Isaiah. Although this is not clearly written, it is nevertheless the basic and governing principle of Isaiah’s writing. I hope that we will all see this crucial matter and keep it in mind as we turn to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53712" data-verses="Isaiah 30:1">chapters thirty and thirty-one</span>, where we will see that Jehovah’s dealing with Israel’s reliance on Egypt and His dealing with the nations issue in Israel’s turn to Him and in His return to Israel with the restoration. </p>

These libations were drink offerings which the Gentiles poured out to their idols. When two parties or nations made an alliance or formed a league, they would <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> pour a libation upon the earth to indicate that they had made an alliance. Israel had formed such an alliance with Egypt. Therefore, the refuge of Pharaoh will be their shame, and shelter in the shadow of Egypt, their humiliation. The people of Egypt cannot be a help or a profit to them but rather a shame and also a reproach (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53716" data-verses="Isaiah 30:3-5">vv. 3-5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="jjSUu6s5jiQAdG86BLWF1ZqzCMhWt-ISNusTXt7-raNbeRDPHn5I4AQg6gI3v-nu9"> In typology Egypt signifies the world.

Abraham did this (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53718" data-verses="Genesis 12:10">Gen. 12:10</span>). Today, when Christians become low, they often go to the world. To go to Egypt, to rely upon Egypt, or to make an association with Egypt is sin. To go to the world or to rely upon the world can never be a profit, glory, or help to us. It always issues in humiliation, shame, and reproach (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53719" data-verses="Isaiah 30:5">Isa. 30:5</span>). I have seen a good number of saints who became unhappy with the church life and turned to the world. Then they went into the world, and eventually they stayed in the world.

Apart from the law, God’s people in the Old Testament did not have any instruction.

<p data-content-id="pmSZylHOI91d7TIxcig47jmQwjeeWukG32pyqBYiqnoT2DYbTm6RM9vdoNBvActy1"> In this message we will consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53751" data-verses="Isaiah 32:1">chapters thirty-two through thirty-five</span>. Before we come to these chapters, I would like to say a word concerning the main thought of the book of Isaiah. </p>
<p data-content-id="v8bXBUaOMzEw-TiNL5ZinXlcX97nmg86AjAc50n7OsvDdfqaWEWKpdyEo4hVS0NFL"> The divine revelation in Isaiah concerns God’s economy, to have Christ as the centrality and universality of God’s great move. God’s great move is a great wheel, having a hub, a rim, and spokes between the two. Christ is the centrality—the hub—and the universality—the rim with all the spokes. Christ is everything in God’s move. This is the main thought of this book. </p>
<p data-content-id="WJ5aP-FOAwwmtqgyigv9qzgwRz5_2hxzBbpu9V9IDxIMpTzB5bTDMszy1Pz0KJtzc"> To understand the book of Isaiah, we need to have the view from the entire sixty-six books of the Bible. Isaiah is of two portions. The first portion includes <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53752" data-verses="Isaiah 1:1">chapters one through thirty-nine</span>, and the second portion includes <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53753" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">chapters forty through sixty-six</span>. The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah correspond to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament. The last twenty-seven chapters correspond to the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. The New Testament begins with John the Baptist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53754" data-verses="Mark 1:1-3">Mark 1:1-3</span>), and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53755" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Isaiah 40</span> also begins with John the Baptist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53756" data-verses="Isaiah 40:3">v. 3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="2jaApwQLvdqGiLTlJvah4WQHW7lD7UKdp6WAgQbms_jfk-21iNUPdC_JsG6KRUu0A"> The first part of Isaiah concerns the chastisement of God’s dear people and the punishment of the nations to bring in a turn among God’s people. To have a turn to fulfill God’s purpose, we need to realize that we have been discharged, “fired,” by God. Today, our practical God, our God in our daily living, is Christ. As descendants of Adam, as those created <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> by God, we want to know God, worship Him, do His will, please Him, and fulfill the desire of His heart. This is right, for God wants us to be a good human being and one who fulfills His purpose. But God never planned or arranged in His eternal economy that we should do this by ourselves. He wants us to do it by Him. He wants us to let Him do it in us, by us, and through us. For example, as one who has been loving the Lord for many years, I can testify that the hardest thing for us Christians to overcome is our temper. God, however, does not want us to overcome our temper. We should neither lose our temper nor try to overcome it. Instead, we need to resign, give up, have a turn from trying to overcome our temper, and let Christ come in to be the temper-overcomer. The real spiritual turn is to resign from the position of one who is trying to be a proper human being. We need to resign from what we want to do. This is Isaiah’s thought and logic. </p>

According to the Bible, this sacrifice in Bozrah and slaughter in the land of Edom will be fulfilled in full in the great war at Armageddon, which will take place in a <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> region that extends to Bozrah. Jehovah has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for Zion’s contention (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53770" data-verses="Isaiah 34:8">v. 8</span>).

First, in this message, we need to see some crucial matters regarding the person of King Hezekiah. Then in the next message we will consider the details of these four chapters, including Hezekiah’s seeking after Jehovah for his situation, Hezekiah’s seeking after Jehovah for his health, and Hezekiah’s failure in the enjoyment of the peaceful situation and sound health. </p>

The first thirty-five chapters to this book cover God’s loving chastisement on His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment on the nations, in order that His elect might have a turn to Him so that the created things might be restored and that the all-inclusive Christ might be brought in. At this point, everyone and everything have been fired by God, and Christ, the only one who is qualified, is here. Why, after covering these matters, does Isaiah spend four chapters to speak of a small part of the life of one person? After spending much time to consider this matter, I believe that the Lord has shown me the reason. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53792" data-verses="Isaiah 36:1">chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine</span>, Isaiah gives us an example in the person of Hezekiah, the king of Judah. We may say that in the first thirty-five chapters of his prophecy Isaiah gives us the principle and that in the next four chapters he gives us an example. <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="sAUuh7LlqXNG6AROi1cs09krQ5DZjzfI_chqB-doKR4QVigm2H8Zow2WVVIv3a7pb"> After reading these chapters, it is good to consider what kind of person Hezekiah was. Hezekiah was a godly man, but I would not say that he was a man of God, a God-man. When he was threatened by Sennacherib king of Assyria and was insulted by the word of the king’s servant, Hezekiah, in his suffering, brought the trouble to the Lord and offered to Him a very good prayer (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53793" data-verses="Isaiah 36:1-20">36:1-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53794" data-verses="Isaiah 37:9-20">37:9-20</span>). Since Hezekiah was the king appointed by God and since he was a godly person, God did something for him. God answered his prayer and performed one of the greatest miracles in human history, killing one hundred eighty-five thousand Assyrians in one night (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53795" data-verses="Isaiah 37:22-38">37:22-38</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wl8xsYLSuZClCRTKGBd4pFHNAlHmYEkQnLlaHP7tDTdBXGw5RHixpzekYzX350c8O">God Adding Fifteen Years to Hezekiah’s Life</h2><p data-content-id="LQhDs-iNd9dq5o_tTmhDpPDQmkq7ZljdgsiBluha_pnPIx6DSXOLgZBEdGTR9gpyK"> After Hezekiah received this miraculous deliverance, he became mortally ill. Isaiah came to him and said, “Thus says Jehovah, Put your house in order, for you are about to die and will not live” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53796" data-verses="Isaiah 38:1">38:1</span>). Then Hezekiah again prayed a very godly prayer, saying, “O Jehovah, please remember how I have walked before You in truth, with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in Your sight” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53797" data-verses="Isaiah 38:3">v. 3</span>). God heard Hezekiah’s prayer and answered it by healing him and saying, through Isaiah, that He would add fifteen years to his life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53798" data-verses="Isaiah 38:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="mXH6jwyIvlIyW-cyafhns1XgE-33SIuk3R5HgJphRIFLi_LVDUGLN4j-Olw06YPmP"> The number of years added to Hezekiah’s life is significant. When Hezekiah became mortally ill, he was a middle-aged man, perhaps about forty years old. For God to give him another fifteen years meant that he would live until the age of approximately fifty-five. Since God was willing to heal Hezekiah, why did He not give him another thirty years and allow him to reach the age of seventy? I believe that the reason God extended Hezekiah’s life by only fifteen years was that, in the sight of God, Hezekiah was not a person who could be trusted to carry out God’s purpose. Had Hezekiah been permitted to live longer, he might have caused even <span class="pg" data-page-id="127" id="127">[127]</span> more trouble to God’s kingdom than he did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53799" data-verses="Isaiah 39:1">chapter thirty-nine</span>. During his last fifteen years, Hezekiah made a mistake that was so serious that it caused God’s kingdom on earth to be lost. </p>

His prayers indicated that he had a sober mind and was quite wise. However, after he was healed by God, he did something foolish when visitors from Babylon came to him with a gift. Receiving the gift, he showed the visitors his treasury, his whole armory, and everything in his dominion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53801" data-verses="Isaiah 39:2">v. 2</span>). This was a foolish act and a great mistake. The showing of these riches, which had been accumulated by his fathers since the time of David and Solomon, became a temptation to the king of Babylon. A little over one hundred years later, the king of Babylon came and took away these riches. Hezekiah did not consider his action carefully, nor did he pray about it. He should have been careful, knowing that Babylon was Judah’s enemy and that sooner or later the Babylonian army would come to destroy him. However, Hezekiah did not take thought concerning what the king of Babylon might do. This shows that Hezekiah was hasty and not very considerate or careful. </p>

Actually Hezekiah was very selfish. This is proved by the way he responded to Isaiah’s word to him in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53802" data-verses="Isaiah 39:5-7">39:5-7</span>. “Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts: Behold, the days are coming when everything which is in your house and which your fathers have laid up as a treasure unto this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left, says Jehovah. And they will take away some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, and they will become eunuches in the palace of the king of Babylon.” When Hezekiah heard this, he said to Isaiah, “The word of Jehovah which you have spoken is good....For there will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="128" id="128">[128]</span> peace and truth in my days” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53803" data-verses="Isaiah 39:8">v. 8</span>). This indicates that Hezekiah was selfish. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKUKLH45yBJtdHW2HQzjDav_wma_4HlFtt1ofnLxcnhYFoycnBqCFUmBqa3kjcWVb"> Furthermore, Hezekiah was the king not of a worldly kingdom but of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of Judah was actually God’s kingdom on earth, and Hezekiah should not have regarded it as his own kingdom. For Hezekiah to lose his kingdom was a small thing, but for God to lose His kingdom was a great thing. Hezekiah’s response in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53804" data-verses="Isaiah 39:8">verse 8</span> indicates that he had no thought for God and God’s kingdom, nor did he care even for his own children. He was altogether for himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="-waEYRv93EhPN6GvKzVSJqUI5US28tMkU59WnoJRQOgj-h7qhd8NKNqqlIlNCrxzR"> If we do not have the proper view of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53805" data-verses="Isaiah 36:1">chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine</span>, we may think that Hezekiah was quite good. He faced two great problems—the invasion from Assyria and mortal illness—and dealt with them in a way that seemed to be godly. We may feel, therefore, that if we could handle problems in Hezekiah’s way, we also would be quite good. However, in giving us the pattern found in these chapters, Isaiah shows us how a person such as Hezekiah, who was appointed a king in God’s kingdom, who was godly, and who prayed and received miraculous answers from God, eventually became not a success but a failure. He failed because of his self-glory and self-interest. He was full of self and was not able to restrict the self. Being a selfish person, he made a great mistake, became a failure, and was eventually fired by God. </p>

Would we be like Hezekiah, who was hasty and was so much for himself? As we consider this matter, we must learn to say, “Lord, I would not be any kind of person; I would just be nothing. I would have You as my person and my life, as the One who lives in me that I may live You. If I want to be anything, I want to be a person like this.” If we would all pray such a prayer, the Lord’s recovery would have a great revival. </p>

After that, the old creation remains until it is terminated at the end of the millennium. The end of the thousand-year kingdom will be the termination of the old creation as well as the completion, the consummation, of the new creation, as signified by the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53846" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Rev. 21:1-2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="cle8-utSykwjPzf3VIH5NytXesDpMuIK_KMD9zOpCjKe9hViDIjmiZxkpY6OjHik2"> History tells us that Isaiah wrote his book during two or three periods of time. I believe that the second part of his prophecy was written at a time different from the first part. </p>
<p data-content-id="YR_U7a4zFL6KVYMurXead5zD1j379BuHa-797b249EFRSudskQm1EB4lEmOGUz8Me"> The second part begins with a word of comfort spoken to the heart of Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53847" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1-2">Isa. 40:1-2</span>). The fact that this word is spoken to the heart means that it is concerned not with the outer man but with the inner man. In this chapter, the speaking of the word of comfort to the heart of Jerusalem is actually the announcing of the gospel. Thus, we <span class="pg" data-page-id="138" id="138">[138]</span> may understand the word <em>comfort</em> as meaning the preaching of the gospel. </p>
<p data-content-id="EDD4W4Bi8P_kanjIZpkPwtyBcj3m-fMlSC_LE2PNygKjPm1E-k1y3WoflKMCat_Eg"> The first thing announced in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53848" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Isaiah 40</span> is the coming of John the Baptist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53849" data-verses="Isaiah 40:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). Immediately after this is the appearing of Christ as the glory of Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53850" data-verses="Isaiah 40:5">v. 5</span>). The glory of Jehovah is the center of the gospel for the new creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53851" data-verses="2Corinthians 4:4-6">2 Cor. 4:4-6</span>). Christ is the effulgence of God’s glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53852" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Heb. 1:3</span>), and this effulgence is like the shining of the sun. The New Testament tells us that Christ’s first coming was the rising of the sun (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53853" data-verses="Luke 1:78">Luke 1:78</span>).

The word of God is actually Christ as the gospel of God. This word is abiding, and as the word of life, it is also living. All men of flesh, all withering and fading human beings, should receive Christ, the glory of God, who comes to people as the living and abiding word of God. Those who receive Christ as this word of God will be regenerated that they may have eternal life to live forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53856" data-verses="1Peter 1:23">1 Pet. 1:23</span>). </p>

For us to wait on God means that we “fire” ourselves, that is, that we stop ourselves with our living, doing, and activity and receive Christ as our replacement. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53858" data-verses="Isaiah 40:31">Verse 31</span> says that such a waiting one will mount up with wings like eagles, signifying the resurrection power of Christ. He will not only walk and run—he will also soar in the heavens, far above every earthly frustration. This is a transformed person. Therefore, in this chapter we have the announcing of the gospel (corresponding to the four Gospels), salvation through regeneration (corresponding to the Acts), and transformation (corresponding to the Epistles). </p>
<p data-content-id="-waEYRv93EhPN6GvKzVeBqUE7US28tMkU59WnoJRQOgj-h7qhd8NKNqqlIlNCrxzR"> I believe that Isaiah wrote this chapter to give us a comparison between Hezekiah, a godly man who was still in the old creation, and a regenerated and transformed person <span class="pg" data-page-id="139" id="139">[139]</span> in the new creation. As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53859" data-verses="Isaiah 36:1">chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine</span> indicate, no matter how good Hezekiah was, he was still in the old creation, and thus he was fired by God. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53860" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">chapter forty</span> we see a different kind of person—one who is regenerated and transformed, one who has been fired, who has taken God in Christ as his replacement, and who is now continually waiting upon the Lord. Such a person “will mount up with wings like eagles.” The apostle Paul is the best representative of the kind of person described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53861" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Isaiah 40</span>. Let us consider the difference between Hezekiah and Paul and ask ourselves whether we will be like Hezekiah or like Paul. May we all be like Paul, who was absolutely in the new creation. With him, the old creation had been terminated, fired, and replaced, and now the new creation is here with Christ. </p>

A testament is a covenant, a signed agreement, that has become a will in which certain things are passed on to the heirs. The covenant is the agreement between God and us. Through the death of Christ, the covenant became a testament, a will. Now in His resurrection Christ executes, enforces, this testament. According to the book of Isaiah, the covenant, which has become the testament, is Christ Himself. Thus, we first have the covenant, the covenant becomes the testament, and the testament is Christ. Christ has not only given us the testament—He Himself is the testament and the reality of everything contained in it. For example, two items in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="148" id="148">[148]</span> testament are life and strength. Today, Christ is our eternal life, and He is our strength. </p>

In His ministry the Lord did not strive with others, and He did not promote Himself. He did not seek to make Himself known to people on the streets. In a sense He was very hidden.

<p data-content-id="zoZ_fVBVjDeBvKX_n-FHLXffrcTuqa6rTyl33t2pXpVXLDXjhMeTZgmHCmZP9ElRh"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53966" data-verses="Isaiah 41:8">41:8</span> Israel is called God’s servant. Israel’s being God’s servant is related to God’s desire in His economy to have a corporate expression of Himself for His glory. God wants such a corporate expression so that He may be glorified. This is the reason <span class="verse" data-ref-id="53967" data-verses="Isaiah 43:7">43:7</span> says that God created, formed, and made Israel for His glory. God’s glory can be expressed only by a group of people. Israel is God’s servant in the sense of fulfilling God’s purpose to have a corporate expression for His glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="a2P39prM6EX_HLBQX5hl6O5Ms-6UKpnpKVeApXqgSU0gO2Ybw4I7I1oV3UtONDpf6"> Cyrus was also a servant of God. Because Cyrus was used by God and did many things for God, he was God’s servant. God needed someone to defeat Babylon, His enemy, which had captured His people and destroyed the temple. Cyrus was used by God to subdue Babylon. Having gained dominion over Babylon, Cyrus, according to God’s desire and at the expiration of Israel’s seventy years of captivity, then declared the release of Israel from captivity. Cyrus also issued a decree allowing the Jews to rebuild their temple in Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="53968" data-verses="Ezra 1:2-3">Ezra 1:2-3</span>). In doing these things, Cyrus was surely one with Christ as a servant of Jehovah. These three matters—the <span class="pg" data-page-id="153" id="153">[153]</span> defeat of Babylon, the release of Israel, and the decree concerning the rebuilding of the temple—were great matters in the fulfillment of God’s economy at that time. These three things are also types, signifying Christ’s defeating Satan, releasing us from captivity, and building up the church as the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="bv2WaUA81d0xeJoiPxHJeaWsWW0RR1MCdnj3LsH-Yzx1ju2wy_7WNDc0ePPJjn9A-"> It is easy for us to realize that Cyrus was one with Christ as God’s servant, but it is difficult for us to realize this regarding Israel. We need to see, therefore, that, apart from Israel, Cyrus could not have done anything as God’s servant. For instance, Cyrus released the captives, but who were the captives? The captives were the people of Israel, the people who were to be used by God to express Him in a corporate way for His glorification. In this sense, Israel was one with Christ as God’s servant. The servant of Jehovah is corporate, and Israel, having been released by Cyrus, was part of this corporate servant. </p>
<p data-content-id="qLcT4wgKp4K96nzb-VA69uxFfKCVCtmQ-ddLWU3OUWeWKVVKtz4shHE650_vNmZDU"> The point we would emphasize here is that in God’s economy Christ is everything. He is the releasing One, typified by Cyrus, and He is also the released One, typified by Israel. Typically speaking, both Cyrus as the releasing one and Israel as the released ones are parts of Christ, who is the reality of everything in God’s move, the centrality and the universality of the great wheel of God’s move. </p>
<p data-content-id="yL2Ky-HIjJpVThJMPlO7cwIiWB9B7hyN5AS9cHjRMy64K2UMPG0rJxFZdOU2W4lcc"> Today the church is the testimony of God in the sense of being one with Christ as the testimony of God. It is in being such a testimony that the church serves God. For this reason, all God’s elect can be considered servants of God with Christ for the expression of God’s glory. The glorification of God is the purpose of our service. The highest service we can render to God is to express His glory. </p>

THE IDOLS OF BABYLON<br/>BEING POWERLESS AND USELESS</h2><p data-content-id="pmSZylHOI91d7TIxcig03jmgwjeeWukG32pyqBYiqnoT2DYbTm6RM9vdoNBvActy1"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54027" data-verses="Isaiah 46:1-2">46:1-2</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54028" data-verses="Isaiah 46:5-7">5-7</span>, the idols of Babylon are powerless and useless and cannot be compared to Jehovah. Furthermore, the idols are a burden for Israel to carry in their coming captivity. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54029" data-verses="Isaiah 46:1-2">46:1 and 2</span> say, “Bel has bowed down; Nebo stoops; / Their idols are on beasts and cattle; / The things which you carry are a burden, / A load for a weary beast. / They stoop and have bowed down together; / They are not able to escape the burden; / But they themselves have gone into captivity.” Bel was one of the gods of the Babylonians, supposed by some to be the Babylonian name of Baal. </p>
<p data-content-id="t8bnQrQm6FdShy-EgcXrSYG25TTSXQfcZGteWHR3UQg52r_TcQ6cbm7M6CShPFDoa"> Instead of helping the people of Israel, the idols were a burden to them, for the people had to carry them. When Israel was captured by the Babylonians, God’s people still would not give up their idols and had to carry them from the good land to Babylon. In these verses, Isaiah, speaking somewhat <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> in a mocking way, seemed to be saying, “You people of Israel have made idols for yourselves, but they will not do anything for you. One day you will be captured, and you will have to carry your idols with you as a burden into captivity.” </p>
<p data-content-id="hzY1tM_vwP6yiexhKU080WcLS00OQ2FHJHueHLL0JnTSgM-pFcVRMqavXK50VgQkc"> Anything that replaces God or occupies the position of God is an idol as a burden to the worshipper. Today’s human society encourages people to make idols. A person, education, or a high position with a company can all become idols to us. Eventually, every idol will not help us but instead will become a burden that we must carry. </p>

This captivity proved to them that all the idols are powerless, useless, and unable to do anything, and that only Jehovah, the God whom their forefathers worshipped, is the genuine God. He alone is able to save. </p>

THE THREE PERSONS OF THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH</h2><p data-content-id="J5yVgcn2hVxwlmacvRVNmMmDICGRJu4rHGOQehPnQIwJNdnqBbZfew_d3gwtKGTwq"> In order to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54068" data-verses="Isaiah 49:1">Isaiah 49</span>, we need to see the three persons of the servant of Jehovah—Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54069" data-verses="Isaiah 49:5-9">vv. 5-9a</span>), Isaiah the prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54070" data-verses="Isaiah 49:1-4">vv. 1-4</span>), and Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54071" data-verses="Isaiah 49:3">v. 3</span>). Both Isaiah the prophet and Israel consummate in Christ. All three are one servant. First, all are Israel. Israel, of course, is Israel, Isaiah was an Israelite, and Jesus Christ was a typical Israelite. Thus, as Israelites they all are one. Second, as a whole, Israel was God’s servant, His witness, in the Old Testament. Isaiah as a part of Israel also was a servant of Jehovah. In the New Testament Christ is unveiled as the Servant of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54072" data-verses="Mark 10:45">Mark 10:45</span>) and His Witness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54073" data-verses="Revelation 1:5">Rev. 1:5</span>). This again shows the oneness of Isaiah, Israel, and Christ as servants of Jehovah. But in the New Testament, our oneness with Christ as servants of God is seen more clearly, because the New Testament says that we are in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54074" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>). Together we are one corporate Christ. Since we are in this corporate <span class="pg" data-page-id="168" id="168">[168]</span> Christ, and Christ is the Servant of God, we also are one servant of God, one witness of God. This is God’s eternal view, and this is the view we need to have in order to understand <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54075" data-verses="Isaiah 49:1">Isaiah 49—50</span>. </p>

Isaiah spoke for God, but Christ spoke for God much more. In His ministry on earth, the main thing He did was speak for God. Even after He ascended to the heavens, He continued to speak, for He spoke in the speaking of the apostles. The Epistles of Paul, for example, are a continuation of Christ’s speaking. </p>

In the servant mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54087" data-verses="Isaiah 49:3">Isaiah 49:3</span>, Jehovah will be glorified. This typifies that God is glorified in Christ as the Israel of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54088" data-verses="John 13:31">John 13:31b</span>). </p>

Jehovah says to Him, “Kings will see and arise, / And princes will bow down; / Because of Jehovah, who is faithful, / The Holy One of Israel, who has chosen You.” Christ was subjected to tyrants when He stood before Pilate and submitted to him. He, the Creator, was thus subject to a created human being. To this One who was subjected to tyrants such as Herod and Pilate, kings will arise and princes will bow down because Jehovah, who is faithful, has chosen Him. </p>

Jehovah Giving Him<br/>as a Covenant of the People</h2><p data-content-id="SmYb8X5DkMX1is5fBiy3PEGT2TJreiRZgwNut5F5ur9fZrkZrs1dBJeO_jB-pFaTl"> “Thus says Jehovah, / In an acceptable time I have answered You, / And in a day of salvation I have helped You; / And I will preserve You and give You for a covenant of the people, / To restore the land, to apportion the desolate inheritances, / To say to the prisoners, Come forth, / To say to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54093" data-verses="Isaiah 49:8-9">vv. 8-9a</span>). Here we see that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah has been given as a covenant of the people. A covenant is a signed agreement between two parties, in which promises are made. A covenant becomes a will upon the death of the covenanting party. In a will someone may promise to give all his riches to another person. The will becomes the title deed of all those riches. But if there are no actual riches to receive, the will is <span class="pg" data-page-id="171" id="171">[171]</span> meaningless. Christ is our will, our covenant, and He is all the riches given to us in the will. The Bible is a will that mentions many wonderful items that are to be our portion. But without Christ as the reality, the Bible would be only empty pages. Christ is the reality of the items given as bequests in the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="gscF4m7-lUlMCcyyYPNr9PRlmnyTDtR8LWYqxUMZF3D3BVVmY2BWD0HZjB0SqwQxg"> Christ is given as a covenant to restore the land. To restore the land is to accomplish something of God’s economy concerning His kingdom. The restoring of the land is mainly for the kingdom of God, which will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="evZWGvKilH-_j1AxvIVqhseLe7V6_icIqi73-4obRHEd5xAVW1XeP2quVKqJ44fBo"> In our experience of Christ today, to restore the land means to have the land enlarged or expanded. Christ is the land. To experience Christ as the expanding land is to occupy Christ as the land for the building up of God’s kingdom that His temple, His testimony, may be established. If we have only the Bible but lack the experience of Christ as the reality, we do not have the feeling that Christ as the land is expanding. But if we have the Bible with the experiences of Christ, we sense that Christ as the land is expanding. The more we experience Christ, the more we sense that Christ is expanding within us. The more we experience Christ in this way, the more God’s kingdom is established with God’s temple as His testimony. </p>

This revelation includes the fact that God has an enemy—Satan. As God’s adversary, Satan is always rejecting God, opposing God, and doing whatever he can to frustrate God from accomplishing His economy. This opposition to God’s economy indicates that there is a war raging in the universe between God and Satan. </p>

These vessels continued to exist, but they were marred. Furthermore, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, captured the people of high rank in Israel, including the royal family, and forced them to worship his god in Babylon. Hence, the worship of God was damaged and marred by Babylon. This shows that Babylonian politics went together with Babylonian religion. </p>

For Christ to grow up like a tender plant before Jehovah means that Christ grew up before Him in His humanity. In His divinity Christ has always been perfect and complete, and thus there was no need for Him to grow in His divinity. His growth took place in His humanity. First He was a child, and then He grew into boyhood and eventually into manhood. Having become perfected and completed in His humanity, at the age of thirty He came forth to minister for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="lRnGBbKnFFwheo_id-wgEHn4nZ8gVcFhd5jkSJRN7ha8wanPDUFPhcvoB8-OKcwsT"> Christ grew up not only like a tender plant but also like a root out of dry ground. The words <em>dry ground</em> signify a difficult environment. For the Lord Jesus, this dry ground included the poor home of Joseph and Mary, the despised city of Nazareth, and the despised region of Galilee. Like a root out of dry ground, Christ grew up in the midst of hard circumstances. </p>

The Hebrew word translated <em>sorrows</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54176" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3-4">verses 3 and 4</span> literally means pains, either physical or mental. According to Keil and Delitzsch, Christ was a “man whose chief distinction was, that His life was one of constant painful endurance.” He, as a man of sorrows, was a despised person. </p>

This <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> means that He died not for Himself but for us. He died in our place. Christ’s death was not a martyrdom; Christ was put to death by God for us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54179" data-verses="Isaiah 53:4">v. 4b</span>). Thus, His death was a vicarious death. </p>

These verses use the words <em>sicknesses</em> and <em>sorrows</em> along with <em>transgressions</em> and <em>iniquities</em> (that is, sins). This raises a question: Do our sicknesses and sorrows need Christ’s redemption? Sicknesses and sorrows are mentioned with transgressions and iniquities because our sicknesses and sorrows come from one thing—sin. If we had never sinned, we could never be sick and we would have no sorrow. Our transgressions and sins surely need Christ’s redemption. Since our sicknesses and sorrows come from sin, they also need Christ’s redemption. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54181" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> we are told clearly that Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows in His vicarious death. Therefore, when we are sick, it is proper for us to pray, “Lord, because in Your death for me You bore my sicknesses, I do have the ground to ask You to take my sickness away.” </p>

First, Christ was persecuted and then He was judged. By these two things He was taken away. </p>
<p data-content-id="gscF4m7-lUlMCcyyYPNr_PRhknyTDtR8LWYqxUMZF3D3BVVmY2BWD0HZjB0SqwQxg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54184" data-verses="Isaiah 53:8">Verse 8b</span> goes on to say, “And as for His generation, who among them had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living / For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?” This means that no one understood that it was for us that Christ suffered persecution and judgment and died. Even those who were with the Lord Jesus when He was dying on the cross did not understand that He was dying for them. The stroke that should have been the due of God’s people fell on Him. He suffered death for us. </p>

<p data-content-id="5cfSks8f9T4wzhajEBGe2gl_PKabj3mMDfXnmEjpE8oTiQFZRNSodjL8n4i8NSKGW"> This verse continues with the phrase, “If You make His soul an offering for sin.” The Hebrew can also be rendered “His soul would make an offering for sin.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54186" data-verses="Leviticus 4:1-2">Leviticus 4 and 5</span> indicate that the trespass offering may be regarded as part of the sin offering.

Redemption is thus for the sin, including the trespasses, of fallen man. While Christ was on the cross, God was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief, in order to make Him an offering for sin. This is a further indication that Christ died a vicarious death for the purpose of accomplishing redemption for us. </p>

Likewise, if God was pleased to put Him to death, and He was not willing to die, then His death would not have been a vicarious death. <span class="pg" data-page-id="185" id="185">[185]</span> The vicarious death of Christ depends on God’s being pleased to put Him to death and on Christ’s being willing to die in such a way. Moreover, if Christ had sinned, His death could not be counted as a vicarious death; He would have had to die for Himself, and He could not have died for us. </p>
<p data-content-id="hzY1tM_vwP6yiexhKU083WcDS00OQ2FHJHueHLL0JnTSgM-pFcVRMqavXK50VgQkc"> Isaiah’s writing in this chapter presents a clear defense in the heavenly court, testifying that God was pleased to put Christ to death, that Christ was willing to die for others, and that He was altogether sinless (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54190" data-verses="Isaiah 53:9">v. 9</span>).

Water is also mentioned at the end of the first section of this book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54227" data-verses="Isaiah 12:3">12:3</span>). This indicates that in the book of Isaiah, God always considers that He is our salvation as living water. In His salvation God gives Himself to us as our portion for our enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="5cfSks8f9T4wzhajEBGe5glWNKabj3mMDfXnmEjpE8oTiQFZRNSodjL8n4i8NSKGW"> We live by three things: air, water, and food. Air is for our breathing, water is for our drinking, and food is for our eating. Spiritually speaking, of these three things, water is the most crucial. Air actually contains water, and water conveys spiritual food. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54228" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Revelation 22:1 and 2</span>, the tree of life (food) grows in the river of water of life. Thus, water and food go together. Our eating should always be matched by our drinking. </p>

The word <em>waters</em> here reveals that we may enjoy God not just in one aspect but in many aspects. The thought here is similar to that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54230" data-verses="John 7:38">John 7:38</span>. In that verse the Lord Jesus says, “He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.” These rivers are the many flows of the different aspects of the divine life, such as love, light, grace, power, strength, holiness, and righteousness. <span class="pg" data-page-id="192" id="192">[192]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="mXH6jwyIvlIyW-cyafhrt1XgA-33SIuk3R5HgJphRIFLi_LVDUGLN4j-Olw06YPmP"> The book of Isaiah shows us that our God may become our enjoyment through our continual drinking of Him. However, we are sinners, and in order to drink of God, we need a proper, adequate, and complete redemption. This redemption is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54231" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">chapter fifty-three</span>, a chapter which reveals more of the dynamic redemption of Christ than any other chapter in the Bible. The dynamic redemption accomplished by Christ is the security not only to Israel but also to the seed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54232" data-verses="Isaiah 53:10">53:10</span>), which is the church as the corporate Body of the resurrected Christ. </p>

The call here is like that at the end of the Bible: “The Spirit and the bride say, Come!...he who wills, let him take the water of life freely” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54235" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Rev. 22:17</span>). The waters in these two portions of the Word are our redeeming God, the very God who accomplished redemption for us through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. As we will see, these waters are both the eternal covenant and the sure mercies shown to David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54236" data-verses="Isaiah 55:3">Isa. 55:3</span>). God’s way and God’s thought (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54237" data-verses="Isaiah 55:8">v. 8</span>) are that we would come to drink of Him. </p>

on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54247" data-verses="Acts 13:34">verse 34</span> there), the sure mercies shown to David are Christ Himself in resurrection. Whereas Isaiah speaks of “the sure mercies,” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54248" data-verses="Acts 13:34">Acts 13:34</span> speaks of “the holy and faithful things.” The Hebrew word for <em>mercies (chesed)</em> implies the notion of holiness. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54249" data-verses="Acts 13:34">Acts 13:34</span> Paul interprets the sure mercies as the holy and faithful things, and then he goes on to indicate that these things are the resurrected Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="WJ5aP-FOAwwmtqgyigvxqzgpSz5_2hxzBbpu9V9IDxIMpTzB5bTDMszy1Pz0KJtzc"> In Christ as the sure mercies, God reaches us in His grace to be our enjoyment. The New Testament reveals that the incarnated God brings us grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54250" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54251" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54252" data-verses="John 1:16-17">16-17</span>). Grace is actually God Himself for our enjoyment. In order to receive this grace, we need to be in the right position. However, as sinners full of iniquities, we were not in such a position. Thus, there was the need for mercy, which reaches farther than grace and which brings us into the position to receive grace. Because our situation was miserable and could not match God’s grace, Christ not only took the step of incarnation to bring God as grace to us, but He also took a further step of death and resurrection in order to become the sure mercies to us in resurrection. Through His death and resurrection, <span class="pg" data-page-id="194" id="194">[194]</span> Christ, the embodiment of God’s grace, became the sure mercies, and through these mercies we are now in the proper position to match God and to receive Him as grace. This is what Isaiah prophesied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54253" data-verses="Isaiah 55:1">chapter fifty-five</span>, and this is what Paul meant in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54254" data-verses="Acts 13:1">Acts 13</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="2jaApwQLvdqGiLTlJvat4WQuc7lD7UKdp6WAgQbms_jfk-21iNUPdC_JsG6KRUu0A"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54255" data-verses="Isaiah 55:4">Isaiah 55:4</span> says, “Behold, I have given him as a witness to the peoples, / A leader and a commander to the peoples.” This indicates that Christ is not only the sure mercies shown to David but also the real Witness, Leader, and Commander. He is the universal Commander in Chief. </p>

This is to come to the Lord in order to drink of Him. “Call upon Him while He is near” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54259" data-verses="Isaiah 55:6">v. 6b</span>). This is the way to drink.

<p data-content-id="9TrCf1KejPoZVajTCqVzZOtuwP6YYza-lMQd7ygpmSZCaXclF4ZegVoF3Vug8RryN"> In the foregoing message we saw that the real meaning of keeping the Sabbath is that we cease from our doing, stop our work, and enjoy what the Lord has done for us, drinking of Him as the waters. In the Old Testament, to keep the Sabbath was not to do any work but to remember what God had done in His creation. In the New Testament, to keep the Sabbath is to believe in the Lord Jesus. To believe in Christ is actually to be “fired,” to be replaced with Christ, and to drink of Him as the waters. In the sight of God, this is the real keeping of the Sabbath. If we keep the Sabbath in this way, we will be able to say, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54276" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). The more we realize that it is no longer we who live but that it is Christ who lives in us, the more we drink of the waters. The crucial point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54277" data-verses="Isaiah 55:1-2">Isaiah 55 and 56</span> is learning how to drink the divine waters and to keep the Sabbath by being fired and replaced with Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="jjSUu6s5jiQAdG86BLWJ7ZqWMMhWt-ISNusTXt7-raNbeRDPHn5I4AQg6gI3v-nu9"> The crucial point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54278" data-verses="Isaiah 57:1">chapters fifty-seven and fifty-eight</span> is how to fast. The real meaning of fasting is to stop eating all things other than the Lord Jesus and to not have the taste for anything other than Him. We should be weary of “eating” worldly styles, fashions, and beautification. We need to fast, to cease from all other kinds of eating, to stop the taste for <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> all other foods, and to eat Jesus as the bread of life embodied in His word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54279" data-verses="John 6:48">John 6:48</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54280" data-verses="John 6:51">51</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54281" data-verses="John 6:63">63</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54282" data-verses="John 6:68">68</span>). This is our fasting. </p>
<p data-content-id="TezDZPL8NrUYNGdOWIcPdAVGPpOO-TfpF8RL5VFcCQVs-AgFoSjWXFBe6PSOdjcpf"> Let us keep this understanding of fasting in mind as we see in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54283" data-verses="Isaiah 57:1-2">Isaiah 57 and 58</span> the evil condition and the need of the wicked of the house of Jacob who have nothing to do with Christ as the Servant of Jehovah.

<p data-content-id="ok4KA4atXxC4_GGUgoqTZJdGDSzicZp2Ck3w9wYZEOloEhZlx-sLpr5qWuMH_IR_Y"> The evil condition of the wicked is that they do not come to the Lord to eat and enjoy the Lord. They do many things, but they do not come to contact Him, to take Him, to receive Him, to taste Him, and to enjoy Him. In the sight of God, nothing is more evil than this. Today, we may have a morning revival, come to the meetings, sing hymns, and even pray without contacting the Lord. To do this is to be a hypocrite. </p>

The wicked, however, are busy with other things and do not care for God’s seekers. When the righteous die and rest in their beds, no one takes it to heart. The word <em>beds</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54285" data-verses="Isaiah 57:2">verse 2</span> signifies graves. </p>

In the New Jerusalem for eternity, we will have a life of resting and fasting. Our unique food will be Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the tree of life. Furthermore, having been fully fired, we will not work but will be at rest. This will be the situation of everyone in the New Jerusalem. <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> </p>

Through all His processes, Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God has accomplished God’s full redemption, and now He is applying His complete salvation to His believers. Although many Christians are preaching the gospel, few people receive this preaching. Because people are busy working and eating, few have any room in their heart, any capacity in their being, for Christ. Thus, they all need to rest, to keep the Sabbath; they also need to fast. By resting and fasting we can partake of all that the processed Christ has accomplished for us. In totality, what He is and has accomplished is just the divine water, which is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God for us to drink and enjoy. </p>
<p data-content-id="2jaApwQLvdqGiLTlJvapwWQie7lD7UKdp6WAgQbms_jfk-21iNUPdC_JsG6KRUu0A"> I can testify that before I was saved, I was a busy and ambitious young man. But when I heard the gospel and received the Lord Jesus, I immediately began to keep the Sabbath and to fast. Now, more than sixty years later, I still like to rest and to fast. I want to be “fired” again and replaced by Christ more and more, resting in Him and fasting from every taste other than Him. According to the divine revelation in the Scriptures, we all need to learn to keep the Sabbath and to fast. </p>

It was by her speaking that Eve committed sin. If she had not spoken to the serpent but had turned to Adam, she would have overcome the serpent’s temptation. However, she spoke to the serpent, and by her speaking she fell into sin. This illustrates the fact that speaking is a problem to us all. Our speaking may minister life to others, or it may minister death to others. Whether we build up others or damage them, whether we minister life or death, depends on how and what we speak. If the saints in the church life could be corrected in their speaking, every church would be revived. </p>

Today the Christian life is just to practice the breathing of the Spirit and the eating and speaking of the word. For this reason, we emphasize, encourage, promote, and advocate the matter of prophesying, that is, speaking for God, speaking God forth, and speaking God in His word into others for the building up of the Body of Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="7Cq8OFR2k0o5VhNZcdPb19FZYAnivjkCp4IsrDaFEu5DXx3xmJfCnIW6iFZ3cxZj5"> God dispenses Himself into our spiritual being through His Spirit, who is the very breath of God. The Spirit is the breath of God for our breathing. The more we breathe the Spirit, the more we are under the divine dispensing. The first two lines of a hymn by A. B. Simpson on the Spirit as the breath say, “O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me, / Teach me how to breathe Thee in” (<em>Hymns,</em> #255). The chorus says, “I am breathing out my sorrow, / Breathing out my sin; / I am breathing, breathing, breathing, / All Thy fulness in.” Instead of being limited in our breathing, we need to exercise spiritual deep breathing. The more deeply we breathe the Spirit, the healthier we will be in our spiritual life. </p>
<p data-content-id="_AvbZ1OwnZrQ7Z-eVxWNuNCYXFBYP1vwjljEA6aW_YTYAEaDSCnq0IA4R7ypZyzPH"> The word God has given to us for our nourishment is Christ as God’s embodiment. The Triune God is embodied in Christ, Christ is embodied in the word, the word is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. By such a cycle the Triune God dispenses Himself into us. Day by day we should deal with the word and the Spirit.

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="fR3FSAPwpELEt7o898BTnbn3LcIjkJG41RF-XGMr8wANynIdYRkLxYxdC1pZYDojA">I.

First, He was anointed by God and with God, and then through His death and resurrection He became the ointment for the anointing of others. His ministry to us is thus a ministry of anointing. Eventually, the ministry of Christ, the Anointed of Jehovah, will issue in the restoration of Israel, His elect people. </p>
<p data-content-id="gscF4m7-lUlMCcyyYPNv5PRtinyTDtR8LWYqxUMZF3D3BVVmY2BWD0HZjB0SqwQxg"> The history of Israel is mainly a history of tragedy, although there were times of glory, such as the building of the temple under Solomon. The temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, and the vessels for the service of God in the temple were carried away to Babylon. From that time until the present, Israel has not been fully a free nation. Hence, Israel still needs restoration. <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="evZWGvKilH-_j1AxvIVulseDa7V6_icIqi73-4obRHEd5xAVW1XeP2quVKqJ44fBo"> Christ’s coming is of two parts and at two times. In His first coming, Christ came to minister, to dispense, Himself into His followers. In this way He carried out the New Testament ministry to dispense the Triune God into the disciples under His ministry, most of whom were Jews. This ministry in Christ’s first coming laid a solid foundation for His second coming. When He comes the second time, He will come mainly in an outward way to rescue Israel from their circumstances and to bring in their restoration. This restoration will be expanded to include all things created by God. This period of restoration will last for a millennium, for the thousand-year kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="5cfSks8f9T4wzhajEBGawglzFKabj3mMDfXnmEjpE8oTiQFZRNSodjL8n4i8NSKGW"> The ministry of the Anointed of Jehovah is described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54341" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1-3">Isaiah 61:1-3</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54342" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1">Verse 1</span> says, “The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me, / Because Jehovah has anointed Me / To bring good news to the afflicted; / He has sent Me to bind up the wounds of the brokenhearted, / To proclaim liberty to the captives, / And the opening of the eyes to those who are bound.” As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54343" data-verses="Luke 4:16-21">Luke 4:16-21</span> indicates, this refers to Christ in His first coming. The Lord’s ministry in His first coming was one of grace, not vengeance, which is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54344" data-verses="Isaiah 61:2">Isaiah 61:2</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="N-FUGiukulHdfeeBKJWgsUWI-C3Vtiyq3naFoqKsOXoQOjoaDnKgOEo_CqDPuh31a"> When the Lord came the first time, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and constituted with the essence of the Holy Spirit added to His humanity to be a God-man. He then lived thirty years as a man in that essence of the Spirit. At the age of thirty He came forth to carry out His ministry. At that time He was baptized in water, and immediately the Holy Spirit descended upon Him economically (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54345" data-verses="Luke 3:21-22">Luke 3:21-22</span>). Prior to that time, He was already constituted with the Spirit essentially, but in order to carry out God’s economy, He needed the Spirit economically to empower Him and authorize Him to be the Servant of God to minister God into His chosen people. This is the significance of the words, “The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="t8bnQrQm6FdShy-EgcXvXYG29TTSXQfcZGteWHR3UQg52r_TcQ6cbm7M6CShPFDoa"> As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ brought good news to the afflicted, bound up the wounds of the brokenhearted, proclaimed liberty to the captives, opened the eyes of the blind (physically and spiritually), and proclaimed the acceptable <span class="pg" data-page-id="213" id="213">[213]</span> year of Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54346" data-verses="Isaiah 61:2">Isa. 61:2a</span>), which is the year of jubilee.

In His second coming He will avenge Israel, proclaiming the vengeance of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="U9URzQvxl-2lbh8eBc0oMULmdVKDDr1W7UKzDtFOt5gwiv1E1oQCE1BiF2e8JjzZg"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54348" data-verses="Isaiah 61:2">Verse 2</span> also indicates that in His second coming Christ will “comfort all who mourn.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54349" data-verses="Isaiah 61:3">Verse 3</span> continues, “To grant to those who mourn in Zion, / To give to them a headdress instead of ashes, / The oil of gladness instead of mourning, / The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness; / That they may be called the terebinths of righteousness, / The planting of Jehovah, that He may be glorified.” Here ashes signifies shame and headdress signifies glory. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54350" data-verses="Hebrews 1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span>, the oil of gladness is the Spirit. Instead of mourning, restored Israel will have the Spirit as the oil of gladness. Furthermore, instead of a spirit of heaviness, there will be a mantle of praise. As a result, Israel will be called the terebinths of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, so that He may be glorified. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtvmNOQoEXWPJrXLSOVVmla9d4o0Rx1dcmIVN6QiUkC-QwmmcWMvUGGb6XF0aziH7"> The first part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54351" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1-3">Isaiah 61:1-3</span> refers to the Lord’s ministry in His first coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54352" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1-2">vv. 1-2a</span>), and the second part refers to the restoration of Israel in His second coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54353" data-verses="Isaiah 61:2-3">vv. 2b-3</span>). Hence, this portion of the Word implies both Christ’s first coming and His second coming. In Isaiah’s prophecy the Lord’s two comings are like two mountain peaks which, when viewed from a distance, seem to be one peak. For this reason, Isaiah put Christ’s first coming and second coming together. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VG1BawJMM7x2I8Q1-xncK7gmsEg3yJ32rYr_aqOpNv8d2Qc_Ih4-0lnhtsdV5yxzA">II.

The Lord’s first coming has much to do with His second coming. Without the foundation laid in His first coming, there would be no way for His second coming to take place. Based upon what He did in His first coming, Christ’s second coming will issue in the restoration of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="1ATOEVfKwdlLTMhjSp8QycziVmQpQkhEIEZAadL-BjklqdI_9Tr4YS71F0zEh2Wky"> In His first coming, the Lord Jesus gained His early disciples, such as Peter, John, and James, from the Jews. <span class="pg" data-page-id="214" id="214">[214]</span> They became His believers, but this does not mean that they have given up their Jewish status, for in the millennial kingdom the first twelve apostles will sit on thrones as rulers to judge the twelve tribes of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54355" data-verses="Matthew 19:28">Matt. 19:28</span>). At that time, they will not be apostles of the church, but, having been brought back by the Lord to their Jewish status, they will be rulers, governors, of Israel. Both Christ and His twelve apostles seemingly forsook Israel and established the church. However, in the restoration, when the Lord returns in His second coming, He will first receive the throne of David His father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54356" data-verses="Luke 1:32">Luke 1:32</span>), and then He will be the Ruler of the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54357" data-verses="Romans 15:12">Rom. 15:12</span>). His twelve apostles will be His helpers to rule over the nation of Israel. From this we can see the relationship between what Christ did in His first coming and what He will do in His second coming. </p>
<p data-content-id="9TrCf1KejPoZVajTCqV3ROt77P6YYza-lMQd7ygpmSZCaXclF4ZegVoF3Vug8RryN"> In God’s eyes the Lord’s two comings are two aspects which show one unique coming of Christ. In a sense, Christ’s coming to earth has not yet been completed. He began to come to mankind two thousand years ago. Since His unique coming has not been finished, it will continue with the second aspect of His coming. When the second aspect of His coming is accomplished, His entire coming from God to mankind will be consummated. Today His coming is not finished, because He is still on the way. Therefore, the unique coming of Christ is of two sections. The first section took place two thousand years ago, and the second section will be accomplished in the future. Hence, in the Old Testament prophecies, Christ’s coming was viewed as two mountain peaks which, from a distance, looked like one mountain range. At present, we are in the “valley” between these peaks. </p>

At that time, the holy city, New Jerusalem, will comprise only the overcoming Old Testament and New Testament saints, but not the Israelites who will be saved at the Lord’s coming back. At the end of the millennium, Satan will stir up opposers, mainly from Gog and Magog, to attack the camp of the Jews and the city of the saints, but fire will come down out of heaven to devour them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54412" data-verses="Revelation 20:9">Rev. 20:9</span>). In the new heaven and new earth after the millennium, the Jews who were saved at the coming of the Lord Jesus will be mingled with the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in the new heaven and new earth, there will be only two peoples. First, there will be the New Jerusalem, composed of the believers and the Jews, God’s sons as the royal family to rule over the nations and as the priests to serve God forever. Second, there will be the nations, who will not be regenerated but only restored and who will live on the earth outside the New Jerusalem to be God’s people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54413" data-verses="Revelation 21:3">Rev. 21:3</span>). </p>

That plan is His eternal economy to create the universe and man so that He may have a people to express Him in a marvelous way. Isaiah’s central point is to show us how God made Christ the centrality and universality of His great move for the accomplishment of His economy. This is why Isaiah reveals so many items of Christ. Christ has to be many items; otherwise, He could not fulfill God’s economy. </p>

In this pair there is a comparison. “The Shoot” is in comparison to “the Fruit,” and “Jehovah” is in comparison to “the earth.” The title Immanuel includes “Jehovah” and “the earth” because it means God with us, that is, God with man. God is eternal, and man came from the earth. The Fruit of the earth refers to a man made from the dust (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54427" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Gen. 2:7</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54428" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span> says that the Lord Jesus shared in man’s blood and flesh. Furthermore, Christ is the eternal God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54429" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> says that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54430" data-verses="John 1:14">verse 14</span> says that the Word became flesh.

When Jehovah God branched Himself out, He did it in His divinity to branch Himself into humanity. Before Jesus was born, our unlimited God was existing merely in the territory of His divinity. He did not possess humanity before His incarnation. Approximately two thousand years ago, God was incarnated. In that incarnation, He branched Himself out in His divinity into humanity. From the year of Christ’s birth, our God is in both divinity and humanity. This is the difference between the unbelieving Jews’ God and our God. Their God is merely in divinity without any element of humanity, but the God we Christians have is One who is in divinity and in humanity. Jesus is the incarnated God, the complete God and the perfect Man. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQhDs-iNd9dq5o_tTmhLjPDckkq7ZljdgsiBluha_pnPIx6DSXOLgZBEdGTR9gpyK"> <em>Jesus</em> was the divine title given by God. Jesus means Jehovah the Savior, or Jehovah the salvation. <em>Immanuel,</em> meaning <em>God with us,</em> was the name called by man. According to our experience of Jesus, we have to call Him Immanuel, which means God with man. Our Jesus is the God-man. He is both God and man, both divine and human. For God to be in humanity is His spreading, His branching out, from one territory to another territory. Today our God exists in two territories—divinity and humanity. Our God today is both divine and human. </p>

He, in His Divinity, to Be the Beauty and Glory<br/>of God’s Chosen People in the Day of Restoration</h2><p data-content-id="ZQ5ZOI_t6lKDRPvgSN9W3lyp3AC8cJuDm5UqbcECOt5pUvu52v_X7zsCFrdRWWuEC"> The incarnated God, in His divinity, will be the beauty and glory of God’s chosen people in the day of restoration. Because Christ lives in us, we are partakers of the divine nature (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54434" data-verses="2Peter 1:4">2 Pet. 1:4</span>). In this sense, we are not only human but also <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> divine. The divine nature is our beauty and our glory. When worldly women go to a special place, they may adorn themselves with the best material and jewelry. This is for their beauty and glory. The uniform of generals in an army is full of stars and badges. This is also for their beauty and glory. Our beauty and glory is not in such outward adornment. Our God with His divine nature is our beauty and our glory. In the day of restoration, if we are faithful, we will be the most beautiful and glorious creatures in this universe because we will have our God in a full way as our beauty and as our glory. Even today if we live Christ, those around us will see that we are weighty and dignified. When a man lives Christ, people will consider that he is a weighty man, a man of gravity, a man of beauty and glory beyond description. Whatever we do and say in Christ is full of dignity and gravity. We should not forget our divine genealogy. We are sons of God in the family of God. His divinity is our beauty and our glory. </p>

<p data-content-id="cle8-utSykwjPzf3VIH9IytfesDpMuIK_KMD9zOpCjKe9hViDIjmiZxkpY6OjHik2"> Isaiah, a book which was quoted greatly by the Lord Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament, reveals many wonderful aspects concerning Christ. In the last message we saw Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54464" data-verses="Isaiah 4:2">Isa. 4:2</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54465" data-verses="Isaiah 7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span> says that the virgin will conceive, bear a son, and call His name Immanuel. This is Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah for the branching out of Jehovah God, in His divinity, into humanity. This is a new development of Jehovah God for His increase and spreading through His incarnation. The Shoot of Jehovah implies the spreading of Jehovah to branch Himself out for His increase. Christ as the Fruit of the earth is for reproduction. Christ, as the one grain who fell into the earth to die, produced many grains, many believers, in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54466" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>). Divinity cannot spread or increase without humanity. The divine life is reproduced in the human life. One day the divine God came to put on human blood and flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54467" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). This was Christ as the Fruit of the earth, a man born of human blood and flesh from the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="YR_U7a4zFL6KVYMurXeeY5z71j379BuHa-797b249EFRSudskQm1EB4lEmOGUz8Me"> In message one we also saw that Christ is a covering canopy of glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54468" data-verses="Isaiah 4:5-6">Isa. 4:5-6</span>). Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth will eventually become a canopy to cover all the interests of God on this earth. When we are in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, we will fully realize this. Christ is the universal canopy to cover all of God’s interests. He is also the tabernacle overshadowing us, God’s elect, protecting us from all kinds of troubles signified by heat, storm, and rain. I <span class="pg" data-page-id="234" id="234">[234]</span> hope that we can get into these aspects of Christ and fellowship about them until they become our experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="EDD4W4Bi8P_kanjIZpkL1ty5cj3m-fMlSC_LE2PNygKjPm1E-k1y3WoflKMCat_Eg"> In this message we want to see the vision of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54469" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span>. In this chapter Christ is seen in His divine glory with His human virtues held in His holiness. His glory is divine, His virtues are human, and His holiness is standing fast. The Bible says that no man has seen God at any time (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54470" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18a</span>). Our God is invisible, yet Isaiah saw Him. Isaiah declared that he saw the Lord, the King, Jehovah of hosts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54471" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isa. 6:1</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="DSgijqH7I3eza2ivBfoD5nHEyaCyUwpg7PL2m3xGMv7aVYPK1L11f4RkD4W1mOBaY"> A clear picture is presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54472" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span>, showing us Christ in glory. This chapter, however, does not give us a detailed description of what Christ looks like. Isaiah only says, “In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54473" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">v. 1</span>). The Lord seen by Isaiah must have been in the image of a man because <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54474" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">verse 1</span> tells us that the train of His robe filled the temple. His robe is the first main item in this scene because it fills the temple. </p>
<p data-content-id="SmYb8X5DkMX1is5fBiyzOEG6_TJreiRZgwNut5F5ur9fZrkZrs1dBJeO_jB-pFaTl"> The second main item in Isaiah’s vision is the temple being filled with smoke (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54475" data-verses="Isaiah 6:4">v. 4</span>). The third main item is the seraphim (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54476" data-verses="Isaiah 6:2">v. 2</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54477" data-verses="Isaiah 6:2">Verse two</span> says, “Seraphim hovered over Him, each having six wings.” The word “hovered” literally means “stood.” The seraphim stood over Him. We know that they were standing for His holiness because they declare, “Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54478" data-verses="Isaiah 6:3">v. 3</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54479" data-verses="Isaiah 6:4">Verse 4</span> says, “The foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called.” The divine glory is another major item in Isaiah’s vision. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54480" data-verses="Isaiah 6:3">Verse 3</span> says, “The whole earth is filled with His glory.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54481" data-verses="John 12:1">John 12</span> says that Isaiah saw the Lord’s glory and spoke concerning Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54482" data-verses="John 12:41">v. 41</span>). The smoke that filled the house, the temple, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54483" data-verses="Isaiah 6:4">Isaiah 6:4</span> is the glory. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54484" data-verses="Isaiah 4:5">Isaiah 4:5</span> also refers to glory as a cloud of smoke over the convocations of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="0C8OwT_hU8xxS8d8SQBEo53nwTusq86ZLv7NeC1igx0uvAO8X3dOR65YnTutEvaR-"> The divine glory is signified by the smoke, holiness is signified by the seraphim, and the Lord’s human virtues are signified by the train of His robe. Human virtues mainly are based upon righteousness. An unrighteous person does not have human virtues. He is bankrupt in human virtues because he is unrighteous. Human virtues depend upon <span class="pg" data-page-id="235" id="235">[235]</span> righteousness. When Christ accomplished His redemption on the cross, He fulfilled the requirements of God’s glory, God’s holiness, and God’s righteousness. As fallen sinners, we cannot fulfill the requirements of God’s glory, holiness, and righteousness, but Christ satisfied them. We need to see the vision of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54485" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span> in His glory, His holiness, and His righteousness with His human virtues. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7Cq8OFR2k0o5VhNZcdPbx9FVeAnivjkCp4IsrDaFEu5DXx3xmJfCnIW6iFZ3cxZj5">I. A VISION SEEN BY ISAIAH IN HIS DEPRESSION</h2><p data-content-id="_AvbZ1OwnZrQ7Z-eVxWNqNCUdFBYP1vwjljEA6aW_YTYAEaDSCnq0IA4R7ypZyzPH"> The vision of Christ in glory was seen by Isaiah in his depression (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54486" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isa. 6:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54487" data-verses="Isaiah 6:5">5</span>). Isaiah loved God and loved Israel, God’s elect. He realized by looking at Israel’s situation, that there was not the expression of God’s glory. Israel had also violated God’s holiness and had become corrupt in human virtues. Furthermore, King Uzziah had died. Among the kings of Israel, he was a very good king, yet he died. In that kind of environment, Isaiah was surely very depressed. The Lord appeared to him in his depression. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BJUW1oqczZ95vjpUQa_p8mHwP32OpzD--By_DI2ytYA36hm4mGG2k8OomeR93vmhG">II. THE LORD, THE KING, JEHOVAH OF HOSTS,<br/>APPEARING TO ISAIAH</h2><p data-content-id="xNrMFclh2xa_fUULOC0HCvhdG4xcvUOOvo0v0AIrJt4JQzhdYzjO_qiVuYxThNsp1"> The Lord, the King, Jehovah of hosts, appeared to Isaiah. He saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54488" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isa. 6:1a</span>). Isaiah saw the glory of God and the train of the Lord’s robe filling the entire temple. He also saw the seraphim, and each seraphim had six wings. Two of the wings were for covering his face, two covered his feet, and with two he flew. These seraphim called to each other, saying, “Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is filled with His glory” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54489" data-verses="Isaiah 6:3">v. 3</span>). That was their fellowship with each other, indicating that they signify or represent the holiness of Christ. They were standing there for His holiness. Such a vision should have encouraged the depressed prophet, but he did not tell us he was encouraged. Instead, he said, “Woe is me, for I am finished! For I am a man of unclean lips, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54490" data-verses="Isaiah 6:5">v. 5</span>). Then one of the seraphim flew to Isaiah with an ember from the altar to touch his mouth for his cleansing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54491" data-verses="Isaiah 6:6-7">vv. 6-7</span>). This is the picture presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54492" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="236" id="236">[236]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="rTSxy6ufSYY0cJBRx2jBYxDIe-PkGj6zjpNjnSLueU-tMdGQu5_MrjbAjwXzSYNvV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54493" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span> Christ, the God-man, is seen in His divine glory. This God-man is unveiled in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54494" data-verses="Isaiah 4:1">chapter four</span> as the Shoot of Jehovah, the Fruit of the earth, a canopy covering God’s interests in the entire universe, and the tabernacle overshadowing God’s elect to protect them from all kinds of troubles. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54495" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span> shows us the same One in another aspect. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54496" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span> He is the God in glory sitting on the throne. Because He is wearing a long robe, He is also a man. This One is the God-man with divine glory and human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="ddB4lVkVmyJ68CnsJyJTeGTCdUEqFgq-k0BZRd94yrfre8l1WideKLwaD17JxG7L9"> His human virtues are signified by the long train of His robe. This indicates that the vision here pays more attention to Christ’s human virtues. The four Gospels show us Christ as God and as man, but they show us more concerning Christ as a man. In the Gospels we see more of Christ in His manhood and in His humanity than in His divinity. Christ is expressed in His human virtues much more than in His divine glory. However, His human virtues need the divine glory as a source. Christ is a person with the divine glory expressed in His human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="QitwyRAi-BSyEqDN1P_gXBFaZbCY_fx4QXG-tNSwIQCcZx2gydXf2eVhMxTRLWMCr"> We all have to see the full vision of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54497" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1">Isaiah 6</span>. Christ is sitting on a high and lofty throne as the Lord, the King, Jehovah of hosts. He is the very God on the throne. John the apostle told us in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54498" data-verses="John 12:1">John 12</span> that Isaiah saw Christ’s glory. This means that Jehovah of hosts, the King, the Lord, was Christ. Christ was wearing a long robe in this vision. This means that Christ’s humanity is “long.” The train of Christ’s robe fills the temple. The Lord who appeared to Isaiah was on a high and lofty throne in His divine glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54499" data-verses="John 12:39-41">John 12:39-41</span>), signified by the smoke, and with His human virtues, signified by the train of His robe. His holiness is held by the seraphim (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54500" data-verses="Isaiah 6:2-3">Isa. 6:2-3</span>). </p>

These prophecies speak of a child born and a son given. The word <em>child</em> in these verses implies God, implies man, implies God becoming a man, and implies God and man mingled together as one. Such a child was a God-man. This child of both the divine and human natures born of a human virgin was also a son given in the divine nature by the Eternal Father. </p>
<p data-content-id="U9URzQvxl-2lbh8eBc0oIUL7RVKDDr1W7UKzDtFOt5gwiv1E1oQCE1BiF2e8JjzZg"> The first poetic pair of items revealed concerning Christ in the book of Isaiah is that He is the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54519" data-verses="Isaiah 4:2">4:2</span>). The second pair of items concerning Christ is an issue of the first pair. This pair is Christ as the covering canopy of glory and the overshadowing tabernacle of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54520" data-verses="Isaiah 4:5-6">4:5-6</span>). We are covered under the glory and we are overshadowed by grace. Christ as grace is a tabernacle overshadowing us, and Christ as glory is a canopy covering us. Many of the riches of Christ seen in Isaiah are not pointed out in the New Testament. Paul’s writings, for example, do not speak of Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth. The Christ whom Paul ministered to us and helped us to pursue is God’s Shoot to branch out God and the Fruit of the earth for His multiplication and reproduction. God’s branching out was for Him to spread Himself from and with <span class="pg" data-page-id="240" id="240">[240]</span> divinity into humanity. In eternity past and before the incarnation, He was merely in the territory of divinity. Then through His incarnation, He branched out into another territory, the territory of humanity. </p>

His divine glory is signified by the smoke, His human virtues are signified by the train of His robe, and His holiness is held by the seraphim.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54572" data-verses="Psalms 90:1">Psalm 90:1</span>, Moses said, “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.” Our God is our eternal dwelling place.

The tabernacle and the temple were <span class="pg" data-page-id="246" id="246">[246]</span> not only the dwelling place of God but also the dwelling place of His serving ones, the priests.

The most inward part of the temple is the Holy of Holies, the dwelling place of God. God’s dwelling becomes our dwelling. Such a revelation of God as our sanctuary should cause us to aspire to live a life with God as our roommate all the time. We need to have definite, intimate, and sweet times with God as our roommate.

This is a mutual abode for the Triune God to abide in the believers and for the believers to abide in Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54584" data-verses="Ephesians 3:1">Ephesians 3</span> Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us into our inner man, so that Christ could make His home in our hearts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54585" data-verses="Ephesians 3:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). This is Christ making us His home for us to take Him as our home. If Christ takes us as His home, we can be assured that we will have Christ as our home. Then He will live with us and we will live with Him. This is God and man living together as roommates. Eventually, the conclusion of the divine revelation is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the aggregate of God and man living together. For eternity God will love man, man will love God, and God and man will live together as roommates. </p>

<p data-content-id="PKUKLH45yBJtdHW2HQzrNavuzma_4HlFtt1ofnLxcnhYFoycnBqCFUmBqa3kjcWVb"> In the previous messages, we have seen many items of Christ unveiled in the book of Isaiah. He is the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54618" data-verses="Isaiah 4:2-6">4:2-6</span>). He is the Christ in glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54619" data-verses="Isaiah 6:1-5">6:1-5</span>). As Immanuel, He was a child born of a human virgin and a son given by the Eternal Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54620" data-verses="Isaiah 7:14">7:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54621" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6-7">9:6-7</span>). He is also a sanctuary to the positive ones and a stone to strike against, a rock of stumbling, a trap, and a snare to the negative ones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54622" data-verses="Isaiah 8:14-15">8:14-15</span>). In this message we want to see another aspect of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54623" data-verses="Isaiah 9:1-5">Isaiah 9:1-5</span> we see Him as the great light for the shining in darkness and for the release from bondage. </p>
<p data-content-id="-waEYRv93EhPN6GvKzVaHqUZzUS28tMkU59WnoJRQOgj-h7qhd8NKNqqlIlNCrxzR"> Light is crucial for our existence. Where light is, there is life. Where darkness is, there is death. According to the Bible, darkness is a punishment. Darkness equals death, and darkness is a prison. God uses darkness as death and a prison to punish people. Exodus shows that darkness was part of the punishment on Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54624" data-verses="Exodus 10:21-23">10:21-23</span>). Revelation shows the judgment of darkness on the kingdom of Antichrist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54625" data-verses="Revelation 16:10">16:10</span>). Actually, the entire fallen world is under God’s judgment of darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54626" data-verses="Ephesians 5:8">Eph. 5:8a</span>). In every city and even in every home among fallen mankind, there is darkness. We can testify that before we were saved, we were in darkness. We were in darkness until the genuine gospel came to us, and we saw the light. </p>
<p data-content-id="pmSZylHOI91d7TIxcigw0jmYwjeeWukG32pyqBYiqnoT2DYbTm6RM9vdoNBvActy1"> In the entire universe, light is the key to life. Plants, animals, and men all need light in order to live. In the Bible, we Christians are called the sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54627" data-verses="Galatians 3:26">Gal. 3:26</span>) and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="254" id="254">[254]</span> sons of light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54628" data-verses="John 12:36">John 12:36</span>). As the sons of light, we should live in the light, walk in the light, remain in the light, and be persons altogether in the light. When we are in the light, we are in fellowship with our Triune God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54629" data-verses="1John 1:5-7">1 John 1:5-7</span>). Then we participate in what He is and enjoy Him. </p>

Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54635" data-verses="Isaiah 9:6">verse 6</span> shows that He was a child born of a human virgin and a son given by the Eternal Father. Christ as the great light shines in darkness. When we have light, everything is in order. If I awake late at night, I dare not go into the kitchen if there is no light there. We cannot see in the darkness, and we do not know what lurks in the darkness. When we see everything, we have peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="CxK0Doj68KK2DfqTC1PSnASx32OAGZ0t_38mb1Yk3T9noem-2jJT0OYYhPlFmtF_3"> As the all-inclusive One, Christ is the light. If He were not the light, we would have no way to go on spiritually. The Gospel of John is a book on life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54636" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1</span> stresses that Christ came as light and life. This light is the true light and the light of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54637" data-verses="John 1:9">vv. 9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54638" data-verses="John 1:4">4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54639" data-verses="John 8:12">8:12</span>). This light “shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54640" data-verses="John 1:5">1:5</span>). Darkness cannot overcome light. Wherever light goes, darkness flees. Light subdues, defeats, and overcomes darkness. A brother may be quarreling with his wife, but when the light shines within him, he stops quarreling. He exchanged words with his wife because he was in darkness. But when the light shines, darkness is gone, and he stops quarreling. When darkness is present, everything is in disorder. But when light is present, everything is in order, and everyone is at peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="PKUKLH45yBJtdHW2HQzrNav_4ma_4HlFtt1ofnLxcnhYFoycnBqCFUmBqa3kjcWVb"> Isaiah unveils Christ as the light in a very beautiful and poetic way. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54641" data-verses="Isaiah 9:1-2">Isaiah 9:1 and 2</span> say, “But gloom does not remain in the place where there was anguish: formerly He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali contemptibly, but afterwards He treats the way of the sea, across the Jordan, with glory, Galilee of the nations. The people who walked in the darkness have seen a great light; upon those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death light has <span class="pg" data-page-id="255" id="255">[255]</span> shined.” He treats the land with glory by being the great light. Gloom, anguish, and contempt were in the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali—Galilee of the nations—because darkness was there. However, the people who walked in this darkness saw a great light. They were dwelling in the land of the shadow of death. Darkness is the shadow of death. When people walk in the darkness, they are in the shadow of death. But upon those in the land of the shadow of death, light has shined. </p>

FOR THE SHINING IN DARKNESS</h2><p data-content-id="pmSZylHOI91d7TIxcigw0jmB5jeeWukG32pyqBYiqnoT2DYbTm6RM9vdoNBvActy1"> Christ is unveiled as the great light for the shining in darkness. He shines upon the people walking in darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54642" data-verses="Isaiah 9:2">Isa. 9:2a</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54643" data-verses="John 1:5">John 1:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54644" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54645" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">1 Pet. 2:9b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54646" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Col. 1:13</span>), shining upon those dwelling in the shadow of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54647" data-verses="Isaiah 9:2">Isa. 9:2b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54648" data-verses="Luke 1:78-79">Luke 1:78-79</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="v8bXBUaOMzEw-TiNL5ZqoXlBZ97nmg86AjAc50n7OsvDdfqaWEWKpdyEo4hVS0NFL"> Christ as the great light firstly shines. Our salvation was a shining of Christ as the great light upon us. When He shined upon us, we were saved. His shining is our salvation, and His shining is His saving of us. By His shining, darkness is gone. When darkness is gone, everything negative is gone. Before I was saved as a teenager, my mother had a difficult time dealing with me, but when I was nineteen years old, Christ shined upon me. My love for the things of the world was gone. My mother wondered what had happened to me. Even though many outward negative things were dealt with, many inward negative things still remained within me. This is why we need more shining. The inner shining is Christ’s saving. </p>
<p data-content-id="WJ5aP-FOAwwmtqgyigv1lzgpez5_2hxzBbpu9V9IDxIMpTzB5bTDMszy1Pz0KJtzc"> The people in darkness either walk or sit. They walk in the darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54649" data-verses="Isaiah 9:2">Isa. 9:2</span>), and they sit in the land of the shadow of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54650" data-verses="Matthew 4:16">Matt. 4:16</span>). When a person is in darkness, he is limited to walking a little bit and sitting. Before we were saved, we were walking and sitting in darkness. Then Christ as the great light shined in the darkness and brought us into His marvelous light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54651" data-verses="1Peter 2:9">1 Pet. 2:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="2jaApwQLvdqGiLTlJvap3WQia7lD7UKdp6WAgQbms_jfk-21iNUPdC_JsG6KRUu0A"> We need to realize the tremendous importance of the shining of light. If the sun did not shine for one day, the entire earth would suffer. If it did not shine for three weeks, many <span class="pg" data-page-id="256" id="256">[256]</span> things on the earth would die. Every day the living things of the earth live under the shining of the sun. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54652" data-verses="Luke 1:78-79">Luke 1:78-79</span>, Zachariah referred to Isaiah’s word when he spoke of Christ as the rising sun from on high visiting us to appear to those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death. We Christians were the ones who were walking in darkness and sitting in the shadow of death. Then we received the Lord’s shining, and that shining saved us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="uoR14bixKWKAhAFIiEKLQSojwYzaDIV0czj5nw-Z1vb3lXpZFhrT300F6GkynCLgZ">III. FOR THE RELEASE FROM BONDAGE</h2><p data-content-id="fR3FSAPwpELEt7o898BThbnSJcIjkJG41RF-XGMr8wANynIdYRkLxYxdC1pZYDojA"> Isaiah also speaks of Christ as the great light for the release from bondage. The shining of the light is the release, and the darkness is the bondage. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54653" data-verses="Isaiah 9:2">9:2</span> Isaiah speaks of the great light. Then in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54654" data-verses="Isaiah 9:3">verse 3</span> he talks to the Lord directly: “You have multiplied the nation; / You have increased their gladness; / They are glad before You as with the gladness of harvest, / As men rejoice when they divide the spoil.” The nation here is the people of God. The Lord has multiplied the people of God, increased their gladness, and they are glad before the Lord. Their gladness is like the gladness of those who have a harvest and like the gladness of those who divide the spoil after winning the battle. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2AlQGFEtbY3V68hEJdQq7s-nDnm-QbOPj1PY3loDh0BSFBk1Q1m_bAmK-r0giaBC"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54655" data-verses="Isaiah 9:4">Verse 4</span> says, “For You break the yoke of their burden / And the staff on their shoulder, / The rod of their oppressor, / As in the day of Midian.” The gladness of the people of God has been increased because the Lord breaks the yoke of their burden, the staff on their shoulder, and the rod of their oppressor. He does this as in the day of Midian, where the army of Gideon defeated the Midianites (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54656" data-verses="Judges 7:24-25">Judg. 7:24-25</span>). The king of Assyria came to invade Judah and to oppress them, but the Lord destroyed them as He destroyed the Midianites through Gideon. </p>

<p data-content-id="kwafBUBsFu1fpBs9XYdAAmvMZo3c1LyTkysTVNgloudM6rHrFh3r2Wk95FIYojDui"> In this message we want to see the all-inclusive Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54662" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span>. This chapter covers the Lord’s coming in the last days to bring in the restoration of all things, the revival of Israel, and the submission of the seeking Gentiles. For this purpose Christ has to be four items. These four items in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54663" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span> form two pairs in the poetic writing of Isaiah. The first pair is Christ as a twig from the stem of Jesse and a branch from the roots of Jesse bringing in the restoration of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54664" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1-9">vv. 1-9</span>). The second pair is Christ as a banner to the peoples and a standard to the nations bringing in the return of God’s people and the submission of the Gentiles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54665" data-verses="Isaiah 11:10-16">vv. 10-16</span>). The banner and the standard are the enlargement of the twig and the branch. Christ has to be these two pairs of four items for the fulfilling of God’s economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="J5yVgcn2hVxwlmacvRVJrMm7ICGRJu4rHGOQehPnQIwJNdnqBbZfew_d3gwtKGTwq">I. A TWIG FROM THE STEM OF JESSE<br/>AND A BRANCH FROM THE ROOTS OF JESSE</h2><p data-content-id="zoZ_fVBVjDeBvKX_n-FDAXf6ncTuqa6rTyl33t2pXpVXLDXjhMeTZgmHCmZP9ElRh"> Christ is a twig from the stem of Jesse and a branch from the roots of Jesse (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54666" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1-9">Isa. 11:1-9</span>). Christ is typified by a twig from the stem of a great tree which has been hewn down to the roots (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54667" data-verses="Isaiah 10:32-34">Isa. 10:32-34</span>). Nearly everything concerning Israel <span class="pg" data-page-id="262" id="262">[262]</span> and the house of David had been cut down. Only Jesse, David’s father is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54668" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span>. All that remained was Jesse, the source of David. The issue of Jesse, the house of David, had been hewn down, but the source from which David came still remained. The royal family of David, the house of David, was cut down when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to conquer Judah and subdue Israel. He destroyed the holy city, Jerusalem, and the holy temple. He captured the royal family of David, including the king and his family, and carried them away to Babylon. This was meant to be the termination of the royal family of David. The big tree of the house of David was hewn down, but the stem with the roots was still there. Christ came out of this source as a twig from the stem and as a branch from the roots. </p>
<p data-content-id="a2P39prM6EX_HLBQX5hhxO5th-6UKpnpKVeApXqgSU0gO2Ybw4I7I1oV3UtONDpf6"> The royal family was cut down, leaving the stem with the roots there for approximately six centuries, from about 606 B.C. to the time Christ was born. When Christ was born as prophesied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54669" data-verses="Isaiah 7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span>, He was the twig from the stem of Jesse. Not many people would pay attention to a twig. Jesus was a twig from the stem of Jesse. Although He became so “small,” no amount of persecution or suffering could put Him down. As the twig from the stem of Jesse, He remains forever. </p>
<p data-content-id="YR_U7a4zFL6KVYMurXeeU5zm_j379BuHa-797b249EFRSudskQm1EB4lEmOGUz8Me"> Christ’s coming in incarnation as the twig was the revival of David’s deprived royal family. David’s royal family was deprived to such an extent that there was hardly anything left of it. But one day in God’s incarnation, a child was born to David’s family. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David. Out of Mary a twig was born. David’s “hewn down” royal family was revived at the birth of that twig. </p>
<p data-content-id="EDD4W4Bi8P_kanjIZpkL5tygXj3m-fMlSC_LE2PNygKjPm1E-k1y3WoflKMCat_Eg"> We must realize that the revival of David’s family is still going on. According to our thought, Christ has two comings, but according to God’s realization, He has sent His Son once for all. This sending started from Bethlehem. When Jesus was born, that was the beginning of God’s sending His Son to the earth. This sending has not yet been fully accomplished. It is still going on. This sending began at the time Jesus was born and will be completed when the Son of Man comes to the earth in an open way. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54670" data-verses="Matthew 24:27">Matthew 24:27</span> says, “For as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, <span class="pg" data-page-id="263" id="263">[263]</span> so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.” That will be the completion of God’s sending His Son. </p>
<p data-content-id="DSgijqH7I3eza2ivBfoD1nHh6aCyUwpg7PL2m3xGMv7aVYPK1L11f4RkD4W1mOBaY"> Christ as the twig from the stem of Jesse came into existence about two thousand years ago, but His being sent has not been fully accomplished. The completion of His being sent by God is accomplished in three ways: by His building up of the church, by His preparing of Israel, and by His adjustment, His judging, of the nations. The present situation in the entire Middle East is altogether for the benefit of Israel. Israel has enjoyed the benefit of the recent war between the United States and Iraq. This can be considered as a part of Christ’s coming in His preparation of Israel. The recent war involving Iraq was also God’s adjustment of the nations. Since 1987 we have seen a great adjustment on earth among the nations—firstly involving Russia and its satellite countries and secondly among the countries in the Middle East. What an adjustment this has been! Christ has taken a big step in these recent years in the world situation. He is much nearer to appearing on earth in an open way, and He is still on His way. </p>
<p data-content-id="SmYb8X5DkMX1is5fBiyzCEGb2TJreiRZgwNut5F5ur9fZrkZrs1dBJeO_jB-pFaTl"> The Lord came at His birth. Then He went to the cross to die. The disciples thought He was going to leave them. However, the Lord revealed that this was not His going but His coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54671" data-verses="John 14:3">John 14:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54672" data-verses="John 14:17-20">17-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54673" data-verses="John 20:19-22">20:19-22</span>). The Lord’s going through death and resurrection was actually His coming to the disciples as the Spirit to get into them and dwell in them. He also came on the day of Pentecost as the Spirit, baptizing His Body in one Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54674" data-verses="Acts 2:4">Acts 2:4a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54675" data-verses="Acts 2:17">17</span>). Today He is still on the way. He is coming. The entire world situation is an indication of the steps of Christ’s coming. He was a little twig in the manger at Bethlehem, but as the lightning in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54676" data-verses="Matthew 24:27">Matthew 24:27</span>, He will be a great standard to the nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="gscF4m7-lUlMCcyyYPNvwPRtmnyTDtR8LWYqxUMZF3D3BVVmY2BWD0HZjB0SqwQxg"> We need to consider what is revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54677" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54678" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span> reveals Christ as the twig and the branch.

What a Spirit! This Spirit is the sevenfold intensified Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54680" data-verses="Revelation 1:4">Rev. 1:4</span>). Along with this Spirit is God’s administration, God’s government (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54681" data-verses="Isaiah 11:3-5">Isa. 11:3-5</span>). Then there is <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> the restoration of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54682" data-verses="Isaiah 11:6-9">vv. 6-9</span>). Eventually the twig becomes a banner to the peoples (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54683" data-verses="Isaiah 11:10">v. 10</span>), and the branch becomes a standard to the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54684" data-verses="Isaiah 11:12">v. 12</span>). Even the Gentiles will come to Christ. Where is the center of the earth? Where is the center of the human race? Where is the center of world history? Look at the banner. Christ as the banner is the center, to whom the nations must go. This is the revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54685" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="evZWGvKilH-_j1AxvIVusseDe7V6_icIqi73-4obRHEd5xAVW1XeP2quVKqJ44fBo"> Christ as the twig and the branch has already come. On the one hand, Christ as the twig and the branch is in the heavens, and on the other hand, He is within the believers and the church. What is He doing? He is still going on. He is still on His way. He is still “stepping” toward us. He is in us, but He is still stepping toward us. This is the marvelous truth of His coming. </p>
<p data-content-id="5cfSks8f9T4wzhajEBGa5glzBKabj3mMDfXnmEjpE8oTiQFZRNSodjL8n4i8NSKGW"> In His incarnation He was a twig. In His resurrection He is a branch in full. At the beginning this branch was the Shoot of Jehovah as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54686" data-verses="Isaiah 4:2">Isaiah 4:2</span>. His being the Shoot of Jehovah indicates His divinity. His being a twig from the stem of Jesse and a branch from the roots of Jesse indicates His humanity. Actually, He is one branch, a branch that is both divine and human. </p>

The stem of Jesse indicates the deprived human royal source (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54688" data-verses="Ruth 4:17">Ruth 4:17b</span>).

We have seen that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54709" data-verses="Isaiah 4:1">Isaiah 4</span> there are four items typifying Christ, and these four items form two pairs. The first pair is Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth, and the second pair is Christ as a covering canopy of glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54710" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span> there are also four items typifying Christ, and these four items form two pairs.

In these messages we are not studying the future fulfillment of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54712" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span>. We are studying the principle of the restoration of life. The twig and the branch come up in life, and this life is full of restoring power, deepening power, growing power, and fruit-bearing power. A twig coming out from a dried and dead stump is a strong indication of the restoring <span class="pg" data-page-id="270" id="270">[270]</span> power in this life. The branch signifies that this life has the deepening power, the growing power, and the fruit-bearing power. This life brings in the Spirit, and this Spirit carries out God’s administration where we see a full restoration of life. Wherever Christ as life grows in freshness and depth, there is the Spirit with His riches, there is the government of God in righteousness and justice, and there is the restoration of life. </p>

A BANNER TO THE PEOPLES<br/>AND A STANDARD TO THE NATIONS</h2><p data-content-id="rTSxy6ufSYY0cJBRx2jBVxDpR-PkGj6zjpNjnSLueU-tMdGQu5_MrjbAjwXzSYNvV"> Through the restoration of Israel, Christ will become a banner to the peoples and a standard to the nations. We need to consider the distinction between a banner and a standard. In order to understand the biblical truths, we need to understand the proper meaning of the words used in the Bible. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54713" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span> describes the scene of a recovery, a revival, a restoration. When the peoples see such a restoration, they will ask, “What is this? Who is carrying this out?” This is why there is the need to put up a banner full of explanation, description, and instruction. This convinces people, convicts people, and captures people. This banner becomes a magnet. It is very magnetic. In the restoration, there will also be the need of a standard to call the people and to gather the people. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54714" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">Isaiah 11</span> the banner is mentioned first and then the standard. The banner is mainly for designation, explanation, and instruction, and the standard is mainly for calling and gathering. The standard is placed as the central object of the called and gathered people. </p>
<p data-content-id="fR3FSAPwpELEt7o898BTvbnSBcIjkJG41RF-XGMr8wANynIdYRkLxYxdC1pZYDojA"> In our church life, when the Christ among us grows bigger and bigger, eventually we have Him as the banner. This grown up Christ becomes a banner to describe, to designate, and to explain. Christ as the banner instructs people concerning the revival and restoration in the church. This banner will be a great magnet, a great attraction. It will become very magnetic. Actually, this great magnet is also a standard which draws people, attracts people, calls people, collects people, and gathers people. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2AlQGFEtbY3V68hEJdQk7s-vDnm-QbOPj1PY3loDh0BSFBk1Q1m_bAmK-r0giaBC"> Wherever Christ is exalted and taken as the central object for His seeking ones to be gathered to, there is the return of <span class="pg" data-page-id="271" id="271">[271]</span> God’s people and the submission of the subdued ones. The church life then becomes an attraction, not by the church itself but by Christ as the twig to become the banner and as the branch to become the standard. We need to see why Isaiah couples Christ as the twig and the branch with Christ as the banner and the standard. When we have Christ as a twig growing among us, this growing-up twig becomes a banner, which describes, explains, designates, and even gives some instructions concerning what Christ is to the church. The same Christ is also a branch growing up to be a standard. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Hm7MzKBVNqPZvSZnxKZdz9Tzqtp-xXbkrNr2Q-9EvAjIvq579v1RiiagtxjY2sjVC">A.

David is this human royal source. The word <em>stands</em> indicates being full of strength and ability. Christ stands full of strength and ability as a banner to the peoples. </p>
<p data-content-id="kwafBUBsFu1fpBs9XYdABmvRXo3c1LyTkysTVNgloudM6rHrFh3r2Wk95FIYojDui"> A banner, probably being the enlargement of the twig in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54717" data-verses="Isaiah 11:1">verse 1</span>, indicates an ensign as a gathering and collecting mark. The Hebrew word for <em>banner</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54718" data-verses="Isaiah 11:10">verse 10</span> may also be translated as <em>ensign</em> (ASV) or <em>signal</em> (NASB). Christ as a banner is the gathering and collecting mark to the peoples of the earth. The phrase <em>to the peoples</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54719" data-verses="Isaiah 11:10">verse 10</span> indicates to all the people of the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="J5yVgcn2hVxwlmacvRVJqMmiHCGRJu4rHGOQehPnQIwJNdnqBbZfew_d3gwtKGTwq"> <em>Him will the nations seek</em> indicates that all the nations of the earth will turn to Him and be willing to be His people. The day will come when all the peoples on this earth will turn to seek after Christ and will be happy to be His people. We are expecting that day. </p>
<p data-content-id="zoZ_fVBVjDeBvKX_n-FDBXffrcTuqa6rTyl33t2pXpVXLDXjhMeTZgmHCmZP9ElRh"> <em>His resting place will be the glory</em> indicates that the divine glory of God will be Christ’s resting place. The divine glory will be His bed, His sofa, His resting place. This indicates that the divine glory is one with Christ. The divine glory being His resting place implies His divinity, which means that He and God are one. Actually, the banner to the peoples is God Himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="272" id="272">[272]</span> </p>

The Lord will recover for the second time the remnant of His people from the nations and gather them from the four corners of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54724" data-verses="Isaiah 11:11">vv. 11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54725" data-verses="Isaiah 11:12">12b</span>). The first time the Lord recovered Israel was in their exodus from Egypt. Even today most of the Jews are dispersed, scattered everywhere, throughout the globe. </p>
<p data-content-id="8E91CI8WBa01w0bEiW0XE13lvXM70BpxbK9wQvTVRzk8lV-uoWmAAoyE0h-_tRuC9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54726" data-verses="Isaiah 11:13-14">Verses 13 and 14</span> say that Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, nor will Judah be hostile to Ephraim. They will be together to plunder the nations on the west and on the east; the nations will come into the grasp of their hand and submit to them. Ephraim was the northern nation of Israel, and Judah was the southern nation. The one nation was divided into two—the nation of Israel and the nation of Judah. Instead of their being hostile toward one another, they will be harmoniously one. They will be together to plunder the nations on the west and on the east. The nations will come into the grasp of their hand and submit to them. In our experience this signifies the result of our preaching of the gospel. If we are jealous of each other and hostile to each other, we cannot be together to plunder the people from the west and from the east, and they will not fall into the grasp of our hand and submit to us. </p>

<p data-content-id="ok4KA4atXxC4_GGUgoqLQJdbJSzicZp2Ck3w9wYZEOloEhZlx-sLpr5qWuMH_IR_Y"> In this message we want to see the springs of salvation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54744" data-verses="Isaiah 12:1">Isaiah 12</span>. We need to know the difference between the words <em>fountain</em> and <em>springs.</em> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54745" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:7">Deuteronomy 8:7</span> speaks of the good land as “a land of waterbrooks, of springs and of fountains, flowing forth in valleys and in mountains.” The fountain is the source, the spring is the issue of the source, and the waterbrook, or the river, is the flow. The source of the Jordan River is in Mount Hermon. Some of us visited there and saw the spring of water gushing out from the fountain to become a river. In its verbal form <em>spring</em> means to gush out or gush up. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54746" data-verses="Exodus 15:1">Exodus 15</span> speaks of the children of Israel arriving at Elim on their journey in the wilderness. At Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54747" data-verses="Exodus 15:27">v. 27</span>). The source of these springs may have been one fountain. </p>
<p data-content-id="3BADcAnW9OEC5k8Yd7Uyqj5TX5egJ3xQPJp_FOL39Tr6GcaslKhpsLMjyFet50hDV"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54748" data-verses="Isaiah 12:1">Isaiah 12</span> does not use the word <em>spring</em> in the singular but the word <em>springs</em> in plural. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54749" data-verses="Isaiah 12:3">Verse 3</span> says, “Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation.” The term <em>the springs of salvation</em> implies that salvation is the source. The source of the springs of salvation is a fountain, and that fountain is salvation. The <em>source,</em> the <em>fountain,</em> and <em>salvation</em> are synonyms. Who is the source, the fountain, the salvation, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54750" data-verses="Isaiah 12:1">Isaiah 12</span>? <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54751" data-verses="Isaiah 12:2">Verse 2</span> says, “God is now my salvation; / I will trust and not dread; / For Jah Jehovah is my strength and song, / And He has become my salvation.” <em>Jah</em> is <span class="pg" data-page-id="278" id="278">[278]</span> a short form of Jehovah. This is similar to a person’s full name also having a short form, such as <em>Benjamin</em> and <em>Ben.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="GJDDUPDDLX0o4Er94zmbzXfhOmpDzlv3f1-hon_Kz_82lAUhb8Q4Ir7xA9OciutNq"> The main word stressed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54752" data-verses="Isaiah 12:1">Isaiah 12</span> is <em>salvation.</em> God is our salvation, and Jah Jehovah is our strength and song. Strength and song both indicate experience. When God’s salvation is experienced by us, this salvation becomes our strength, and eventually it will be our song, our praising. The strength and the song are experiences of salvation. In our experiences our God is Jah and Jehovah. In the New Testament, our God is called Jesus and Christ. He is the Lord Jesus Christ. When we are calling upon Him, we can say in a very intimate way, “My Lord Jesus Christ.” Sometimes we can express this in a more dear way by saying, “My dear Lord Jesus Christ.” Jah Jehovah in the New Testament is our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="cle8-utSykwjPzf3VIHhMytvesDpMuIK_KMD9zOpCjKe9hViDIjmiZxkpY6OjHik2"> Out of the fountain of salvation come the springs. This salvation is Jah Jehovah. In the New Testament, Jah Jehovah is Jesus, the incarnated God. <em>Jesus</em> means the <em>salvation of Jehovah.</em> This salvation is the source of all the springs. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54753" data-verses="John 7:38">John 7:38</span> the Lord Jesus said that out of our innermost being would flow rivers of living water. Not just a river, but rivers flow out of us. When I was young, I was bothered because I knew that the rivers, which are plural, refer to the one Spirit. I did not see at that time that the book of Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54754" data-verses="Revelation 1:4">1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54755" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">4:5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54756" data-verses="Revelation 5:6">5:6</span>). God’s one Spirit has been intensified sevenfold. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54757" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span> the rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54758" data-verses="Romans 15:30">Rom. 15:30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54759" data-verses="1Thessalonians 1:6">1 Thes. 1:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54760" data-verses="2Thessalonians 2:13">2 Thes. 2:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54761" data-verses="Galatians 5:22-23">Gal. 5:22-23</span>) of the one unique river of water of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54762" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Rev. 22:1</span>), which is God’s Spirit of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54763" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Rom. 8:2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="t8bnQrQm6FdShy-EgcXzWYG25TTSXQfcZGteWHR3UQg52r_TcQ6cbm7M6CShPFDoa"> The springs issue out of the fountain. The springs are Christ. These springs become the rivers, which are the Spirit. The salvation is the source, the fountain, out of which Christ springs up. The processed Triune God is the fountain, the springs, and the river of water of life. The Father is the fountain, the Son is the springs, and the Spirit is the river of water of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="hzY1tM_vwP6yiexhKU0kwWcLS00OQ2FHJHueHLL0JnTSgM-pFcVRMqavXK50VgQkc"> The water in a fountain comes from the heavens. This water comes down to the earth and gets deeply into the earth. <span class="pg" data-page-id="279" id="279">[279]</span> Eventually, it becomes a fountain under the earth, and this fountain springs up to become springs. This is a picture. The water is the processed Triune God becoming a fountain, out of which we can have the springs of salvation for our enjoyment and experience. When we receive this water, it becomes a stream flowing within us. God as our salvation is the fountain; Christ is the springs of salvation for our enjoyment and experience; and the Spirit is the flow of this salvation within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="U9URzQvxl-2lbh8eBc00NULmZVKDDr1W7UKzDtFOt5gwiv1E1oQCE1BiF2e8JjzZg"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54764" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span> the Lord Jesus showed the Samaritan woman that the very living water would become in her a spring of water welling up into eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54765" data-verses="John 4:14">v. 14</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54766" data-verses="Revelation 21:6">Revelation 21:6</span> the Lord says, “I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.” Both the Old and New Testaments show that the living water is God’s practical salvation. This practical salvation is the processed Triune God Himself. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MtvmNOQoEXWPJrXLSOVJnla9Z4o0Rx1dcmIVN6QiUkC-QwmmcWMvUGGb6XF0aziH7">RECEIVING THE TRIUNE GOD<br/>AS OUR SALVATION BY DRINKING HIM</h2><p data-content-id="VG1BawJMM7x2I8Q1-xnAL7gmgEg3yJ32rYr_aqOpNv8d2Qc_Ih4-0lnhtsdV5yxzA"> Most people do not consider that God’s salvation is so subjective to us. Most think of His salvation in an objective way. Some think that they need the Lord Jesus to stretch out His hand to rescue them and pull them out of the fall. Actually, the Lord’s salvation is absolutely not like this. If we want the Lord to save us, we must drink Him. The way to receive the processed Triune God as our salvation is by drinking Him. When the water gets into us, it permeates our entire being. The way that we get nourished, transformed, conformed, and glorified is by drinking Christ into us. This is the way to receive God as our salvation. The source of this water is a fountain, which is immeasurably deep and wide, and this fountain has many springs. </p>
<p data-content-id="iwT5Yy0cX4eU-alBW_sxIHXqHtH3G3v4KvJAkK1R0Bp2b4WRH-eqJZg0tSj0qYchX"> The springs at Niagara Falls are not drinkable because they are too great and fierce, but Jesus is a gentle spring. In the ancient times in the Middle East, people would go to a spring where there was a well from which they drew water for themselves and for others. We can also come to the Lord to draw living water from Him for ourselves and for others. This shows that the processed Triune God as our salvation is very <span class="pg" data-page-id="280" id="280">[280]</span> subjective. The water that we drink passes through our entire being, is assimilated by us, and even becomes us. </p>
<p data-content-id="1ATOEVfKwdlLTMhjSp8MzczuTmQpQkhEIEZAadL-BjklqdI_9Tr4YS71F0zEh2Wky"> In both the Old and New Testaments, water is used as an illustration of our Triune God. At the end of the Bible in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54767" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span>, there is a picture of a throne, upon which the Lamb-God is sitting. Out from the throne underneath the Lamb, flows the river of water of life. In this river grows the tree of life, and this river passes through the entire holy city. The river actually spirals down from the throne in the middle of the golden street to water the whole city. Every part of the city is nourished and watered by this river. This is a full picture of the Triune God to be our salvation. Every day we need to drink Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="9TrCf1KejPoZVajTCqVrQOt39P6YYza-lMQd7ygpmSZCaXclF4ZegVoF3Vug8RryN">BREATHING AND DRINKING<br/>BY CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2><p data-content-id="jjSUu6s5jiQAdG86BLWRyZqzOMhWt-ISNusTXt7-raNbeRDPHn5I4AQg6gI3v-nu9"> Along with drinking the Lord, we also need to breathe Him in. According to the spiritual reality, breathing is drinking. M. E. Barber said in one of her hymns, “Just to breathe the Name of Jesus / Is to drink of Life indeed” (<em>Hymns,</em> #73, verse 2). To breathe the name of Jesus is to drink the water of life. By calling “O Lord Jesus” we breathe, and by breathing we drink. </p>
<p data-content-id="TezDZPL8NrUYNGdOWIcXUAVnMpOO-TfpF8RL5VFcCQVs-AgFoSjWXFBe6PSOdjcpf"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54768" data-verses="Isaiah 12:1">Isaiah 12</span> speaks of drawing water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54769" data-verses="Isaiah 12:3">v. 3</span>). No doubt, this is for drinking. Now we need to consider where breathing is revealed in this chapter. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54770" data-verses="Isaiah 12:4">Verse 4</span> says, “And you will say in that day, / Praise Jehovah; call upon His name!” Praising Jehovah and calling upon His name are put together as one. Whenever we call on the name of the Lord, that implies praising. When we say “O Lord Jesus,” that is not only calling but also praising. When we say, “O Lord Jesus, I love You,” this is praising and breathing. Many Christians are deadened because they do not practice this spiritual breathing. If we do not breathe physically, we will die within a short period of time. This shows how crucial calling on the Lord is. </p>

THE KING REIGNING IN THE TENT OF DAVID</h2><p data-content-id="N-FUGiukulHdfeeBKJW8sUWR3C3Vtiyq3naFoqKsOXoQOjoaDnKgOEo_CqDPuh31a"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54796" data-verses="Isaiah 16:5">Isaiah 16:5</span>, the all-inclusive Christ is the King reigning in the tent of David. We may wonder what this aspect of Christ has to do with us since Christ will reign as a king in the tent of David in the coming age during the restoration of the nation of Israel. We need to realize, however, that we can also enjoy Christ as the reigning One in the tent of David in the age of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="t8bnQrQm6FdShy-EgcXzXYGTzTTSXQfcZGteWHR3UQg52r_TcQ6cbm7M6CShPFDoa"> The Gospels show that Christ is intimately related to David. The Gospel of Luke was of course written by Luke, a Gentile, and it was basically written to Gentiles. But Luke reports the angel telling Mary that the One conceived in her womb would be given “the throne of David His father” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54797" data-verses="Luke 1:32">1:32</span>). The One that Mary would bring forth would be a descendant of David and would inherit the throne of David. What does this have to do with the new testament believers? We have to realize that, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54798" data-verses="Hebrews 6:5">Hebrews 6:5</span>, the age of grace, the new testament age, is a foretaste of the coming age. Actually, the age of grace is a miniature of the coming age, and the coming age is the consummation of the age of grace. We <span class="pg" data-page-id="284" id="284">[284]</span> are not in the coming age of the kingdom yet, but we are in its miniature, the age of grace. Thus, what we are enjoying today is a foretaste of the coming kingdom in the age of restoration. </p>
<p data-content-id="hzY1tM_vwP6yiexhKU0kxWcqZ00OQ2FHJHueHLL0JnTSgM-pFcVRMqavXK50VgQkc"> Divine healing is a part of the restoration in the coming age, but today in the age of grace we may also enjoy and receive divine healing. This is a foretaste of the power of the coming age. As ones who are saved by grace, we are enjoying Christ in the age of grace as the miniature of the coming age. </p>
<p data-content-id="bv2WaUA81d0xeJoiPxHRcaWseW0RR1MCdnj3LsH-Yzx1ju2wy_7WNDc0ePPJjn9A-"> Thus, today we have to realize that Christ is our King. He reigns not only in our hearts but also in the tent of David. In the Old Testament, when the tent of David was set up, when David’s kingdom was fully established, that was a great consolation and joy to the Israelites. In the coming age, when Christ reigns in the tent of David, that will be a greater consolation to Israel. Christ reigning in the tent of David signifies consolation, encouragement, and restoration. Today we are enjoying Christ as the King ruling not only in our heart but also in the tent of David. For Him to reign in us in the tent of David means that He reigns in us with a kingdom. </p>
<p data-content-id="qLcT4wgKp4K96nzb-VAi_uxFXKCVCtmQ-ddLWU3OUWeWKVVKtz4shHE650_vNmZDU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54799" data-verses="Isaiah 16:5">Isaiah 16:5</span> says, “Then will a throne be established in lovingkindness, / And upon it One will sit in truth / In the tent of David, / Judging and pursuing justice / And hastening righteousness.” Christ’s throne will be established in lovingkindness. Lovingkindness means tender affection. All of us can approach His throne because lovingkindness is there. </p>
<p data-content-id="yL2Ky-HIjJpVThJMPlOjewIuUB9B7hyN5AS9cHjRMy64K2UMPG0rJxFZdOU2W4lcc"> Christ sits upon His throne in truth. Truth here means truthfulness and faithfulness. Christ is not only loving and kind but also truthful and faithful. He is the worthy One. As the One sitting upon the throne in the tent of David, He is the real David. He judges and pursues justice. To judge is to adjust and correct in order to make peace. Christ is the unique Judge in the whole universe. In our natural being, we do not treat others justly. The husbands do not treat the wives in justice, nor do the wives treat the husbands in justice. But Christ is perfectly just with everyone and pursues justice in all of His judgments. He is also the One hastening righteousness. </p>

Today Christ reigns in us in the tent of David, bringing in the kingdom with lovingkindness, truthfulness, faithfulness, justice, and righteousness. If we are under His ruling, His reigning, we will be the same as He is in these virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="0C8OwT_hU8xxS8d8SQBYt53n0Tusq86ZLv7NeC1igx0uvAO8X3dOR65YnTutEvaR-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54801" data-verses="Isaiah 24:23">Isaiah 24:23</span> confirms that when Christ will reign in the tent of David in the age of restoration, it will be Jehovah of hosts reigning because Christ is Jehovah of hosts. When Christ will reign as Jehovah of hosts in Zion and Jerusalem, the moon will be abashed, and the sun will be ashamed. For it will be Jehovah of hosts who will reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and His glory will be before His elders. When Christ reigns in the millennium, even the brightest things “will be ashamed.” But even today we can enjoy Christ reigning in us as a foretaste of His reign in the coming age. </p>

THE ETERNAL ROCK FOR HIS PEOPLE TO TRUST IN</h2><p data-content-id="_AvbZ1OwnZrQ7Z-eVxWRvNCUZFBYP1vwjljEA6aW_YTYAEaDSCnq0IA4R7ypZyzPH"> Every human being apart from Christ has nothing to trust in, but we have the Lord as the eternal Rock to trust in. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54802" data-verses="Isaiah 17:10">Isaiah 17:10</span> says, “For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, / And the Rock of your stronghold you have not remembered. / Therefore you plant plants of delight / And set them with plant cuttings to a strange god.” Christ is the God of our salvation. Actually, He Himself is our salvation. He is the Rock of stronghold for His people to remember Him as their salvation. If we forget Christ as our God, we will be like those who plant plants for another god. We have to pray, “Lord, we do not ever want to plant plants for another god. We want to always remember You.” As the Rock of our stronghold, Christ is the God of our salvation in whom we should trust. </p>
<p data-content-id="BJUW1oqczZ95vjpUQa_15mHwL32OpzD--By_DI2ytYA36hm4mGG2k8OomeR93vmhG"> He is also the Rock of Israel for His people to contact Him as their joy. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54803" data-verses="Isaiah 30:29">Isaiah 30:29</span> says, “You will have a song / As in the night when the feast is sanctified, / And gladness of heart as when one marches to the flute / To go to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.” Although this verse describes the coming age of restoration, we enjoy a foretaste of this in the meetings of the church and the ministry. We are those feasting on the Lord and with the Lord and singing <span class="pg" data-page-id="286" id="286">[286]</span> in the Lord and to the Lord. We have gladness in our heart as those who are marching to the flute to go to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel. Today when we come to the meeting, we should come with gladness in our heart, as those who are “marching to the flute to go to the mountain of Jehovah.” </p>

Today we, as the Gentiles, do enjoy Christ as our Savior and our mighty Defender. He not only saves us in many ways but also defends us at the time of need. </p>

Today in the new testament age of grace He is already manifested to us. We all can see Him inwardly in our spirit. He is no longer hiding Himself in a corner. We can hear His word on the way telling us to turn to the left or to turn to the right. We have such a Teacher who will no longer hide Himself in a corner from His people but will always instruct His people to turn to the right or turn to the left at the crossroad. </p>

<p data-content-id="9TrCf1KejPoZVajTCqVrSOtmwP6YYza-lMQd7ygpmSZCaXclF4ZegVoF3Vug8RryN"> In this message we want to see what Christ is as the Steward in the house of God, typified by Eliakim. Eliakim is one of the most all-inclusive types of Christ. This type is seen in only five verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54809" data-verses="Isaiah 22:1">Isaiah 22</span>—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54810" data-verses="Isaiah 22:20-24">verses 20-24</span>. Although this portion of the Word is short, it is very difficult to understand and interpret. </p>
<p data-content-id="jjSUu6s5jiQAdG86BLWRwZquMMhWt-ISNusTXt7-raNbeRDPHn5I4AQg6gI3v-nu9"> This type in these verses reveals six aspects of Christ. First, He is the Steward in God’s house. Second, He is the Father as the Source and Supplier to the people of God. A father of a home is always the source of that family and the supplier. Third, Christ is typified as a key-holder. The Lord Jesus referred to Himself as the One who has the key of David in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54811" data-verses="Revelation 3:7">Revelation 3:7</span>. He is the One who holds the key of the house of David. The house is the place where a person keeps all his precious things. The house which keeps the precious things is the treasury. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54812" data-verses="Isaiah 39:2">Isaiah 39:2</span> records how Hezekiah showed the Babylonian visitors his treasury, which literally means “the house of his precious things.” The house of David was a treasury. Hezekiah opened up this treasury to show the Babylonian visitors the riches of the house of David. Christ is the One who has the key to the house of David. </p>
<p data-content-id="TezDZPL8NrUYNGdOWIcXWAV-PpOO-TfpF8RL5VFcCQVs-AgFoSjWXFBe6PSOdjcpf"> Fourth, Christ is seen as a peg, a nail, driven into a sure place. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54813" data-verses="Zechariah 10:4">Zechariah 10:4</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54814" data-verses="Ezra 9:8">Ezra 9:8</span> are other verses which refer to the peg, or the nail. Fifth, Christ is a throne of glory for His Father’s house. Sixth, Christ is the One upon whom hangs all the glory of His Father’s house. All the people of <span class="pg" data-page-id="290" id="290">[290]</span> God’s house are hanging on Him, and these people are likened to vessels. </p>
<p data-content-id="ntO50bOijJMzmNkskqpnP6ukv2FSqqc2Bgx_sLnuTf1bUIyGc52QX8pB5QylzmI4x"> We may say that whatever is in the New Testament concerning Christ was already referred to in the Old Testament. In principle, this is true. But we also need to realize that there are many details in the Old Testament that cannot be found in the New Testament. The New Testament does not tell us that Christ is a peg, a nail, and no New Testament verse tells us directly that Christ is the throne. The New Testament tells us that Christ is a slave, a servant of God, but it does not tell us directly that Christ is a steward. The New Testament says that we believers are stewards (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54815" data-verses="1Peter 4:10">1 Pet. 4:10</span>), but it does not use the word <em>steward</em> in reference to Christ. A servant may not be a steward, but a steward is surely a servant. </p>
<p data-content-id="6_OSZe2X2kZhdrl83py0bXxg9jU7nUSD9UzCRnBkVHYRo1DTJ9c4RnDAMFzJqC30o"> In ancient times, a large family would have a steward to dispense the riches of the household to all of its members. The book of Genesis records that Joseph was such a steward of Pharaoh’s house to distribute the riches of this house. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54816" data-verses="Isaiah 22:1">Isaiah 22</span> speaks of Shebna as the steward over the king’s house, the royal household, the royal family. All the treasures were in the king’s house, and the key to this house was in his hand. Eventually, he was replaced by Eliakim, a type of Christ as the Steward in the house of God. The New Testament does not relate so many details concerning Christ. We need to see how rich the all-inclusive Christ is. He is not only the Steward and the Father but also the Key-holder and the peg. He is also a throne of glory and the One upon whom hangs all the glory of His Father’s house. </p>
<p data-content-id="jjSUu6s5jiQAdG86BLWRwZqzGMhWt-ISNusTXt7-raNbeRDPHn5I4AQg6gI3v-nu9"> Our fellowship in this message to point out the aspects of Christ in the type of Eliakim shows that we need the exposition and interpretation of the Bible. Without the proper exposition and interpretation of the Bible, we would not be able to understand it. Darby, Scofield, and Newberry all recognized that Eliakim was a real type of Christ. Today we are standing on the shoulders of the teachers of the Bible who have gone before us so that we can see and enter into more of the riches of the all-inclusive Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="291" id="291">[291]</span> </p>

Christ is the real steward of God’s house, the divine household. God’s household is the greatest house in the universe, including all the believers throughout the ages. In this vast divine household, Christ is the unique Steward. He takes care of God’s household in every way to serve us. </p>
<p data-content-id="6_OSZe2X2kZhdrl83py0bXxB0jU7nUSD9UzCRnBkVHYRo1DTJ9c4RnDAMFzJqC30o"> His service is a kind of governing, or ruling. In His service there is the dominion, the administrative authority. When we are served by Christ, we are under His government. He governs us and rules over us, taking care of us. The more He takes care of us, the more we are under His authority, His administration. When I was initially saved, I did not consider Christ’s ruling over me in His divine government. But the more I went on with the Lord and enjoyed Him, the more I was caught by Him. The more I enjoyed Him, the more I became governed by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="RWFHKesiQFgZazxZPJ6h_RKYvCVsdgryCSllUbbuvWm2lmnZkYhSqmHn7Gi_Xa-di"> In the late 1960s and early 1970s in Elden hall in Los Angeles, a number of hippies were saved and came into the church life. As they went on with the Lord and enjoyed the Lord, they were brought under the Lord’s government. Gradually, as these young brothers were brought under the divine authority, they stopped wearing their headbands, they shaved their beards, and they put shoes and socks on their feet. Most young people want freedom. I was the same way as a young person, but I was saved by the Lord. The more I prayed to Him, the more I enjoyed Him, and the more I enjoyed Him, the more He restricted me. I was and still am experiencing His inward governing. While a steward serves the children of a certain family, he or she also governs them. Similarly, while Christ as the Steward serves us in God’s house, He governs us. Christ is God’s Steward taking care of God’s children. </p>

Christ is a Father to us. As the Father, He is our Source and Supplier. The more we go on as children of God, the more we realize that our Savior, Christ, is our Source and our Supplier. Everything comes from Him. He supplies us and supports us physically, psychologically, and spiritually in every way. If we are short of understanding and wisdom, we should call on Him, look to Him, and wait on Him. Then He will be our understanding and wisdom. We should not be confident in our own understanding and wisdom concerning certain situations or people. We should look to Christ in everything so that He can be our understanding and wisdom. Today Christ is a Father as the Source and Supplier to support us in everything and in every way. </p>

The book of Isaiah may be divided into two sections. The first section is composed of the first thirty-nine chapters, and the second section is composed of the next twenty-seven chapters, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54848" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">chapters forty through sixty-six</span>. This is similar to the division of the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament has thirty-nine books, and the New Testament has twenty-seven books. At the end of the first section of Isaiah, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54849" data-verses="Isaiah 36:1">chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine</span>, there is the account concerning Hezekiah. Thus, this last message on the first part of Isaiah covers the aspects of the all-inclusive Christ up through <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54850" data-verses="Isaiah 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span>. In the next message we will begin to see the aspects of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54851" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">chapter forty</span>, the first chapter of the second section of Isaiah. </p>
<p data-content-id="AvPRXCDvWPiXRWBLHvk1Ju8aW2zbBZw8VeVejT0nSqA7E0kK3cIPJSEiiXJm5nqH4"> In this message we want to see Christ as a crown, a stone, and a King. He is a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty; He is a stone as a foundation, a tested stone, and a precious cornerstone; and He is a King as a man to be a refuge, a covering, streams of water, and the shadow of a massive rock. These items of Christ will all eventually be completely fulfilled in the age of restoration after God will have completed His governmental dealing with Israel. <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="FGittJXCVs1rkWe7ktAfs5VQpBIcZfHlxi6UoKmz6jdb4AkrfS1FmkAs3rLH6WK0t"> Today the nation of Israel is confined to a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea. Without God’s sovereign arrangement to have a nation such as the United States to protect Israel, Israel would have already been more diminished. The recent crisis in the Middle East was the exercise of God’s sovereignty for the uplifting of Israel and the putting down of the opposing Arab countries. Although Israel has been uplifted, it is still suffering. The day will come, however, when Israel will be fully restored. The landmark of that day will be the second coming of Christ in His glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="CxK0Doj68KK2DfqTC1POjASU92OAGZ0t_38mb1Yk3T9noem-2jJT0OYYhPlFmtF_3"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54852" data-verses="Deuteronomy 11:24">Deuteronomy 11:24</span> speaks of the boundaries of the territory of Israel—“Every place on which the sole of your foot treads will be yours; from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even unto the farmost sea will be your border.” The farmost sea is the Mediterranean Sea. The territory of Israel will stretch from the Mediterranean Sea all the way to the Euphrates within Iraq. Today the nations are debating about what land should belong to Israel and what land should belong to the Palestinians. But the Lord set the boundaries of the land of Israel in Deuteronomy, and He promised that He would cut off and drive out others who possessed this land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54853" data-verses="Exodus 23:23">Exo. 23:23</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54854" data-verses="Exodus 23:28">28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54855" data-verses="Exodus 23:31">31</span>). What the nations of the world feel about Israel does not matter. The Lord’s feeling and decision regarding the situation of Israel mean everything. </p>

We need to consider the difference between a crown and a diadem. We may think that these are the same, but these items are not in apposition in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54857" data-verses="Isaiah 28:5">verse 5</span>. There is a conjunction between them—a crown of glory <em>and</em> a diadem of beauty. This is Isaiah’s marvelous writing. A crown is like a hat or turban, whereas the diadem is the most beautiful, glorious part of the crown. It is the headband. Generally speaking, a crown signifies glory, but its beauty is in its diadem, which may be full of jewels and <span class="pg" data-page-id="301" id="301">[301]</span> precious stones. The diadem is the beauty of the glorious crown. </p>
<p data-content-id="rTSxy6ufSYY0cJBRx2jdfxDIa-PkGj6zjpNjnSLueU-tMdGQu5_MrjbAjwXzSYNvV"> Christ will be a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of Israel, God’s chosen people, in the age of restoration after all the dealings of God. He will be His chosen people’s glorification. Glory and beauty are two distinct things. Something may be very glorious but not that beautiful. Christ will be both glory and beauty to His elect people. </p>
<p data-content-id="ddB4lVkVmyJ68CnsJyJPZGTCZUEqFgq-k0BZRd94yrfre8l1WideKLwaD17JxG7L9"> We need to remember that the age of grace is a miniature and a foretaste of the coming age of restoration. Today we enjoy a foretaste of Christ as our crown and diadem. Regretfully, many do not feel glorious to tell people that they are Christians. Some Christians may talk about other persons or things in a glorious way, but when they come to the subject of Christ, they may feel shameful. This is not right. When we talk about Christ and when we tell people that we are Christians, we should consider that Christ is our crown and diadem, our glory and beauty. </p>
<p data-content-id="QitwyRAi-BSyEqDN1P_8QBFadbCY_fx4QXG-tNSwIQCcZx2gydXf2eVhMxTRLWMCr"> I experienced Christ in this way about fifty years ago when Japan invaded China and I was imprisoned by the Japanese army. On the one hand, they shamed me, judged me, and tortured me. On the other hand, they respected and regarded me because I behaved as a Christian. Paul said in the book of Philippians, while he was imprisoned in Rome, that he had the earnest expectation and hope not to be put to shame but to magnify Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54858" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">1:20</span>). Paul magnified Christ to such an extent that even some in Caesar’s household became believers in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54859" data-verses="Philippians 4:22">4:22</span>). In Paul’s experience, he had Christ as a crown with a diadem. We should feel glorious that we are Christians. When we are defeated, we feel ashamed, but when we repent and receive the dispensing Christ in a fresh way, we feel glorious. </p>

He is a stone laid by God in Zion. </p>
<p data-content-id="Owq2f2I7NIYFk__C2ywsOpoxR1kxR__Fg1-1HGnPDzxmpjvxRJoOnponCYjgQHroH"> This stone is a foundation firmly established for God’s building in Israel. We can enjoy Christ as such a firmly established foundation today. With the worldly people who do not believe in Christ, everything is fading. This is because they do not have Christ as a stone, a foundation, on which to stand. As Christians, we have Christ as a crown upon our heads and as a rock under our feet. This rock is firmly established for God’s building among His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="42lYhddcih55Tpki129ke8oJKJQYZYNlC_L9wpOqJcbvARzvSLoTKgjzo7LRsbZQU"> Christ is a tested stone which has been tried and which is trustworthy. Christ as a stone was tested during the thirty-three and a half years of His human life. From the time that He became a man, He was tested every day of His earthly life, and He had no failure. He is perfect, complete, solid, and strong. He is fully qualified to be our foundation because He has been tested. </p>
<p data-content-id="ok4KA4atXxC4_GGUgoqLTJdGLSzicZp2Ck3w9wYZEOloEhZlx-sLpr5qWuMH_IR_Y"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54861" data-verses="Isaiah 28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, he who believes in this tried and trustworthy stone “will not hasten away.” The King James Version renders this portion as “shall not make haste.” Darby says in a note that this can be translated as “shall not hasten with fear.” This can also mean “will not hurry in panic.” Christ is a trustworthy stone, and we believe in Him. Whatever happens to us, we do not need to be in haste or in panic. We can be at peace. The worldly people, even including Christians who do not trust the Lord so much, are always in haste, in panic, whenever something happens to them. In their haste they do not know what they should do. </p>

<p data-content-id="uoR14bixKWKAhAFIiEKXTSoy9YzaDIV0czj5nw-Z1vb3lXpZFhrT300F6GkynCLgZ"> In the previous message we pointed out that the book of Isaiah may be divided into two sections. The first section is composed of the first thirty-nine chapters, and the second section is composed of the final twenty-seven chapters. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54907" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Chapter forty</span>, the first chapter in the second section, shows us Christ as Jehovah the Savior. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54908" data-verses="Isaiah 41:1">Chapters forty-one through sixty-six</span> reveal Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. As the Servant of Jehovah, He is typified by three persons—Cyrus, Isaiah, and Israel. In the book of Isaiah, Cyrus is presented in a very good and positive sense. God said that He chose Cyrus, loved Cyrus, and appointed Cyrus to carry out His commission. In Isaiah, Cyrus typifies Christ. Isaiah, the prophet of Jehovah, also typifies Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. Israel as the corporate servant of Jehovah also typifies Christ. Christ is the totality of Israel. In this message we want to see the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54909" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Isaiah 40</span>, where Christ is revealed as Jehovah the Savior, as the glad tidings. </p>
<p data-content-id="fR3FSAPwpELEt7o898BPibnPLcIjkJG41RF-XGMr8wANynIdYRkLxYxdC1pZYDojA"> The book of Isaiah is not easy to understand. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54910" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Chapter forty</span> may be considered as the most difficult chapter in this book. Isaiah wrote this chapter in a marvelous way with a definite prophecy concerning John the Baptist. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54911" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Chapters forty through sixty-six</span>, altogether twenty-seven chapters, may be considered as one word from Jehovah to His chastised, chosen people, Israel. This word is a word of comfort. In the first thirty-five chapters, Isaiah did not have a good feeling about Israel. He rebuked, condemned, and exposed Israel to the uttermost. Jeremiah is even stronger than Isaiah in this <span class="pg" data-page-id="310" id="310">[310]</span> respect. He points out repeatedly how evil Israel is. The first thirty-five chapters of Isaiah are full of his rebuking of Israel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54912" data-verses="Isaiah 36:1">Chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine</span> are an interval concerning one person—Hezekiah. After this short history of four chapters, Isaiah’s tone altogether changes. There is no more rebuking or condemnation. Instead there is Jehovah’s word of comfort to Israel, and the beginning of the word of Jehovah is the glad tidings. Isaiah says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54913" data-verses="Isaiah 40:9">40:9</span>, “Here is your God!” As long as God is here, the glad tidings are here. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2AlQGFEtbY3V68hEJdMp7snkDnm-QbOPj1PY3loDh0BSFBk1Q1m_bAmK-r0giaBC"> The New Testament shows that God came to man as Jesus, the incarnated One. God Himself was incarnated (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54914" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54915" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). That was His coming to man. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54916" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span> records how God came to Abraham. He came with two angels to visit Abraham. He and these angels all were in the form of men when they came to Abraham, but Jesus came in a different way. He came in the way of incarnation, the way of entering into man and becoming a man to directly participate in man’s humanity, partaking of man’s blood and flesh. For His coming there was the need of a forerunner to usher in the incarnated God to His people. This forerunner was John the Baptist. The New Testament opens with John’s ushering, recommendation, and introduction of the incarnated God. </p>

Jehovah the Savior, Jesus, was ushered in by the voice of John the Baptist crying in the wilderness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54918" data-verses="Isaiah 40:3">verse 3</span>, the voice cries, “Make clear / The way of Jehovah; / Make straight in the desert / A highway for our God.” To make clear the way of Jehovah is to make clear the way of Jesus. Jesus is the New Testament Jehovah. Jehovah and Jesus are one person. In the Old Testament, the name of Jesus is Jehovah, and in the New Testament the name of Jehovah is Jesus. To make clear the way of Jehovah is to make straight in the desert a highway for our God. The way of Jehovah, Jesus, is a highway for our God. This means that Jesus is our God. </p>

If there was a valley, a bridge was over it. The terrain was leveled and adjusted so that the highways could be constructed. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZQ5ZOI_t6lKDRPvgSN9Kwlyl1AC8cJuDm5UqbcECOt5pUvu52v_X7zsCFrdRWWuEC"> We need to consider what Isaiah means by making a highway for our God. To prepare the way of Jehovah is to prepare our heart. Jesus comes with the intention of getting into our spirit, but to enter into our spirit, He must pass through our heart. Our heart is composed of four parts—the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience. The human heart is full of valleys, mountains, hills, crooked places, and rough places. </p>
<p data-content-id="AvPRXCDvWPiXRWBLHvk1Ou8He2zbBZw8VeVejT0nSqA7E0kK3cIPJSEiiXJm5nqH4"> Before we were saved was our heart straight or crooked? Was it fine or rough? In our heart there were valleys, mountains, crooked places, and rough places. Even now we have to confess that our heart is not that straight, not that level. Our heart is still crooked and rough. The highway is a paved heart. Every part and avenue of our heart need to be straightened by the Lord through repentance that the Lord may enter into us to be our life and take possession of us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54920" data-verses="Luke 1:17">Luke 1:17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="FGittJXCVs1rkWe7ktAfr5VJgBIcZfHlxi6UoKmz6jdb4AkrfS1FmkAs3rLH6WK0t"> Our mind may be full of crooked places, and our emotion may be very rough. We may be cold toward the Lord. This is why John was crying in the wilderness to make straight in the desert a highway for our God. The human heart is like a desert full of crooked and rough places. What is our heart like? Is it straight and paved, without valleys, mountains, crooked places, or rough places? This is John the Baptist’s crying word to usher in the Savior, who is Jesus as the revealing of Jehovah God. </p>

In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus told us that He was sent by the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54926" data-verses="John 5:36-37">5:36b-37a</span>) and that He did not speak from Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54927" data-verses="John 14:10">14:10</span>).

<p data-content-id="qLcT4wgKp4K96nzb-VAi7uxUcKCVCtmQ-ddLWU3OUWeWKVVKtz4shHE650_vNmZDU"> In this message we want to see Christ as the Servant of Jehovah typified by three persons—first, by a Gentile king, Cyrus the king of Persia; second, by God’s selected corporate people, Israel; and third, by a typical, bonafide, top prophet of Jehovah, Isaiah. All three were God’s servants in the sense of a type. Because Christ is so great, many types are needed to describe Him. The Old Testament is full of types of Christ. In the New Testament, the four Gospels portray Christ in four aspects, but He has many, many aspects. In the book of Isaiah we can see many aspects of the all-inclusive Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="yL2Ky-HIjJpVThJMPlOjawIzcB9B7hyN5AS9cHjRMy64K2UMPG0rJxFZdOU2W4lcc"> Isaiah was a wonderful, poetic writer. His writing is long. We have pointed out previously that the sections of Isaiah are very significant. The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah symbolize all the significances in the contents of the Old Testament, which is composed of thirty-nine books. The thirty-nine books of the Old Testament may be considered as the element, and the first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah are the essence extracted from this element. The last twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah are the second section of this book, and they correspond to the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. This section of twenty-seven chapters can be considered as the essence of the New Testament, the extract of the real significance of the New Testament. This extract is concerning one person. Today we call Him the Lord Jesus Christ, which equals the Lord Jehovah in the Old Testament. <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> The Lord Jehovah is the Old Testament Lord Jesus Christ, and the Lord Jesus Christ is the New Testament Lord Jehovah. </p>
<p data-content-id="8E91CI8WBa01w0bEiW0LI13wkXM70BpxbK9wQvTVRzk8lV-uoWmAAoyE0h-_tRuC9"> The first chapter of the second section of Isaiah is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54984" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">chapter forty</span>, where Christ is revealed as Jehovah the Savior. In this chapter what is covered is the revealing of the Lord Jehovah. Revealing means manifesting. When a person is hidden, concealed, and covered, we cannot see him. When his covering is removed, he is revealed to us. This means He is manifested. The revealing is the manifestation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54985" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Chapter forty</span> covers the revealing of the Lord Jehovah, which is the manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ. In this chapter Isaiah declares, “Here is your God!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54986" data-verses="Isaiah 40:9">v. 9</span>). The revealing of the Lord Jehovah is the appearing of the very God, and this Lord Jehovah, the very God, is the Lord Jesus Christ. Jehovah, the Lord God, appears as the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior. </p>
<p data-content-id="0C8OwT_hU8xxS8d8SQBYp53C6Tusq86ZLv7NeC1igx0uvAO8X3dOR65YnTutEvaR-"> From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54987" data-verses="Isaiah 41:1">chapters forty-one through sixty-six</span>, Christ is revealed as the Servant of Jehovah. These twenty-six chapters cover this one person. In this message we want to cover the revelation of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54988" data-verses="Isaiah 41:1">chapters forty-one through fifty</span>. In these ten chapters there are four servants of God—Cyrus, the Gentile king; Israel, God’s chosen corporate people; Isaiah, God’s wonderful prophet; and Christ. They are four, but eventually they are one, so they are four-in-one. </p>
<p data-content-id="7Cq8OFR2k0o5VhNZcdPHw9F0VAnivjkCp4IsrDaFEu5DXx3xmJfCnIW6iFZ3cxZj5"> Now we need to consider what these servants as types of Christ did and what Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is doing today. They surely were one with God to carry out His commission to build the temple as the center and reality of God’s interest on the earth. Today’s temple in the New Testament is the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54989" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:16-17">1 Cor. 3:16-17</span>). The church is not a physical building with a tower and a bell. Paul tells us that the church is God manifested in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54990" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15-16">1 Tim. 3:15-16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ok4KA4atXxC4_GGUgoqLVJdGDSzicZp2Ck3w9wYZEOloEhZlx-sLpr5qWuMH_IR_Y"> Both the Old and New Testaments talk about the church. However, in the New Testament, Paul tells us that the church was hidden in the Old Testament. It was a mystery (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54991" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4-5">Eph. 3:4-5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="54992" data-verses="Ephesians 3:9">9</span>). Although the church was hidden in appearance in the Old Testament, in type it was not hidden. Eve, for example, was the wife of Adam to be the type of the church as <span class="pg" data-page-id="319" id="319">[319]</span> Christ’s counterpart. If we want to know the church, we need to know the type of Eve. Eve as the counterpart of Adam has a number of very significant points. Eve was built with Adam’s rib (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54993" data-verses="Genesis 2:22">Gen. 2:22</span>). God used this rib to build a woman. Eve was out of Adam. This signifies that the church is something out of Christ. Thus, the church was not created. The church was built up with something that has come out of Christ. Without the type of Eve, we could not understand the church that well. Eve was out of Adam and eventually went back to Adam to be one flesh with Adam. This is a good picture of the church in a type. The Old Testament is full of types of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="3BADcAnW9OEC5k8Yd7Uyvj5Kc5egJ3xQPJp_FOL39Tr6GcaslKhpsLMjyFet50hDV"> The New Testament speaks of the church as the kingdom of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54994" data-verses="Romans 14:17">Rom. 14:17</span>) and the house of God, the household of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54995" data-verses="Ephesians 2:19">Eph. 2:19</span>). The house, the dwelling place, is also the household, those who dwell in the house. The church as the household is composed of the sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54996" data-verses="Galatians 3:26">Gal. 3:26</span>), the members of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54997" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:12">1 Cor. 12:12</span>). The church is also the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54998" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">Eph. 1:22-23</span>) and the new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="54999" data-verses="Ephesians 2:15">2:15</span>). Thus, the church is the kingdom of God, the house of God, the household of God, the sons of God, the members of Christ, the Body of Christ, and the new man. Eventually, the church will consummate in the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55000" data-verses="Revelation 21:2">Rev. 21:2</span>). The new man is enlarged to be the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the holy city, the tabernacle of God and the temple of God. All of these aspects of the church can be seen in typology in the Old Testament. Paul said the church was hidden as a mystery, but the church is not hidden in the types in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="GJDDUPDDLX0o4Er94zmb2XfEGmpDzlv3f1-hon_Kz_82lAUhb8Q4Ir7xA9OciutNq"> We need to see the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ from the types in the book of Isaiah. In Isaiah, God has four servants: Cyrus, Israel, Isaiah, and Jesus Christ, the coming Messiah. What did they do? They built up a city, that is, the kingdom of God. The city is a symbol of the kingdom. They also built up the temple, and the temple is a symbol of God’s house with God’s people as God’s household. Israel was God’s people, and Isaiah and Christ were both a part of Israel. They were both Jewish. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55001" data-verses="Hosea 11:1">Hosea 11:1</span> Israel refers to Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55002" data-verses="Matthew 2:15">Matt. 2:15</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="320" id="320">[320]</span> </p>

He did God’s pleasure on Babylon, symbolizing the Roman Catholic Church in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55011" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17</span>. He was God’s counselor (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55012" data-verses="Isaiah 46:11">Isa. 46:11b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55013" data-verses="Hebrews 10:7">Heb. 10:7</span>) to subdue the nations and have dominion over the kings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55014" data-verses="Isaiah 41:2">Isa. 41:2b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55015" data-verses="Isaiah 41:25">25c</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55016" data-verses="Isaiah 45:1">45:1b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55017" data-verses="Ezra 1:2">Ezra 1:2a</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55018" data-verses="Acts 5:31">Acts 5:31a</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55019" data-verses="Revelation 1:5">Rev. 1:5a</span>). He was also Jehovah’s shepherd for the fulfilling of His desire in building up the city (symbolizing the kingdom) and the temple of God and in releasing God’s captives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55020" data-verses="Isaiah 44:28">Isa. 44:28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55021" data-verses="Isaiah 45:13">45:13b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55022" data-verses="Ezra 1:2-3">Ezra 1:2-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55023" data-verses="John 10:11">John 10:11</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55024" data-verses="John 5:30">5:30b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55025" data-verses="John 2:19">2:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55026" data-verses="Luke 4:18">Luke 4:18b</span>). In all of the above aspects, Cyrus was a type of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. </p>
<p data-content-id="EDD4W4Bi8P_kanjIZpkX0tygTj3m-fMlSC_LE2PNygKjPm1E-k1y3WoflKMCat_Eg"> Isaiah tells us that Cyrus was the one whom God chose, whom God raised up, whom God called, whom God anointed, whom God loved, and the one who would do God’s pleasure to make God happy all the time. He was loved by God and worked to please God, to do God’s good pleasure. God’s good pleasure is His people, Israel. Israel was God’s counterpart. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55027" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:1">Jeremiah 2</span> speaks of the bridal love, the honeymoon love, between Jehovah and Israel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55028" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Verse 2</span> says, “Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals; how thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown” (ASV). In the Bible the honeymoon love is called the bridal love. Jehovah was married to Israel and had a honeymoon with them. At that time they both enjoyed the bridal love. It is amazing that these romantic terms came out of the mouth of Jehovah God. He fell in love with Israel. God is the Husband, and His redeemed people are His wife. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55029" data-verses="Jeremiah 3:14">Jeremiah 3:14</span> God said that He was Israel’s Husband. </p>

The covenant is also a matter of righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="lRnGBbKnFFwheo_id-w4FHnhoZ8gVcFhd5jkSJRN7ha8wanPDUFPhcvoB8-OKcwsT"> Paul said in Romans that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55092" data-verses="Romans 1:16">1:16</span>). Unto salvation means for salvation. To do anything we need power. The power of electricity is for all our electrical conveniences. The gospel is the power of God for us to be saved, for our salvation. This is because in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55093" data-verses="Romans 1:17">v. 17</span>). God has saved us not only by His love and not only by His grace but also by His righteousness. His righteousness binds Him, and His righteousness gives us the ground, the standing, to say, “God, You have to save me.” If God did not save us when we repented and believed into the Lord Jesus, He would not be righteous. <span class="pg" data-page-id="328" id="328">[328]</span> God’s Son, our Savior, died for us to fulfill all the requirements of God’s righteousness. That was according to the law, so the law has been fulfilled. The legal requirements of God have been fulfilled by our Savior according to God’s righteousness. Thus, God has to save us according to His righteousness. He has to justify us. </p>
<p data-content-id="Owq2f2I7NIYFk__C2ywsLpoUd1kxR__Fg1-1HGnPDzxmpjvxRJoOnponCYjgQHroH"> Before the death of our Savior, God could condemn us. We did not have any ground to claim any kind of justification, forgiveness, and salvation. But now His death has accomplished all the requirements of God’s righteousness according to His law, so this death gives us a righteous ground. Now God has to forgive us, justify us, and save us. </p>
<p data-content-id="42lYhddcih55Tpki129kb8ooHJQYZYNlC_L9wpOqJcbvARzvSLoTKgjzo7LRsbZQU"> In the early years of my Christian life, I was not this bold. I was always begging. I was afraid that God might regret that He made a mistake in saving me. If He were to change His mind, my salvation would be gone. Later I came to know that God saved me not only by love and not only by grace but also by righteousness. Whether we are good or bad, God has to save us because our Savior died for us to fulfill all of God’s righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="v8bXBUaOMzEw-TiNL5Z2pXlBd97nmg86AjAc50n7OsvDdfqaWEWKpdyEo4hVS0NFL"> The justification, the forgiveness, and the salvation God renders to us have all been “covenanted.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55094" data-verses="Matthew 26:1">Matthew 26</span> the Lord Jesus enacted a new covenant, saying, “For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55095" data-verses="Matthew 26:28">v. 28</span>). The new covenant is the Lord’s blood, and His blood signifies His death. He died for our sins and transgressions. The symbol of His death is the blood. The blood was the very means by which He made for us the new testament with His Father. Thus, redemption, justification, forgiveness, and salvation have all been covenanted by Him through His blood. Today our salvation is a covenanted salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="WJ5aP-FOAwwmtqgyigvpkzgpaz5_2hxzBbpu9V9IDxIMpTzB5bTDMszy1Pz0KJtzc"> We can use the buying of a house to illustrate this. We may say we have bought a house, but we need the title deed as a proof of our purchase. The deed is an agreement, a covenant. The house has been covenanted to us, and the guarantee of this covenant is the title deed. Our purchase has been covenanted. It has been legalized. In a sense, we may <span class="pg" data-page-id="329" id="329">[329]</span> say that the title deed, the covenant, equals the house. The title deed to the house is the covenant, and the covenant is the house. </p>

This means that God’s salvation, God’s blessings, and all of God’s riches have been covenanted to us, and this covenant is just Christ. Just as my title deed equals my house, Christ equals all of God’s salvation, blessings, grace, reality, and riches. All of this has been covenanted to us. Our covenant is Christ. God’s salvation, God’s righteousness, God’s justification, God’s forgiveness, God’s redemption, God’s riches, and all He has and will do have been covenanted to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="uoR14bixKWKAhAFIiEKXRSoj0YzaDIV0czj5nw-Z1vb3lXpZFhrT300F6GkynCLgZ"> In Greek the word for covenant is also the word for testament. Every proper covenant eventually becomes a testament. Before the person who enacted the covenant dies, it is the covenant. After he dies, that covenant becomes a testament. A testament in today’s terms is a will. What if your father had a will which said that you were entitled to ten million dollars, twenty houses, and fifteen commercial ships. Would you not be happy? Our Father in heaven has given us a lot of things. We have a will full of hundreds of bequests. My heavenly Father has given me all these bequests, and they have been covenanted to me as a testament. That is the new testament. We have the New Testament of the Bible in our hands, but this is not the reality. The reality of all the hundreds of bequests in the New Testament is Christ. Without Christ, the Bible is empty, so the real testament, the real will, is Christ. Christ is our title deed, and this title deed is in our spirit as the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, consummated Spirit. </p>

We know that we have been forgiven, justified, redeemed, and saved because the Bible tells us so. The Bible is God’s covenant, and after Christ’s death this covenant has become a testament, a will. But without Christ the Bible is empty. Actually, Christ is the covenant, and this Christ who is the covenant is in our spirit and has become one spirit with us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55098" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="330" id="330">[330]</span> </p>

A will is a legal matter that does not depend upon love or grace. It depends on the law, and the law is a matter of righteousness. Christ has been given to us as such a legal covenant. He is our forgiveness, our justification, our redemption, and our salvation. This is not my word. This is Paul’s logic. Paul said that the gospel is the power of God to save because the righteousness of God is in the gospel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55099" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">First Corinthians 1:30</span> tells us that God has made Christ our righteousness. This righteousness is wrapped up with God’s covenant. God’s salvation today is a covenanted salvation. Today the very salvation and redemption we have received is covenanted by Jesus Christ. He Himself actually is the covenant. </p>

<p data-content-id="EDD4W4Bi8P_kanjIZpkX2tyxcj3m-fMlSC_LE2PNygKjPm1E-k1y3WoflKMCat_Eg"> In this message I would like to say more concerning Christ as the covenant and the light to God’s chosen people. Why did Christ need to be given to us by God as a covenant? What is the significance of this? Apparently, it is not difficult to grasp logically the thought that Christ is the light given by God to the nations. But the thought that God has given Christ to us as a covenant is difficult to grasp. Nevertheless, we need to realize that in these two matters, the covenant and the light, the entire Bible is embodied. The entire Scripture of sixty-six books is embodied in these two things—in Christ being the covenant and in Christ being the light. </p>
<p data-content-id="DSgijqH7I3eza2ivBfof6nH8yaCyUwpg7PL2m3xGMv7aVYPK1L11f4RkD4W1mOBaY"> There is a clear word in two portions of the Bible that says that Christ has been given to us, God’s chosen people, first as the covenant and, second, as the light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55224" data-verses="Isaiah 42:5-7">Isa. 42:5-7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55225" data-verses="Isaiah 49:6">49:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55226" data-verses="Isaiah 49:8-9">8b-9a</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55227" data-verses="Isaiah 42:6">Isaiah 42:6b</span> says, “I have kept You [Christ] and I have given You / As a covenant for the people, as a light for the nations,” and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55228" data-verses="Isaiah 49:6">Isaiah 49:6b</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55229" data-verses="Isaiah 49:8">8b</span> say, “I will also set You as a light of the nations / That you may be My salvation to the ends of the earth....And I will preserve You and give You for a covenant of the people.” </p>
<p data-content-id="SmYb8X5DkMX1is5fBiyvNEGC_TJreiRZgwNut5F5ur9fZrkZrs1dBJeO_jB-pFaTl"> We should be deeply impressed when we read such a word. <span class="pg" data-page-id="344" id="344">[344]</span> Many Christians, when they come to the Word of God, see only the shallow things. When they read a chapter such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55230" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span>, they prefer to see that wives should submit to their husbands and that husbands should love their wives. This is according to their taste, their preference. Although the Bible does teach that wives should submit to their husbands and that husbands should love their wives, this is a very small item in the teaching of the Bible. The principal item unveiled in the Bible is God’s economy. God’s economy is to dispense Himself into us as our life, our person, and our everything. This is what the Bible teaches, and this is what the Old Testament and the New Testament unveil to us. But, sorry to say, nearly all the readers of the Bible have their eyes covered concerning this matter, and thus they cannot see this. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gscF4m7-lUlMCcyyYPNz_PRIonyTDtR8LWYqxUMZF3D3BVVmY2BWD0HZjB0SqwQxg">I. GOD’S FULL SALVATION BEING BASED ON<br/>HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND CONSUMMATED IN HIS LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="evZWGvKilH-_j1AxvIVyjseiR7V6_icIqi73-4obRHEd5xAVW1XeP2quVKqJ44fBo"> The Bible shows us that God has an economy, an eternal plan, to dispense Himself into us as our life, our person, and our everything. Unfortunately, however, after man was created, he became fallen. In man’s fall, man broke the requirements of God’s righteousness. As a result, man was condemned by the righteousness of God. Now, between us, the fallen sinners, and God there is the problem of condemnation. All the sinners, all the descendants of Adam, are under God’s condemnation because of the breaching of God’s righteousness. Thus, we need God’s justification to erase God’s condemnation. There is no other way for God to erase our condemnation but by God’s justification. </p>
<p data-content-id="gscF4m7-lUlMCcyyYPNz_PRtinyTDtR8LWYqxUMZF3D3BVVmY2BWD0HZjB0SqwQxg"> The Israelites, the people of God under the old testament, tried their best to establish their own righteousness so that they might be justified by God based on their own righteousness. But their righteousness was not up to the standard of God’s justification (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55231" data-verses="Romans 9:31">Rom. 9:31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55232" data-verses="Romans 10:3">10:3</span>). God’s justification is according to the highest standard, the standard of His righteousness. Paul told us clearly that for this purpose God has given Christ to us as the righteousness of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55233" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">First Corinthians 1:30</span> says that God first put us into Christ and then made Christ His righteousness to us. Thus, the first <span class="pg" data-page-id="345" id="345">[345]</span> item that Christ is to us is the righteousness of God. We do not need to establish our own righteousness. Needless to say, it is impossible for us to do this. Even if we were able to establish our own righteousness, that righteousness would not measure up to the standard of God’s righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="evZWGvKilH-_j1AxvIVyjseDa7V6_icIqi73-4obRHEd5xAVW1XeP2quVKqJ44fBo"> Our righteousness is like yellow dust, whereas God’s righteousness is like bright yellow gold. The standard of our righteousness is far too low. Thus, if we bring our own righteousness to God, this means nothing. This is why the Bible says that no flesh, that is, no fallen man, shall be justified by God through his own works of keeping the law (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55234" data-verses="Romans 3:20">Rom. 3:20</span>). Whatever we do, regardless of how much we can accomplish according to the law, does not match God’s requirement and thus does not measure up to the standard of God’s justification. Only the righteousness of God is able to match such a standard. </p>
<p data-content-id="5cfSks8f9T4wzhajEBGG2glzFKabj3mMDfXnmEjpE8oTiQFZRNSodjL8n4i8NSKGW"> The Old Testament gives us a good illustration, the illustration of Abraham’s gaining a son, to show that man’s righteousness cannot meet the standard of God’s justification. In a very real sense, Abraham’s son Isaac signifies God’s righteousness. God promised Abraham that he would have a son from God and that this son would be a blessing to all the nations of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55235" data-verses="Genesis 15:3-5">Gen. 15:3-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55236" data-verses="Genesis 18:10">18:10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55237" data-verses="Genesis 18:14">14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55238" data-verses="Genesis 22:18">22:18</span>). But Sarah, Abraham’s wife, proposed that he bear a son through her maidservant, Hagar, and Abraham accepted that proposal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55239" data-verses="Genesis 16:1-4">Gen. 16:1-4a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55240" data-verses="Genesis 16:15">15</span>). What Abraham produced by that means was Ishmael, who was rejected by God. God told Abraham to send Ishmael away (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55241" data-verses="Genesis 21:10-12">Gen. 21:10-12</span>). Hence, what Abraham produced did not count. Only what God gave counted. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55242" data-verses="Genesis 15:6">Genesis 15:6</span> says that after hearing God’s word, Abraham believed God, and his believing was counted by God as righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="N-FUGiukulHdfeeBKJW8qUWI-C3Vtiyq3naFoqKsOXoQOjoaDnKgOEo_CqDPuh31a"> Hence, God’s righteousness can be seen in the comparison between these two boys, Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael surely did not match God’s righteousness. Only Isaac matched God’s righteousness. The unique way in which Abraham could receive such a son that equaled God’s righteousness was by faith. The apostle Paul said the same thing. He said that we should not endeavor to establish our own righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55243" data-verses="Romans 10:3">Rom. 10:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55244" data-verses="Philippians 3:9">Phil. 3:9</span>). That would produce Ishmael, and it would <span class="pg" data-page-id="346" id="346">[346]</span> never be counted by God as what He desires. We must believe God; then we will receive something from Him, and that something is Christ as today’s Isaac. This Christ is the righteousness of God given to us as our righteousness, our acceptance by God, and this eventually becomes the blessing. Today God’s intention is to give Himself, embodied in Christ, as everything to us. So we need to receive Him first as our righteousness, then as our life, then as our person, then as our everything, and finally as our inheritance. </p>
<p data-content-id="t8bnQrQm6FdShy-EgcXzRYG29TTSXQfcZGteWHR3UQg52r_TcQ6cbm7M6CShPFDoa"> Now we need to consider how this Christ could be our righteousness given to us by God. First, as the righteousness of God and as our Substitute, Christ had to die. God’s righteousness required Christ to die a vicarious death for us, and Christ did this. In the evening before His death, He established a table for His disciples that they might remember Him and enjoy Him. In that establishing of the Lord’s table, He took the cup and said to His disciples, “This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55245" data-verses="Luke 22:20">Luke 22:20</span>). This word connects the thought of God’s righteousness with Christ’s blood. It is through Christ’s blood that we can receive and gain God’s forgiveness, and God’s forgiveness equals God’s justification. When God justifies us, He forgives us, and when God forgives us, He justifies us. According to the word of the Lord Jesus, this forgiveness, or this justification, is fully based on Christ’s death, which has fulfilled all the requirements of God’s righteousness. </p>

<p data-content-id="MtvmNOQoEXWPJrXLSOVJvlasQ4o0Rx1dcmIVN6QiUkC-QwmmcWMvUGGb6XF0aziH7"> In this message we will cover three points concerning Christ’s being the Servant of Jehovah—the arm of Jehovah, the reigning God, and the exalted Christ. Isaiah is a book of sixty-six chapters. In previous messages we pointed out that the first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah correspond to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, and the last twenty-seven chapters correspond to the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55327" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Chapter forty</span>, the first chapter of the last twenty-seven, is the same as the beginning of the New Testament, in which John the Baptist was introduced. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55328" data-verses="Isaiah 40:3-5">Verses 3-5</span> of that chapter, speaking of John the Baptist, say, “The voice of one who cries / In the wilderness: Make clear / The way of Jehovah; / Make straight in the desert / A highway for our God. / Every valley will be lifted up, / And every mountain and hill will be made low, / And the crooked places will become straight, / And the rough places, a broad plain. / Then the glory of Jehovah will be revealed, / And all flesh will see it together, / Because the mouth of Jehovah has spoken” (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55329" data-verses="Matthew 3:3">Matt. 3:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55330" data-verses="Mark 1:3">Mark 1:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55331" data-verses="Luke 3:4-6">Luke 3:4-6</span>). Immediately after this chapter that introduces the New Testament, there are twenty-six chapters, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55332" data-verses="Isaiah 41:1">chapter forty-one through chapter sixty-six</span>, concerning Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. </p>
<p data-content-id="VG1BawJMM7x2I8Q1-xnAD7g7uEg3yJ32rYr_aqOpNv8d2Qc_Ih4-0lnhtsdV5yxzA"> We need to see that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah, occupying twenty-six chapters in Isaiah, is mainly for Israel’s return and restoration. When these twenty-six chapters were <span class="pg" data-page-id="358" id="358">[358]</span> written in the way of prophecy, Israel was destined to be scattered, to be captured, to be exiled from their fathers’ land to some foreign lands to suffer there. In such a condition of captivity and exile, they needed Christ as the Servant of Jehovah to serve them in order to bring them back from their captivity and also to restore them. As captives in Babylon, the Israelites needed not only to be released but also to return to their fathers’ land. Then, after their return, they needed to be restored. Their nation was devastated to the uttermost. It had become a desolation, an uninhabitable wilderness, with no rain, no soil for growing crops, and no food for people to eat. Surely they needed a restoration. Thus, Isaiah has twenty-six chapters on Christ serving God’s elect to bring them back and to restore them. </p>

The first two of these items—the arm of Jehovah and the reigning God—have the tone of the Old Testament. But the final item—the exalted Christ—does not bear an Old Testament tone; rather, it is an item of God’s New Testament economy. This final item is mentioned at the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55335" data-verses="Isaiah 52:1">Isaiah 52</span>, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55336" data-verses="Isaiah 52:13-15">verses 13-15</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55337" data-verses="Isaiah 52:1">Chapter fifty-two</span> is continued by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55338" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">chapter fifty-three</span>.

Put on strength, / O arm of Jehovah; / Arise as in the days of old, / As in the generations of past ages.” This is not Jehovah’s speaking but Isaiah’s, representing the people of God. Isaiah seemed to cry out, “Arise, arise, O arm of Jehovah and put on Your strength! Do the same things that You did in the days of old. Do You not remember how You dried up the <span class="pg" data-page-id="359" id="359">[359]</span> sea and made it a highway for us all to walk through? Do the same thing today to bring back all those who are in exile.” </p>

<p data-content-id="a2P39prM6EX_HLBQX5h9xO5Mo-6UKpnpKVeApXqgSU0gO2Ybw4I7I1oV3UtONDpf6"> The arm of Jehovah signifies the strength of Jehovah.

In the exodus from Egypt, the first obstacle the children of Israel met was the Red Sea. Behind them Pharaoh’s army was chasing them, and in front of them was the Red Sea. They could do nothing about the situation, but the arm of Jehovah did something. He caused a strong wind to blow so that the water was divided. The sea was dried up, and Israel walked in the sea on dry land. Isaiah was burdened that the arm of Jehovah would do the same thing in his day so that the captives of Israel would be brought back. </p>
<p data-content-id="8E91CI8WBa01w0bEiW0LF13ppXM70BpxbK9wQvTVRzk8lV-uoWmAAoyE0h-_tRuC9"> In Isaiah’s prophecy Christ has a name which is called “the arm of Jehovah.” This name is mentioned not only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55360" data-verses="Isaiah 51:9">51:9</span> but also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55361" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">53:1</span>, where Isaiah shouted, “Who has believed our report? / And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?” The arm of Jehovah mentioned in both of these verses is Christ. Christ is the arm of Jehovah, who is the Triune God, the great I Am. Christ is the arm of Jehovah to save God’s people. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="0C8OwT_hU8xxS8d8SQBYk53n4Tusq86ZLv7NeC1igx0uvAO8X3dOR65YnTutEvaR-">B. For the Redeemed of Jehovah<br/>to Return and to Come to Zion<br/>with a Ringing Shout and Eternal Joy</h2><p data-content-id="7Cq8OFR2k0o5VhNZcdPH99FVWAnivjkCp4IsrDaFEu5DXx3xmJfCnIW6iFZ3cxZj5"> The arm of Jehovah’s arising and putting on strength as in the days of old is for the redeemed of Jehovah to return and to come to Zion with a ringing shout and eternal joy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55362" data-verses="Isaiah 51:11">51:11</span>). In the Bible, in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, we are told that God’s people need God’s redemption. This is because we as God’s elect often become fallen. Whenever there is a fall, there is the need of redemption. First, we fell into sin. Humanly speaking, because we fell into sin, we may feel that we need deliverance. But legally speaking, according to God’s economy, we need God’s redemption to redeem us from sin. Human beings do not have such a thought because human beings do not know God’s government. God’s government always <span class="pg" data-page-id="361" id="361">[361]</span> involves the matter of righteousness. Our falling into sin involves God’s righteousness. For God to come to rescue us is not simple. Before God can rescue us, there must be a redemption that fulfills the requirements of God’s righteousness. </p>

<p data-content-id="wl8xsYLSuZClCRTKGBdspFHQIlHmYEkQnLlaHP7tDTdBXGw5RHixpzekYzX350c8O"> The last three verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55422" data-verses="Isaiah 52:1">chapter fifty-two</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55423" data-verses="Isaiah 52:13-15">verses 13-15</span>, and the first verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55424" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">chapter fifty-three</span> should be put together. This portion of Isaiah’s record is very difficult for people to understand. Such a portion was included in the holy Word because people’s knowledge concerning Christ differs. Generally speaking, people either do not know Christ, or they know Christ in a natural way as some kind of great person. This kind of knowledge can be found in the Old Testament. There are a number of Old Testament verses that speak concerning the different aspects of Christ’s greatness, such as His majesty, His authority, and His power. In the previous message we mentioned three items in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55425" data-verses="Isaiah 51:1-2">Isaiah 51 and 52</span> concerning the knowledge of Christ. The first item is to know Christ as the arm of Jehovah, which refers to the strength, the might, and the power of Jehovah. Then, the second item is to know Christ as the reigning God. Surely these two are items of Christ’s greatness. At the end of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55426" data-verses="Isaiah 52:1">Isaiah 52</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55427" data-verses="Isaiah 52:13">verse 13</span> says, “Behold, My Servant will act wisely and will prosper; / He will be exalted and lifted up and very high.” We may think that this refers to Christ’s acting wisely to do great things. But if we enter into this portion of the Word, we will realize that this is not the meaning here. </p>
<p data-content-id="LQhDs-iNd9dq5o_tTmhXpPDJvkq7ZljdgsiBluha_pnPIx6DSXOLgZBEdGTR9gpyK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55428" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:22-24">First Corinthians 1:22-24</span> says, “For indeed Jews require <span class="pg" data-page-id="372" id="372">[372]</span> signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.” Thus, in 1 Corinthians wisdom refers to Christ. However, the wisdom mentioned here does not refer to the wisdom exercised in creating the universe. According to the context, the wisdom and power in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55429" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:22-24">1 Corinthians 1:22-24</span> both refer to Christ as the deep things of God, that is, the depths of God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55430" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:10-11">First Corinthians 2:10-11</span> says that only the Spirit of God can search the depths of God. The depths of God are the deeper items of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="mXH6jwyIvlIyW-cyafhzs1XFK-33SIuk3R5HgJphRIFLi_LVDUGLN4j-Olw06YPmP"> The first deeper item of Christ is Christ’s crucifixion, Christ’s cross, mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55431" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>. No one can understand why Christ, who was God incarnated as a man and who could have called more than twelve legions of angels to protect Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55432" data-verses="Matthew 26:53">Matt. 26:53</span>), was willing to be nailed to the cross and to hang there for six hours. This is one item of the depths of God concerning Christ. Then, Christ died on that cross. Who understands fully the meaning, the significance, of Christ’s death? The understanding that, because we were sinners, God sent His Son to die for us so that He could save us according to His love is correct, but it is too superficial. The death of Christ has a much deeper significance than this. In its deeper significance, Christ’s death not only involved Christ Himself but also included us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55433" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). Furthermore, Christ’s death terminated all the ordinances among mankind concerning the different ways of living (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55434" data-verses="Ephesians 2:14-15">Eph. 2:14-15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55435" data-verses="Colossians 2:14">Col. 2:14</span>). This too is something deeper concerning the significance of Christ’s death. Then, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55436" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>, Christ’s death, like a grain of wheat falling into the ground, released God’s divine life. Christ’s death also judged the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55437" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>) and destroyed the one who has the might of death, that is, the devil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55438" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). These are additional items of the deeper significance of Christ’s death. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZQ5ZOI_t6lKDRPvgSN9K9lyE-AC8cJuDm5UqbcECOt5pUvu52v_X7zsCFrdRWWuEC"> Another item of the depths of God concerning Christ is Christ’s resurrection. Apparently, Christ’s resurrection was simply His rising up from death. However, the resurrection of Christ was much more than merely His rising up. According to its deeper significance, the resurrection of Christ was a <span class="pg" data-page-id="373" id="373">[373]</span> great birth. In the resurrection of Christ, not only Christ Himself was born (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55439" data-verses="John 16:20-22">John 16:20-22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55440" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>); millions of Christ’s believers also were born in His resurrection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55441" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">First Peter 1:3</span> tells us that through the resurrection of Christ, we all were regenerated, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55442" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Romans 8:29</span> says that Christ is now God’s Firstborn among many brothers. This is a deeper aspect of Christ’s resurrection. Furthermore, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55443" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45b</span> says that as the last Adam, Christ became a life-giving Spirit through resurrection. Before His resurrection Christ was a man in the flesh, but through His resurrection He was transferred out of the realm of the flesh and became a life-giving Spirit. This is certainly a matter of great depth. All these deeper things concerning Christ are fully revealed in the New Testament, but it is very difficult to see these things concerning Christ in the Old Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="VG1BawJMM7x2I8Q1-xnAC7gmkEg3yJ32rYr_aqOpNv8d2Qc_Ih4-0lnhtsdV5yxzA"> When they come to either the Old Testament or the New Testament, many readers of the Bible hold to their own natural concepts. In a very real sense, the kind of person we are determines the kind of Bible we have. The Bible contains many deep things that are difficult to understand; but thank the Lord that He is the searching Spirit, and He is also the unveiling Spirit, the revealing Spirit. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55444" data-verses="Acts 8:1">Acts 8</span> the Ethiopian eunuch was reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55445" data-verses="Isaiah 53:7-8">Isaiah 53:7-8</span>, concerning Christ as a lamb brought to the slaughter and as a sheep that was dumb before its shearers. These words are very simple, yet the eunuch did not understand them. He asked Philip, “Concerning whom does the prophet say this? Concerning himself or concerning someone else?” The Bible is full of deep things such as these. Thus, whenever we come to the Bible, we need to forget about what we know, what we have learned, and what we have heard, and pray, “Lord, I look to You for my understanding of Your Word.” </p>

However, according to Isaiah’s poetic writing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55449" data-verses="Isaiah 52:14">verse 14</span>, many were astonished at Christ because His appearance and His form were marred. They were astonished because they did not expect a servant of God to be a marred one, a disfigured one, as Christ was. </p>

From the day that He came out to minister on this earth, the Lord Jesus acted wisely and prospered in God’s pleasure. </p>
<p data-content-id="TezDZPL8NrUYNGdOWIcXdAVnApOO-TfpF8RL5VFcCQVs-AgFoSjWXFBe6PSOdjcpf"> First, the Father’s pleasure was that the Son would go to the cross and die for His chosen people. In Gethsemane the Lord Jesus prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55452" data-verses="Matthew 26:39">Matt. 26:39</span>). Later, as He was being arrested, He told His disciples, “The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55453" data-verses="John 18:11">John 18:11</span>). Because the Lord Jesus prospered in God’s pleasure, God the Father could say, “This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55454" data-verses="Matthew 3:17">Matt. 3:17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ntO50bOijJMzmNkskqpnE6uBj2FSqqc2Bgx_sLnuTf1bUIyGc52QX8pB5QylzmI4x"> Christ entered into death and then rose up from death to enter into resurrection. Through this, God the Father begot many sons. This too is the Father’s pleasure, and it is also Christ’s prosperity in His resurrection. Christ’s resurrection was not only a matter of His rising out of death. In Christ’s resurrection millions of God’s chosen people were born. Although we were not yet born, we all were regenerated two thousand years ago, when Christ resurrected. This is the wisdom by which Christ as the Servant of Jehovah acted wisely. Christ acted wisely not according to the Old Testament economy but according to the New Testament economy. From the first day of His ministry until the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus did nothing according to the Old Testament economy. Rather, He did everything according to the New Testament economy. <span class="pg" data-page-id="375" id="375">[375]</span> </p>

The first stage is the stage of Christ’s incarnation; the second, the stage of His crucifixion; the third, the stage of His resurrection; and the fourth, the stage of His ascension. In this message we will <span class="pg" data-page-id="388" id="388">[388]</span> consider the first two stages, and in the next two messages we will see the last two stages. </p>

This chapter is a confession that will be made by the household of Israel who will be saved at the Lord’s coming back. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55549" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12</span> tells us that when the Lord Jesus comes back, the household of Israel will be saved on the same day and even at the same time. Zechariah tells us that the Jews will return to their fathers’ land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55550" data-verses="Zechariah 8:7-8">8:7-8</span>). At the beginning of the last week, the last seven years of this age, Antichrist will make a covenant with Israel, and in the middle of that week he will change his mind (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55551" data-verses="Daniel 9:27">Dan. 9:27</span>). Then, for three and a half years he will persecute the Jews to the uttermost. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55552" data-verses="Zechariah 13:8">Zechariah 13:8</span>, two-thirds of the Jews will be killed by him; only one-third will be left. Those who remain will probably be mostly in the area of Jerusalem. After killing that many Jews, Antichrist will still not be satisfied. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55553" data-verses="Zechariah 14:2">Zechariah 14:2</span>, he will capture Jerusalem, and half of the city will be exiled. Those who remain will constitute only about one-sixth of the Jews who return to their fathers’ land. At that juncture Antichrist will attempt to devour, to destroy, the entire race of Israel, but the Lord will come down to defeat him, and the remaining Jews will see Him and recognize Him as the One whom their forefathers pierced. Then they will all repent and wail (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55554" data-verses="Zechariah 12:10-14">12:10-14</span>). By so doing, this remnant will receive Christ. They will all be saved in a household salvation. At that time they will recount <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55555" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span>, and that portion of the Word will be full of taste to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="uoR14bixKWKAhAFIiEKTXSoC9YzaDIV0czj5nw-Z1vb3lXpZFhrT300F6GkynCLgZ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55556" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> was written nearly twenty-seven hundred years ago. Although throughout these twenty-seven centuries the Jews have read this chapter again and again, they do not know what it talks about. Today nearly all who read the Bible appreciate <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55557" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span>, but they may not truly understand this chapter. I have discovered that the best way to make this chapter clear to you is to help you to see the four stages of Christ revealed in this chapter. </p>
<p data-content-id="0C8OwT_hU8xxS8d8SQBcs53nwTusq86ZLv7NeC1igx0uvAO8X3dOR65YnTutEvaR-"> Christ was in the first stage, the stage of incarnation, for thirty-three and a half years; He was in the second stage, the stage of crucifixion, for approximately six hours; and He <span class="pg" data-page-id="389" id="389">[389]</span> has been in the third stage, the stage of resurrection, for two thousand years already. The stage of Christ’s resurrection will have no ending; it will last for eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55558" data-verses="Revelation 1:18">Rev. 1:18</span>). After His resurrection, Christ entered into His ascension. He ascended in resurrection. It is impossible to separate Christ’s resurrection from His ascension. Today Christ is in both resurrection and ascension. He was incarnated and He was crucified, but now He is in ascension and resurrection. He is in ascension based on His resurrection. His resurrection issued in His ascension. These two can never be separated. Now He lives forever in both resurrection and ascension. He is not only the resurrected Christ, but also the resurrected and ascended Christ. </p>

Christ is our Savior, and He did redeem us, but His incarnation by itself was not His redemption. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55559" data-verses="Isaiah 53:2">Isaiah 53:2</span> says, “For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground.” Christ’s being like a tender plant and a root out of dry ground was not part of His redemption. Likewise, His not being esteemed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55560" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3">v. 3</span>) was not part of His redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="BJUW1oqczZ95vjpUQa_x4mHwP32OpzD--By_DI2ytYA36hm4mGG2k8OomeR93vmhG"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55561" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1-3">Isaiah 53:1b-3</span> refers to Christ’s incarnation. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55562" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Verse 1</span> says, “Who has believed our report? / And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?” <em>The arm of Jehovah</em> is a figure of speech signifying Jehovah Himself in His power. Thus, the arm of Jehovah is God Himself in His saving power. This arm of Jehovah has been revealed. Two thousand years ago, when the Lord Jesus came out of Nazareth to preach the gospel, that was the unveiling of the arm of Jehovah. Christ as the arm of Jehovah was revealed to many, but they did not realize that He was the arm of Jehovah. They did not see that He was Jehovah Himself coming in power to save them. </p>
<p data-content-id="xNrMFclh2xa_fUULOC0fGvhdG4xcvUOOvo0v0AIrJt4JQzhdYzjO_qiVuYxThNsp1"> Based on this revelation of the arm of Jehovah, the apostles reported (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55563" data-verses="1John 1:3">1 John 1:3</span>). But who has believed their report? When the Lord Jesus comes back, the remnant of Israel will all repent and wail.

Why did no one believe the report and receive the revelation concerning Christ? Because He grew up not like a king but like a tender plant before Jehovah. Because of this they did not believe the apostles’ report. A number of times in the four Gospels the Jews despised the Lord Jesus, speaking words such as, “Can anything good be from Nazareth?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55566" data-verses="John 1:46">John 1:46</span>) and “Is not this the carpenter’s son?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55567" data-verses="Matthew 13:55">Matt. 13:55</span>). If Jesus had come out of Bethlehem, out of the city of the royal family, perhaps many Jews would believe in Him. But they have not believed, because He grew up like a tender plant before Jehovah, and like a root out of dry ground. </p>
<p data-content-id="rTSxy6ufSYY0cJBRx2jZcxDIe-PkGj6zjpNjnSLueU-tMdGQu5_MrjbAjwXzSYNvV"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55568" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3">Isaiah 53:3</span> begins, “He was despised and forsaken of men, / A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55569" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">verse 1</span> Christ is referred to as the arm of Jehovah, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55570" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3">verse 3</span> He is called a man of sorrows. The arm of Jehovah is Jehovah in His power, and the man of sorrows is Jesus. When these two are put together, they equal incarnation.

<p data-content-id="a2P39prM6EX_HLBQX5h54O5Vh-6UKpnpKVeApXqgSU0gO2Ybw4I7I1oV3UtONDpf6"> This message is the second in a series of three messages on the all-inclusive Christ in His four stages according to God’s New Testament economy. In this message we will consider the stage of Christ’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="bv2WaUA81d0xeJoiPxHVcaWJUW0RR1MCdnj3LsH-Yzx1ju2wy_7WNDc0ePPJjn9A-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55676" data-verses="Isaiah 53:10-11">Isaiah 53:10b-11b</span> says, “When He makes Himself an offering for sin, / He will see a seed, He will extend His days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand. / He will see the issue of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous.” In this portion of the Word there are four points: (1) Christ’s making Himself an offering for sin; (2) His seeing a seed and extending His days; (3) His seeing the issue of the travail of His soul and being <span class="pg" data-page-id="404" id="404">[404]</span> satisfied; and (4) His making many righteous by the knowledge of Him. The first item of the four belongs to the second stage, the stage of Christ’s crucifixion. The remaining three points belong to the third stage, the stage of Christ’s resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="qLcT4wgKp4K96nzb-VAm_uxkcKCVCtmQ-ddLWU3OUWeWKVVKtz4shHE650_vNmZDU"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55677" data-verses="Isaiah 53:11">Isaiah 53:11a</span>, the words <em>the issue</em> have been inserted; they are not present in the Hebrew text. The issue is the outcome, the result, of the travail of Christ’s soul. Christ suffered by pouring out His soul unto death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55678" data-verses="Isaiah 53:12">v. 12b</span>). Surely there should be an issue, an outcome, of that travail. Isaiah said that Christ would see the outcome, that is, the issue, of the travail of His soul, and He would be satisfied. </p>
<p data-content-id="RWFHKesiQFgZazxZPJ6l8RKYrCVsdgryCSllUbbuvWm2lmnZkYhSqmHn7Gi_Xa-di"> Then, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55679" data-verses="Isaiah 53:11">Isaiah 53:11b</span> says, “By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous.” The phrase <em>by the knowledge of Him</em> does not mean by Christ’s knowledge; it means by knowing Him, the righteous One, the resurrected Christ as God’s Servant. By such knowledge of Him, Christ will make the many righteous. Many versions of the Bible translate this verse, “will justify the many.” The Hebrew text can mean both. But we prefer to translate it, “will make the many righteous,” because this refers to Christ in His resurrection. Justification is related mainly to Christ’s death. However, for Christ to make us righteous is not merely to justify us through His death by His blood. It means primarily to make us righteous. It must be in resurrection that the living Christ lives in us so that He can be lived out of us as righteousness. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55680" data-verses="Revelation 19:7-8">Revelation 19:7-8</span> says that when the bride is ready for the marriage of the Lamb, she will be clothed in fine linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints. The righteousnesses of the saints refer to the subjective righteousness lived out of us by our living of Christ. Christ in His resurrection will make us all righteous by Himself as the resurrection life being lived out of us. </p>
<p data-content-id="sAUuh7LlqXNG6AROi1c889krQ5DZjzfI_chqB-doKR4QVigm2H8Zow2WVVIv3a7pb"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55681" data-verses="Isaiah 53:12">Isaiah 53:12a</span> says, “Therefore I will divide to Him a portion with the Great, / And He will divide the spoil with the Strong.” This brief portion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55682" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> refers to Christ’s ascension. It is in His ascension that Christ brought us to the heavens as His captives. We were Satan’s captives, but through His death and resurrection, Christ released us. Then, in a sense, He captured us. Now we are His captives. In His <span class="pg" data-page-id="405" id="405">[405]</span> ascension He brought all of us as His captives with Him into the heavens. When He was ascending, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55683" data-verses="Ephesians 4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span> says that “He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.” The Amplified New Testament renders this, “He led a train of vanquished foes.” This means that Christ conquered Satan and captured Satan’s captives, making them His captives. In His ascension Christ brought all these captives to the Father. There in the heavens He and the Father, who is the great One and also the strong One, shared the prey and divided the spoil. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wl8xsYLSuZClCRTKGBdohFHNAlHmYEkQnLlaHP7tDTdBXGw5RHixpzekYzX350c8O">III. IN THE STAGE OF HIS RESURRECTION</h2><p data-content-id="LQhDs-iNd9dq5o_tTmhThPDQmkq7ZljdgsiBluha_pnPIx6DSXOLgZBEdGTR9gpyK"> To consider Christ’s resurrection and all the items produced in and through Christ’s resurrection, we need to be calm and also to have a sober mind. The seed and the issue mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55684" data-verses="Isaiah 53:10-11">Isaiah 53:10 and 11</span> imply a great deal. Because of this we need to include many items in the definition of Christ’s resurrection in the New Testament. In his writings Paul explained and defined Christ’s resurrection to the uttermost. In Paul’s definition of Christ’s resurrection, many items concerning the produce of Christ’s resurrection are unveiled to us. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mXH6jwyIvlIyW-cyafh3k1XgE-33SIuk3R5HgJphRIFLi_LVDUGLN4j-Olw06YPmP">A. As the Processed Christ, the Last Adam,<br/>Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="ZQ5ZOI_t6lKDRPvgSN9O1lylxAC8cJuDm5UqbcECOt5pUvu52v_X7zsCFrdRWWuEC"> In His resurrection, as the processed Christ, the last Adam, Christ became a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55685" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55686" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>). After Christ’s resurrection, His being processed was consummated. Originally, Christ was the very God in eternity past (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55687" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55688" data-verses="Philippians 2:6">Phil. 2:6</span>). He was only God; with Him there was only divinity and all the attributes of this divinity. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55689" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> indicates this, saying, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Then, four thousand years after man was created, almost two thousand years ago, the unique God became incarnated. That was the first step of His process. When He was incarnated, He entered into the “tunnel” of His process. By so doing, He became a man, a God-man. Outwardly, He was a man; inwardly, He was nothing less than God. After His incarnation, <span class="pg" data-page-id="406" id="406">[406]</span> He was no longer merely God. As a little child born of Mary and lying in a manger, He was not only God but a God-man. It is wrong to say that only God was lying there in the manger, because He was lying there not only as God but also as a little boy. Likewise, it is wrong to say that only a boy was lying in the manger, because within that little boy there was God. </p>
<p data-content-id="AvPRXCDvWPiXRWBLHvkxLu8Ha2zbBZw8VeVejT0nSqA7E0kK3cIPJSEiiXJm5nqH4"> In His incarnation Christ lived as a God-man for more than thirty years. He traveled all around the holy land from north to south, mainly from Galilee to Jerusalem, on the west side of the Jordan. In such a narrow strip of land the Lord Jesus traveled back and forth for three and a half years. Although as a God-man He was very great, only once did He do anything to manifest His greatness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55690" data-verses="Matthew 17:1-8">Matthew 17:1-8</span>, He ascended with His disciples, Peter, James, and John, to Mount Hermon and was transfigured before their eyes. Six days before, He had told His disciples that some among them would not taste death until they saw the Son of Man coming in His kingdom. In His transfiguration on the mount, His appearance was still that of a man, but His face shined like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light. At that moment He was a man in glory. This was altogether a part of His process. </p>
<p data-content-id="FGittJXCVs1rkWe7ktAbu5VJkBIcZfHlxi6UoKmz6jdb4AkrfS1FmkAs3rLH6WK0t"> At the end of His incarnation, that is, at the end of His human life, He went voluntarily into death. Christ’s death was wonderful in three aspects. In the human aspect, He was murdered. He was led as a lamb to the slaughter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55691" data-verses="Isaiah 53:7">Isa. 53:7</span>), and He was slaughtered by man for three hours, from nine o’clock in the morning until noon. Then from twelve o’clock to three o’clock in the afternoon, God came in. When God put all our sins upon Him, He counted Him as the unique sinner in the universe. Thus Christ died a vicarious death for us, the sinners. On the cross God wounded Him, crushed Him, cut Him off from the land of the living, and judged Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55692" data-verses="Isaiah 53:5">vv. 5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55693" data-verses="Isaiah 53:6">6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55694" data-verses="Isaiah 53:8">8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55695" data-verses="Isaiah 53:10">10a</span>). Because of this, His death was counted by God as a vicarious death for us. </p>

<p data-content-id="xNrMFclh2xa_fUULOC0fEvhAI4xcvUOOvo0v0AIrJt4JQzhdYzjO_qiVuYxThNsp1"> In this message we come to the last verse of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55766" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span>. As we have seen in the previous two messages, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55767" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> covers the four stages of Christ. In the whole universe Christ is the most wonderful One. As such a One, Christ has four stages: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The entire Bible of sixty-six books speaks mainly concerning these four things. Nothing in the universe is as crucial as Christ’s incarnation, Christ’s crucifixion, Christ’s resurrection, and Christ’s ascension. In this message we will see Christ in the stage of His ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="rTSxy6ufSYY0cJBRx2jZexDRR-PkGj6zjpNjnSLueU-tMdGQu5_MrjbAjwXzSYNvV"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55768" data-verses="Colossians 2:15">Colossians 2:15</span> says that while Christ was hanging on the cross, the Father stripped off the rulers and authorities, the evil angelic powers. This verse opens a window to show us that while Christ was being crucified on the cross, a war was raging between God and Satan. Before that time Satan had induced a group of angels to rebel against God and to follow him and become his subordinates. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55769" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span> Satan is called “the ruler of the authority of the air,” indicating that under him are the rulers and authorities in the air, which are the evil angels. When Christ was crucified on the cross, there was a war between the good angels and the evil angels, and even between God and Satan. This is clearly indicated by <span class="pg" data-page-id="418" id="418">[418]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55770" data-verses="Colossians 2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>, which says, “Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.” The antecedent of the pronoun <em>He</em> in this verse is <em>God</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55771" data-verses="Colossians 2:12">verse 12</span>. If we read only the four Gospels, we will not be able to see that during Christ’s crucifixion a war was raging between God and Satan. Only <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55772" data-verses="Colossians 2:15">Colossians 2:15</span> shows us such a scene. </p>
<p data-content-id="ddB4lVkVmyJ68CnsJyJLYGTnRUEqFgq-k0BZRd94yrfre8l1WideKLwaD17JxG7L9"> We need to realize that in the universe there is an invisible scene behind the visible scene. In the entire universe there are two scenes; one is visible, and the other is invisible. When Christ was crucified, there was a visible scene. All the people standing there saw that visible scene. The soldiers put Christ on the cross and nailed His hands and His feet. Then they erected the cross. The bystanders saw these things, but they could not see and they did not see that behind the visible scene there was an invisible scene: God and Satan were fighting there. In this fighting God stripped off all the troublesome rulers and authorities, and He made a public show of them, triumphing over them in Christ and in the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="QitwyRAi-BSyEqDN1P_4RBF7UbCY_fx4QXG-tNSwIQCcZx2gydXf2eVhMxTRLWMCr"> This indicates that in the whole universe only four things are crucial to God and to us, His elect. All other things are insignificant. In the books of the New Testament we can see the invisible scene behind the visible scene concerning Christ’s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This scene is continuing even today. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ks0-CsfGps88CTf9Bvjx-SMPpO8piKeoiwr1F8Bi_ombalAGWQaduu3FhVvFEPu8l"> The Old Testament, in books such as Daniel, also shows that at that time there were both a visible scene and an invisible scene. In the scene that was visible to people, Babylon came to capture Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55773" data-verses="Daniel 1:1-2">Dan. 1:1-2</span>). That captivity endured for seventy years. At the end of those years the Medo-Persian Empire defeated Babylon. All these things were visible. But people could not see that behind that scene there was another, invisible scene. They could not see that behind Persia was the prince of Persia, and behind Greece was the prince of Greece. When Greece under Alexander was fighting against Persia, the two princes also were fighting in the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55774" data-verses="Daniel 10:13">10:13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55775" data-verses="Daniel 10:20">20</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="lRnGBbKnFFwheo_id-w8BHn4jZ8gVcFhd5jkSJRN7ha8wanPDUFPhcvoB8-OKcwsT"> In each of the four steps of Christ, not only men but also angels were involved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55776" data-verses="Luke 2:8-14">Luke 2:8-14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55777" data-verses="Colossians 2:15">Col. 2:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55778" data-verses="Matthew 28:2-7">Matt. 28:2-7</span>; <span class="pg" data-page-id="419" id="419">[419]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55779" data-verses="Acts 1:10-11">Acts 1:10-11</span>). This indicates again that concerning Christ’s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension there is both the visible scene and the invisible scene. However, of these two, the invisible scene is more important. </p>

<p data-content-id="ok4KA4atXxC4_GGUgoqPSJdGHSzicZp2Ck3w9wYZEOloEhZlx-sLpr5qWuMH_IR_Y"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55780" data-verses="Isaiah 53:12">Isaiah 53:12a</span> says, “Therefore I [Jehovah God] will divide to Him [the ascended Christ] a portion with the Great, / And He will divide the spoil with the Strong.” The word <em>spoil</em> in this verse is very significant. It indicates that there was a war. Without a war there could be no spoil. Spoil signifies prey, and prey denotes captives taken in a war. The word <em>spoil</em> indicates that a war was fought and someone won that war, and the winner got the prey, the captives, the spoil. This one word opens a wide window to us, enabling us to see the invisible scene of a war. Christ, the One who won that war, divided the spoil with the Great and the Strong. Here, <em>the Great</em> and <em>the Strong</em> refer to God. God is the Great, and God is also the Strong. As the Great, He received the honor from Christ’s ascension, and as the Strong, He gained the victory. So the two, Christ and the strong and great One, shared the spoil with each other. </p>
<p data-content-id="3BADcAnW9OEC5k8Yd7U2oj5KY5egJ3xQPJp_FOL39Tr6GcaslKhpsLMjyFet50hDV"> This indicates that in Christ’s ascension there was a demonstration of Christ’s victory by the sharing of the captives, the spoil, the prey, taken in Christ’s victory. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55781" data-verses="Isaiah 53:12">Isaiah 53:12a</span>, just one half of a verse, is the only portion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55782" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> that speaks concerning Christ’s ascension. But this half verse, with the demonstration of Christ’s victory by the sharing of the prey, opens a wide window to us. God the Father was the Great and also the Strong, and God the Son was the Fighter. He fought the battle on the cross and in His resurrection. He won the battle, and by winning that battle He captured all Satan’s captives. All men, beginning from Adam and including us, were captured by Satan. We became Satan’s captives. However, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55783" data-verses="Ephesians 4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span>, when Christ ascended <span class="pg" data-page-id="420" id="420">[420]</span> to the heavens, “He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.” This verse is a quotation from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55784" data-verses="Psalms 68:18">Psalm 68:18</span>. <em>Those taken captive</em> refers to those who had been captured by Satan. This verse indicates that when Christ ascended to the heavens, He led a train, a procession, of captives. These captives included all the saved sinners. Before that time, we were captives under Satan’s hand. Satan captured us and made us his captives because of sin and death. We were in slavery to Satan under sin and death. Then Christ through His death and resurrection defeated Satan, and He captured all the captives under Satan’s hand and made them His captives. First we were captives of Satan, but now we have become captives of Christ. Then, in His ascension Christ led us in a triumphal procession, “a train of vanquished foes” (The Amplified New Testament), to the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="GJDDUPDDLX0o4Er94zmfxXfECmpDzlv3f1-hon_Kz_82lAUhb8Q4Ir7xA9OciutNq"> Perhaps we do not realize that we have already been in the heavens. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55785" data-verses="Ephesians 4:1">Ephesians 4</span> tells us that when Christ ascended to the heavens, He led a procession of captives, who were originally the captives of Satan, and He brought all these captives to the heavens to present them to the Father. These captives included you and me. We were among those vanquished by Christ. Satan also was vanquished by Him. Many people have never heard such a gospel. Thus, we need to preach the higher gospel to them according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55786" data-verses="Ephesians 4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span>, telling them that Christ vanquished and captured them through His death and resurrection and took them to the heavens in His ascension. As a triumphant Victor, Christ led a triumphant procession to celebrate His victory, and He brought these captives to the heavens to offer them to the Father, saying, “Father, these are the prey, the spoil, gained by Me through My fighting. Now, Father, I present them all to You as My presents. You sent Me, and I went. Now I have come back to You with a present, a gift, from the cross and from Hades. I captured these, and now I present them all together to You as a present.” The Father accepted this gift from the Son. Then the Father gave all these captives back to the Son as a gift from the Father. This is the invisible scene in Christ’s ascension. <span class="pg" data-page-id="421" id="421">[421]</span> </p>

THE SURE MERCIES OF DAVID</h2><p data-content-id="cle8-utSykwjPzf3VIHlPytXesDpMuIK_KMD9zOpCjKe9hViDIjmiZxkpY6OjHik2"> The all-inclusive Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, is the sure mercies of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55834" data-verses="Isaiah 55:3-4">Isa. 55:3b-4</span>). History tells us that David was a marvelous king. It is difficult to understand how an excellent, marvelous, and majestic king would need mercies. According to our concept, poor people, low-class people, need mercies. David may be considered as the top king in human history. How could such a high person need mercies? </p>
<p data-content-id="YR_U7a4zFL6KVYMurXeGf5zD1j379BuHa-797b249EFRSudskQm1EB4lEmOGUz8Me"> David wrote many marvelous psalms. It is hard to believe that such a writer murdered a person and took that person’s wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55835" data-verses="2Samuel 11:1">2 Sam. 11</span>). Murder and fornication were committed by <span class="pg" data-page-id="432" id="432">[432]</span> this one king. Did he not need mercy? Among all the good psalms written by David, there is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55836" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">Psalm 51</span>. This is a psalm of David’s repentance and confession after he had committed fornication and murder. This psalm shows that even David was a person who needed God’s mercy. This indicates that everyone in the human race needs the mercy of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="EDD4W4Bi8P_kanjIZpkTytyBcj3m-fMlSC_LE2PNygKjPm1E-k1y3WoflKMCat_Eg"> The books of 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles speak of the history of the children of Israel and their kings. To a great extent the record of the citizens of the commonwealth of Israel with their kings is terrible. Few of the kings were good; most of them were bad to the uttermost. In such a bad situation, there was the need of God’s mercy. </p>
<p data-content-id="CxK0Doj68KK2DfqTC1PKjASx32OAGZ0t_38mb1Yk3T9noem-2jJT0OYYhPlFmtF_3"> The book of Isaiah is full of Isaiah’s condemnation of the children of Israel. He compared them to the wicked inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55837" data-verses="Isaiah 1:9-10">1:9-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55838" data-verses="Isaiah 3:9">3:9</span>). Jeremiah was also strong in his condemnation of Israel. Jeremiah shows us how much the kings of David’s family needed God’s mercy. Jeremiah speaks of Zedekiah, the last king of Judah. He was warned by Jeremiah to the uttermost but he would not listen. Eventually, he was captured. After Jerusalem fell, he attempted to escape, but he was captured by the Babylonian soldiers and brought before Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Then Nebuchadnezzar slew his sons, put out his eyes, bound him with chains, and carried him away to Babylon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55839" data-verses="Jeremiah 39:1-7">Jer. 39:1-7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55840" data-verses="Jeremiah 52:1-10">52:1-10</span>). This shows the pitiful situation of the Lord’s people at that time. In such a pitiful situation, they needed God’s mercy. </p>

Christ Being God’s Sure Mercies to David</h2><p data-content-id="-waEYRv93EhPN6GvKzVCDqUE7US28tMkU59WnoJRQOgj-h7qhd8NKNqqlIlNCrxzR"> When Isaiah came to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55841" data-verses="Isaiah 55:1">chapter fifty-five</span>, after having written so many chapters concerning Christ, he spoke of an aspect of Christ which we would never dream of or imagine. This aspect of Christ is that He is “the sure mercies shown to David” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55842" data-verses="Isaiah 55:3">v. 3b</span>). The word <em>shown</em> is not in the Hebrew text of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55843" data-verses="Isaiah 55:3">Isaiah 55:3</span>. A number of translations say “the sure mercies of David,” but this can be interpreted as David having a lot of mercies. This is not correct. These mercies are shown to David or promised to David. </p>
<p data-content-id="pmSZylHOI91d7TIxcigowjmB5jeeWukG32pyqBYiqnoT2DYbTm6RM9vdoNBvActy1"> We have pointed out that the sixty-six chapters of Isaiah <span class="pg" data-page-id="433" id="433">[433]</span> are divided into two sections. The first section of thirty-nine chapters matches the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament; and the last section of twenty-seven chapters matches the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. The content of these two sections also matches the thought in the Old and New Testaments respectively. The second section, matching the New Testament, is altogether a word of comfort. There is no more condemnation or rebuking. In this word of comfort, there is a portion which says that Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the sure mercies that God has shown to David and promised to David. God promised that the very Christ, who would come out of David’s descendants, would be the sure mercies of God toward the royal family of David. </p>
<p data-content-id="v8bXBUaOMzEw-TiNL5ZysXlBZ97nmg86AjAc50n7OsvDdfqaWEWKpdyEo4hVS0NFL"> No one could blot out the entire royal family of David because of the sure mercies of God, Christ. Christ, one of the descendants of David, became God’s sure mercies to David. Jeremiah said that just as the ordinances of the sun for light by day and of the moon and the stars for light by night will never depart, so the seed of Israel and David would not cease from being a nation before Him forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55844" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:35-36">Jer. 31:35-36</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55845" data-verses="Jeremiah 33:24-26">33:24-26</span>). In other words, nothing can annul God’s feeling toward the royal family of David. Many kings among David’s descendants are mentioned in 1 and 2 Kings. The last king of the royal family of David will be Jesus Christ, the embodiment of God’s sure mercies. He is the sure mercies to the house of David. These mercies include many gracious things and blessings from God to the house of David. </p>
<p data-content-id="WJ5aP-FOAwwmtqgyigvthzgpez5_2hxzBbpu9V9IDxIMpTzB5bTDMszy1Pz0KJtzc"> The Scriptures speak of God’s love, God’s grace, and God’s mercy. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55846" data-verses="Luke 15:1">Luke 15</span> says that when the prodigal son came back, the father, who was expecting him, was moved with compassion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55847" data-verses="Luke 15:20">v. 20</span>). Compassion is a tender kind of mercy. The father’s tender mercy was touched because the returned prodigal son was in such a poor condition, just like that of a beggar. He was altogether not worthy of the father’s love. The father’s love was so high, and his son had fallen to the bottom level. Thus, the father’s compassion was moved. </p>
<p data-content-id="2jaApwQLvdqGiLTlJvaxzWQia7lD7UKdp6WAgQbms_jfk-21iNUPdC_JsG6KRUu0A"> The apostle Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55848" data-verses="Romans 12:1">Romans 12</span> exhorted the saints through the compassions, the mercies, of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55849" data-verses="Romans 12:1">v. 1</span>). Why did Paul not exhort the saints through the great love of God? This <span class="pg" data-page-id="434" id="434">[434]</span> is because the great love of God is too far away from us in our pitiful condition and situation. Love and grace are too high for us to touch in our low state. But, hallelujah, God has another attribute called mercy. Mercy reaches the farthest. We are so low, but the mercies of God can reach us in our pitiful situation and wretched position. Often in my prayers before ministering the word, I tell the Lord, “We trust in Your mercy.” I dare not tell the Lord that we trust in His love. If I am so poor, I am not on the level to match God’s love. But God reaches us on the bottom level through His mercies. </p>
<p data-content-id="uoR14bixKWKAhAFIiEKTUSojwYzaDIV0czj5nw-Z1vb3lXpZFhrT300F6GkynCLgZ"> A number of Christians may speak about the great love of God in Christ, but I am concerned that what they speak is not so thorough. If they were thorough in knowing God in His attributes in different levels, they would speak much about God’s mercy. This is because our day by day present situation does not match the level of God’s love. Our real practical situation surely fits the lowest level of God’s attributes, that is, God’s mercy. </p>
<p data-content-id="fR3FSAPwpELEt7o898BLlbnSJcIjkJG41RF-XGMr8wANynIdYRkLxYxdC1pZYDojA"> God’s love and God’s grace are on a higher level than His mercy. Grace is a gift. God has a heart loving us, and out of that heart God prepares a gift for us. That gift is grace. Because we are not worthy of this gift, however, God has come down to reach us in His mercy. In His attribute of mercy, He can reach us on the lowest level. Very few of God’s children, however, realize that they need God’s mercy. In my prayers in the early days of my being a Christian, I spoke about God’s love. Today after many years of experience, however, I trust in God’s mercy. This is because my low situation does not match the high level of God’s love. </p>
<p data-content-id="I2AlQGFEtbY3V68hEJdIu7s-nDnm-QbOPj1PY3loDh0BSFBk1Q1m_bAmK-r0giaBC"> We may consider that we are ladies and gentlemen, but really we are “scorpions” and “gophers.” The people considered David as a high king, but he considered himself as a worm (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55850" data-verses="Psalms 22:6">Psa. 22:6</span>). This is why he told God that he needed His mercy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55851" data-verses="Psalms 51:1">51:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55852" data-verses="Psalms 52:8">52:8b</span>). Eventually, David’s very descendant would be the King of kings on this earth to be the sure mercies to the entire royal family of David. </p>

<p data-content-id="t8bnQrQm6FdShy-EgcX3SYGrzTTSXQfcZGteWHR3UQg52r_TcQ6cbm7M6CShPFDoa"> In this message we want to see the all-inclusive Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in two aspects. First, He is the Anointed of Jehovah. This is a very precious term in the Old Testament. Second, He is the Angel of the presence of Jehovah. Some may think that to say “the Angel of the presence of Jehovah” is wrong. We may prefer to say “the Angel <em>in</em> the presence of Jehovah.” But the text of the Scripture says “the Angel <em>of</em> His presence” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55894" data-verses="Isaiah 63:9">Isa. 63:9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="hzY1tM_vwP6yiexhKU0g0WcSZ00OQ2FHJHueHLL0JnTSgM-pFcVRMqavXK50VgQkc"> The most striking chapter on the Angel of Jehovah is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55895" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span>. The Angel of Jehovah was the One who escorted the entire race of Israel out of Egypt through the wilderness and into the good land. Eventually this One, the Angel of Jehovah, is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55896" data-verses="Zechariah 1:1">Zechariah 1</span>. He is the One who rides on the red horse, who was suffering with God’s suffering people in order <span class="pg" data-page-id="442" id="442">[442]</span> to serve them. The Angel of Jehovah served the children of Israel in their whole journey of forty years in the wilderness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55897" data-verses="Exodus 14:1">Exodus 14</span> we can see that He was taking the lead at the forefront. When the Egyptian army was chasing after Israel, the Angel turned to the rear (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55898" data-verses="Exodus 14:19">v. 19</span>). He Himself protected Israel from the Egyptian army. That Angel of Jehovah was the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="U9URzQvxl-2lbh8eBc0wJULDRVKDDr1W7UKzDtFOt5gwiv1E1oQCE1BiF2e8JjzZg"> The last item of the all-inclusive Christ in the book of Isaiah is the Angel <em>of,</em> not <em>in,</em> the presence of Jehovah. His being the Angel <em>of</em> the presence of Jehovah means that He is the presence of Jehovah. <em>Of</em> indicates apposition. If I am <em>with</em> you, that means you and I are two persons. If I am <em>of</em> you, this makes us one. A husband may say that he is <em>of</em> his wife. That means that he and his wife are one. <em>In the presence</em> implies two persons. <em>Of the presence</em> means one person. The Angel of Jehovah is just Jehovah’s presence. If I say, “the life in Christ,” this means the life and Christ are two. If I say, “the life of Christ,” this means the life is Christ. <em>The Angel of the presence of Jehovah</em> means that this very Angel is the presence of Jehovah. </p>
<p data-content-id="MtvmNOQoEXWPJrXLSOVNjlacQ4o0Rx1dcmIVN6QiUkC-QwmmcWMvUGGb6XF0aziH7"> The Angel of Jehovah, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55899" data-verses="Exodus 3:1">Exodus 3</span> through Isaiah to Zechariah, was always with Israel. Quite often He was suffering with Israel. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55900" data-verses="Zechariah 1:1">Zechariah 1</span> presents the vision of a man as the Angel of Jehovah riding on a red horse and standing among the myrtle trees in the bottoms of the valley (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55901" data-verses="Zechariah 1:7-17">vv. 7-17</span>). The myrtle trees signify the humiliated people of Israel in their captivity. Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was standing among these myrtle trees in the bottoms of the valley. This means that He was remaining strongly among the captured Israel in the lowest part of the valley in their humiliation. </p>
<p data-content-id="YR_U7a4zFL6KVYMurXeGY5zm_j379BuHa-797b249EFRSudskQm1EB4lEmOGUz8Me"> Eventually, this One will tread the great winepress at Armageddon. Armageddon is referred to in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55902" data-verses="Isaiah 63:1">Isaiah 63</span>. That winepress will extend from Bozrah of Edom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55903" data-verses="Isaiah 63:1-6">vv. 1-6</span>) to Armageddon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55904" data-verses="Revelation 16:16">Rev. 16:16</span>), a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia, that is, one hundred eighty-two miles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55905" data-verses="Revelation 14:20">Rev. 14:20</span>). The Angel of Jehovah, the coming back Jesus, will tread that great winepress. Without Isaiah we would not know that the treader of that great winepress will be the Angel of the presence of Jehovah. <span class="pg" data-page-id="443" id="443">[443]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="EDD4W4Bi8P_kanjIZpkT1tygXj3m-fMlSC_LE2PNygKjPm1E-k1y3WoflKMCat_Eg"> The Anointed of Jehovah and the Angel of the presence of Jehovah are the last two items of what the all-inclusive Christ is to Israel in Isaiah. <em>The Anointed of Jehovah</em> is a sweet term to God’s people. But <em>the Angel of the presence of Jehovah</em> is a term mostly applied toward the enemies of God’s people. First, He was there dealing with Pharaoh and his Egyptian army. He was protecting God’s people in the front and at the rear. Even in Zechariah He was the protecting Angel, depicted as the rider on the red horse. Isaiah concludes his view of the all-inclusive Christ with these two items—one is so sweet to God’s elect, and the other is so strong toward the enemies of God’s elect. </p>
<p data-content-id="DSgijqH7I3eza2ivBfob5nHh6aCyUwpg7PL2m3xGMv7aVYPK1L11f4RkD4W1mOBaY"> Israel’s last enemy will be Antichrist and all the nations with him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55906" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19</span> tells us that Antichrist will collect all the evil persons on this earth to be the armies to destroy Israel. Even today there are many Arab nations who would like to destroy Israel. The final one who will have a kind of conspiracy to destroy Israel will be Antichrist with his allies, the nations. But the Angel of Jehovah will fight him down, will defeat him, and will put him directly into the lake of fire. The Angel of Jehovah is the Lord Jesus as the presence of the Triune God.

This Prophecy Having a Foretaste Fulfillment<br/>at Christ’s First Coming</h2><p data-content-id="5cfSks8f9T4wzhajEBGC1glzBKabj3mMDfXnmEjpE8oTiQFZRNSodjL8n4i8NSKGW"> This prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah had a foretaste fulfillment at Christ’s first coming. In the Old Testament, we cannot see the two comings of Christ. It shows us only that Christ will have one coming. The two comings of Christ can be likened to two peaks of a mountain range. They may only look like one peak from a distance, but when you come near them, you can see that there are two peaks with a big valley, a big plain, between them. The prophecy concerning the coming of Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55908" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1">Isaiah 61</span> is actually in two aspects. <span class="pg" data-page-id="444" id="444">[444]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="N-FUGiukulHdfeeBKJW4pUWI6C3Vtiyq3naFoqKsOXoQOjoaDnKgOEo_CqDPuh31a"> In the New Testament, the peak of the Lord’s first coming is mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55909" data-verses="Luke 4:1">Luke 4</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55910" data-verses="Luke 4:1">Luke 4</span> speaks of the Lord entering into a synagogue on the Sabbath day. The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him, and He read the first few verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55911" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1">Isaiah 61</span>. Then the Lord rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, sat down, and said, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55912" data-verses="Luke 4:21">v. 21</span>). All of them marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55913" data-verses="Luke 4:22">v. 22</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="t8bnQrQm6FdShy-EgcX3SYG2xTTSXQfcZGteWHR3UQg52r_TcQ6cbm7M6CShPFDoa"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55914" data-verses="Luke 4:1">Luke 4</span> gives us a record of the first “peak” of the prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55915" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1-3">Isaiah 61:1-3</span>. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55916" data-verses="Isaiah 61:1">Isaiah 61</span> itself we can see only one peak, not two peaks. The final twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah, from <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55917" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1-66">Isaiah 40 through 66</span>, speak about Christ’s coming. Isaiah told us that the Lord’s coming will bring in the time of restoration, the restoration of Israel. But when we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55918" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Isaiah 40—66</span> today, in the view of the New Testament light, we can see two comings here. </p>
<p data-content-id="hzY1tM_vwP6yiexhKU0g0WcLa00OQ2FHJHueHLL0JnTSgM-pFcVRMqavXK50VgQkc"> For instance, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55919" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Isaiah 40</span> speaks of the glory of Jehovah being revealed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55920" data-verses="Isaiah 40:5">v. 5</span>) and of the Lord Jehovah coming with might (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55921" data-verses="Isaiah 40:10">v. 10</span>). This refers to Jesus’ appearing. That appearing surely is not His second coming. It was His first coming ushered in by John the Baptist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55922" data-verses="Isaiah 40:3-5">vv. 3-5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55923" data-verses="Luke 3:4-6">Luke 3:4-6</span>). The chapters following <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55924" data-verses="Isaiah 40:1">Isaiah 40</span> contain many verses telling us about Christ’s coming. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55925" data-verses="Isaiah 53:1">Isaiah 53</span> tells us that the Lord comes as a tender plant, as a root out of dry ground (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55926" data-verses="Isaiah 53:2">v. 2</span>), and as a man of sorrows (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55927" data-verses="Isaiah 53:3">v. 3</span>). This surely refers to His first coming. Today we know this, but in the ancient times they did not have this thought. I doubt even whether Isaiah knew this. They only knew that Messiah would come. To them there was only one coming. But actually Messiah, the Anointed One of Jehovah, will come two times. The first time is for the age of grace, and the second time will be for the age of restoration. </p>
