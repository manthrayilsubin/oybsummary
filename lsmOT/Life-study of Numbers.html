<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Zjo9b_sbrL-1x6xy-0gySP_IT48ZurBOk8dWCpfBgyBR0D6E30f90C4kCu_Hzx6Aq">I. AN ADVANCEMENT<br/>OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="AQYzzKQWYTkaFQeLtwXyC8Dl0s-ydiCBfKdc5vmfXuwsxv0xS9OBpDz-8zAqA_-Qz"> In the five books of Moses (the Pentateuch) many seeds of the truth are sown. Every main point of the divine truth is in these books. However, the divine revelation was not given to us once for all but progressively. </p>
<p data-content-id="FRSfve2gXKF2q5U8QMttWfoQa_Ak8O0qwdoGc_QmQ-eQ8kJW69ciA8zsBiJhZIN53"> In the progress of the divine revelation there is the advancement of the divine revelation. In the first book, Genesis, we have God and His creation. “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40347" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Gen. 1:1</span>). At the end of the sixty-six books of the Bible there is a glorious, bright, new city. In the beginning there was only God Himself. Then God accomplished the work of creation, so in addition to God there was the creation, including man. Man fell, but after the fall of man, there was God’s redemption. Eventually, at the end of the Bible, there is a city built with the divine Trinity mingled with His redeemed people. Between God’s creation at the beginning and the new city at the end, the divine revelation advances progressively book after book. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Cmeet7LFEwA83Buuyy4WlpgGXwrqBpX55w_jk3kONkrrJH7N7b1Pyn3Qqcfwcq2SE">A. In Genesis</h2><p data-content-id="QMNNHzC1cNpRTwWtut-WgyUPZuqv1v75JSKuO1jimhfuoO5aaxSFW4a02nXRm6WnV"> In Genesis we see God’s creation and man’s fall. Whereas Genesis begins with God’s creation, it ends with the result of man’s fall—a dead man in a coffin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40348" data-verses="Genesis 50:26">50:26</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="KczBxhEn9SA44FFZSVMXsfoJhD6h8ghOy5WWYqtP7LFq_5eOHT5zjQ8Bhcb9oDTxH">B. In Exodus</h2><p data-content-id="lGJMqXpxLr00FAOi_3oq-1bbsmdyiel3q9IrhyEOb-mti2DuXEIULfVfV-8aXxhkd"> After the fall of man, God came in to save us with His wonderful redemption. This is what we see in Exodus. In the book of Exodus we have God’s salvation and the building of His habitation. </p>
<p data-content-id="OZSjkV5USBSK_MP1WUozFm3Lt21uazrsJs9t6GIBcxwgHMpXkI44nN0BaekRScDuy"> God’s habitation is more valuable than His creation. When God created the heavens and the earth, He was homeless. Even though man fell, God would not give up. He still went on to redeem and save fallen man that He might build up His habitation with His redeemed people. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="4MK-wePHgeEAEGgR-z7X1M-1hwRZhE7RGIluVa5oEpcHV3stVAVn4-Tc5CTQh0iYn">C. In Leviticus</h2><p data-content-id="owSxjcqeZRVmxEIS3OihGHPsyLldhdw0vmgvUEemAnltodyTzv6yHvYP90yMUcQyG"> In Leviticus we have the redeemed’s worship and living. By the time we reach Leviticus, many of the fallen people have been saved and have become God’s redeemed people. Leviticus reveals that these redeemed ones need to worship God and live the life He desires. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="3Y75k2O-GWhqOrdtGMwxX2I6DTats6BF3Ik8Rqg0fOcYDaq8QCBZ97FKiVycD9iDM">D. In Numbers</h2><p data-content-id="GH2P9Y3tWVo3vwOnM-tmCA3hQFbUq0bMbEZhDa4imkkh08ueAdWa3Wq1nnlLdF8Wv"> In Numbers we see God’s redeemed people being formed into His army and their journey in fighting for God. The army is for God’s people to fight so that God can gain the ground on earth to build up His kingdom with His habitation. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="c66RxjgPYhMLBezgrzhPx-n3gLRZ-jMxsmz68qF6tmK_P8z65dz6eCIYn-7KqSz3Q">II. A COMPARISON</h2><p data-content-id="YHlejKwe4zJM9asMqbsyVu6pu-a_w97ON3jvWMY9Q5agu8XBAHpB57Htd9BbOWaqj"> At this point, I would like to make a comparison between Numbers and Leviticus. Leviticus stresses the redeemed’s worship and living. Numbers stresses the redeemed’s journey and fighting. In Leviticus God’s redeemed were instructed in how to worship God and live a holy life. In Numbers God’s redeemed were formed into an army and fought for Him throughout their journey. </p>
<p data-content-id="ERNBZk2fVc6bxOiCk-X4O5cn6renRx3McXQ0hmXB6AJkXe9nyhLoNBrjCzDoOcA-M"> In Numbers we can see three things: the formation of an <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> army, the journeys of that army, and the fighting of the army. The formation of the army was for fighting, and the fighting required the army to journey, not to stay in one spot. Always the children of Israel were going on from place to place to gain ground that God might have a people to be built up for His kingdom and His house. For this reason, in Numbers we have the army, the journey, and the fighting. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DxVzNnfEqnwJJe7GyfHvYNQRQ_ybfwglxmBI07FipOB6QgwVm01HCCfjmiwJXMqx5">III. THE GENERAL SKETCH</h2><p data-content-id="Se-6za1KSJE4D3ovoN73x2q9mAnOfZxM7ef9Yu5iYbmakYgNBSFmwp3_76eSfWWkE"> Although Numbers is a long book, the general sketch is simple. The general sketch of Numbers is that the redeemed and sanctified Israelites were formed into a holy army of God, which was to proceed by following God’s leading and was to fight for Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="gVK3NAkEMwsZE8Q-ot7YELudLgFfbM5Uya85eCH9oZZY7jOOGPbB82gui7YdXn6-O"> Whatever is written in the Pentateuch, the five books of Moses, is a type. In particular, in these books we see that the entire nation of Israel was a type of the church. As Israel was formed into an army, so the church should be formed into an army. Concerning this, we should not look at the present situation, at the outward appearance. If we do this, we will be disappointed and wonder where the army is. Although we may have doubts about the existence of a church army, Satan knows that there is such an army. We need to believe that today there is an army formed with all the faithful ones, journeying and fighting all the time that God may have a kingdom with a house. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ezw1IvP5hJlLyGzJuXCMzfiQo7QUre2non4KkPYaTfhE1FqPcM2yCoPnLNpUj9vS2">IV. THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</h2><p data-content-id="56Tr4kCk5lYCc-MpfN0ckfGVpZUNGnXmAb1tHSRy7tzGpsD_p3ykJtYvDxOHS7R3k"> In a general way, we may say that the central thought of the entire Bible is Christ, for the Bible is focused on Christ as the center. But what is the central thought of the book of Numbers? The central thought of Numbers is that Christ is the meaning of life, the testimony, the center of God’s people, and the Leader, the way, and the goal of their journey and fighting. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37CjQgbXVl8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e">A. Christ as the Meaning of Life</h2><p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5FnmjgkZtL34sAQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> In Numbers Christ is revealed as the meaning of the life of God’s people. It seems that during the forty years in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> wilderness, the two million Israelites were doing nothing. They did not engage in industry, commerce, or farming. But day by day they were busy with one thing—the ark of God’s testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40349" data-verses="Numbers 7:89">Num. 7:89</span>). The ark of the testimony was the center of the tabernacle, which was called the tabernacle of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40350" data-verses="Numbers 1:50">1:50</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40351" data-verses="Numbers 1:53">53</span>). For forty years the Israelites worked for the keeping of the ark with the tabernacle. The ark with the tabernacle was the meaning of their life. If there had not been an ark, the life of the Israelites would not have had any meaning. Both the ark and the tabernacle were called God’s testimony. Since the ark typifies Christ, the meaning of the Israelites’ life was to take care of Christ as the testimony of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk2trEsnZhK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D">B. Christ as God’s Testimony</h2><p data-content-id="UdegCvQnXR5xgUhUaUGVfAvjlcq-Cu7dqw2JPQOIsoKn_Y8dqhxtHLn_1Zya9Y6Px"> This Christ, who is the meaning of the life of God’s people, is God’s testimony. In the Old Testament, the testimony refers to the law. The two tablets on which the law was inscribed were called the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40352" data-verses="Exodus 25:21">Exo. 25:21</span>) and were placed in the ark. Because the testimony was put into the ark, the ark was called the ark of the testimony. </p>
<p data-content-id="MNYPxEBRKCjGvjYcSm_-x7G60nDZBONkc_BXexp5aMeJNuq4a-EbRUgKX-x3mauLs"> A law is always a testimony of the one who made it. In keeping with this principle, the law of God is a testimony of what God is; it tells us what kind of God our God is. The law tells us that God is love and light and that He is holy and righteous. Love, light, holiness, and righteousness are four of the divine attributes. The law, as a portrait of what God is, typifies Christ as the embodiment of God in all His divine attributes. In Christ we see that God is love and light and that He is holy and righteous. Thus, the New Testament tells us that Christ is the embodiment of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40353" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). For Christ to be the embodiment of God means that He is the portrait of God, and as such He is the testimony of what God is. Because Christ is the testimony of what God is, He is called “the faithful and true Witness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40354" data-verses="Revelation 3:14">Rev. 3:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40355" data-verses="Revelation 1:5">1:5</span>). As God’s Witness, Christ bears God’s testimony to show us what kind of God He is. </p>
<p data-content-id="VBaATaFwkk1R2p-lJIa9e-4ubkOY975Xa5FmEubBdBBuFAyJhWAJhBvAZCseteqbq"> God’s people should not only take Christ as the meaning of life but also live a life of testifying Christ. When God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> people have this kind of living, Christ becomes their testimony. In Numbers we see Christ as the testimony of God’s people. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="i-M7ojiJqGoJd-LWYW0HzOdKRKIEy22u_R9o2QysidURajdNowaOAucBwqV_zFWnD">C. Christ as the Center</h2><p data-content-id="1q83V7kEkTSAS8FhlVDskwjbLR03QFqsrqbsu0A6Y9sDz6OYDLPkVWCpO4FO6tj8_"> Christ is also the center of God’s people. This is portrayed by the way the children of Israel were encamped around the tabernacle with three tribes on each side. The four camps, each composed of three tribes, and the three families of the tribe of Levi all took the tabernacle with the ark as the center. The children of Israel thus took Christ as the meaning of life, the testimony, and the center. This shows us that as the church today we should take Christ as our meaning of life, our testimony, and our center. </p>

<p data-content-id="uVg-B0zfBhzFLu0-bfSRsngd9Th4eF9Rnw_t3_6v1pD3tO9lSNhdpPMAef8L-UIGR"> The picture portrayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40367" data-verses="Numbers 1:1">Numbers chapter one</span> shows us the entire New Testament, from the incarnation of the Triune God to be a man, living and dwelling among men, to the consummation of the incarnation, the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyLW49QsEhC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS"> To see the incarnation of the Triune God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40368" data-verses="Numbers 1:1">Numbers 1</span> is difficult, because we do not have such a concept. If we would see the incarnation of the Triune God in this chapter, we need to consider the matter of the tabernacle with the ark. Within the tabernacle was the ark, and within the ark was the law. The law is called “the testimony” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40369" data-verses="Numbers 17:4">17:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40370" data-verses="Numbers 17:10">10</span>). The law is a testimony of God because it testifies, shows us, God. Thus, it is actually God who is the center. However, here we do not have God merely in Himself but God in an ark made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. This ark, being one entity of two elements, wood and gold, typifies Christ in His humanity with His divinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="IflM7BbsLZ6u10ceoy3HYp9yXM-Pm_DMYrFV0s5yiOLZE994aXHfO4p54nuE3Htm0"> The word <em>incarnation</em> is not in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40371" data-verses="Numbers 1:1">Numbers chapter one</span>, but the picture is here. In this picture of the tabernacle with the ark, we see the Triune God incarnated to be a man living among men. The tabernacle was built with forty-eight boards. First, the number forty-eight is composed of six multiplied by eight, which signifies man (six) in resurrection (eight). Second, forty-eight is composed of twelve multiplied by four, which signifies the Triune God (contained in the number twelve, composed of three multiplied by four) in His creature (four). Therefore, this picture shows the Triune God <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> incarnated to be a man living among men. Here we see the Triune God, we see man, and we see the Triune God dwelling among men. </p>
<p data-content-id="HPFjB-1Auz0yuOHKiO7sXGRBytXuErvnZ-3dB9TpN-DIjpt7vl1AN1EJ-KBTMrfRS"> The picture of the New Jerusalem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40372" data-verses="Numbers 1:1">Numbers 1</span> involves the encampment of the twelve tribes of Israel around the tabernacle. The New Jerusalem has twelve gates, three gates on each of the four sides, with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40373" data-verses="Revelation 21:12-13">Rev. 21:12-13</span>). In Numbers, the twelve tribes were arranged into an array, which shows us a picture. In this array, three tribes, each tribe being an army, were encamped on each of the four sides of the tabernacle. On the east, toward the sunrise, was the camp of Judah, composed of the armies of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40374" data-verses="Numbers 2:2-9">Num. 2:2-9</span>). On the west, at the rear, was the camp of Ephraim, composed of the armies of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40375" data-verses="Numbers 2:18-24">2:18-24</span>). On the south was the camp of Reuben, composed of the armies of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40376" data-verses="Numbers 2:10-16">2:10-16</span>). On the north was the camp of Dan, composed of the armies of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40377" data-verses="Numbers 2:25-31">2:25-31</span>). This encamping of the twelve tribes is a picture of the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="FRSfve2gXKF2q5U8QMttWfYQTtgk8O0qwdoGc_QmQ-eQ8kJW69ciA8zsBiJhZIN53"> Now we can realize how <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40378" data-verses="Numbers 1:1">Numbers 1</span> affords us a picture of the New Testament from the incarnation to the New Jerusalem. This is actually a summary of the history of the church, which began with the incarnation and will consummate with the New Jerusalem. In type, the history of Israel from Numbers through Malachi, which includes things that are both very good and encouraging and very poor and discouraging, portrays the history of the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cmeet7LFEwA83Buuyy4WlpQGfibqBpX55w_jk3kONkrrJH7N7b1Pyn3Qqcfwcq2SE"> In the picture in Numbers, God is in the center; that is, God is in the ark, in Christ. God is no longer just in the heavens; He is also on the earth, in a man who is His embodiment. This man who is the embodiment of God is Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40379" data-verses="Colossians 2:9">Col. 2:9</span>). Such a man is constituted with two elements, a golden element and a wooden element. He is a “gold-wood” man, a God-man. </p>
<p data-content-id="PuIIleEPVSVfD8jhkWufhU1W1mt57_EJYxmruVj7g1UOrXT8awLuynKwbredYSK3_"> Now this wonderful One, the Triune God incarnated to be embodied as a man, has been expanded, increased, and enlarged. In His expansion and enlargement, Christ has become <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> the tabernacle, God’s dwelling place. As such a tabernacle, He is enterable. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ygMnNXQK98Bslpy7nKLLmhVrmYMEgYLj3HQenBBRZnxyBXU7VW1OzWf6pxTP6q5S"> When God was in Christ only, no one could enter into Him. Without Christ’s expansion, no one could enter into God. But now, in His expansion into a tabernacle, Christ is not only God’s dwelling place but also the place where we can enter into God. Today we can enter into God, taking Christ as our life that He may be the meaning of our life. As He is our life to be the meaning of life to us, He is our testimony. We live Him, express Him, show Him, in every aspect and in every direction. Then He spontaneously becomes our center. Therefore, Christ today is our meaning of life, our testimony, and our center. </p>
<p data-content-id="pitQJ6wzw9SLef7XU0zpqsAX_w8z_ho3XM7OLfBcppeT-qU_lUsjRuGVn988HowAD"> Christ, the embodiment of God, has been enlarged into a habitation in which God dwells and into which we enter. In this enlarged Body of Christ, God has a dwelling place, and we have a place where we can enter into God, meet with God, and even be mingled with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="vAsrJ2nXSZSYEVPzp03QoOlU08TW9-L_Lgvah9JawmYMePT4WRb2Med_Jz2YQdYJK"> This God had no intention to come down, to be incarnated at Bethlehem, and then remain stationary. For almost two thousand years this dear One has been moving. Today He is here with us, moving. In His moving, He is the Leader. He is the unique Leader, for He alone is qualified to lead. Christ is our Leader, our way, and our goal. When we have Christ, we have leadership. When we follow Christ, we follow our Leader. When we follow Him directly, we become a leader. The leadership is with Him; the leadership is He. Christ is not only our Leader but also the way we take today. Our way is Christ, and our goal also is Christ. Bringing Christ to a certain place should be honored. But if we bring something other than Christ, that thing should be condemned. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtQg4gkFxRAg6KQBybFiFbX_jZISmMyCMdudfZSiSkioM0_3Ome8OLQclMyg824a5"> Eventually, the picture in Numbers shows us God and His chosen people mingled together as one entity to conquer the enemy on earth. The enemy utilizes and usurps the entire earth, which God created for Himself and His purpose. How can God regain the earth? God will not regain the earth directly, by Himself as the mighty God, the Creator. In the New Testament economy, God would never do this by Himself. He had to be incarnated to become a man, Christ, and this <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> Christ has to be ministered to sinners to make them all the enlargement of Christ. As a result, there is on earth the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man that God may move on earth and regain it. This move began from Jerusalem as the center, passed through Judea and Samaria, progressed to the uttermost part of the earth, and is here today. Now we are part of this, part of the Triune God incarnated to be a man, living among men to have Himself increased into His chosen people, causing all of them to be mingled with the processed Triune God. This is God’s work of the new creation within the old creation. The ultimate consummation of this work will be the New Jerusalem, which is the processed Triune God mingled with the transformed tripartite man. This is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40380" data-verses="Numbers 1:1">Numbers chapter one</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="2E0ak2tPM0Mfc5DVkAQ7ZdVv2eMY3fc09HxajrXJ90qanQxeb0N_D56Uhkk3_Uw5t"> Having such a picture before us, let us now begin to consider how God’s people are formed into an army. </p>

God’s purpose is to have the New Jerusalem, to mingle Himself with His redeemed people. The formation of the children of Israel into a body to fight for God and to serve God typifies the New Testament believers being built up into the organic Body of Christ to fight for God for the carrying out, in its service to God, of God’s eternal economy. </p>

To put something in array is to set out something in a beautiful arrangement for a display. All the tribes encamped in array were in a beautiful order.

According to our observation and the outward appearance of the situation of the church today, there does not seem to be any encamping in array. In the Catholic church, the state churches, the denominations, and the independent groups, there is much confusion. In all these there are real believers, who are God’s chosen ones. However, among the real ones, there are many tares, many false believers, as revealed in the parable in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40395" data-verses="Matthew 13:24-30">Matthew 13:24-30</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40396" data-verses="Matthew 13:36-43">36-43</span>. Of course, God’s formed army does not include the tares; only the genuine believers in <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> Christ throughout the generations are counted. All these believers, after being saved, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of Christ, will be glorified. In this glorification will be seen the reality of the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God’s work, in His New Testament economy, of the new creation in the old creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHlejKwe4zJM9asMqbsyVuapu8a_w97ON3jvWMY9Q5agu8XBAHpB57Htd9BbOWaqj"> God will spend four dispensations to work His new creation out of the old creation. Eventually, God’s work of the new creation will consummate in one entity—the New Jerusalem. There we will see God’s redeemed people camping in array. Today, however, the situation among the children of God is a mess that causes us to mourn and weep. But we believe that out of this weeping there will be a jubilee. First, there will be a jubilee on a smaller scale during the millennium. Then there will be a jubilee on a full scale for eternity in the new heaven and new earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="ERNBZk2fVc6bxOiCk-X4O58n5r-nRx3McXQ0hmXB6AJkXe9nyhLoNBrjCzDoOcA-M"> The entire Bible of sixty-six books shows us one thing—God’s economy. God’s economy is, first, to work out the old creation. Then out of the old creation, God uses four dispensations to bring forth the new creation. Today, this new creation consummates in the church; in the millennium it will consummate in the New Jerusalem on a smaller scale; and in the new heaven and new earth it will consummate in the New Jerusalem on a full scale. The consummation of the picture of God’s economy revealed in the Bible is the New Jerusalem. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40397" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> there are negative things—the tares, the leaven, and the big tree—among the precious things. God in His economy does not care for these but for the wheat (the plant life), which will be transformed in nature to become gold, pearls, and precious stones (minerals). All these precious things will consummate in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem we will not see tares, leaven, or the big tree; instead, we will see gold, pearls, and precious stones. </p>
<p data-content-id="Se-6za1KSJE4D3ovoN73x2K9lBHOfZxM7ef9Yu5iYbmakYgNBSFmwp3_76eSfWWkE"> We must admit that, at present, we still have some leaven and some of the element of the big tree.

We confess that leaven and the element of the big tree are <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> with us, even within us. Nevertheless, we may have the joyous assurance that we also have gold, pearls, and precious stones and that these are growing and increasing. We may have such an assurance concerning ourselves and also concerning the church. When we look at our church and our work, we may be grieved by the damage caused by the messy situation among us. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40398" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> shows us that this is unavoidable.

<p data-content-id="ezw1IvP5hJlLyGzJuXCMzfCQr7wUre2non4KkPYaTfhE1FqPcM2yCoPnLNpUj9vS2"> First, we will reach the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom, which will still be in the old creation but will be in a revived dispensation. If we are faithful to the Lord in this life, we will be there in the millennial kingdom to participate in the New Jerusalem before the new heaven and new earth. However, if we are defeated, God will deal with us quite severely for a thousand years. The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40402" data-verses="Revelation 3:12">Rev. 3:12</span>) will be a prize only to the overcoming saints, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all the redeemed for eternity. In the new heaven and new earth all God’s redeemed people will be perfected and completed. Thus, for eternity in the New Jerusalem there will be no dust but rather gold, pearls, and precious stones. </p>

Every man encamping by his own standard, with the ensigns of their fathers’ houses signifies that they were arranged without their choice according to their preference but according to God’s ordination and arrangement. If an Israelite were born in the house of Reuben, he had to camp with the tribe of Reuben and be under the ensign of Reuben. <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> He could not camp with Judah or some other tribe.

The law is a portrait of God, typifying Christ as the testimony of God, expressing what God is. Hence, the ark within the tabernacle, as a type of Christ, the embodiment of God, was the center of God’s people, who were journeying in fighting for His testimony. For the testimony of God, the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of the testimony; for the meeting of God’s people, it was called the tent of meeting. </p>

The sanctuary was the tabernacle with its two sections, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The word <em>charge</em> refers to responsibility. For the priests to keep the <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> charge of the sanctuary meant that they were responsible for the entire sanctuary and everything related to it. If anything were damaged or stolen, the priests were responsible. </p>

Concerning the tabernacle, a number of charges were given by God to the children of Israel. They were supposed to do certain things and were not supposed to do other things. If the people kept these charges, it was fortunate for the priests. If the people could not keep God’s charge, the priests were held responsible. The priests were to correct the people or keep them away from the sanctuary or fulfill the charge for them. This is what it means to say that the priests kept the charge of the sanctuary for God’s charge to the children of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="lGJMqXpxLr00FAOi_3oq-0Lbumdyiel3q9IrhyEOb-mti2DuXEIULfVfV-8aXxhkd"> If we have experience in the spiritual service of God, we will realize that, in principle, the New Testament priests bear the same responsibility today. We not only bear the charge of the sanctuary ourselves, but often we must bear the responsibility for others’ service. If they do something wrong, we should correct them and also instruct them to do the right thing. The crucial point here is that the priests are charged to take care of God’s holy dwelling place. </p>

The Levites—<br/>Replacing the Firstborn of Israel</h2><p data-content-id="3Y75k2O-GWhqOrdtGMwxX3Y6BTats6BF3Ik8Rqg0fOcYDaq8QCBZ97FKiVycD9iDM"> The Levites replaced the firstborn of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40440" data-verses="Numbers 3:5-9">3:5-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40441" data-verses="Numbers 3:11-37">11-37</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40442" data-verses="Numbers 3:39-51">39-51</span>). Why was it necessary for the firstborn of Israel to be replaced or redeemed? At the time of the Passover in Egypt, all the firstborn were condemned. But unlike the firstborn of the Egyptians, the firstborn of Israel were not slain. Through the Passover all the firstborn of Israel were redeemed, saved, and replaced. Because of this, in succeeding generations all <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> the firstborn males among the children of Israel were to be replaced by the Levites, the serving ones. The firstborn had lost their position, and therefore it was necessary for them to be replaced by the Levites. For this reason, the number of Levites had to equal the number of firstborn, and any shortage had to be redeemed. </p>
<p data-content-id="GH2P9Y3tWVo3vwOnM-tmCBnhSFbUq0bMbEZhDa4imkkh08ueAdWa3Wq1nnlLdF8Wv"> This replacing of the firstborn by the Levites, the serving ones, indicates that everyone who has been redeemed, saved, and replaced must serve. Since we today have been redeemed, saved, and replaced, we must serve. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="DxVzNnfEqnwJJe7GyfHvYMQRVtCbfwglxmBI07FipOB6QgwVm01HCCfjmiwJXMqx5">F. The Duties in the Tabernacle’s Setting Out</h2><p data-content-id="Se-6za1KSJE4D3ovoN73x3q9sSnOfZxM7ef9Yu5iYbmakYgNBSFmwp3_76eSfWWkE"> The priests and the Levites had certain duties in the tabernacle’s setting out. To set out is to go forward. Thus, what is covered in the holy service is not for a Christ who is inactive but for a Christ who is very active. In His activity we must match Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="gVK3NAkEMwsZE8Q-ot7YEKudAyVfbM5Uya85eCH9oZZY7jOOGPbB82gui7YdXn6-O"> In the Old Testament, God could move by Himself, without man. For instance, when God created the heavens and the earth, there was no need of man to match Him. But the New Testament begins with the divine incarnation. This set up the principle for God’s New Testament economy, which is that God needs man to match Him. Without man, God can do nothing. In the Old Testament, God could do many things without man. In the New Testament, God has given Himself to be bound together with man. This binding together of God with man can be illustrated by the runners in a three-legged race, who are bound together in such a way that each pair of runners has three legs. In the New Testament, God must have man to match Him, to be one with Him, to coordinate with Him. This is the basic principle of God’s New Testament economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37CjRgbUUF8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e"> In His New Testament economy, God does nothing without man. Man must be one with God, match God, and be bound <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> together with God. “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40449" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). This implies that in the New Testament God’s economy has bound man together with God. God is willing to be bound to man, for He cannot move without man. Now God moves not only with man but also within man. This is why God never preaches the gospel directly to anyone; instead, He preaches the gospel through man. </p>
<p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5FnmjgkZsL37tgQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> Christ is moving today throughout the earth. “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40450" data-verses="Acts 1:8">Acts 1:8</span>). To be Christ’s witnesses is to be His testimony, and to be His testimony is to be His portrait. If we are Christ’s testimony, His portrait, people will see Him wherever we go. We witness for Christ in the sense of being His portraits. Hence, all gospel preachers are actually witnesses, portraits, of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk2srEvl5hK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D"> The Lord’s move today is with us. Regarding His move, we may be either a “mule wagon” or a “747.” By this I mean that if we are slow, the Lord’s move with us will be slow. If we are fast, the Lord’s move with us will be fast. </p>
<p data-content-id="UdegCvQnXR5xgUhUaUGVfBvjmeK-Cu7dqw2JPQOIsoKn_Y8dqhxtHLn_1Zya9Y6Px"> We need to see how the Lord moves today. He moves within us. We are today’s Gershonites, Kohathites, and sons of Merari. In order to see how Christ moves on earth, we should look at the move of the tabernacle. The tabernacle moved on the shoulders of the descendants of the three sons of Levi. This moving was in a very good sequence, with no confusion. Only Aaron and his sons could look at the holy things and touch them. The Levites could look at them and touch them only after they had been packed and covered. The layman had no right at all to touch the holy things. </p>
<p data-content-id="MNYPxEBRKCjGvjYcSm_-x6G62mDZBONkc_BXexp5aMeJNuq4a-EbRUgKX-x3mauLs"> From the foregoing we can realize that not everyone is able to bring the Lord’s recovery from one country to another. By the Lord’s mercy, I can testify that when I came to the United States, I brought the ark with all the furnishings of the sanctuary. I also brought the tent of meeting, which is the enlargement of Christ, the church. The Lord moves through our bearing the ark, the furnishings of the sanctuary, and the tent of meeting. <span class="pg" data-page-id="35" id="35">[35]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="VBaATaFwkk1R2p-lJIa9e_4uZlOY975Xa5FmEubBdBBuFAyJhWAJhBvAZCseteqbq"> Christ, the embodiment of God for His expansion, moves through those who love Him. If we do not move, He cannot move. Rather, He is bound and even imprisoned within us. If we do not move, we become a prison to the Lord. </p>

The Priests</h2><p data-content-id="1q83V7kEkTSAS8FhlVDskxjbJQ03QFqsrqbsu0A6Y9sDz6OYDLPkVWCpO4FO6tj8_"> The duties in the tabernacle’s setting out involve both the priests and the Levites. In the Old Testament there is a distinction between the priests and the Levites. However, in the New Testament there is only one class, that of the priests, which includes the Levites. Hence, what the Levites did in the Old Testament, we, the New Testament priests, should also do. </p>

<p data-content-id="THD-di8wGJMlaO716gw-AgS1nTkcoQbV18U2QgihgQryXjW6mpyEGOcguhQaI5k-h"> The priests packed the furnishings of the sanctuary, including the ark, the showbread table, the lampstand, the golden altar, and the altar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40451" data-verses="Numbers 4:5-14">vv. 5-14</span>). The first item of the furnishings of the sanctuary to be packed was the ark. The priests covered the ark with the veil of the screen, a covering of porpoise skin, and a cloth of blue (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40452" data-verses="Numbers 4:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="nM8Y5Wz2ywg4CN1_6gtQBl_Y4YB-LgKssqMiyD-dakeNC6drN0cRYEQTJ7y6zXvtD"> We today have the privilege of packing the things of Christ. First, we pack Christ as the ark, with all that this comprises. Then we pack the showbread table. This is to minister Christ as food, as bread, to God’s serving ones. The Lord Jesus said, “I am the bread of life....He who eats Me shall also live because of Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40453" data-verses="John 6:48">John 6:48</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40454" data-verses="John 6:57">57b</span>). We also pack the lampstand. The showbread table is for life, and the lampstand is for light. Furthermore, we pack the golden altar, which is for God’s acceptance, and the bronze altar, which is for God’s redemption. </p>

Appointing the Levites to Do Their Service</h2><p data-content-id="R2qYnpqtRGomTlcXmAAHxOk8G1dQ7C-wTRkJI_Sw9RV5N2W8gemugfOv9FQXr9QVG"> The priests appointed the Levites to do their service <span class="pg" data-page-id="36" id="36">[36]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40455" data-verses="Numbers 4:19">Num. 4:19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40456" data-verses="Numbers 4:27-28">27-28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40457" data-verses="Numbers 4:33">33</span>). The Levites doing their service were not according to their way but under the direction of the anointed priests. This indicates that we, the New Testament priests serving God, should not act according to our own idea but under the direction of the anointed view, that is, under the direction of the very Spirit who anoints us. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="sagbDhA7pAxvKgcwYTawR6LsJgcCNiozwYjsNXQN0-DGbiFNnmUF8HY7mxgZVUtzf">c. The Charge of Eleazar the Son of Aaron the Priest</h2><p data-content-id="wFQBjuNz7_AjSqmWfTe5PdTYvBmcO8mU81RI6yzs2rp89GNZ-ynPkrIKOR1S7BkLj"> “The charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the continual meal offering, and the anointing oil, even the charge of all the tabernacle and all that is in it, of the sanctuary and its vessels” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40458" data-verses="Numbers 4:16">v. 16</span>). All these items signify the different aspects of the rich Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40459" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> Paul says, “To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.” By the New Testament alone it is difficult for us to see Christ’s unsearchable, or untraceable, riches. We also need the types, the pictures, in the Old Testament. Through all the items mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40460" data-verses="Numbers 4:1">Numbers 4</span> we can see that Christ’s riches are untraceable. </p>
<p data-content-id="L9HftOmYqjmYA0hV0PtiVVPLCDil6jSE9MY_rfUhPEuKy3ijGqB94J8MCZIyjUWvw"> Even the anointing oil is Christ. Although the anointing oil signifies the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is the consummated Triune God. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40461" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39b</span> says, “The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” After Christ was glorified (resurrected), the Spirit became the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God. The Triune God was “raw,” unprocessed, but after passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, He was fully consummated to be the all-inclusive, compound Spirit. Today the Lord is the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40462" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40463" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>).

The Corporate Dealing</h2><p data-content-id="qGcKu1ZVR5xTox402-R1foLvg-SO0c7yKDvJ8DBs_v_SpNT-ALQWUMIgMeeSUavPV"> The dealing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40503" data-verses="Numbers 5:1">Numbers 5</span> is in a very good sequence. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40504" data-verses="Numbers 5:1-4">Numbers 5:1-4</span> begins with a corporate dealing. The whole army should have a corporate dealing, not just a dealing as individuals. This corporate dealing mainly concerns three <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> things—leprosy, discharges, and uncleanness through contact with the dead. </p>

Dealing with Leprosy</h2><p data-content-id="8Nao4cbRs9AiSNlXRQNA-z4b1G-PfC6ZUe2gLXackKJJ2QeSyCCiLybrCyWPJHWD_"> In the church life as God’s army, there should be no leprosy. Leprosy signifies the evil issues of the natural man, especially in rebellion. In this sense, we all are leprous and have leprosy. Leprosy is something within us, in our very element. It is deep and subjective, and it needs a thorough dealing. If we do not deal with the leprosy within us, we will become defiled and unclean. </p>
<p data-content-id="0I15hg85dOcthbcFQOxX6fnEn0ObfxmdReoS22AKOrqla8tAqHC6ayC5UH6a1tzmM"> According to the Old Testament teaching, leprosy comes mainly from rebellion against God’s authority. The first illustration of this was the case of Miriam and Aaron, who rebelled against God’s deputy authority, Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40505" data-verses="Numbers 12:1-10">12:1-10</span>). By rebelling against God’s deputy authority, Miriam became leprous. </p>

Anything that comes out of our being, such as sweat, is a discharge. Spiritually, the discharges are the excessive, abnormal, and unrestrained issues of the natural man, signifying one’s being without control, being unbridled, in relation to one’s self, temper, preferences, likes, and dislikes. In our daily life, if our being is somewhat excessive and unrestrained, it becomes abnormal. This abnormality is a discharge. For example, if we lose our temper, we are excessive, unrestrained, and abnormal. This is a discharge, an issue, of the natural man. An unrestrained expression of our likes or dislikes is also a discharge. </p>

These three things—leprosy from rebellion, discharges from being excessive, abnormal, and unrestrained, and uncleanness through contact with the dead—are a full type of the uncleanness that should be dealt with and removed from the church life. If we deal with these three things, the church will be clean. </p>

For instance, in sitting next to others, we may want more space for ourselves and thus may not be careful to keep our legs in front of our own chair. If our conscience is keen, we will realize that this is wrong. </p>
<p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5FnmjgkZs735vgQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> Furthermore, sometimes we may take advantage of others’ <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> possessions, perhaps using them without permission.

Whenever we have a holy portion to present to God, we give it to the priest. Here we see that this restitution for dealing with our guilt becomes holy, just like a holy portion given to God.

<p data-content-id="sagbDhA7pAxvKgcwYTawR6rsNz8CNiozwYjsNXQN0-DGbiFNnmUF8HY7mxgZVUtzf"> In this message we will continue to consider the dealing with defilement described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40524" data-verses="Numbers 5:1">chapter five</span> of Numbers. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wFQBjuNz7_AjSqmWfTe5PdzYqSWcO8mU81RI6yzs2rp89GNZ-ynPkrIKOR1S7BkLj">D. Dealing with a Wife<br/>over Whom Her Husband Was Jealous</h2><p data-content-id="L9HftOmYqjmYA0hV0PtiVVvLIQil6jSE9MY_rfUhPEuKy3ijGqB94J8MCZIyjUWvw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40525" data-verses="Numbers 5:11-31">5:11-31</span> we have the dealing with a wife over whom her husband was jealous. This case reveals that God is not only sovereign over each of His children but also that He may even do something miraculous in dealing with a particular kind of defilement. </p>
<p data-content-id="mHOnKBa-6rL99a2gC8scd1atvfvYvfOyk6W1gSJKbbJlzuiLfBLqPv4sI-uBw0zXm"> In understanding the book of Numbers, we can easily understand in a logical way the corporate and individual dealings in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40526" data-verses="Numbers 5:1-10">5:1-10</span>. However, it is not easy to comprehend logically the dealing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40527" data-verses="Numbers 5:11-31">5:11-31</span>, something that is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. The only way to understand this dealing logically is to take it as part of typology. </p>
<p data-content-id="9E0RwvkihCfbWu-ZTtqafPiujD4N7t73TIeHLchn3Izflx0InPBI1FJa49wKFpuwV"> The revelation in the Bible is given to us in different ways. First, the divine revelation is given in clear words, such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40528" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>, where we are told that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="jgnwUAKnb3LF-rKF2so0vfqi2hPYdu4JVjXaJif78hdaEK0IAPD6KUO8RgekuaJZh"> Second, the revelation is conveyed through historical records. The books from Exodus to Malachi are a long history of the children of Israel, unveiling to us an abundance of divine truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="THD-di8wGJMlaO716gw-Agy1kTEcoQbV18U2QgihgQryXjW6mpyEGOcguhQaI5k-h"> Third, the divine revelation is given through the lives of different characters, such as the great men in Genesis (Adam, <span class="pg" data-page-id="48" id="48">[48]</span> Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph). For example, Enosh was a weak, frail, mortal man, but he was characterized by his calling on the name of the Lord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40529" data-verses="Genesis 4:26">Gen. 4:26</span>). Although Enosh was weak, by calling on the name of the Lord he was made rich and strong, for he entered into the strength and riches of the One on whom he called. </p>
<p data-content-id="nM8Y5Wz2ywg4CN1_6gtQBlfY7Yh-LgKssqMiyD-dakeNC6drN0cRYEQTJ7y6zXvtD"> Finally, the divine revelation is given through typology. Typology implies figures, shadows, types, and patterns. For instance, Abraham’s two wives are figures of two covenants: Hagar signifies the covenant of law, and Sarah, the covenant of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40530" data-verses="Galatians 4:21-31">Gal. 4:21-31</span>). The story of Sarah and Hagar may be considered not only as a figure but also as a shadow. Neither the covenant of law nor the covenant of grace had been enacted at the time of Hagar and Sarah. Nevertheless, Hagar and Sarah are, respectively, shadows of the covenants of law and of grace. </p>
<p data-content-id="6EZ7oiut5G7ZYj3fVU9kUFozOdXLkv2-BMvHT6O93qKj4EGth2ACU0vty01b6A_6D"> Even clear words and figures of speech may be related to typology. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40531" data-verses="Proverbs 4:18">Proverbs 4:18</span> says, “The path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day” (ASV). This proverb is a clear word, yet in this word is a figure of speech that is a part of typology. The “dawning light,” the sunrise, signifies Christ’s coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40532" data-verses="Luke 1:78">Luke 1:78</span>). This figure may also signify our revival in the morning. From this illustration we see that a clear, plain word may include a figure of speech which may be regarded as a part of typology. </p>
<p data-content-id="R2qYnpqtRGomTlcXmAAHxOE8F09Q7C-wTRkJI_Sw9RV5N2W8gemugfOv9FQXr9QVG"> The typology in the Bible is a great thing and has many aspects. Probably, in the Old Testament the divine revelation conveyed through typology may equal that in plain words. </p>
<p data-content-id="sagbDhA7pAxvKgcwYTawR6rsKg8CNiozwYjsNXQN0-DGbiFNnmUF8HY7mxgZVUtzf"> It is difficult to explain <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40533" data-verses="Numbers 5:11-31">Numbers 5:11-31</span> by clear words. What is portrayed here has nothing to do with history or with a character, but it does have something to do with typology. </p>
<p data-content-id="wFQBjuNz7_AjSqmWfTe5PdzYsBGcO8mU81RI6yzs2rp89GNZ-ynPkrIKOR1S7BkLj"> In typology, God gained a people at Mount Sinai and used them to build a habitation on earth. He then gave them a set of laws, regulations, and ordinances for their worshipping of Him. After this, He came in to form this people into an army. The people gained by God to be formed into an army that can fight for Him and a priesthood that can serve Him should be altogether clean—in their being, nature, speaking, <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> appearance, behavior, the way they move and act, and even in what they possess. </p>
<p data-content-id="L9HftOmYqjmYA0hV0PtiVVvLBACl6jSE9MY_rfUhPEuKy3ijGqB94J8MCZIyjUWvw"> The corporate dealing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40534" data-verses="Numbers 5:1">chapter five</span> includes only three things: leprosy, discharges, and deadness. Nevertheless, these things comprise all the uncleanness that needs to be dealt with among God’s holy people. On the side of the individual, the dealing with one’s faithfulness is a dealing according to God’s righteousness. This is why there is the need of such a portion as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40535" data-verses="Numbers 5:1-10">5:1-10</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="mHOnKBa-6rL99a2gC8scd1atnPfYvfOyk6W1gSJKbbJlzuiLfBLqPv4sI-uBw0zXm"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40536" data-verses="Numbers 5:11-31">Numbers 5:11-31</span> is a particular portion in all the sixty-six books of the Bible, showing us not only God’s sovereignty but also His miracle. The record here is a record of a miracle. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjo9b_sbrL-1x6xy-0gySOfIXqcZurBOk8dWCpfBgyBR0D6E30f90C4kCu_Hzx6Aq"> The test with the water of bitterness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40537" data-verses="Numbers 5:18">v. 18</span>) used a combination of water (referring to the Holy Spirit), dust from the floor of the tabernacle (referring to man’s human nature), and the meal offering (referring to Christ). The wife who was under suspicion was asked to drink the water. If she was sinful, the water would work in her abdomen to cause it to swell and to cause her thigh to be reduced. This does not seem to be a record of something divine. However, this is a wonderful miracle. </p>
<p data-content-id="AQYzzKQWYTkaFQeLtwXyC9jlx-OydiCBfKdc5vmfXuwsxv0xS9OBpDz-8zAqA_-Qz"> The record in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40538" data-verses="Numbers 5:1">Numbers 5</span> is similar to the record of what the Lord Jesus did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40539" data-verses="John 9:1-7">John 9:1-7</span>. He healed a blind man by mingling spittle with dust to make clay and then anointing the blind man’s eyes with the clay. Today, if the Lord tried to do this to us, we might consider it a joke, and we might not be willing to allow Him to do such a thing to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="FRSfve2gXKF2q5U8QMttWeIQQtAk8O0qwdoGc_QmQ-eQ8kJW69ciA8zsBiJhZIN53"> In the record of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40540" data-verses="Numbers 5:11-31">Numbers 5:11-31</span> we can see typology. The water typifies the Holy Spirit, the meal offering of barley typifies the resurrected Christ, and the dust represents the created man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40541" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Gen. 2:7</span>). Hence, creation, the Spirit, Christ, and His death and resurrection are all involved. The water into which was put dust from the floor of the tabernacle became not only a water of bitterness that brought a curse, but also a working water that caused the abdomen to be enlarged and the thigh to be reduced. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cmeet7LFEwA83Buuyy4WloAGci7qBpX55w_jk3kONkrrJH7N7b1Pyn3Qqcfwcq2SE"> If we would expound <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40542" data-verses="Numbers 5:11-31">5:11-31</span>, we must know how to expound the types. The hardest point for us to expound is the dust on the floor of the tabernacle. Dust refers to the natural <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> man, to the man created by God, and the tabernacle is God’s dwelling. God’s dwelling place is built upon the man created by Him. This is the dust on the floor of the tabernacle. God’s dwelling place is holy, yet there is a kind of dust that can be joined to God’s dwelling place. To take such a dust and put it into the water is to take a human nature that can be joined to God’s dwelling place and put it into the Holy Spirit. This water containing dust is then put together with Christ as the meal offering made of barley (in resurrection) but with no frankincense and no oil (without the effectiveness of resurrection and without the Holy Spirit) upon it. Here we see the human nature created by God conjoined with God’s dwelling place, put into the Holy Spirit, and applied with the resurrected Christ. Such a thing will be a real test of our chastity. </p>
<p data-content-id="PuIIleEPVSVfD8jhkWufhVlW2nN57_EJYxmruVj7g1UOrXT8awLuynKwbredYSK3_"> Corporately and individually God’s people should be chaste to God. It is not sufficient merely to be clean. To be clean is one thing, and to be chaste is another. We may not have leprosy, we may not have discharges, and we may not have any contact with deadness, but are we chaste? We may be very faithful, but we do not have a high character if we are not chaste. A wife may be good in every way, but if she has another love, the other love will spoil her in her chastity. God’s people should not only be clean in every way and in every respect—they should also be chaste. Thus, we need to learn how to be chaste toward the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="-ygMnNXQK98Bslpy7nKLLnxVon4MEgYLj3HQenBBRZnxyBXU7VW1OzWf6pxTP6q5S"> Let us now briefly consider some of the details related to the dealing with a wife over whom her husband was jealous. </p>

We must remember that the church and all the believers have a husband—Christ. We may not be rebellious (leprous), we may be quite self-controlled and restrained (not discharging), and our behavior may be altogether right with both God and man, but as a wife to Christ, are we chaste? To be chaste, a wife should not have any love other than her <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> husband. If a wife appreciates any other man, she is on the verge of losing her chastity. </p>

At times we might have made a vow to the Lord, but it might not have been very strong or absolute, and we might not have kept it. Can you make a vow and be faithful to it for your whole life? </p>

Separation is on the negative side, and sanctification is on the positive side. On the negative side, we separate ourselves from the worldly people.

This means that a person is not a Nazarite by birth but can make himself a Nazarite by making a special vow. Thus, the priests are ordained by God out of His initiation, but the Nazarites become such by a vow out of their own initiation. Today we are in the Lord’s recovery out of God’s initiation and also out of our initiation. Both are needed. </p>

This is illustrated by the case of Samuel. Samuel was a Nazarite who complemented the deficient Eli, a priest ordained by God. In his old age Eli had certain deficiencies. However, Samuel, out of his own initiation, came in to fill up the gap caused by Eli’s deficiencies and thereby to complement the deficient Eli. </p>

Here we see that a Nazarite had to abstain from wine and anything related to its source. This signifies abstaining from the earthly enjoyment and pleasure (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40566" data-verses="Psalms 104:15">Psa. 104:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40567" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 10:19">Eccl. 10:19</span>).

<p data-content-id="ezw1IvP5hJlLyGzJuXCMzdyQo4QUre2non4KkPYaTfhE1FqPcM2yCoPnLNpUj9vS2"> A Nazarite had to abstain from vinegar made from wine, from the juice of grapes, and from grapes fresh or dried. This signifies abstaining from anything that issues in earthly enjoyment or pleasure. Vinegar is classified with wine because the source is the same. Wine, vinegar, and grape juice are all prohibited. From this we see that the one who is absolute for God is altogether separated from anything of earthly pleasures. This shows the absoluteness of the Nazarite. </p>

Not shaving the head signifies not rejecting the headship of the Lord (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40569" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:3">1 Cor. 11:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40570" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:6">6</span>). </p>

Spiritually speaking, for us to shave our head means that we cast off the Lord’s authority over us. The Nazarite was to let his hair grow long (freely); that is, he was to remain in subjection to the Lord’s headship, wherein is the power (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40571" data-verses="Judges 16:17">Judg. 16:17</span>). </p>

If we were to do away with the police and close the courts, society would be full of robbers and murderers. We could not bear to live in such an intolerable situation. The United States of America has an excellent constitution, and based upon this constitution there are strong laws and many courts to see that these laws are carried out. Everyone who appears in a court of law must <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> submit to the laws of the United States government.

Thus, it would be dangerous to be in a situation in which there is no deputy authority. This was the reason God established human government (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40572" data-verses="Genesis 9:5-6">Gen. 9:5-6</span>). The entire government is a deputy authority representing God’s authority. Speaking of this, Paul says, “Let every person be subject to the authorities over them. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are appointed by God. Therefore he who resists the authority opposes what God has appointed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40573" data-verses="Romans 13:1-2">Rom. 13:1-2a</span>). Teachers, employers, and police officers are deputy authorities. Everywhere on earth there is deputy authority. </p>
<p data-content-id="VBaATaFwkk1R2p-lJIa9e8oublOY975Xa5FmEubBdBBuFAyJhWAJhBvAZCseteqbq"> Let us apply this matter of deputy authority to the church. Is there deputy authority in the church? If there is no deputy authority in the church, why are there elders? Recently, some have said that there is no deputy authority in the New Testament. If such a claim is true, why does the New Testament tell us that there are elders in the churches? Surely, Christ is the Head, and the authority is the Spirit, but we still need elders in the church. Without elders, the church would be in anarchy. </p>

<p data-content-id="Cmeet7LFEwA83Buuyy4WlrgGfjbqBpX55w_jk3kONkrrJH7N7b1Pyn3Qqcfwcq2SE"> We do not realize how dirty and defiling death is. We consider sin to be very defiling, yet God hates death much more than sin. In the church life, sin may come in to defile the church and damage the saints, but more often we are defiled by death. Death is something hidden. Often death is right beside us, yet we have no consciousness of it or feeling concerning it and become defiled by it. </p>
<p data-content-id="PuIIleEPVSVfD8jhkWufhWFW1nt57_EJYxmruVj7g1UOrXT8awLuynKwbredYSK3_"> How can we know that we have been defiled by death? We know this by having a sense, or feeling, of deadness. Sin brings in condemnation, which affects our conscience. However, death is not a matter of condemnation, not something that affects our conscience. Rather, death is a matter that deadens us and makes us dead. <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="-ygMnNXQK98Bslpy7nKLLkRVrnYMEgYLj3HQenBBRZnxyBXU7VW1OzWf6pxTP6q5S"> Often when you come to a meeting, you receive a supply of life and are enlivened. Sometimes, however, when you get home from a meeting, you feel deadened, but you do not know why. You sense no condemnation in your conscience, but there is a killing going on within you that makes you dead. Your spirit is weak and dull. You are “down” and cannot rise up, and you cannot pray for some days. You did not know it, but in that particular meeting you received some killing; you were deadened by some kind of death. We all have had this kind of experience. </p>
<p data-content-id="pitQJ6wzw9SLef7XU0zpquwX_z8z_ho3XM7OLfBcppeT-qU_lUsjRuGVn988HowAD"> As those who are absolutely and utterly for God, we must avoid earthly pleasure and the influence of death. It is easy to abstain from earthly pleasure, but it is not easy to sense that we are near someone who is spiritually dead. Nevertheless, if we are living in the Spirit in every way, when we come to a meeting, we may immediately have the sense that deadness is there. We may realize not only that the meeting is low and slow but that in the meeting there is deadness hidden beneath the surface. At such a time we need to pray very much to counter that deadening situation: “Lord, cover me with Your blood against any deadening, against any spiritual deadness.” We must fight against deadness. </p>
<p data-content-id="vAsrJ2nXSZSYEVPzp03QoMVU0_TW9-L_Lgvah9JawmYMePT4WRb2Med_Jz2YQdYJK"> Early in the church life in my hometown we were on a church life honeymoon. Everything was new and fresh, and it was difficult to sense any deadness. About a year later, I left my job, became full-time, and moved to Shanghai to be with Brother Nee in the church there. The church in Shanghai had a considerable history and had passed through many troubles. Thus, the church was rather old. Although I was at the center of the work and could have come to know the situation there, I learned not to know anything, for the more we know, the more we are deadened. (Most of the talk in the church life is not related to sinful things but is related to death.) In some of the meetings I was enlivened, but sometimes I had the feeling of being dead. It seemed that the longer I sat in the meeting, the more I became deadened. I wanted to pray, but I was not able to utter anything in prayer. I was under the killing of death, and my spirit could not rise up. <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="WtQg4gkFxRAg6KQBybFiFZn_gYoSmMyCMdudfZSiSkioM0_3Ome8OLQclMyg824a5"> Later, I talked to some older, more experienced ones, and I learned a lesson. When you come to a meeting, you need to sense whether there is any deadness there. You should not do this purposely, as if you were attending the meeting as an inspector. On the contrary, you should be a person who is able to sense the presence of death in a meeting. If death is present, you should be the first to pray, “Lord, cover this meeting with Your prevailing blood. Under this blood we participate in the divine life.” Exercise your spirit strongly against the deadness in the meeting. Then as you sit in the meeting you will be protected. This is part of the spiritual warfare. </p>
<p data-content-id="2E0ak2tPM0Mfc5DVkAQ7Zflv1fsY3fc09HxajrXJ90qanQxeb0N_D56Uhkk3_Uw5t"> The churches in the United States have an extensive background and history. Because of the background and the present situation, there are many elements that have brought in death. I believe that this is the reason for the gradual decline in attendance at the prayer meeting in many churches. Hidden deadness can cause the prayer meeting to become dormant. We need to fight against death and its effects. </p>
<p data-content-id="uVg-B0zfBhzFLu0-bfSRslQd5Bh4eF9Rnw_t3_6v1pD3tO9lSNhdpPMAef8L-UIGR"> As Nazarites, we must learn to avoid deadness. We can easily avoid the deadness caused by the death of a blood relative, for that kind of death is apparent. It is not easy, however, to avoid the unexpected death of someone near us, because that kind of death is often hidden. Therefore, we must be those who are full of life, which is “anti-death.” This depends on how much we exercise our spirit to pray, not in a general way but with a prayer that fights against the enemy. </p>
<p data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyLUI9V-UhC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS"> Sin is of Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40584" data-verses="John 8:44">John 8:44</span>), who is also the source of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40585" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). With the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, there is evil; however, the result of partaking of this tree is not evil—it is death. When we eat of the tree of life, the result is life. In the church life we must constantly fight against death. For example, if in the prayer meeting death makes it difficult for us to pray, we need to fight against death and its influence. </p>
<p data-content-id="IflM7BbsLZ6u10ceoy3HYrNydfePm_DMYrFV0s5yiOLZE994aXHfO4p54nuE3Htm0"> As Nazarites we must abstain from earthly pleasure, remain under the headship of the Lord, and learn to fight <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> against death. Death is everywhere. Society is filled with the germs of death. Because these germs are even in the church life, we need to pray daily, hourly, fighting against death, the last enemy of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40586" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:26">1 Cor. 15:26</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="HPFjB-1Auz0yuOHKiO7sXEhB5-nuErvnZ-3dB9TpN-DIjpt7vl1AN1EJ-KBTMrfRS"> We should not think that the Nazarites are not for fighting. The Nazarites are numbered for the formation of God’s army. They are very vigilant, full of feeling for the war against death. In every church there is the need of the sense, the consciousness, of death so that we may fight against it. </p>

<p data-content-id="Br6Kg7546HFKM2GARtGpqA7aBRzJvJXn1XnlscnO9mIErIt9z5oiyXgJPhz_m6igQ"> A Nazarite is a superior person, one who is absolutely, utterly, and ultimately for God. In order to be a Nazarite, one must pass through all the dealings with defilement and the test of suspicion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40591" data-verses="Numbers 5:1">chapter five</span>. Anyone who has not passed through the dealings and the test in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40592" data-verses="Numbers 5:1">Numbers 5</span> cannot be a Nazarite. </p>
<p data-content-id="x30XFBmjVsgxZ2D79gWqV0yKAptdU6xfKVe4jISiWv2y8vVsZC3Hniqu3S7FO7vNY"> A Nazarite must overcome four main things. First, he must overcome the natural affection toward his blood relatives, the natural affection he has for his mother, father, wife, and children. The Lord Jesus overcame such natural affection. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40593" data-verses="Matthew 12:48-50">Matthew 12:48 through 50</span> say, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers? And stretching out His hand over His disciples, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother.” The Lord Jesus recognized as His relatives those who were His relatives in spirit, not those who were His relatives in the natural life. </p>
<p data-content-id="rUqekoRmFH5ko70ziWtSf3_a2JZEL8JopHkKJur0RBOu5pxUAN_84W9dRCflBtDXA"> Surely the Lord Jesus was a real Nazarite. The best pattern of a Nazarite is the man Jesus. Since He is the pattern, we all must learn of Him, follow Him, and take His yoke (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40594" data-verses="Matthew 11:29-30">Matt. 11:29-30</span>). As a rule, every New Testament believer should be a Nazarite. However, today it is difficult to find one proper New Testament Nazarite in a city. <span class="pg" data-page-id="70" id="70">[70]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="d38X8EOiMEk9dP_79EmblyiRyomQg--9-XB3OqGiYKF1sxI6uIKUnB4ChkhxSbG8O"> The second thing a Nazarite must overcome is earthly pleasure. If we would be Nazarites, we must abstain from earthly pleasure. </p>
<p data-content-id="4MK-wePHgeEAEGgR-z7X0Mu1hxRZhE7RGIluVa5oEpcHV3stVAVn4-Tc5CTQh0iYn"> Third, a Nazarite must deal with the rebellion in his nature. Thank God that we were created with an abundance of hair on our head, indicating that we are under authority. I can testify that it is a great blessing to be under someone, some thing, or some environment. During the Japanese invasion of China, I was arrested by the Japanese and kept in prison for thirty days. Although I was under a very strict dealing and control, even that imprisonment was a blessing to me. </p>
<p data-content-id="owSxjcqeZRVmxEIS3OihHHfsyKldhdw0vmgvUEemAnltodyTzv6yHvYP90yMUcQyG"> Children and teenagers need to be under authority. A child who is not under authority will be unruly and wild. The same is true of teenagers who are not willing to be under someone, some thing, or some environment. </p>
<p data-content-id="3Y75k2O-GWhqOrdtGMwxW2Y6DSats6BF3Ik8Rqg0fOcYDaq8QCBZ97FKiVycD9iDM"> In the church life we all have received God and have been born of God. We all have received the life of God. In this sense we all, including the apostle Paul, are equal. However, in the church some are babes. In his first Epistle, John, in a general way, addressed all the saints as “little children” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40595" data-verses="1John 2:1">2:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40596" data-verses="1John 2:28">28</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40597" data-verses="1John 3:7">3:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40598" data-verses="1John 3:18">18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40599" data-verses="1John 4:4">4:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40600" data-verses="1John 5:21">5:21</span>). Nevertheless, he respectively addressed some as “young children,” others as “young men,” and still others as “fathers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40601" data-verses="1John 2:12-14">2:12-14</span>). To say that all the members of a family of three generations are the same would make the family a mess. In family life we surely need to respect the differences between the grandparents, the parents, and the children. The principle is the same in the church life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40602" data-verses="1Peter 5:5">First Peter 5:5</span> says, “Younger men, be subject to elders.” Although, in the spirit, the older ones should also learn to obey the younger ones (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40603" data-verses="Ephesians 5:21">Eph. 5:21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40604" data-verses="1Peter 5:5">1 Pet. 5:5b</span>), still the difference in age remains. </p>
<p data-content-id="GH2P9Y3tWVo3vwOnM-tmDAnhQEbUq0bMbEZhDa4imkkh08ueAdWa3Wq1nnlLdF8Wv"> It is a blessing to be under someone or some thing. It is even a blessing to be severely limited. I thank the Lord that from the day I came into the recovery, the Lord put me under someone, some thing, or some environment. </p>
<p data-content-id="c66RxjgPYhMLBezgrzhPw-33gIRZ-jMxsmz68qF6tmK_P8z65dz6eCIYn-7KqSz3Q"> Today some are teaching that it is not necessary for believers to submit to a deputy authority, that believers should not be under anyone. This erroneous teaching is very damaging. First, it is damaging to those who teach in this way, and then <span class="pg" data-page-id="71" id="71">[71]</span> it is damaging to the ones who receive such a teaching. Those who accept the teaching that the believers should not submit to deputy authority will be spoiled by this teaching. Some may even be spoiled without remedy in their youth. Therefore, it is a serious matter to teach that we should not submit to deputy authority, and it is also a serious matter to receive this teaching. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHlejKwe4zJM9asMqbsyUuqpu9a_w97ON3jvWMY9Q5agu8XBAHpB57Htd9BbOWaqj"> A Nazarite is a person full of hair, full of submission. With him there are a submissive spirit, standing, atmosphere, and intention. If you are such a person, there will be a great blessing for you and for your future. </p>
<p data-content-id="ERNBZk2fVc6bxOiCk-X4P5Mn5q-nRx3McXQ0hmXB6AJkXe9nyhLoNBrjCzDoOcA-M"> Fourth, a Nazarite must always try his best to avoid death. Do not allow anyone to stand by you who is about to die suddenly. If someone beside you dies suddenly, you may feel that your situation is excusable. But there is no excuse for being defiled by death, and the sudden death of someone will cause your Nazarite vow to be made void. Especially when rumors and gossip are spreading, it is better not to stand by anyone. A person may suddenly die in front of you by uttering all kinds of death. Once you have been contaminated by death, you need to deal with that contamination and have a new start. Otherwise, you will be killed, and eventually the entire church, seemingly without explanation, will be brought into a deadened situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="DxVzNnfEqnwJJe7GyfHvZNART-SbfwglxmBI07FipOB6QgwVm01HCCfjmiwJXMqx5"> As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40605" data-verses="Numbers 5:1">Numbers 5</span> indicates, in order to be a Nazarite, one must pass through many dealings and severe tests. Furthermore, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40606" data-verses="Numbers 6:1-12">6:1-12</span>, a Nazarite must overcome natural affection, worldly pleasure, rebellion, and deadness. Therefore, to be a Nazarite is to be something that is spiritually very high and superior. </p>
<p data-content-id="Se-6za1KSJE4D3ovoN73w269lCHOfZxM7ef9Yu5iYbmakYgNBSFmwp3_76eSfWWkE"> Let us now consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40607" data-verses="Numbers 6:13-21">6:13-21</span> to see some further matters related to being a Nazarite. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="gVK3NAkEMwsZE8Q-ot7YFL-dIilfbM5Uya85eCH9oZZY7jOOGPbB82gui7YdXn6-O">F. At the Completion<br/>of the Nazarite’s Days of Separation,<br/>the Nazarite Being Brought<br/>to the Entrance of the Tent of Meeting,<br/>and the Nazarite Bringing His Offerings to God</h2><p data-content-id="ezw1IvP5hJlLyGzJuXCMyfyQo6QUre2non4KkPYaTfhE1FqPcM2yCoPnLNpUj9vS2"> “This is the law for the Nazarite, when the days of his <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> separation have been completed: he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and he shall bring his offering to Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40608" data-verses="Numbers 6:13-14">vv. 13-14a</span>). In ancient times, the Nazarite’s separation lasted for seven days. In the Bible seven days indicate a full course, even a whole lifetime. For example, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40609" data-verses="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1</span> we have seven days—six days for God’s work in creation and one day for rest. Furthermore, the Passover was followed by the feast of unleavened bread, a feast that lasted seven days. The seven days of this feast signify the whole course of our Christian life. </p>
<p data-content-id="56Tr4kCk5lYCc-MpfN0clfWVpYUNGnXmAb1tHSRy7tzGpsD_p3ykJtYvDxOHS7R3k"> At the completion of the Nazarite’s seven days of separation, he was to be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and he was to bring his offerings to God. Each of these offerings was a type of Christ. The enjoyment of Christ as these offerings indicates the overcoming of natural affection, earthly pleasure, rebellion, and death. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37CiQwbXUl8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e">1. One Male Lamb a Year Old<br/>without Blemish for a Burnt Offering</h2><p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5FnmjgkYtb34tAQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> The Nazarite was to bring “one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40610" data-verses="Numbers 6:14">v. 14b</span>). Here “male” signifies strong, “lamb” signifies meek, “a year old” signifies fresh, and “without blemish” signifies without defects. This lamb for a burnt offering typifies Christ as our burnt offering that we may be acceptable to God in Him and live to God by Him. For us to be in Christ means that we are one with Him. First we are in Him, and then we live to God by Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk3t7EskZhK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D"> When we offer such an offering, we lay our hands on the offering to indicate that we identify ourselves with the offering, making ourselves one with the offering. Therefore, our offering is not merely Christ Himself but also ourselves identified with Christ. Apart from Christ, we cannot offer anything that can be accepted by God. In order for God to accept us, we must be offered to God with Christ in such a way that we make ourselves one with Christ as the burnt offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="UdegCvQnXR5xgUhUaUGVeA_jlfq-Cu7dqw2JPQOIsoKn_Y8dqhxtHLn_1Zya9Y6Px"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40611" data-verses="Numbers 6:1">Numbers 6</span> the completion of the Nazarite’s days of separation signify not an ending but a beginning. This beginning is the beginning of a life of the burnt offering, a life <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> absolutely, utterly, and ultimately for God. This means that when we offer the burnt offering to God, laying our hands on the offering and making ourselves one with the offering, we promise God that from that time we will be just like this offering, living a life absolutely for God in the seven days of the vow of the Nazarite. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="MNYPxEBRKCjGvjYcSm_-w7W61mjZBONkc_BXexp5aMeJNuq4a-EbRUgKX-x3mauLs">2.

Here “ewe” signifies submissive. This ewe lamb typifies Christ as our sin offering that we may be redeemed. </p>

These verses cover the matter of being blessed by God in His divine trinity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GH2P9Y3tWVo3vwOnM-tmDA3hWWLUq0bMbEZhDa4imkkh08ueAdWa3Wq1nnlLdF8Wv">VIII. BEING BLESSED BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="c66RxjgPYhMLBezgrzhPw-n3pbxZ-jMxsmz68qF6tmK_P8z65dz6eCIYn-7KqSz3Q"> This section on being blessed comes after the dealing with defilement, the test of suspicion, and the vow of the Nazarite. These three things are actually three steps. First, we must deal with anything that is defiling. Then we need to undergo the test related to suspicion. Following this, we should consecrate ourselves to the Lord by taking the vow of the Nazarite. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHlejKwe4zJM9asMqbsyUu6pmuq_w97ON3jvWMY9Q5agu8XBAHpB57Htd9BbOWaqj"> If we spend time to consider these three steps, we will realize that to serve the Lord and to fight for His kingdom are not shallow, small, or light matters. On the contrary, these matters are very deep, high, and profound. We must be up to the level of a Nazarite, one who overcomes natural affection, earthly pleasure, rebellion, and unexpected death. If we overcome these four things and stay away from them, we will be in a position to receive God Himself as our blessing. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="pitQJ6wzw9SLef7XU0zprswX_x8z_ho3XM7OLfBcppeT-qU_lUsjRuGVn988HowAD">A.

Jehovah is the Triune God. As the Triune God, He dispenses Himself into us in His divinity and in His divine trinity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="78" id="78">[78]</span> Without being triune, God could not dispense Himself into His chosen people as their blessing. The very blessing is God Himself dispensed into His chosen people. Although God desires to bless His chosen people in this way, they need to come up to a standard that matches His blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtQg4gkFxRAg6KQBybFiEbn_jYISmMyCMdudfZSiSkioM0_3Ome8OLQclMyg824a5"> The unique blessing in the whole universe is God Himself. Anything besides God is vanity. The entire universe was created by God, yet without God, apart from God, even the universe created by God is vanity. The existence of the universe is a great miracle, but without God the miraculous existence of the universe is vanity. Apart from God, everything is “vanity of vanities” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40623" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 1:2">Eccl. 1:2</span>). Only God Himself is real. Only He is the blessing to us. If we gained the entire universe yet missed God, we would be the most pitiful persons. History is filled with cases of people who gained many riches and many material things but who eventually realized that, without God, it was all vanity. God Himself is our blessing, and this blessing comes to us through the dispensing of the divine Being into us in His divine trinity—in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="2E0ak2tPM0Mfc5DVkAQ7Ydlv2fMY3fc09HxajrXJ90qanQxeb0N_D56Uhkk3_Uw5t"> The traditional and even the basic theology concerning God’s divine trinity does not have the view that the divine Trinity is for God to dispense Himself into us. This light has come to us only in the last thirty years. </p>
<p data-content-id="uVg-B0zfBhzFLu0-bfSRtnQd6AB4eF9Rnw_t3_6v1pD3tO9lSNhdpPMAef8L-UIGR"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40624" data-verses="Ephesians 1:1">Ephesians chapter one</span> gives us a record of how the Triune God blesses His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people in His divine trinity. This chapter is mainly on the three steps of God’s blessing us in His divine trinity, that is, on how He blesses us in the Father (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40625" data-verses="Ephesians 1:3-6">vv. 3-6</span>), in the Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40626" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7-12">vv. 7-12</span>), and in the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40627" data-verses="Ephesians 1:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>). Eventually, because of such a flow of the divine Trinity as the blessing to God’s chosen people, there is an issue, and the issue of this blessed flow is the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40628" data-verses="Ephesians 1:22-23">vv. 22-23</span>). The church as the Body of Christ is the total issue of the divine Trinity as a flow to dispense all that God is into His chosen people. The Body of Christ is the fullness, the totality, of the One who fills all in all. </p>
<p data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyKWI9W_0hC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS"> Like Numbers, Revelation, the last book of the Bible, is also a book of numbers. This is true in a particular way concerning <span class="pg" data-page-id="79" id="79">[79]</span> the description of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem has twelve gates with the names of the twelve tribes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40629" data-verses="Revelation 21:12">21:12</span>), and twelve foundations with the names of the twelve apostles (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40630" data-verses="Revelation 21:14">v. 14</span>). Furthermore, the tree of life bears twelve kinds of fruit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40631" data-verses="Revelation 22:2">22:2</span>). Among these twelves the Triune God is hidden, and even mingled, as His people’s blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="IflM7BbsLZ6u10ceoy3HZpNyef-Pm_DMYrFV0s5yiOLZE994aXHfO4p54nuE3Htm0"> The consummation of the record of the entire Bible is God the triune as the very particular and subjective blessing to His people. As the consummation of the entire record of the Bible, the New Jerusalem is just the very God in His divine trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—wrapped up in the number twelve with His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people as their blessing. This blessing will last eternally. Such a blessing is the ultimate fulfillment of God’s blessing to Israel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40632" data-verses="Numbers 6:1">Numbers 6</span>. Only when the New Jerusalem comes, will this blessing be completely fulfilled. </p>
<p data-content-id="HPFjB-1Auz0yuOHKiO7sWGhB6-HuErvnZ-3dB9TpN-DIjpt7vl1AN1EJ-KBTMrfRS"> In the blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40633" data-verses="Numbers 6:1">Numbers 6</span>, “Jehovah bless you and keep you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40634" data-verses="Numbers 6:24">v. 24</span>) is ascribed to the Father; “Jehovah make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40635" data-verses="Numbers 6:25">v. 25</span>) is ascribed to the Son; and “Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40636" data-verses="Numbers 6:26">v. 26</span>) is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. The Father blesses us, the Son shines upon us, and the Holy Spirit lifts up His countenance upon us. As a result, we are kept, we receive grace, and we have peace. </p>
<p data-content-id="XLLTDppJ60HGrEjQbd3j_QTU_VEvU58jcqP7x6v7IGu3acmlClR7B0TiVrBD0lZqc"> Most of the Epistles of Paul open with a word concerning grace and peace. Grace is of the Son and peace is of the Spirit. Grace is somewhat objective. Peace is subjective; it is the result, the issue, of our enjoyment of grace. First we receive grace and then we enjoy peace. We receive grace in the Son and we enjoy peace in the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1dF6aJscO4mjEVXwfZzpu-ldjNKXAM-f35W2Fgo9MGMHdxxaD2W6l_abXuvSctvM"> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40637" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40638" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). Of His fullness we have all received grace upon grace (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40639" data-verses="John 1:16">John 1:16</span>). Whereas the law was given through Moses, grace came through Jesus Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40640" data-verses="John 1:17">John 1:17</span>). This grace is actually a person, Christ Himself. When we receive grace, the result is that we have peace. This peace is the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit becoming the Spirit of peace within us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="80" id="80">[80]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="JURneMwwUjjCukjzuls466oaBuhXJw4OHc1FWynSIUK5iiWwT0Qsz8EketofHftLD"> The blessing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40641" data-verses="Numbers 6:1">Numbers 6</span> is neither an Old Testament blessing nor a New Testament blessing. Rather, it is the eternal blessing of the Triune God, which is the Triune God dispensing Himself in His divine trinity into us for our enjoyment. This is God’s eternal blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="zlDFwvjlbRNSVPZMsJoAMpI-0vIUl9T_qTJ0b8-Djp239rcyY1bn_iJnFc_BwAY5_"> “Jehovah bless you” means that Jehovah gives Himself to you. However, God does not give Himself to us merely in an objective way like one brother giving a gift to another. God gives Himself to us in His trinity, step by step and little by little. If you were to ask me what blessing I have received from the Lord, I would answer, “The only blessing I have received from the Lord is my Triune God. My Triune God is my blessing.” </p>

<p data-content-id="qGcKu1ZVR5xTox402-R1ep7vj_yO0c7yKDvJ8DBs_v_SpNT-ALQWUMIgMeeSUavPV"> The blessing One keeps us. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40646" data-verses="Numbers 6:24">Numbers 6:24</span> the word <em>keep</em> is of crucial importance. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40647" data-verses="John 17:11">John 17:11</span> the Lord Jesus prayed that the Father would keep us in His name. This is to keep us in the dispensing Triune God. While the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, we are kept in the dispensing One. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40648" data-verses="John 17:15">John 17:15</span> the Lord Jesus went on to pray that the Father would keep us from the evil one. When we are kept in the dispensing Triune God, there is nothing left for the hand of the enemy. We should pray for the blessing of being kept absolutely in the dispensing Triune God and altogether outside of the evil one. What a blessing this is! </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5FnmjgkYt739_QQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa">IX. OFFERINGS</h2><p data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk3tbEm35hK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D"> After the dealing with defilement, the testing of suspicion, the vow of the Nazarite, and the blessing of the Triune God, the situation between God and Israel came to a new stage. On the people’s side everything was ready. They had been formed into an army and were camping in array. On God’s side, the tabernacle had been built and set up, and it was standing on earth, declaring that the God of the heavens now had a dwelling place on earth, even in the wilderness. </p>
<p data-content-id="UdegCvQnXR5xgUhUaUGVeAfjuMa-Cu7dqw2JPQOIsoKn_Y8dqhxtHLn_1Zya9Y6Px"> From a bird’s-eye view, we can see two items: the tabernacle and the altar. The tabernacle signifies God’s embodiment on earth. This embodiment is God’s habitation, where He can dwell among men and through which man can not only contact Him but also enter into Him to participate in all that He is in His elements and attributes. These elements and attributes are signified by the showbread, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark. Man can enter into God. How wonderful! </p>
<p data-content-id="Se-6za1KSJE4D3ovoN73w2a9lAHOfZxM7ef9Yu5iYbmakYgNBSFmwp3_76eSfWWkE"> Before this time, God did not have a home on earth. As far as the earth was concerned, God was homeless. He had nowhere to go, to stay, or to settle down. Abraham was a close friend to Him and was very good to Him. God liked Abraham <span class="pg" data-page-id="86" id="86">[86]</span> very much as a close friend, but He could only come to visit him, to stay in His friend’s tent for a few hours and then leave. He had no place to settle and to rest. When the children of Israel went down into Egypt, they were usurped, occupied, by Pharaoh, who used them as slaves. God could do nothing. At that time He could be considered only the God in the heavens but not yet the God on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="gVK3NAkEMwsZE8Q-ot7YFLedIglfbM5Uya85eCH9oZZY7jOOGPbB82gui7YdXn6-O"> In the book of Numbers the situation is altogether different. Now, in the wilderness, among the approximately two million children of Israel, God could have a home, a habitation, and could become fully settled and rest. Also, His people had been formed into an army in good order to have a display in a beautiful array in order to declare something to God’s enemy. Furthermore, God’s chosen people had the right, through the altar (that is, redemption), through the shedding of the blood of the sacrifices, which pointed to Christ, not only to contact God but also to enter into Him. At this stage in the book of Numbers, God was no longer just in the heavens; He was the very God of the heavens and of the earth. Thus, God now has two residences—the heavens and the earth. The residence He prefers is His residence on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="ezw1IvP5hJlLyGzJuXCMyfSQr6wUre2non4KkPYaTfhE1FqPcM2yCoPnLNpUj9vS2"> The tabernacle with all its furnishings fully portrays and typifies the embodied Triune God, the processed Triune God. To be in the tabernacle is to be in the embodied and processed Triune God. Once we are in the tabernacle, we can take a tour within it and view all its contents. </p>
<p data-content-id="56Tr4kCk5lYCc-MpfN0clf2VqY0NGnXmAb1tHSRy7tzGpsD_p3ykJtYvDxOHS7R3k"> The Christian life is a touring life; it is a life of daily taking a tour in the tabernacle, the typified Triune God. This means that after entering into the tabernacle, we can have a tour to see God’s attributes and elements. As we are taking such a tour, we will see the showbread, the lampstand, and the incense altar, all of which typify Christ. God is life; the showbread table displays the bread of life. God is light; the lampstand shines upon us, and we are in the light. God accepts repentant and redeemed sinners, and the incense altar signifies God’s welcoming of us. </p>
<p data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37CiQQbUVF8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e"> Have you taken a tour in the tabernacle today? After you rose up this morning, did you call, “O Lord Jesus,” and enter into God’s dwelling place? In God’s dwelling place we see life, <span class="pg" data-page-id="87" id="87">[87]</span> light, the incense for acceptance, and the ark. After spending time at the altar to deal with our sins, we can enter into the tabernacle and make a tour, looking at the showbread table, the lampstand, and the incense altar. Then we can enter into the most holy place and muse upon the ark. We can even open the ark and see the law of the testimony, the budding rod, and the hidden manna. The Christian life is such a sightseeing life, a life of daily touring the tabernacle. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5FnmjgkYt737sgQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa">A. The Anointing of the Tabernacle<br/>with Its Furnishings<br/>and the Altar with Its Utensils</h2><p data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk3tbEvk5hK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40674" data-verses="Numbers 7:1">Numbers 7:1</span> speaks of “the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed and sanctified it, and all its furnishings and the altar with all its utensils.” This indicates that after the setting up of the tabernacle, Moses anointed the tabernacle with its furnishings and the altar with its utensils. </p>
<p data-content-id="UdegCvQnXR5xgUhUaUGVeAfjmfK-Cu7dqw2JPQOIsoKn_Y8dqhxtHLn_1Zya9Y6Px"> We need to know the spiritual significance of the anointing. The ointment with which the anointing is accomplished may be likened to paint, and the anointing may be likened to painting. The ointment, which is a compound of different elements, typifies the compound, all-inclusive Spirit. This compound Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God. As the consummation of the processed Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit includes Christ’s divine nature, human nature, incarnation, human living, all-inclusive death, wonderful resurrection, and exalting ascension. The ointment, therefore, typifies the Triune God with all that He has passed through. (See <em>Life-study of Exodus,</em> Messages One Hundred Fifty-seven through One Hundred Sixty-six.) To anoint is to put this ointment upon the anointed object. This can be illustrated by painting. To paint an object is to apply paint to the object. Eventually, layer upon layer of paint may be applied to that object. Likewise, to anoint is to apply the processed, consummated Triune God with His divine nature, human nature, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension, as a whole, to the object of the anointing. </p>
<p data-content-id="MNYPxEBRKCjGvjYcSm_-w7262lDZBONkc_BXexp5aMeJNuq4a-EbRUgKX-x3mauLs"> Without the anointing, the tabernacle and the altar had <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> nothing to do with God. Thus, the ointment, a symbol of the compounded and consummated processed Triune God with all His elements and processes, as a whole, had to be put upon the tabernacle and the altar. From that time onward, the tabernacle and the altar were absolutely one with the compounded, consummated Triune God. We today have also been anointed. This means that we are identified with the processed Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="VBaATaFwkk1R2p-lJIa9f-IuZmOY975Xa5FmEubBdBBuFAyJhWAJhBvAZCseteqbq"> After the tabernacle and the altar were anointed, they became most holy, and whoever touched them was sanctified, made holy. Furthermore, by being anointed, by being identified with the processed Triune God, the tabernacle and the altar were dedicated. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="i-M7ojiJqGoJd-LWYW0HyOtKQKoEy22u_R9o2QysidURajdNowaOAucBwqV_zFWnD">B. The Offering of Six Wagons<br/>and Twelve Oxen</h2><p data-content-id="1q83V7kEkTSAS8FhlVDslwTbKRU3QFqsrqbsu0A6Y9sDz6OYDLPkVWCpO4FO6tj8_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40675" data-verses="Numbers 7:2-9">Numbers 7:2-9</span> speaks of the offering of six wagons and twelve oxen. This offering was for the transporting of the tabernacle (not including its furnishings) and the altar, and it was to match God’s move in His dwelling place on the earth. The six wagons and the twelve oxen were offered by the people who had dealt with defilement and had been sanctified to receive the blessing of God in His divine trinity. </p>
<p data-content-id="9E0RwvkihCfbWu-ZTtqaeOyugDYN7t73TIeHLchn3Izflx0InPBI1FJa49wKFpuwV"> God, according to His eternal economy, will not do anything by Himself. He did something by Himself only in producing the old creation. But in the new creation He will not do anything by Himself and He will not move by Himself. He must move and work through man. </p>
<p data-content-id="jgnwUAKnb3LF-rKF2so0ue6i1hvYdu4JVjXaJif78hdaEK0IAPD6KUO8RgekuaJZh"> In Numbers the omnipotent God moved in a portable home in wagons drawn by oxen. We may find it very surprising that God moved in such a way. At the end of the Bible the Lord said, “I come quickly” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40676" data-verses="Revelation 22:20">Rev. 22:20</span>). Why has the Lord not come yet? It seems that He is coming very slowly. Actually, it is not the One in the wagon who is slow; the oxen are slow. This indicates that the transportation we offer Him is slow. If we could offer God a faster means of transportation, such as a 747, surely He would take it. My point here is that, according to God’s New Testament economy, God will not move, act, or do anything by Himself. He needs man’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> cooperation, even man’s coordination. He needs us, and we need to offer ourselves to Him. </p>

In offering these for the service of God, they cooperated with God in His services by offering the silver and gold vessels with the incense, signifying Christ in His redemption and His divine nature as a fragrant satisfaction to God. </p>

And Aaron did so; he lit its lamps in front of the lampstand, as Jehovah commanded Moses.” Here we see that the seven lamps, which signify the seven Spirits (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40691" data-verses="Revelation 4:5">Rev. 4:5</span>), gave light in front of the lampstand, shining toward the middle, or the <span class="pg" data-page-id="94" id="94">[94]</span> central part, of the tabernacle. Thus, the shining of the lamps was in the right direction for serving and moving. </p>
<p data-content-id="zlDFwvjlbRNSVPZMsJoAMpo-3voUl9T_qTJ0b8-Djp239rcyY1bn_iJnFc_BwAY5_"> Within the tabernacle there was no light from the sun, moon, or stars. Apart from the shining of the lampstand, the entire tabernacle would have been in darkness. </p>

The workmanship of the lampstand portrays the constituting of Christ as the light-holder. One piece of gold was hammered into the form of a lampstand according to the pattern that God had shown Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40693" data-verses="Exodus 25:31-40">Exo. 25:31-40</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40694" data-verses="Exodus 37:17-24">37:17-24</span>). Gold signifies Christ’s divine nature, and the beating of the gold signifies Christ’s sufferings in His humanity, through which He was constituted as the divine light-holder to shine in God’s dwelling place so that God’s serving ones could serve there. (For further details concerning the lampstand, see <em>Life-study of Exodus,</em> Messages Ninety-two through Ninety-four.) </p>

Actually, the Levitical work should be one with the priesthood. Because of the Old Testament arrangement, God divided these into two sections. The priesthood was a divine service rendered directly to God, and the Levites served the priesthood. Things such as caring for the animals and carrying the furnishings of the tabernacle were Levitical works. </p>

This indicates that they should live for God.

<p data-content-id="c66RxjgPYhMLBezgrzhPw-H3iIRZ-jMxsmz68qF6tmK_P8z65dz6eCIYn-7KqSz3Q"> Actually, the services of the tabernacle should have been taken care of by the sons of Israel, yet God chose the Levites to replace the sons of Israel.

But without being anointed, the tabernacle and the altar were still separate from God Himself, having nothing to do with God’s life, God’s nature, or anything God had accomplished, obtained, and attained. </p>
<p data-content-id="1q83V7kEkTSAS8FhlVDslxzbJR03QFqsrqbsu0A6Y9sDz6OYDLPkVWCpO4FO6tj8_"> For us to be anointed means that the processed Triune God is put into us and upon us, even mingled with us. We may use the painting of a wooden article as an illustration. After several coats of paint have been applied to the article, it becomes fully one with the paint. The article may be wooden, but after it is painted, we no longer see the wood; instead, we see the nature, the essence, the element, the character, the appearance, the color, and the expression of the paint, for the paint has been applied to the wooden article and has become one with it.

In eternity past God was altogether perfect, but He was not completed. He had the divine nature but not the human nature. However, according to His intention, in the coming eternity He, the very God, will be a God not only with the divine nature but also with the human nature. Because in eternity past, God was not completed, He needed to come into time, a bridge between the two eternities, to pass through many processes in order to be completed. </p>

Approximately two years ago, a certain denominational journal recognized that this one who came to Abraham was Jesus. God came and spoke to Abraham like a friend. Abraham served the Lord a meal, and He ate it. The very God ate the food served to Him by Abraham. Also, Abraham brought Him water, and He washed His feet. When the Lord was leaving, He did not leave quickly. Accompanying Him, Abraham walked with Him and saw Him off. Abraham did not pray to this man but talked to Him as a friend. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40727" data-verses="Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18</span>, God appeared to Abraham in <span class="pg" data-page-id="103" id="103">[103]</span> the form of a man long before He became incarnated.

In eternity past He was God, but He was not a God-man. Therefore, in time He has gone through many processes in order to be consummated and completed. </p>

We may say that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40738" data-verses="Exodus 30:1">Exodus 30</span> we have the “cream,” the ointment, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40739" data-verses="1John 2:1">1 John 2</span> we have the moving of the cream, the anointing. We have this anointing, the moving of the ointment, within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="sagbDhA7pAxvKgcwYTawQ6bsJhcCNiozwYjsNXQN0-DGbiFNnmUF8HY7mxgZVUtzf"> The ointment is not a thing but a person—the completed <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> God. The ointment within us is the processed, compounded, consummated Triune God, the God who has passed through the necessary processes in order to be completed. This is the greatest provision God has prepared for His redeemed people. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wFQBjuNz7_AjSqmWfTe5OdDYvAmcO8mU81RI6yzs2rp89GNZ-ynPkrIKOR1S7BkLj">The Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="L9HftOmYqjmYA0hV0PtiUVfLCCil6jSE9MY_rfUhPEuKy3ijGqB94J8MCZIyjUWvw"> In the Bible, the last title given to the Spirit of God is “the Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40740" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Rev. 22:17</span>). The completed God is the Spirit. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40741" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39b</span> says, “The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” When Jesus was glorified, that is, when He entered into resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40742" data-verses="Luke 24:26">Luke 24:26</span>), the Triune God was consummated and completed to become the Spirit. The Spirit, therefore, is the processed, consummated, and completed Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="mHOnKBa-6rL99a2gC8scc1qtkN_YvfOyk6W1gSJKbbJlzuiLfBLqPv4sI-uBw0zXm"> Let us consider what the Spirit comprises. Within the Spirit is divinity, the divine nature. The Spirit also includes humanity, the human nature. This means that the Spirit includes the element of incarnation. How great a thing was the incarnation! God was conceived within a virgin’s womb and stayed there for nine months. The divine conception was part of a marvelous process. This conception was followed by the Lord’s birth and human living. For thirty years the Lord Jesus lived in the home of a carpenter. Then He came forth to minister for three and one-half years, passing through all kinds of sufferings. In His crucifixion He accomplished an all-inclusive death. Then He walked through death, came forth from death, and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40743" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>), and this life-giving Spirit is now the Spirit—the consummation of the processed Triune God. Now He is ready to be applied to us as the ointment. He is the Triune God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit. Within Him are God, man, redemption, the impartation of life, and the power of resurrection. What a wonderful divine provision! Our God is now anointing us with this provision. He is anointing us with the compounded Spirit, the consummation and completion of the processed Triune God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="105" id="105">[105]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjo9b_sbrL-1x6xy-0gyTOvIXrcZurBOk8dWCpfBgyBR0D6E30f90C4kCu_Hzx6Aq"> I can testify that when I am preparing myself to speak for the Lord, I usually pray, “Lord, fill me with Yourself as the essential Spirit and pour Yourself upon me as the economical Spirit. O Lord, in my speaking be one spirit with me so that You speak in my speaking.” Whenever I pray like this, I am strengthened, confirmed, infused, and filled inwardly and outwardly with the consummated Triune God. </p>

While in the second month Moses was busily recording all the divine provisions, God charged him to write something about what was to take place in the first month. These verses record what the Lord spoke to Moses “in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40752" data-verses="Numbers 9:1">9:1</span>).

The fact that the Passover was to be kept according to all its ordinances and judgments indicates that the keeping of the Passover leaves no opening for man’s ideas and opinions. </p>

In the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40757" data-verses="Numbers 9:10-11">vv. 10-11a</span>). </p>

Here we see that the children of Israel were to eat the Passover with unleavened bread. Unleavened bread signifies the Christ who is without sin. Whenever we receive Christ as our life supply, we receive a life that is without sin. Thus, to eat the Passover with unleavened bread means to eliminate all sinful things. When we enjoy Christ as our Passover, we must purge away everything sinful. </p>
<p data-content-id="d38X8EOiMEk9dP_79EmblzyR672Qg--9-XB3OqGiYKF1sxI6uIKUnB4ChkhxSbG8O"> The Passover was also to be eaten with bitter herbs. The bitter herbs signify regret and repentance with a bitter sense regarding sins.

This indicates that we should enjoy the Passover in its freshness. This also indicates that we are to receive Christ in a full way, not partially. Instead of allowing anything of Christ to be left over, we should take Him in full. </p>
<p data-content-id="KczBxhEn9SA44FFZSVMXteoJhB6h8ghOy5WWYqtP7LFq_5eOHT5zjQ8Bhcb9oDTxH"> Furthermore, the people were not permitted to break a bone of the Passover lamb. The unbroken bone indicates that Christ’s divine life is unbreakable. When the Lord Jesus was crucified as our Passover lamb, His legs were not broken (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40759" data-verses="John 19:33">John 19:33</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40760" data-verses="John 19:36">36</span>). This signifies that in Christ, the Passover lamb, there is something unbreakable and indestructible. This unbreakable and indestructible element is His eternal life. In Christ as our Passover lamb there is the divine life, the eternal life, the unbreakable and indestructible life, that can impart life into us. </p>

However, in this portion of Numbers, the word concerning the unclean ones and the ones on a journey still partaking of the Passover was to be applied on the fourteenth day of the second month (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40767" data-verses="Numbers 9:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>). Hence, the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40768" data-verses="Numbers 9:1-14">9:1-14</span> is here referred to in the second month. This shows the importance of keeping the Passover in relation to the move of God’s redeemed people with God in His activity. </p>
<p data-content-id="c66RxjgPYhMLBezgrzhPw_n3jIxZ-jMxsmz68qF6tmK_P8z65dz6eCIYn-7KqSz3Q"> We should not think that partaking of the Lord’s table has nothing to do with God’s move or with our move with God in His activity. The Lord’s table has much to do with God’s move on earth. Therefore, we must keep the Lord’s table. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHlejKwe4zJM9asMqbsyUv6pt96_w97ON3jvWMY9Q5agu8XBAHpB57Htd9BbOWaqj"> The Passover includes a number of crucial points. The Passover signifies a new start, because it takes place in the first month of the year. Therefore, the Passover should remind us that we need a new start. </p>
<p data-content-id="ERNBZk2fVc6bxOiCk-X4P4cn6penRx3McXQ0hmXB6AJkXe9nyhLoNBrjCzDoOcA-M"> The Passover reminds us that we are a people who should have died under God’s righteous judgment. But for us who should die under His righteous judgment, God prepared a replacement, Christ, who died a vicarious death for us, thus saving us from the death-judgment of God’s righteousness. </p>
<p data-content-id="DxVzNnfEqnwJJe7GyfHvZMQRQ9ybfwglxmBI07FipOB6QgwVm01HCCfjmiwJXMqx5"> The Passover also reminds us that we belong not to ourselves but to the One who died for us. Now we should enjoy Him for our entire life. We have been replaced by Christ, we belong to Him, and we should enjoy Him by taking Him as our life, our life supply, and our everything. </p>
<p data-content-id="Se-6za1KSJE4D3ovoN73w3q9nAHOfZxM7ef9Yu5iYbmakYgNBSFmwp3_76eSfWWkE"> The Passover in the Old Testament was a yearly reminder to the children of Israel. Today we, the believers in Christ, have a weekly reminder, the Lord’s table. Every week, on the first day of the week, we should have the remembrance of the Lord at His table, enjoying all that He is to us. However, some may come to the Lord’s table without knowing what they are doing. Whenever we come to the Lord’s table we should be reminded that we need a new start, a new beginning on the eighth day, which is the first day of the week and a day in resurrection. We also need to be reminded that we were destined to die under God’s righteous judgment, but God prepared Christ to be our replacement to die for us. Therefore, we have been saved from the death-judgment. Furthermore, at the <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> Lord’s table we should be reminded that we do not belong to ourselves but to the One who replaced us and who is now our life and life supply. Since Christ is our life and life supply, we should live by Him. This is the significance of the Passover and also of the Lord’s table. </p>
<p data-content-id="gVK3NAkEMwsZE8Q-ot7YFKudKglfbM5Uya85eCH9oZZY7jOOGPbB82gui7YdXn6-O"> Both the Passover and the Lord’s table are feasts. Whenever we participate in the Passover or in the Lord’s table, we partake of a feast to enjoy Christ in the presence of God. This enjoyment is a mutual satisfaction to God and us. </p>

Godless people, those who are without God and the Lord, do not have a guide. The worldly people are very busy, but they are without a guide.

When God came to be our Redeemer, He came in type as a lamb. The Lord Jesus is the Lamb of God to take away our sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40773" data-verses="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). But when God came to be our guidance, He came as the cloud. This guidance in the form of a cloud is God consummated to be the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="R2qYnpqtRGomTlcXmAAHwOU8F19Q7C-wTRkJI_Sw9RV5N2W8gemugfOv9FQXr9QVG"> A cloud has much to do with the earth, yet it belongs not to the earth but to the heavens. A cloud is closely related to rain and is nearly the same as rain. Often a cloud will actually <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> become rain. When rain comes, something from the heavens reaches the earth, benefitting the people on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="sagbDhA7pAxvKgcwYTawQ67sKh8CNiozwYjsNXQN0-DGbiFNnmUF8HY7mxgZVUtzf"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40774" data-verses="Zechariah 12:1">Zechariah 12:1</span> says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. We may say that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man, with his spirit, is for God. In what way are the heavens for the earth? When the heavens rain, this rain is for the earth. The earth receives the rain from the heavens. The earth is for man because the earth by the rain produces all kinds of food and foodstuff. Man should live by his spirit for God. This is a simple picture of the scenery concerning man on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="wFQBjuNz7_AjSqmWfTe5OdjYsAGcO8mU81RI6yzs2rp89GNZ-ynPkrIKOR1S7BkLj"> The history of human civilization shows that man has usually “followed the cloud” and settled where there is water. Primarily, man lives not in dry places but near the rivers, the seas, and the oceans. Hence, man must follow the cloud. If people do not want to wither and die of thirst, they must go where there is water. </p>
<p data-content-id="L9HftOmYqjmYA0hV0PtiUV_LBDCl6jSE9MY_rfUhPEuKy3ijGqB94J8MCZIyjUWvw"> In typology the cloud from the heavens signifies God in the sense of God’s presence. When the cloud was in a certain place with God’s people, God’s actual presence was with His people. When they saw the cloud, they knew that God was present with them. When the cloud, God’s presence, remained, the children of Israel stayed where they were. But when the cloud moved, that was a sign that God was ready to move and that the people should also get ready to move. Thus, when the cloud set out, Israel moved, and when the cloud stopped, Israel stopped. From this we see that the guidance was God Himself in the form of a cloud. </p>
<p data-content-id="mHOnKBa-6rL99a2gC8scc1KtnMfYvfOyk6W1gSJKbbJlzuiLfBLqPv4sI-uBw0zXm"> Now we need to consider how to apply the matter of God’s guidance by the cloud to our experience today. Christians should always follow the Spirit. However, whereas the cloud in the Old Testament was visible, the Spirit is altogether invisible. Also, the cloud was somewhat concrete, but the Spirit is altogether abstract. The children of Israel could see the cloud, but we cannot see the Spirit. How, then, can we know that God is with us? What is the sign of God’s presence? Concerning these questions, we need to learn a lesson from our forefathers—go where there is water. <span class="pg" data-page-id="117" id="117">[117]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjo9b_sbrL-1x6xy-0gyTOPIUr8ZurBOk8dWCpfBgyBR0D6E30f90C4kCu_Hzx6Aq"> Water comes from rain, and rain is from the cloud. In a sense, rain is another form of the cloud. The cloud and the rain are the same in substance. In essence the cloud and the rain are the same. The cloud becomes rain, and when the rain comes, we have water. Therefore, we may say that the cloud, the rain, and the water are three-in-one. </p>
<p data-content-id="AQYzzKQWYTkaFQeLtwXyD9zly_uydiCBfKdc5vmfXuwsxv0xS9OBpDz-8zAqA_-Qz"> Today we cannot see the Spirit, but we can see what issues from the Spirit. This issue is the sense within us that we are being watered. However, often as we move we have the sense deep within that we are dry. When we are dry, we should not move, but neither should we stay. This dryness is a strong sign that we are wrong with God, either in our position or in other matters. Hence, we need to pray, not in a general way but by confessing. Often we do not know in what we are wrong. Since our dryness is a sign that we are wrong and since we may not know in what we are wrong and therefore do not know what to confess, we need to grope. In our groping, we may confess from different angles concerning our mistakes, shortcomings, wrongdoings, defects, and even fleshly activities and lustful desires. We may need to confess from many different directions. We need to confess by groping until our feeling in our prayer reaches something, and the cloud is there. Then we know the Lord’s leading. </p>
<p data-content-id="FRSfve2gXKF2q5U8QMttXeYQTvgk8O0qwdoGc_QmQ-eQ8kJW69ciA8zsBiJhZIN53"> The presence of the Spirit today is altogether invisible and abstract, and it has absolutely something to do with our situation before God, especially in our spirit. When our spirit is wrong, we need to go to God to adjust our spirit. We may not be able to adjust our spirit in a morning watch of only ten minutes. It may take more than half an hour for us to adjust our spirit in full. If we are wrong in something and if the Lord has the purpose of teaching us to know His way, He may not be quick to show us in what we are wrong. Rather, He may leave us in a puzzled state for quite a while, even for several days. During this time, we may pray in a groping way seemingly without getting anywhere. Because the Lord has a deep lesson for us to learn, He will train us during these puzzling days of groping. Then one day we will reach the point where the Lord wants us to be. There we either touch the rain or see the cloud. It is in this way that we learn. <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="Cmeet7LFEwA83Buuyy4WkoQGfgbqBpX55w_jk3kONkrrJH7N7b1Pyn3Qqcfwcq2SE"> We need to keep in mind that God’s guidance is actually God Himself in His presence with us. In ancient times, God’s guidance was in the form of a cloud. Today we do not have the cloud; we have the Spirit within us. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="PuIIleEPVSVfD8jhkWufgV1W2mN57_EJYxmruVj7g1UOrXT8awLuynKwbredYSK3_">1. The Cloud Covering<br/>the Tabernacle of the Testimony</h2><p data-content-id="-ygMnNXQK98Bslpy7nKLKnhVom4MEgYLj3HQenBBRZnxyBXU7VW1OzWf6pxTP6q5S"> “On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of testimony” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40775" data-verses="Numbers 9:15">Num. 9:15a</span>). Here we see that on the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud (the Spirit) covered (overshadowed) the tabernacle of the testimony. This overshadowing in the vast and terrible wilderness was a great salvation. Furthermore, I believe that the cloud overshadowed not only the tabernacle but the entire camp of the children of Israel. In the wilderness there was an array, and above that array was an overshadowing cloud. This overshadowing cloud was an indication, a testimony, that there was something on earth for God. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="pitQJ6wzw9SLef7XU0zprtAX8xcz_ho3XM7OLfBcppeT-qU_lUsjRuGVn988HowAD">2. At Evening and at Night<br/>the Cloud Bearing the Appearance of Fire</h2><p data-content-id="vAsrJ2nXSZSYEVPzp03QpPlU39zW9-L_Lgvah9JawmYMePT4WRb2Med_Jz2YQdYJK"> “At evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning. So it was continually; the cloud covered it, and at night it had the appearance of fire” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40776" data-verses="Numbers 9:15-16">vv. 15b-16</span>). In typology, the cloud signifies the Spirit, and the fire, for enlightening, signifies the Word. When we have a clear sky in our spiritual life, we feel the presence of the Spirit. Quite often, however, we are in the night, and then the Spirit becomes the Word to us. This is a strong proof that the Spirit is the Word (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40777" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17-18">Eph. 6:17-18</span>). The over-shadowing element becomes the shining essence. Today we have both the Holy Spirit as the cloud and the holy Word as the fire. The Holy Spirit as the cloud overshadows, and the holy Word as the fire shines. </p>

Where the cloud settled down, they <span class="pg" data-page-id="119" id="119">[119]</span> encamped. When the cloud abode over the tabernacle, they remained encamped (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40778" data-verses="Numbers 9:17-22">Num. 9:17-22</span>). Because the children of Israel followed the cloud, they did not need to worry or be anxious about when to move. Instead of being anxious, they could be at peace. </p>

On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40792" data-verses="Numbers 10:11">v. 11a</span>), the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony, and the sons of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40793" data-verses="Numbers 10:11-12">vv. 11b-12a</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40794" data-verses="Numbers 10:12">Verse 12b</span> tells us that the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran. This was their setting out the first time at the word of Jehovah by Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40795" data-verses="Numbers 10:13">v. 13</span>). </p>

In this sequence, the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah took the lead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40797" data-verses="Numbers 10:14-16">vv. 14-16</span>), setting out first by their armies. They were followed, not by another camp, but by the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, the Levites who carried the tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40798" data-verses="Numbers 10:17">v. 17</span>). They were followed, in turn, by the second camp, the camp of Reuben (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40799" data-verses="Numbers 10:18-20">vv. 18-20</span>). The <span class="pg" data-page-id="124" id="124">[124]</span> Kohathites, the Levites who carried the sanctuary, set out next, and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40800" data-verses="Numbers 10:21">v. 21</span>). The camp of the sons of Ephraim set out third (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40801" data-verses="Numbers 10:22-24">vv. 22-24</span>), and the camp of the sons of Dan, taking up the rear of all the camps, set out last. </p>

The father-in-law refused (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40804" data-verses="Numbers 10:30">v. 30</span>). Then Moses besought him to go with them in order that he might be their eyes, for they were to encamp in the wilderness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40805" data-verses="Numbers 10:31-32">vv. 31-32</span>). Moses thought that his father-in-law would be a great help, but God’s sovereignty would not allow any man to come in. Thus, Moses and the children of Israel had to put their trust in the Lord. This account of Moses’ trusting in man is inserted here to compare man’s leading with the leading of the ark in the subsequent verses. </p>

Today, the leading One among the churches is the crucified and resurrected Christ, who is the ark. </p>

The Sons of Israel Setting Out<br/>from the Mount of Jehovah Three Days’ Journey,<br/>and the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah<br/>Going before Them to Seek Out<br/>a Resting Place for Them</h2><p data-content-id="c66RxjgPYhMLBezgrzhPw_H3gLRZ-jMxsmz68qF6tmK_P8z65dz6eCIYn-7KqSz3Q"> “They set out from the mount of Jehovah three days’ journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40808" data-verses="Numbers 10:33">v. 33</span>). Here we see that the sons of Israel went three days’ journey. The way was not paved, the oxen were slow, and travel for the wagons was difficult. However, the ark (Christ) <span class="pg" data-page-id="125" id="125">[125]</span> of the covenant of Jehovah went before them to seek out a resting place. The ark, with all the contents of the tabernacle, including the altar, showbread table, lampstand, and incense altar, was the responsibility of the Kohathites and was borne by them. The Kohathites should have set out after the camp of Reuben; nevertheless, the ark came to the front to take the lead. </p>
<p data-content-id="YHlejKwe4zJM9asMqbsyUvapu-a_w97ON3jvWMY9Q5agu8XBAHpB57Htd9BbOWaqj"> There is a difference between guidance and leading. The term <em>guidance</em> is used with respect to the cloud and the blowing of the trumpets, but concerning the ark we have used the term <em>leading.</em> Guidance is general; leading is particular. The cloud and the trumpet guided the children of Israel in a general way. However, the ark did not render a general guidance but a particular leading to the people. Thus, the ark became the leader, taking the lead to find a resting place. </p>
<p data-content-id="ERNBZk2fVc6bxOiCk-X4P48n6renRx3McXQ0hmXB6AJkXe9nyhLoNBrjCzDoOcA-M"> During the forty years the children of Israel traveled in the wilderness, it was difficult to find a resting place for two million people. Today our Christian life is a long journey on a rugged, unpaved way. As we are journeying on this rugged way, it is not easy for us to rest. The Lord Jesus, the Forerunner, has cut the way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40809" data-verses="Hebrews 6:20">Heb. 6:20</span>), but He did not pave the way. He passed through the rugged way, and now we are following His footsteps on this way. We have need of a resting place. Here no one, not even the older and more experienced ones, can help us. Concerning this, we should not put our trust in man. The unique One in whom we can trust is Christ as the ark. He is the Leader, and He leads us to the proper place of rest. He not only guides us in a general way but leads us in a particular way. </p>
<p data-content-id="DxVzNnfEqnwJJe7GyfHvZMwRQ_ybfwglxmBI07FipOB6QgwVm01HCCfjmiwJXMqx5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40810" data-verses="Numbers 10:1">Numbers 10</span> the real leader was not Moses. At that time, even Moses was inadequate. The ark led the children of Israel in a particular way, much like a small boat leads a large ship through a narrow strait and a swift current into the harbor. </p>
<p data-content-id="Se-6za1KSJE4D3ovoN73w3K9mAnOfZxM7ef9Yu5iYbmakYgNBSFmwp3_76eSfWWkE"> Not only was the ark a living ark, but the rock that followed the Israelites was also living (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40811" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">Exo. 17:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40812" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Cor. 10:4</span>). In the wilderness Christ followed the children of Israel as a rock to supply them with living water. As the ark, He was their Leader, taking the lead to find a resting place <span class="pg" data-page-id="126" id="126">[126]</span> for them and to lead them through the hard part of their journey. </p>
<p data-content-id="gVK3NAkEMwsZE8Q-ot7YFKOdLgFfbM5Uya85eCH9oZZY7jOOGPbB82gui7YdXn6-O"> The children of Israel were led not by man (Moses’ father-in-law) but by the ark (Christ) of God’s covenant. This indicates that the leadership of Christ is faithful. This leadership is not according to emotion or affection but according to a covenant. God made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants to bring them into the good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40813" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Gen. 12</span>). Eventually, God’s covenant was placed in the ark, and thus the ark was called the ark of the covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40814" data-verses="Numbers 10:33">Num. 10:33</span>). Hence, Christ is the Christ of the covenant, the Christ of God’s faithfulness. Christ must lead us into a resting place because He is the Christ of God’s covenant. </p>

The Word of Moses When the Ark Set Out</h2><p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5FnmjgkYsr34sAQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> When the ark set out, Moses said, “Arise, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate You flee before You” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40816" data-verses="Numbers 10:35">v. 35</span>). We are not the enemies of God or the haters of God; we are His army and His lovers. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40817" data-verses="Judges 5:31">Judges 5:31</span> says, “Let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.” Because we love God, we do not flee before Him; rather, we are as the sun going forth in its might. We may be small in number, but we are here as His army and as His lovers. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk3sLEsnZhK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D">4. The Word of Moses When the Ark Rested</h2><p data-content-id="UdegCvQnXR5xgUhUaUGVeBPjlcq-Cu7dqw2JPQOIsoKn_Y8dqhxtHLn_1Zya9Y6Px"> When the ark rested, Moses said, “Return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of thousands of Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40818" data-verses="Numbers 10:36">Num. 10:36</span>). What does this mean? In studying this verse, we need to realize that sometimes the Old Testament prophets did not know the full meaning of what they were saying. We may apply this principle to Moses’ speaking here. It is not likely that, when he uttered this word, Moses was clear that the ark was a type of <span class="pg" data-page-id="127" id="127">[127]</span> the incarnated Jehovah. Today we realize that the ark and Jehovah cannot be separated. Moses, however, might have felt that Jehovah was separate from the ark. Thus, when the ark rested, he said, “Return, O Jehovah.” This is a logical application of this word spoken by Moses. But there should also be a greater meaning to Moses’ word. In order to understand such a word, we need the whole Bible, because sometimes the speaking of the prophets was fulfilled much later. </p>

Here <em>evil</em> refers not only to evil words but also to evil things. The evil words spoken by the people were based on evil things. These <span class="pg" data-page-id="130" id="130">[130]</span> evil words went into the ears of Jehovah. This murmuring kindled the anger of Jehovah, and He sent fire to consume some at the extremities of the camp.

The mixed multitude consisted of those without a definite family, those who did not know of whom they were born or to what family they belonged.

This indicates that as food Christ is full of life. This food is a seed. When we eat Christ, He comes into us as a seed. Compared to corn or wheat, the coriander seed is tiny. Although this seed is very small, it is full of life, and it brings the life element into our being. As such a seed, Christ grows within us. </p>

This indicates that manna was bright in appearance. Bdellium has been interpreted to signify two different substances, both a white transparent gum and a white pearl. The pearls produced by resin from certain trees are very much like the pearls produced by oysters. When the resinous gum that flows out of these trees hardens, it forms pearl-like balls. The word <em>bdellium</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40868" data-verses="Numbers 11:7">11:7b</span> may refer to these balls. Both kinds of pearls are bright and transparent. </p>

The fact that the manna could be ground, beaten, and boiled indicates that it was solid. After the people had prepared the manna in this way, they made cakes of it. These cakes were a form of fine bread and were nourishing. This indicates that manna was good for nourishment. As our real manna today, Christ is rich in nourishment. </p>

The Hebrew words translated “cakes baked with oil” may also be rendered “fresh oil.” The taste of fresh oil or of cakes baked with oil signifies the sweet taste of the Holy Spirit. Oil typifies the Holy Spirit. When we eat Christ as our manna, we taste the Spirit of God. The oil here is fresh. The Spirit we taste when we enjoy Christ as manna is always fresh. </p>

First, those on the extremities of the camp of Israel murmured evil against Moses and against God, and then the mixed multitude lusted for meat. After this, Miriam and Aaron, Moses’ sister and brother, both of whom were older than Moses, followed the tide of murmuring and rebellion to stand up against Moses and slander him. At that time, there was turmoil among the Israelites; there was no peace or quiet. There must have been a great deal of gossip circulating among the people, and this might have stirred up Miriam and Aaron to speak against Moses. I believe that their motive for doing this had already been with them for quite a time; it was not something new that originated at this juncture. </p>

Thus, “Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40890" data-verses="Numbers 12:1">v. 1a</span>). For some reason, they were not happy with Moses concerning this. However, the Bible does not tell us that God was bothered by this marriage or that He condemned it. </p>
<p data-content-id="DxVzNnfEqnwJJe7GyfHvZPQRT_SbfwglxmBI07FipOB6QgwVm01HCCfjmiwJXMqx5"> Moses, Aaron, and Miriam were blood relatives. They were all over eighty years old. Moses had been called by God, and Aaron also had been called by Him. We are not told that Miriam was called, but the Bible does speak of her as a prophetess (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40891" data-verses="Exodus 15:20">Exo. 15:20</span>). She had been ordained by God, and when the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, she took the lead in praising God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40892" data-verses="Exodus 15:21">Exo. 15:21</span>). All three of them were quite distinctive among the people. They were well-educated, they were close to God, they were knowledgeable in the things of God, and they were considered leaders among the people of Israel. Nevertheless, there were “germs” hidden within Miriam and Aaron that were stirred up by the “winds” blowing with the tide of turmoil. From this we need to learn that in the service of the Lord we should not allow anything negative to remain hidden within us. Any such thing that is not rooted out of our being will come out sooner or later. We need to be alert and aware of any germs that may still be in us. We may seem to be very good, but when certain winds begin to blow or when a particular “storm” or turmoil arises, we may be affected and involved. Then, like Miriam and Aaron, we will be exposed. </p>

Has He not spoken through us also?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40893" data-verses="Numbers 12:2">Num. 12:2</span>). Miriam might have said, “I am a prophetess, one who speaks for God. God has spoken not only through Moses but also through me.” Hence, the real issue here concerned the <span class="pg" data-page-id="137" id="137">[137]</span> question of who had God’s oracle. You may be used by God to speak for Him, but you may not have God’s oracle. </p>
<p data-content-id="56Tr4kCk5lYCc-MpfN0cldGVqZ0NGnXmAb1tHSRy7tzGpsD_p3ykJtYvDxOHS7R3k"> At Moses’ time the oracle of God was with Moses. According to the Pentateuch, God spoke to Moses many times. Whenever Jehovah wanted something to be done, He first spoke about it to Moses. Actually, neither Aaron nor Miriam was God’s spokesman; only one, Moses, had the oracle of God. The jealousy concerning this was the germ that caused the “sickness” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40894" data-verses="Numbers 12:1">Numbers 12</span>. Throughout the generations, the germs of jealousy and rivalry regarding speaking for the Lord have existed among God’s servants. </p>
<p data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37CiSgbUWF8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e"> In speaking against Moses, Miriam and Aaron were speaking against the deputy authority of God. Although Moses was younger than Miriam and Aaron, God had appointed him to be His deputy authority, His representative authority. God had called Aaron and had raised up Miriam, but there is no hint that God charged them to be His representative. But God told Moses clearly that He had chosen Him to be His representative authority on earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40895" data-verses="Exodus 3:10-17">Exo. 3:10-17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40896" data-verses="Exodus 7:1">7:1</span>).

Why is it that although two rebelled, only one was punished? Why did God punish the female but not the male? We may think that the male had borne more responsibility and that he should have been punished instead of the female. There were, I believe, two reasons God punished Miriam but not Aaron. First, it is likely that Miriam took the lead in this rebellion. She was the instigator, the initiator, who stirred up Aaron. Miriam, not Aaron, was the main source. Second, it is not at all seemly for a female to rebel. Concerning rebellion, some allowance may be given to a male, but none should be given to a female. God punished Miriam to warn and alarm all the females among the children of Israel so that they would not follow Miriam. </p>

Our wives and our little ones will become a prey; would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40933" data-verses="Numbers 14:1-3">14:1-3</span>). Then they even dared to say to one another, “Let us choose a leader, and return to Egypt” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40934" data-verses="Numbers 14:4">v. 4</span>).

<p data-content-id="lGJMqXpxLr00FAOi_3oq81Lbumdyiel3q9IrhyEOb-mti2DuXEIULfVfV-8aXxhkd"> At this point, I would like to speak a word concerning the spiritual significance of the good land, the land of Canaan. When I was first sent to this country with the Lord’s recovery, at the first conference in Los Angeles, I gave a series of messages, based mainly on <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40938" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:7-10">Deuteronomy 8:7-10</span>, that were published in the book <em>The All-inclusive Christ.</em> In those messages I pointed out that the good land is a picture of the all-inclusive Christ. The good land was used by God to typify a person, who is the embodiment of God. This embodied God is the Triune God, who has been processed and consummated in one person, Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="OZSjkV5USBSK_MP1WUozHmnLv21uazrsJs9t6GIBcxwgHMpXkI44nN0BaekRScDuy"> The Bible is a marvelous book, and it contains many different kinds of writings and subjects. Actually, the entire Bible presents one matter—that God desires to be embodied in one person, who is the unique One in the universe. It is impossible to exhaust the telling of this wonderful person. God and man are in this person; He includes all the elements and attributes of the divine nature and all the virtues of the human nature. In Him we have the reality of both the divine nature and the human nature. In Him we also have life, light, and the Spirit. All the positive things in the universe are embodied, contained, and realized in this one person, the all-inclusive God-man, who is the center and meaning of the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="4MK-wePHgeEAEGgR-z7X3Mu1jwRZhE7RGIluVa5oEpcHV3stVAVn4-Tc5CTQh0iYn"> The religion of Christianity has been on earth for over nineteen hundred years. Nevertheless, since the time of the apostles, the wonderful person of Christ has not been presented to people in as full a way as He is revealed, somewhat hiddenly, in the Bible and as we see Him today. We thank the Lord for opening His holy Word to us, enabling us to see aspects of Christ which have been veiled for centuries. </p>
<p data-content-id="owSxjcqeZRVmxEIS3OihEHfswLldhdw0vmgvUEemAnltodyTzv6yHvYP90yMUcQyG"> Very soon after the first century, the Bible, the revelation of this wonderful person, became veiled and later was locked up by Catholicism. During the Reformation, the Bible was unlocked, but it was not yet unveiled. Since that time, the things Christians have seen in the Bible are related mainly <span class="pg" data-page-id="145" id="145">[145]</span> to God’s salvation. These things include God’s creation, the divine attributes of faithfulness, righteousness, holiness, and love, man’s fall and sinfulness, God’s love for man, Christ’s coming to save and redeem man through His vicarious death on the cross, His resurrection from among the dead, and the Holy Spirit’s being poured out at Pentecost to make the believers the church. For the most part, Christians have not seen God’s economy. What they teach, preach, and propagate is largely according to human thought, with only a little that is according to the divine thought. In their preaching they do not emphasize the impartation of life. Instead, they stress the matters of forgiveness, redemption, justification by faith, and sanctification, but they have not seen the dispensing of the Triune God into the tripartite man, that man may have the divine life and possess the divine nature to become part of the enlarged Christ. (Some of those who stressed the inner life saw that the believers are members of the enlarged Christ, but they saw this only vaguely, not clearly.) </p>

Then we will see that they also failed by transgressing the word of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40943" data-verses="Numbers 14:39-45">vv. 39-45</span>). Concerning these matters, I have some serious things to say. </p>

God had brought the children of Israel to the border of the good land, and they could have easily crossed the border and entered into the land. But God knew their heart, and He put them to the test. He gave the word to send out the twelve spies to spy out the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40945" data-verses="Numbers 13:1-2">13:1-2</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40946" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:2">Deuteronomy 8:2</span>, God did this purposely in order to test them. This test exposed them to the uttermost. </p>
<p data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyJWI9esEhC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS"> Our faith may be very weak and small, nearly nonexistent. Since this may be our situation, we should learn to humble ourselves before God, confessing the weakness of our faith and asking Him to forgive us. This is the spirit we should have before God. But as indicated by what they said, the children of Israel did not care for God but only for themselves. Their feeling was centered not on God but on themselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37ChQgbUUF8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e"> Today, thirty-five hundred years later, we can realize from reading the biblical record that although God’s bringing of the people into the good land was apparently for the people, it was actually to accomplish, to carry out, God’s eternal plan, <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> which is altogether centered on the all-inclusive Christ. This is on the positive side. </p>
<p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5FnmjgkbtL37tgQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> On the negative side, God still has an enemy, Satan. Apparently, it is man who occupies and usurps the earth; actually, the usurper is not man but Satan. This is the reason that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40947" data-verses="Matthew 6:10">Matthew 6:10</span> the Lord Jesus told us to pray that the Father’s will would be done on earth as it is in heaven. This indicates that God’s will has not yet been accomplished on earth. Concerning God’s will being done, there is no problem in the heavens, but there is a problem on earth. Therefore, we need to pray for God’s will to be done on earth as it is done in heaven. </p>
<p data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk0trEvl5hK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D"> At the time of Exodus, the entire earth was occupied by the Gentiles, who were under the hand of Satan. Not even a small part of the earth created by God was under His control. The children of Israel were in Egypt, but Egypt was not their land. They had to find a land, and God had prepared a land for them. Hundreds of years before, God had told their forefather Abraham that He would give the land of Canaan to his descendants (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40948" data-verses="Genesis 13:14-17">Gen. 13:14-17</span>). Actually, God’s desire was that Abraham’s descendants would take that good land for His purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="UdegCvQnXR5xgUhUaUGVdAvjmeK-Cu7dqw2JPQOIsoKn_Y8dqhxtHLn_1Zya9Y6Px"> When the men spied out the land, they found that the descendants of Anak, a particular people whom the Bible calls the Nephilim, or giants, were dwelling there (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40949" data-verses="Numbers 13:33">Num. 13:33</span>). The origin of the Nephilim is seen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40950" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span>. In brief, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40951" data-verses="Genesis 6:1">Genesis 6</span> tells us that when man fell to such an extent that he became flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40952" data-verses="Genesis 6:3">v. 3</span>), the fallen angels came down to earth to marry the daughters of men (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40953" data-verses="Genesis 6:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40954" data-verses="Genesis 6:4">4</span>). This mixed marriage produced the giants, the Nephilim. God could not tolerate this mixture. It was because of this mixing of the human race with the fallen angels that God destroyed the whole human race by the flood. Later, the same mixed race, the Nephilim, a mixture of fallen angels and fallen man, dwelt in the land of Canaan. Hence, God commanded the children of Israel to take over this land and to destroy every living being there so that the human race could be cleared up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="40955" data-verses="Deuteronomy 7:1-2">Deut. 7:1-2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="MNYPxEBRKCjGvjYcSm_-z7G62mDZBONkc_BXexp5aMeJNuq4a-EbRUgKX-x3mauLs"> However, the children of Israel did not know this. Their <span class="pg" data-page-id="151" id="151">[151]</span> consideration was not for God but for their own interest. They did not care for God in the least, but cared only for their safety, their peace, and their existence. They did not confess their weakness or humble themselves before God. Eventually, they offended God to such an extent that they became abhorrent to Him. What they did was altogether abhorrent in His sight. </p>
<p data-content-id="VBaATaFwkk1R2p-lJIa9c-4uZlOY975Xa5FmEubBdBBuFAyJhWAJhBvAZCseteqbq"> As human beings we need to be concerned for our daily life, our jobs, our safety, and our security. But we should not forget that God’s enemy, Satan, is hidden behind the scene and that the real issue on earth today is a matter not between God and man but between God and Satan. Thus, if we care only for our existence, security, safety, peace, and future, we may become an abhorrence in the eyes of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="i-M7ojiJqGoJd-LWYW0HxOdKTLIEy22u_R9o2QysidURajdNowaOAucBwqV_zFWnD"> Today some believers are very much for themselves, caring for their security and for blessings in material things but not caring for God’s purpose. Such Christians believe in Jesus Christ only for their own benefit; they do not have the slightest thought concerning God’s interest on earth and in the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="1q83V7kEkTSAS8FhlVDsmwjbJQ03QFqsrqbsu0A6Y9sDz6OYDLPkVWCpO4FO6tj8_"> Surely we are God’s children, and God is for us. But for whom are we? Some Christians give no thought to God’s interest, God’s gain, or God’s suffering. They think and speak only about themselves and their security. Among worldly people today, security is a big idol. Everything they do is for their security. For their security they study diligently and work hard. Some even fear God and believe in Christ for their own security. </p>
<p data-content-id="9E0RwvkihCfbWu-ZTtqadOCujB4N7t73TIeHLchn3Izflx0InPBI1FJa49wKFpuwV"> Why did the children of Israel become abhorrent to God in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40956" data-verses="Numbers 13:1-2">Numbers 13 and 14</span>? They became abhorrent because they were so much for themselves. In everything and in every way they were for themselves, not for God’s interests. If they had thought even a little about God’s interests, they would have said, “God, as You have been so good to us, we just love You. We would like to sacrifice our future, our safety, our security, our existence, and everything for Your purpose. We forget about our benefit. We care only that You accomplish Your purpose. For Your purpose, let us go and possess the land.” </p>
<p data-content-id="jgnwUAKnb3LF-rKF2so0teKi2jPYdu4JVjXaJif78hdaEK0IAPD6KUO8RgekuaJZh"> Caring for God and His interests produces faith. When we <span class="pg" data-page-id="152" id="152">[152]</span> are so much for ourselves, it is difficult for us to have faith in God. But if we take the standing that we are for God and that for His interests we are willing to risk everything—our future, our family, even our life—faith will spontaneously be produced in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="THD-di8wGJMlaO716gw-ChS1nTkcoQbV18U2QgihgQryXjW6mpyEGOcguhQaI5k-h"> We all need to be impressed with the fact that in ourselves we are weak and do not have any faith. Who among us can boast that he has faith? Faith is of God, faith is in God, and faith comes from God. If we would have faith, we must learn to care for God’s interests and not for our benefit. The worldly people are concerned daily for their own security and benefit, but we should care for God and His interests. History tells us that those who cared for God and did not consider their own benefit became people of faith, and some even became giants of faith. </p>

Moses was a God-man; he knew God. Therefore, he did not pray according to his concept; rather, he prayed according to God’s concept, according to what God is, what God speaks, and what God promises.

His prayer, saying that Jehovah is slow to anger and abounding in mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, bound God according to what He had spoken and what He is. </p>

ORDINANCES</h2><p data-content-id="qGcKu1ZVR5xTox402-R1dpLvpsSO0c7yKDvJ8DBs_v_SpNT-ALQWUMIgMeeSUavPV"> In the middle of all the turmoils, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40975" data-verses="Numbers 15:1">chapter fifteen</span> is inserted. Why is there the need of such an insertion? According to the behavior of the children of Israel, it became clear that they did not care very much for God’s interests. What they did was mostly for themselves. This situation brought in God’s judgment and punishment. It is doubtful that at that time the children of Israel remembered all the instructions on how to be accepted by God. They could not be accepted by themselves or in themselves but in the One who replaced them, Christ. In the Old Testament typology, this Christ, our replacing One, has many aspects, which can be seen in the many different kinds of offerings. The main aspects are seen in the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, which may be matched by some corresponding offerings, such as the meal offering of cakes and wafers and the drink offering. </p>
<p data-content-id="yogGGgbIJieS7MU0cVjERxjlFjfQCcAm9w46WVr1gAb6TJLAvX8-z2ryALdGL70w9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40976" data-verses="Numbers 15:1">Numbers 15</span> might have been inserted because the children of Israel did not care for God’s interests. This chapter was a reminder to them that their situation was altogether displeasing to God. Probably they had forgotten to offer the offerings required by God to make propitiation for their errors, wrongdoings, and rebellion. </p>
<p data-content-id="aECWv_lTxwekQyYAZotodQUeHFFmniOA1d0SzbnD0g14YSu3QLsjuz5hjx3S9YWCt"> Let us consider again the situation of the children of <span class="pg" data-page-id="158" id="158">[158]</span> Israel. First, those who were at the borders of their encampment, not at the center, murmured evil before God. Then the mixed multitude among them lusted before God. Both received their portion of God’s judgment. After that, as a great surprise to Moses, his older sister and brother, who had always been with him at the center of God’s move, rebelled. Thus, the situation and atmosphere among the children of Israel were very low, and the morale, along with all the positive things, was gone. Next, the spies were sent to spy out the land, and ten of these spies brought back an evil report. They also received the proper judgment from God. Therefore, before another rebellion arose (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40977" data-verses="Numbers 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>), God came in with <span class="verse" data-ref-id="40978" data-verses="Numbers 15:1">Numbers 15</span> as an insertion. If the children of Israel had kept the ordinances in this chapter, they would have been rescued from further turmoil. </p>
<p data-content-id="bE_9bUDz2n1OFoQ6MqyJzM3YUnf35hIg2SkRB_DtOR76JTH0rYg8plcGGDpWELP1w"> Two of the ordinances inserted here concerned the offerings and the breaking of the Sabbath. To present an offering to God indicates that we realize that we cannot do anything to please God. We offer Christ to God because we are unable to make God happy, to be well-pleasing to Him, and to be accepted by Him. By offering Christ to God we admit that, in ourselves and by ourselves, we cannot please Him or be acceptable to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="qGcKu1ZVR5xTox402-R1dpLvg-SO0c7yKDvJ8DBs_v_SpNT-ALQWUMIgMeeSUavPV"> To keep the Sabbath is to acknowledge, recognize, and receive the fact that God has done everything for us. We do not need to do anything, and we cannot do anything, for ourselves. God has done everything, and we should simply acknowledge and accept what God has done for us and rest in it. This is to keep the Sabbath. </p>
<p data-content-id="yogGGgbIJieS7MU0cVjERxjlNxPQCcAm9w46WVr1gAb6TJLAvX8-z2ryALdGL70w9"> God created everything in six days. At the conclusion of His creation, He created man. When man came forth from God’s creating hand, he did not need to do anything. He began immediately to enjoy what God had made for him, and he rested in it. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Nao4cbRs9AiSNlXRQNA8y4b1G-PfC6ZUe2gLXackKJJ2QeSyCCiLybrCyWPJHWD_"> To break the Sabbath is to deny what God has done for us and to try to do everything for ourselves. This is a blasphemy to God. If we try in ourselves to do something to please God, our effort is a blasphemy to God because it is a denial of what God has done for us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="159" id="159">[159]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="0I15hg85dOcthbcFQOxX4enEn0ObfxmdReoS22AKOrqla8tAqHC6ayC5UH6a1tzmM"> We should always have the consciousness that we are nothing and that we are not able to do anything.

<p data-content-id="7yTIaBOhlCkC6wnzpdOnj5P80TO4cU6JN5dp73tdKZs9iz_xB3_gpvjWsQcHJJNa-"> We should also keep in mind that striving in ourselves and for ourselves means nothing and is actually blasphemy. We should simply accept God and what He has done for us. We should not be like the worldly people who deny God by all their self-endeavoring. They deny God by what they do. Even some atheists would say, “Who is God? I don’t need God. I can do everything myself.” This is to deny God and to blaspheme Him. </p>

The second rebellion was the lusting of the mixed multitude. The third involved two elder relatives of Moses who were very close to him. Now, after the fourth rebellion, the rebellion of unbelief in spying out the land, some of the leading ones rebelled. This time the rebellion was on a much larger scale; it involved more than two hundred fifty people. </p>

Hence, he was not among those at the border nor among the mixed multitude. Rather, as a Levite, a serving one, even a leader among the Levites, he was in the center of the camp. <span class="pg" data-page-id="170" id="170">[170]</span> </p>

This rebellion was a great hardship to Moses and Aaron because it was against the center of the government. </p>

<p data-content-id="Zjo9b_sbrL-1x6xy-0gyQPfIXqcZurBOk8dWCpfBgyBR0D6E30f90C4kCu_Hzx6Aq"> The cause of the rebellion was the struggle for position and power. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41028" data-verses="Numbers 16:9-10">verses 9 and 10</span> Moses said, “Is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the assembly to minister to them; and that He has brought you near to Him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And will you seek the priesthood also?” The priests had the priesthood, the priestly service, and the Levites had the Levitical service next to them and were serving the priests. But, as Moses’ word indicates, the rebels were struggling for power and for a higher position. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="AQYzzKQWYTkaFQeLtwXyA8jlx-OydiCBfKdc5vmfXuwsxv0xS9OBpDz-8zAqA_-Qz">2. The Accusation</h2><p data-content-id="FRSfve2gXKF2q5U8QMttUfIQQtAk8O0qwdoGc_QmQ-eQ8kJW69ciA8zsBiJhZIN53"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41029" data-verses="Numbers 16:3">verse 3</span>, the rebels made an accusation against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have gone too far! For all the assembly is holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?” This shows that the root, or the factor, of this rebellion was the struggle for power. Through the centuries, many problems among Christians have been caused by the struggle for position and power. In society this <span class="pg" data-page-id="171" id="171">[171]</span> power struggle is everywhere—in the schools, in the government, and in corporations. In the work place, people play politics in order to gain more power and position. The same thing happened among God’s people in ancient times and has been repeated again and again among Christians through the centuries. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Cmeet7LFEwA83Buuyy4WnpAGci7qBpX55w_jk3kONkrrJH7N7b1Pyn3Qqcfwcq2SE">C. The Reaction of Moses</h2><p data-content-id="PuIIleEPVSVfD8jhkWufjUlW2nN57_EJYxmruVj7g1UOrXT8awLuynKwbredYSK3_"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41030" data-verses="Numbers 16:4-11">16:4-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41031" data-verses="Numbers 16:15-18">15-18</span> we see the reaction of Moses. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="-ygMnNXQK98Bslpy7nKLJmxVon4MEgYLj3HQenBBRZnxyBXU7VW1OzWf6pxTP6q5S">1. Falling on His Face</h2><p data-content-id="pitQJ6wzw9SLef7XU0zposQX8wcz_ho3XM7OLfBcppeT-qU_lUsjRuGVn988HowAD"> “When Moses heard it, he fell on his face” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41032" data-verses="Numbers 16:4">v. 4</span>). This indicates that in his reaction to this rebellion, Moses was humble. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="vAsrJ2nXSZSYEVPzp03QqO1U38zW9-L_Lgvah9JawmYMePT4WRb2Med_Jz2YQdYJK">2. Standing on the Position<br/>of God’s Deputy Authority</h2><p data-content-id="WtQg4gkFxRAg6KQBybFiHbH_gaoSmMyCMdudfZSiSkioM0_3Ome8OLQclMyg824a5"> Although Moses was humble in falling on his face, he did not give up his God-given position as God’s deputy authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41033" data-verses="Numbers 16:5-11">vv. 5-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41034" data-verses="Numbers 16:16-18">16-18</span>). He rebuked Korah and all his company and charged them to be present before Jehovah with their censers, saying that Jehovah would make known who was His and who was holy and would cause him to come near Him. This indicates that in a struggle for power the only one who can judge and expose the real situation is God Himself. Moses did not fight back; rather, he brought the rebels and the ones against whom they rebelled to God. As God’s deputy, or delegated, authority, Moses referred this case to God as the highest authority for His speaking, exposure, and judgment. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="2E0ak2tPM0Mfc5DVkAQ7bdFv1dsY3fc09HxajrXJ90qanQxeb0N_D56Uhkk3_Uw5t">3. Being Very Angry</h2><p data-content-id="uVg-B0zfBhzFLu0-bfSRunwd4BB4eF9Rnw_t3_6v1pD3tO9lSNhdpPMAef8L-UIGR"> Moses was very angry and prayed, “Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one ass from them, and I have not ill-treated one of them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41035" data-verses="Numbers 16:15">v. 15</span>). Moses’ prayer concerning God’s not accepting their offering was serious. It is not easy for a servant of God to pray in this way. Here it seems that Moses was forced to vindicate himself, but God did not condemn him for this. <span class="pg" data-page-id="172" id="172">[172]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyJWo9U-0hC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS">4. Sending to Call Dathan and Abiram</h2><p data-content-id="IflM7BbsLZ6u10ceoy3Haptyce-Pm_DMYrFV0s5yiOLZE994aXHfO4p54nuE3Htm0"> Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41036" data-verses="Numbers 16:12">v. 12a</span>), but, speaking in a very eloquent manner, they answered that they would not come up (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41037" data-verses="Numbers 16:12-14">vv. 12b-14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="HPFjB-1Auz0yuOHKiO7sVGBB4_HuErvnZ-3dB9TpN-DIjpt7vl1AN1EJ-KBTMrfRS"> I do not like to talk about the rebellion of God’s people, but the Bible gives us a long portion here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41038" data-verses="Numbers 16:1">Numbers 16</span> to cover this matter. Ambition for position and power is always a problem to God’s people. Ambition is a “gopher” that undermines God’s plan and damages His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="XLLTDppJ60HGrEjQbd3j8QzU9WEvU58jcqP7x6v7IGu3acmlClR7B0TiVrBD0lZqc"> I admire Moses’ boldness in confronting this problem. He was attacked to the uttermost. Those rebels not only attacked him, but they also rebelled against him as the authority arranged by God. It was difficult for him to say anything. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1dF6aJscO4mjEVXwfZzquelfgNKXAM-f35W2Fgo9MGMHdxxaD2W6l_abXuvSctvM"> When I was with Watchman Nee on the mainland of China, I saw him attacked a number of times. He never did anything or said anything to vindicate himself, and he never complained against others. As he told me, because he was the target, it was difficult for him to say anything concerning himself without vindicating, and it was difficult to say anything about others without condemning. So the best way, he said, was not to say anything. </p>
<p data-content-id="JURneMwwUjjCukjzuls456IaAvBXJw4OHc1FWynSIUK5iiWwT0Qsz8EketofHftLD"> Even though Brother Nee was the one under attack, it was the church that was damaged, and it was God’s plan that was hurt. Furthermore, many young ones, who did not have much discernment concerning these things, were damaged. On the other hand, the church received some positive help from all the turmoil. </p>
<p data-content-id="zlDFwvjlbRNSVPZMsJoAPpo-1uoUl9T_qTJ0b8-Djp239rcyY1bn_iJnFc_BwAY5_"> The ambition for power and the struggle for power are in our blood. This ambition and struggle can be found not only among males but also among females. The rebellion of Miriam and Aaron against Moses proves this. I believe that this rebellion was instigated by Miriam. I have seen cases in which a sister instigated a rebellion from behind the scenes. She used a brother to carry out her intention. We all need to be careful to guard against the “gopher” of ambition within us. </p>
<p data-content-id="aECWv_lTxwekQyYAZotodQEeFHFmniOA1d0SzbnD0g14YSu3QLsjuz5hjx3S9YWCt"> The first generation of Christ’s followers was troubled by the struggle for power. At a very crucial time, when the Lord <span class="pg" data-page-id="173" id="173">[173]</span> Jesus was going to Jerusalem to be crucified, He told His followers what would happen to Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41039" data-verses="Matthew 20:17-19">Matt. 20:17-19</span>). They heard Him, but they neither listened to what He said nor cared about it. While He was telling them about His death, they were struggling for power. The mother of James and John (Jesus’ aunt) even brought her two sons to the Lord, begging Him to put one on His right and one on His left in the kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41040" data-verses="Matthew 20:20-28">Matt. 20:20-28</span>). The other disciples were indignant toward these two brothers. This indicates that there was a power struggle among the disciples. </p>
<p data-content-id="bE_9bUDz2n1OFoQ6MqyJzMnYWlf35hIg2SkRB_DtOR76JTH0rYg8plcGGDpWELP1w"> If you read through the Acts and the Epistles, you will see that this struggle for power was there from the beginning of the church life. Ananias and Sapphira (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41041" data-verses="Acts 5:1-4">Acts 5:1-4</span>) were a couple who lied to God. Actually, their lying was a struggle for power. They wanted to be more important, to elevate themselves in the eyes of others. At the end of the Epistles, John mentioned one who was struggling for power, Diotrephes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41042" data-verses="3John 1:9-11">3 John 9-11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="qGcKu1ZVR5xTox402-R1dpbvl-yO0c7yKDvJ8DBs_v_SpNT-ALQWUMIgMeeSUavPV"> The history of Christianity is a history of the struggle for power. This struggle is within each one of us. You may not realize it, but it is hidden inside you. Eventually, the church life will be a test to our real situation. As long as we are in the church life, sooner or later we will be tested and exposed. </p>

They, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones, came out and stood at the entrance of their tents (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41054" data-verses="Numbers 16:27">v. 27</span>). The fact that their tents were close together indicates that they were very intimate. They belonged to different tribes—Korah, to the tribe of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, to the tribe of Reuben—but they were quite close. When the earth opened up, they were all in the same place. </p>
<p data-content-id="OZSjkV5USBSK_MP1WUozHnnLt31uazrsJs9t6GIBcxwgHMpXkI44nN0BaekRScDuy"> Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones, and all the men who belonged to Korah and all their goods, were swallowed by the earth and sent down alive into Sheol (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41055" data-verses="Numbers 16:28-33">vv. 28-33</span>). <em>Sheol</em> is a Hebrew word equivalent to the Greek word <em>Hades.</em> Sheol, or Hades, is the place where the souls and the spirits of the dead are kept. Korah and the others went down to Sheol alive. They went <span class="pg" data-page-id="177" id="177">[177]</span> there directly; they did not need to die first. Hades is like a temporary jail, and the lake of fire is the final prison. These perished ones entered into the temporary jail to wait for the final imprisonment in the lake of fire. They went there without dying physically. This was something new that Jehovah created (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41056" data-verses="Numbers 16:29-30">vv. 29-30</span>). We may say that it was a great miracle in a negative sense. In this way God used the earth to judge the rebellious ones.

The two hundred fifty men were burned by God in His judgment. Then their censers were hammered into plates to cover the altar. When the people came to offer at the altar, they were reminded of the rebellion and of God’s judgment on Korah and his company. <span class="pg" data-page-id="178" id="178">[178]</span> </p>

His glory appeared in the cloud that covered the tent of meeting (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41061" data-verses="Numbers 16:42">v. 42</span>). He told Moses that He would consume the assembly in a moment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41062" data-verses="Numbers 16:43-45">vv. 43-45a</span>), and He sent the plague to kill them under His wrath (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41063" data-verses="Numbers 16:46">v. 46b</span>).

Moses and Aaron fell on their faces (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41064" data-verses="Numbers 16:45">v. 45b</span>). Aaron put fire from the altar in the censer, placed incense on the fire, carried the censer quickly to the assembly, and stood between the dead and the living, to make propitiation for them. Then the plague was stopped. Nevertheless, fourteen thousand seven hundred of the people were killed. This was God’s judgment from within the rebellious people. <span class="pg" data-page-id="179" id="179">[179]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37ChRwbWUF8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e"> By reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41065" data-verses="Numbers 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> we can see that the remainder of the people still were not subdued. There had been a threefold, miraculous judgment by God. God had judged them by the earth, by fire from heaven, and by the plague that issued from the germs within them. Any one of those judgments should have been sufficient to subdue them and to cause them to fall down before God and worship Him. They certainly should have been subdued by the third judgment. However, even after the third judgment the people still complained (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41066" data-verses="Numbers 17:13">17:13</span>). How terrible was their situation! They were so bold in their rebellion, not caring if they went to Sheol or the lake of fire, that they risked their lives, even their souls. They rebelled against Moses and Aaron, and eventually they rebelled against the very God, Jehovah. From this we see how perverse is the rebellious nature of fallen humankind. </p>
<p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5Fnmjgkbsb35tgQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> If we consider God’s way of judging, we will see that He executes His judgment from three directions: from the earth, from heaven, and from within the rebellious ones. Rebellious people, however, are not subdued by this. Actually, according to the record of the Bible, God never has subdued people by judgment. After the thousand years of purifying in the millennium, the human race will still rebel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41067" data-verses="Revelation 20:7-9">Rev. 20:7-9</span>). God’s judgment does not subdue people; rather, it consumes them. </p>

But <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41072" data-verses="Numbers 26:11">Numbers 26:11</span> tells us that the sons of Korah did not die. Either they did not take part in that conspiracy and rebellion, or they took Moses’ word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41073" data-verses="Numbers 16:26">16:26</span> and departed from the tent of their father and thereby escaped the tragedy that took place when the earth opened and swallowed Korah and his company. </p>
<p data-content-id="MNYPxEBRKCjGvjYcSm_-z6G6_1jZBONkc_BXexp5aMeJNuq4a-EbRUgKX-x3mauLs"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41074" data-verses="1Chronicles 6:33-37">1 Chronicles 6:33-37</span>, a record of the genealogy of Samuel, we are told that Samuel was a descendant of Korah. Korah aspired to have a higher position in the priesthood. He did not attain it and he became rebellious. However, one of his descendants became a priest, not by struggling for power but by being offered as a Nazarite. (See Messages Eight through Ten on being sanctified to be a Nazarite.) Samuel was not only a priest but also a great prophet. </p>
<p data-content-id="VBaATaFwkk1R2p-lJIa9c_4uR2-Y975Xa5FmEubBdBBuFAyJhWAJhBvAZCseteqbq"> Furthermore, as the title of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41075" data-verses="Psalms 88:1">Psalm 88</span> indicates, this psalm was written by Heman, a descendant of Korah and a grandson of Samuel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41076" data-verses="1Chronicles 6:33">1 Chron. 6:33</span>). Heman was not only a psalmist but also a singer in the temple under David’s arrangement. </p>
<p data-content-id="L9HftOmYqjmYA0hV0PtiXVPLBCCl6jSE9MY_rfUhPEuKy3ijGqB94J8MCZIyjUWvw"> In God’s sparing Korah’s descendants, we can see His mercy. One of Korah’s descendants became a great prophet and took part in the priesthood. Another became one of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="182" id="182">[182]</span> psalmists, a writer of one of the best psalms and a temple singer and musician. Thus, from the history recorded in the Old Testament, we can see that God is severe to some but merciful to others. Whether we experience His mercy or His severity depends on how we behave ourselves. </p>

God’s Vindication</h2><p data-content-id="Zjo9b_sbrL-1x6xy-0gyQO_IUq8ZurBOk8dWCpfBgyBR0D6E30f90C4kCu_Hzx6Aq"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41077" data-verses="Numbers 17:1">Numbers 17</span> is a chapter on God’s vindication. God’s vindication always goes along with His judgment. Hence, His judgment and His vindication cannot be separated. Actually, God’s judgment is a form of vindication. But judgment is mainly on the negative side, and vindication is mainly on the positive side. On the negative side, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41078" data-verses="Numbers 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> God judged Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and the other rebels, including not only the two hundred fifty leaders of the assembly but also the company of Korah. In carrying out this judgment, God exercised His righteousness. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41079" data-verses="Numbers 17:1">chapter seventeen</span> God went further to vindicate Aaron and Moses, His deputy authority, in a positive way. </p>

This signifies that everything had to be brought into the presence of God to let God deal with the real situation by speaking the truth to all the people through His vindication. In typology a rod signifies authority (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41081" data-verses="1Corinthians 4:21">1 Cor. 4:21</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41082" data-verses="Numbers 17:1">Numbers 17</span> the rods represented the leaders of the twelve tribes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41083" data-verses="Numbers 17:2">v. 2</span>), and Aaron’s rod represented the tribe of Levi (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41084" data-verses="Numbers 17:3">v. 3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="Cmeet7LFEwA83Buuyy4WnogGfjbqBpX55w_jk3kONkrrJH7N7b1Pyn3Qqcfwcq2SE"> Jehovah said, “The rod of the man whom I choose shall bud; thus I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41085" data-verses="Numbers 17:5">v. 5</span>). A rod is a piece of dead wood. It has not only been cut, but it is also dead and dried up. Yet such a dead and dried up piece of wood would bud. A bud is something organic, something of life. It <span class="pg" data-page-id="183" id="183">[183]</span> was God’s intention that this budding of a dead rod would cause the murmurings of the people to cease. </p>
<p data-content-id="PuIIleEPVSVfD8jhkWufjVFW1nt57_EJYxmruVj7g1UOrXT8awLuynKwbredYSK3_"> The rods were to lie before God in the tent of meeting through a whole night. It is not likely that Aaron slept well that night. He probably thought about his rod, wondering if it would bud. For Aaron that night was truly a dark night. Sometimes, for His vindication, God puts us into a dark night, a dark tunnel, through which we must pass. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="-ygMnNXQK98Bslpy7nKLJnRVrnYMEgYLj3HQenBBRZnxyBXU7VW1OzWf6pxTP6q5S">2.

What a miracle that was! Aaron’s dead, dried up rod budded. This was an organic miracle. </p>
<p data-content-id="vAsrJ2nXSZSYEVPzp03QqPVU0_TW9-L_Lgvah9JawmYMePT4WRb2Med_Jz2YQdYJK"> Moses brought all the rods to all the sons of Israel, and they all looked (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41087" data-verses="Numbers 17:9">v. 9</span>). The record indicates that, without saying a word and without praising the Lord for His vindication, each man took his rod. </p>

<p data-content-id="HPFjB-1Auz0yuOHKiO7sVHhB5-nuErvnZ-3dB9TpN-DIjpt7vl1AN1EJ-KBTMrfRS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41093" data-verses="Numbers 16:1-2">Numbers 16 and 17</span> two signs were produced through the rebellion of the sons of Israel. One was a negative sign, made of the censers of those who had been judged (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41094" data-verses="Numbers 16:36-40">16:36-40</span>). One was a positive sign, produced by the budding rod of <span class="pg" data-page-id="184" id="184">[184]</span> Aaron. The budding rod was contained in the ark with two other things—the hidden manna and the testimony of God, the law. All three items are types of Christ. The budding rod, the hidden manna, and the testimony, the law, of God all signify Christ. By this we can see that whatever happened in the Old Testament on the positive side was related to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="XLLTDppJ60HGrEjQbd3j8RTU8WkvU58jcqP7x6v7IGu3acmlClR7B0TiVrBD0lZqc"> The budding rod of Aaron typifies not a dead Christ but the resurrected Christ, the budding Christ, who imparts life to others. Christ always flows out life to enliven others. Christ is the greatest budding rod in the universe. Today He is still budding, and we are a small part, the fruit, the almonds, of His budding. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="k1dF6aJscO4mjEVXwfZzqv-legtKXAM-f35W2Fgo9MGMHdxxaD2W6l_abXuvSctvM">4.

After God’s vindication through Aaron’s budding rod, they said, “Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone. Everyone shall die who comes near at all to the tabernacle of Jehovah. Shall we not all end up perishing?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41095" data-verses="Numbers 17:12-13">vv. 12-13</span>). This indicates that even after seeing God’s judgment and vindication, the people were not subdued. The earth had opened to swallow Korah and his company, fire had come down from God to consume the two hundred fifty leaders, and fourteen thousand seven hundred of the people had been slain by the plague in one day. All these were miracles on the negative side. The next day, God did a miracle not on a large scale but on a small scale, causing Aaron’s rod to bud, blossom, and bear fruit, even ripe fruit. This was altogether positive, a matter of mercy and grace, with no thought of judgment. It was a vindication to indicate who and what were of God and on God’s side. Everyone should have been convinced and subdued, but the people of Israel still spoke words of rebellion to Moses. </p>
<p data-content-id="zlDFwvjlbRNSVPZMsJoAPoI-0tIUl9T_qTJ0b8-Djp239rcyY1bn_iJnFc_BwAY5_"> It is no wonder that these children of Israel were not permitted to enter the promised land. In their rebellion, they had gone too far. Some of the rebels had said to Moses and Aaron, “You have gone too far!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41096" data-verses="Numbers 16:3">16:3</span>). Moses said the same <span class="pg" data-page-id="185" id="185">[185]</span> thing to them: “You have gone too far, sons of Levi!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41097" data-verses="Numbers 16:7">16:7</span>). Actually, the rebellious ones had gone too far, yet they accused Moses and Aaron of going too far. They condemned Moses and Aaron for doing what they themselves were doing. Similar things have happened through the generations, with the ambitious ones falsely accusing others of being ambitious. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41098" data-verses="Numbers 16:1-2">Numbers 16 and 17</span> God’s judgment and vindication clearly indicated that the rebels, not Moses and Aaron, had gone too far. </p>

This altar, on which the sacrifices were offered, is a type of the cross of Christ. God’s judgment of these two hundred fifty men signifies the judgment of the cross on all of man’s service to God which is according to man’s opinions, by his flesh, and in rivalry with others. The two hundred fifty men were burning incense in the service of God, which was according to their own way. Their service was judged by God, and the result of that judgment was a negative sign, the covering on the altar.

<p data-content-id="wFQBjuNz7_AjSqmWfTe5NdjYkSWcO8mU81RI6yzs2rp89GNZ-ynPkrIKOR1S7BkLj"> The almonds produced by Aaron’s budding rod point to the enjoyment of Christ. Such terms as <em>enjoying Christ, eating Christ,</em> and <em>drinking Christ</em> are part of a new vocabulary that came to this country with the Lord’s recovery. Christ is enjoyable, and He is our portion for our enjoyment. However, as we will see, in the typology of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41113" data-verses="Numbers 18:8-10">18:8-10</span>, the Christ who is the priests’ portion is actually a part of God’s portion reserved for the priests to share. The priests not only eat God’s food; they also eat with God and feast with Him. They are invited by God to share His portion. </p>
<p data-content-id="4MK-wePHgeEAEGgR-z7X3NO1hxRZhE7RGIluVa5oEpcHV3stVAVn4-Tc5CTQh0iYn"> The divine thought concerning enjoying, eating, and drinking Christ is in the holy Word, but it has been hidden for nearly two thousand years. We did not see the matters of eating and drinking Christ until 1958, at which time I gave a series of messages on enjoying the Lord by eating and drinking Him. </p>

This reward is Christ. The more the priests serve, the more they receive Christ as their reward and the more they enjoy Christ. Such a reward is the divine food to be enjoyed by the faithful priests. This is much greater than the budding rod. </p>

The word <em>iniquity</em> is used here to charge the priests not to make mistakes while carrying out their priestly service. The priesthood was a service to offer all kinds of offerings and sacrifices to God, all of which were types of different aspects of the rich Christ. Thus, it was a very important and serious matter. Any mistake, neglect, or shortage would have been a kind of iniquity. The priests were <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> required to fulfill their charge without making mistakes so that their priestly service would not have any iniquity. </p>

The whole tabernacle was the sanctuary. In the Bible the word <em>sanctuary</em> is used in a very ambiguous way; it may refer to the Holy Place, to the Holy of Holies, or to both. The sanctuary typifies Christ and also the church. The altar, which was outside the sanctuary, signifies the cross of Christ. Therefore, the sanctuary and the altar typify Christ with the church and His cross. </p>

We have pointed out that in typology the heave offering refers to the ascension of Christ, to the ascending of Christ to the heavens. This thought corresponds to the Lord’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41160" data-verses="Matthew 6:19-20">Matthew 6:19 and 20</span>, where we are told to “lay up treasures in heaven” rather than on earth. To lay up treasures in heaven is to “send” our money to heaven, and to do this is to “heave up” our money. According to typology, whatever is heaved to God becomes a type of the ascended Christ. For example, suppose a particular heave offering consisted of one hundred goats. These goats, which were heaved up to the heavens, became a type of Christ in ascension. Today, we, the children of God, should also offer some of the things God has given us. When we offer these things, we heave them up, lifting them up to the heavens. What we offer in this way becomes the ascended Christ. </p>

Eventually, all the tents he made became Christ, because he did not make them for himself but for Christ. All the tents made by Paul were heaved up to the heavens; hence, they all became Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="_hRt6BaEalb59wfF8M4rPdE10kUpSheCpOP0cpOmV8IJSJlfGzEGzh_y08rbJRoeV"> The principle should be the same with us today. No matter what our profession or occupation may be, in actuality we should not be handling the things related to our work; rather, we should be handling Christ all the time. Whether or not this is our situation depends on a basic factor—working at <span class="pg" data-page-id="199" id="199">[199]</span> our profession or occupation for Christ and not for ourselves. If we do our work for Christ, then what we offer to God will become a heave offering. It will become something of Christ heaved up to the heavens. </p>
<p data-content-id="Br6Kg7546HFKM2GARtGppBLaEDTJvJXn1XnlscnO9mIErIt9z5oiyXgJPhz_m6igQ"> What are we Christians doing on earth? What is our center? The ark was the center of the children of Israel. According to typology, this indicates that our center should be Christ. The type further indicates that we should handle Christ as the ark and as all the contents of the tabernacle, and we should also handle His cross. Then whatever we do, we will work for Christ and handle Christ. This will become the factor, the cause, the element, and the essence of our living on earth, and it will cause our living to be absolutely Christ. Then whatever we give to the Lord will be heaved up to Him and will become Christ. </p>

However, before I come to this matter, I would like to say a word about the way the book of Numbers is sectioned. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1dF6aJscO4mjEVXwfZzqsulbz9KXAM-f35W2Fgo9MGMHdxxaD2W6l_abXuvSctvM"> The first section (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41168" data-verses="Numbers 1:1">1:1—9:14</span>) shows the formation of the children of Israel into an army. From <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41169" data-verses="Numbers 9:15">9:15</span> they began as the army to set out on their journey. They traveled only a little more than three days before the troubles, turmoils, and rebellions came in. These things began to take place in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41170" data-verses="Numbers 11:1">chapter eleven</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="JURneMwwUjjCukjzuls4544aL8BXJw4OHc1FWynSIUK5iiWwT0Qsz8EketofHftLD"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41171" data-verses="Numbers 11:1">Chapters eleven through fourteen</span> form one group, in which we see four aspects of rebellion. First, the people on the border, on the edge, of the camp murmured evil against God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41172" data-verses="Numbers 11:1-3">11:1-3</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41173" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:2">Deut. 8:2</span>). Second, the mixed multitude, those who were not clear about their status and family, lusted according to their fleshly desires (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41174" data-verses="Numbers 11:4-35">Num. 11:4-35</span>). Third, Miriam and Aaron, who were very close to Moses and in the center of the administration, rebelled (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41175" data-verses="Numbers 12:1-16">12:1-16</span>). Fourth, the children of Israel were unbelieving concerning entering into the good land. That was a rebellion out of the unbelief of a fleshly people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41176" data-verses="Numbers 13:1">13:1—14:38</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="zlDFwvjlbRNSVPZMsJoAPrY-_94Ul9T_qTJ0b8-Djp239rcyY1bn_iJnFc_BwAY5_"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41177" data-verses="Numbers 15:1">Chapter fifteen</span> is an insertion in which ordinances were given in three directions: concerning God’s provision of different offerings, which are aspects of Christ; concerning the keeping of the Sabbath, which is to receive what God has done for us; and concerning the people’s dress, which signifies <span class="pg" data-page-id="202" id="202">[202]</span> that our living should have some beauty and that our conduct should be under a heavenly ruling. </p>
<p data-content-id="Se-6za1KSJE4D3ovoN73z069lAHOfZxM7ef9Yu5iYbmakYgNBSFmwp3_76eSfWWkE"> Immediately after the three ordinances were given, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41178" data-verses="Numbers 16:1">chapter sixteen</span> a nationwide, universal, popular rebellion occurred. Two hundred fifty of the top leaders and well-known men from among the children of Israel rebelled to such an extent that there is no word to describe it. In the whole Bible we cannot see another occasion where God was so angry with man that He judged the leaders of the rebellion by causing the earth to open its mouth and swallow them up with their families and possessions. </p>
<p data-content-id="gVK3NAkEMwsZE8Q-ot7YGJ-dIglfbM5Uya85eCH9oZZY7jOOGPbB82gui7YdXn6-O"> It is noteworthy that some of the children of Korah did not join the rebellion. Rather, they departed from it. Eventually, Samuel, a descendant of Korah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41179" data-verses="1Chronicles 6:33-37">1 Chron. 6:33-37</span>), became a great prophet and a Nazarite priest. Samuel’s grandson, Heman, became a psalmist and a holy singer in God’s temple under the Levitical service arranged by David. </p>
<p data-content-id="ezw1IvP5hJlLyGzJuXCMxdyQr6wUre2non4KkPYaTfhE1FqPcM2yCoPnLNpUj9vS2"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41180" data-verses="Numbers 17:1">Chapter seventeen</span> records that at the end of that vast, terrible rebellion, God vindicated Aaron by the resurrected Christ in His resurrection power. This power was displayed in a dead and dried up piece of wood that budded, blossomed, and bore fruit, even unto maturity. </p>
<p data-content-id="56Tr4kCk5lYCc-MpfN0cmdWVqY0NGnXmAb1tHSRy7tzGpsD_p3ykJtYvDxOHS7R3k"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41181" data-verses="Numbers 18:1">Chapters eighteen and nineteen</span> are another insertion. Apparently <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41182" data-verses="Numbers 18:1">chapter eighteen</span> is a regulation that reconfirms the compensation, or reward, given to the Aaronic priesthood and the Levitical service to the priesthood. Actually it is a strong vindication added to the previous vindication, the budding rod. </p>
<p data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37ChSwbUVF8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e"> Because a company of the Levites had rebelled against the priests, the people became confused. Thus, after the turmoil, God reconfirmed the priesthood. God had already confirmed the priesthood in the books of Exodus and Leviticus. Now, in Numbers, God reconfirmed the reward to the priesthood and the Levitical service. This was a strong vindication against the rebellion. </p>
<p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5Fnmjgkbvb37sgQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41183" data-verses="Numbers 18:1">chapters eighteen and nineteen</span> in a superficial way, we will not be able to appreciate the background and atmosphere that remained after the rebellion. A particular kind of atmosphere was created among the children of Israel <span class="pg" data-page-id="203" id="203">[203]</span> toward the priests and the Levites. Both had nothing as an inheritance to live on. They lived solely on what the children of Israel would give them in the way of tithes. The practice was that the people gave tithes to the Levites, the Levites in turn gave tithes to the priests, and the priests then offered something to God. This means that the priests, the Levites, and even God Himself lived on the mercy of the children of Israel. The Levites lived on the giving of the sons of Israel; the priests lived on the giving of the Levites; and God lived on the giving of the priests, the Levites, and the sons of Israel. If the people had refused to give, all three—the Levites, the priests, and God Himself—would have had nothing to eat. Therefore, at this juncture God came in to reconfirm His reward to the priests and to all the serving ones of the priesthood. This became a covenant, a perpetual statute, for the children of Israel to keep throughout their generations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41184" data-verses="Numbers 18:11">18:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41185" data-verses="Numbers 18:19">19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41186" data-verses="Numbers 18:23">23</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk0v7Evk5hK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D">VII. THE WATER FOR IMPURITY</h2><p data-content-id="UdegCvQnXR5xgUhUaUGVdC_jmfK-Cu7dqw2JPQOIsoKn_Y8dqhxtHLn_1Zya9Y6Px"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41187" data-verses="Numbers 19:1">Chapter nineteen</span> of Numbers is a very peculiar chapter in the Bible. It is not easy to understand why this chapter is here. In this chapter a heifer is burned with other items, and the ashes are used to make a water for impurity. By reading the whole chapter we can understand that the impurity, the uncleanness, refers mainly to the filthiness of death. This water is a provision to get rid of the effect and impurity of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="MNYPxEBRKCjGvjYcSm_-z5W62lDZBONkc_BXexp5aMeJNuq4a-EbRUgKX-x3mauLs"> Immediately after the rebellion in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41188" data-verses="Numbers 16:1">chapter sixteen</span>, death was everywhere. In one day fourteen thousand seven hundred people died, and their carcasses lay everywhere. In many of the tents in the camp, there were dead bodies. A man became contaminated by touching a dead body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41189" data-verses="Numbers 19:11">19:11</span>), by being present when a person died (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41190" data-verses="Numbers 19:18">v. 18</span>), or by entering the tent where a dead body had been (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41191" data-verses="Numbers 19:14">v. 14</span>). The entire population of two million Israelites was under the effect of death. They were all in a situation of impurity. Thus, there was the need for the water for impurity to annul the effect and impurity of death. </p>
<p data-content-id="VBaATaFwkk1R2p-lJIa9c8ouZmOY975Xa5FmEubBdBBuFAyJhWAJhBvAZCseteqbq"> Probably, in Exodus and Leviticus God did not have the thought concerning the water for impurity, because in those <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> times there was not such a popular, universal death as in Numbers. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41192" data-verses="Numbers 19:1">Numbers 19</span> death overshadowed the entire people of God. After the death of the fourteen thousand seven hundred, virtually all the tents and every vessel in the tents became contaminated. Wherever anyone went or whatever he touched, he became unclean. </p>
<p data-content-id="i-M7ojiJqGoJd-LWYW0HxMNKQKoEy22u_R9o2QysidURajdNowaOAucBwqV_zFWnD"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41193" data-verses="Numbers 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>, the budding rod was a vindication of the priesthood. Then, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41194" data-verses="Numbers 18:1">chapter eighteen</span>, the regulations were restated as a reconfirmation of the compensation to the priests and the Levites so that the problem would be settled forever. Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41195" data-verses="Numbers 19:1">chapter nineteen</span>, the water for impurity was invented to deal with the universal effect of death among God’s people. </p>

While the children of Israel were journeying in the wilderness, the shortage of water was a great problem. The people numbered more than two million, and they had a great many cattle. Finding water for all these people and their cattle was a serious problem. Because there was no water for the assembly, the people “gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41228" data-verses="Numbers 20:2">v. 2</span>). </p>

The rock typifies Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41235" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Cor. 10:4b</span>), and the water typifies the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41236" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Cor. 10:4a</span>). </p>

Moses Taking the Rod,<br/>Calling the People Rebels,<br/>and Striking the Rock with His Rod Twice,<br/>and Water Coming Out Abundantly</h2><p data-content-id="yogGGgbIJieS7MU0cVjERzTlNwPQCcAm9w46WVr1gAb6TJLAvX8-z2ryALdGL70w9"> Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, and he and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41237" data-verses="Numbers 20:9-10">Num. 20:9-10a</span>). Then Moses said to the people, “Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41238" data-verses="Numbers 20:10">v. 10b</span>). Having said this, “Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice; and water came forth <span class="pg" data-page-id="211" id="211">[211]</span> abundantly, and the assembly drank, and their cattle” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41239" data-verses="Numbers 20:11">v. 11</span>). Moses was wrong both in word and in deed. No doubt, he was angry with the children of Israel, and he even might have lost his temper. Whenever we are angry and do not control ourselves, it is easy for us to make mistakes. At such times we, like Moses, may speak wrongly or act wrongly. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Nao4cbRs9AiSNlXRQNA8wIb1F-PfC6ZUe2gLXackKJJ2QeSyCCiLybrCyWPJHWD_"> The Bible tells us that Moses was “very meek, more than all men who were on the face of the earth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41240" data-verses="Numbers 12:3">12:3</span>). A real man of God, Moses fell on his face before God, not saying anything. He had truly learned of God. Nevertheless, such a meek person became angry at the children of Israel. God had told him to take the rod and speak to the rock that it may yield its water. Moses could have gathered the congregation together before the rock and said, “Praise the Lord! He is good and He is gracious. He surely takes care of us. You need water, and He will supply water. We only need to speak to the rock, and the water will flow forth.” How wonderful it would have been if Moses had spoken in this way! However, in his anger Moses said to the people, “You rebels.” Moses did not dare to say anything to God, but when he came from the presence of God to the people, he spoke angrily to them. Then he struck the rock twice with his rod. It was not necessary for him to strike the rock once, much less twice. The rock had already been struck in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41241" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">Exodus 17</span>, and God did not tell Moses to strike it again. Rather, God told Moses simply to speak to the rock. Although Moses was a faithful servant of God, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41242" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> he made a mistake which caused him to lose his right to enter into the promised good land. </p>

God Supplying the Israelites<br/>with Manna and Water to Meet Their Proper Need,<br/>without Any Punishment, but Supplying Them<br/>with Quails to Satisfy Their Lusting after<br/>the Flesh, as a Punishment</h2><p data-content-id="7yTIaBOhlCkC6wnzpdOnj7_83Su4cU6JN5dp73tdKZs9iz_xB3_gpvjWsQcHJJNa-"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41243" data-verses="Exodus 16:14-18">Exodus 16:14-18</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41244" data-verses="Exodus 17:5-6">17:5-6</span>, God supplied the Israelites with manna and water to meet their proper need, without any punishment. But in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41245" data-verses="Numbers 11:1">Numbers 11</span> He supplied them with quails to satisfy their lusting after the flesh, as a punishment (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41246" data-verses="Numbers 11:4">vv. 4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41247" data-verses="Numbers 11:18-20">18-20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41248" data-verses="Numbers 11:31-34">31-34</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41249" data-verses="Exodus 16:1-2">Exodus 16 and 17</span> God was not angry <span class="pg" data-page-id="212" id="212">[212]</span> with the people. When they needed food, He sent manna, for food is a necessity. Likewise, when they needed water, another necessity, He gladly supplied them with living water from the smitten rock. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41250" data-verses="Numbers 11:1">Numbers 11</span> the people were lusting after the flesh. Because this was not a matter of necessity, He was angry with them and, in His anger and as a judgment, He supplied them with quails. Can you differentiate these two kinds of situations? When the children of Israel caused God trouble concerning necessities, He was not offended, but when they lusted, He was offended. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41251" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> the people contended because they did not have water. Because water was a necessity, God was not angry with them. Actually, it was His responsibility to supply them with water. </p>

Moses Failing to Sanctify God<br/>in Being Angry with the People of Israel<br/>and in Wrongly Striking the Rock Twice</h2><p data-content-id="Br6Kg7546HFKM2GARtGppCraFDzJvJXn1XnlscnO9mIErIt9z5oiyXgJPhz_m6igQ"> Moses failed to sanctify God in being angry with the people of Israel and in wrongly striking the rock twice. In being angry, he did not represent God rightly in His holy nature toward His people. In striking the rock twice, he represented God wrongly in God’s action. Hence, he and his brother were punished by God by not being allowed to enter into the good land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41252" data-verses="Numbers 20:12-13">20:12-13</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41253" data-verses="Numbers 20:24">24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41254" data-verses="Numbers 27:12-14">27:12-14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="x30XFBmjVsgxZ2D79gWqW2iKF79dU6xfKVe4jISiWv2y8vVsZC3Hniqu3S7FO7vNY"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41255" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> God was not angry with the people, but Moses was angry with them. He went to God and appealed to Him, but he did not dare to say anything. In this matter Moses was right, for we should not pray when we are angry. Concerning this, we need to remember how Elijah prayed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41256" data-verses="1Kings 19:14">1 Kings 19:14</span>. In his prayer Elijah said, “I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.” Referring to this prayer, Paul said that Elijah was pleading with God against Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41257" data-verses="Romans 11:2">Rom. 11:2</span>). Elijah’s pleading was actually his accusing the people. From the case of Moses in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41258" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="213" id="213">[213]</span> case of Elijah in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41259" data-verses="1Kings 19:1">1 Kings 19</span>, we learn that we should be careful whenever we pray to God concerning His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="rUqekoRmFH5ko70ziWtSc1va8a5EL8JopHkKJur0RBOu5pxUAN_84W9dRCflBtDXA"> “Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41260" data-verses="Numbers 20:12">20:12</span>). God blamed Moses and Aaron for not believing in Him and for not sanctifying Him before the people. Because he was angry when God was not angry, Moses did not rightly represent God. In his anger, Moses might have thought that the time had come for God to consume the people. God, however, realized that the problem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41261" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> was caused by the people’s thirst. Just as a mother is not angry with a child who cries because of thirst but instead cherishes the child, so God was not angry with His thirsty people but rather assumed the responsibility of supplying them with water. </p>

<p data-content-id="4MK-wePHgeEAEGgR-z7X2Mu1mjxZhE7RGIluVa5oEpcHV3stVAVn4-Tc5CTQh0iYn"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41296" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">chapter twenty</span> of Numbers there are two lines: the line of life and the line of the types. In this message I would like to give a word concerning the types. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="owSxjcqeZRVmxEIS3OihFHfs0YVdhdw0vmgvUEemAnltodyTzv6yHvYP90yMUcQyG">7. The Significance of the Types</h2><p data-content-id="3Y75k2O-GWhqOrdtGMwxU2Y6KAats6BF3Ik8Rqg0fOcYDaq8QCBZ97FKiVycD9iDM"> According to the typology in this portion of the Word, water signifies the Spirit of life, or the life in the Spirit. Since the divine life and the divine Spirit are one, the water here signifies both life and the Spirit. The problem in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41297" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> was due to the lack of the Spirit of life. This indicates that whenever God’s people are short of the Spirit of life, they will have trouble. Most of the problems in the church life are caused by the shortage of the Spirit of life. If we have such a shortage, we will either blame others or contend with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="GH2P9Y3tWVo3vwOnM-tmBAnhYWLUq0bMbEZhDa4imkkh08ueAdWa3Wq1nnlLdF8Wv"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41298" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> we are shown the way to receive the Spirit of life. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41299" data-verses="Numbers 20:8">verse 8</span> God said to Moses, “Take the rod, and gather the assembly, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes that it may yield its water.” God’s word to Moses indicates that we need to apply the death of Christ to our present situation. To “take the rod” is to apply the death of Christ to ourselves. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41300" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">Exodus 17</span> the rod was used to smite, to strike, the rock. There, the rod was in the hand of Moses, who represented the law. Christ was smitten by the law; He was cleft in order that the Spirit of life might flow out of Him. Since the rock had already been smitten in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41301" data-verses="Exodus 17:1">Exodus 17</span>, there was no need for it to be smitten again in <span class="pg" data-page-id="222" id="222">[222]</span> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41302" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span>. Christ, typified by the rock, should be crucified only once. In striking the rock a second time, Moses made a serious mistake. This act was against God’s economy. In God’s economy Christ should not be crucified more than once. </p>
<p data-content-id="MNYPxEBRKCjGvjYcSm_-y7W62nDZBONkc_BXexp5aMeJNuq4a-EbRUgKX-x3mauLs"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41303" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span> Paul, speaking of the children of Israel, says, “They drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.” This reveals that Christ has been crucified to become the rock which follows His people. We may say that He is the “following rock.” This means that He is the life-giving Spirit, who is always with us to supply us with the water of life. Christ was crucified under the rod of the law, and now He is the following rock, the life-giving Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="VBaATaFwkk1R2p-lJIa9d-ouZkOY975Xa5FmEubBdBBuFAyJhWAJhBvAZCseteqbq"> In order to meet our need for the Spirit of life, we should not ask Christ to be crucified again for us. We should simply take up the rod; that is, we should apply Christ’s death to our situation. When we do this, we will experience the crucified Christ, the Christ who is emphatically presented by Paul in 1 Corinthians. For instance, in this epistle Paul says, “I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41304" data-verses="1Corinthians 2:2">1 Cor. 2:2</span>). Paul’s word indicates that he took the rod, the death of Christ, and applied it to the Corinthians so that through Christ’s death they could receive the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="i-M7ojiJqGoJd-LWYW0HwONKTKIEy22u_R9o2QysidURajdNowaOAucBwqV_zFWnD"> Now that the Spirit has been given, there is no need for Christ to be crucified again that the living water may flow forth. To have the living water, we simply need to take the rod and apply it to our situation today. We also need to speak to the rock. Speaking to the rock is a matter of believing. Furthermore, speaking to the rock indicates that we have prayed, not in the way of begging but in the way of believing that the Spirit has already been given. </p>
<p data-content-id="1q83V7kEkTSAS8FhlVDsnwzbJR03QFqsrqbsu0A6Y9sDz6OYDLPkVWCpO4FO6tj8_"> Through the crucifixion of Christ living water has flowed out of Christ. This is clearly revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41305" data-verses="John 19:34">John 19:34</span>. “One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.” Today we need only to speak to the rock, and the water will flow again from the rock. We may say, “Praise the Lord that the Spirit is here!” This is to speak to the rock that the water may flow into us to <span class="pg" data-page-id="223" id="223">[223]</span> be our supply. This is the way to apply the death of Christ to our situation that we may have the Spirit of life. </p>
<p data-content-id="9E0RwvkihCfbWu-ZTtqacOSujC4N7t73TIeHLchn3Izflx0InPBI1FJa49wKFpuwV"> In our hymnal there is an excellent hymn with deep spiritual significance on the relationship between the cross and the Spirit (<em>Hymns,</em> #279). Stanza four of this hymn says that we must go through the Jordan before we can be anointed from above, that we must be baptized in death before we can experience the Dove. Here Jordan signifies death, and the Dove signifies the Spirit. If we pass through the river of death, we will receive the living Dove. </p>
<p data-content-id="jgnwUAKnb3LF-rKF2so0seai2gPYdu4JVjXaJif78hdaEK0IAPD6KUO8RgekuaJZh"> The problems in the church life are solved when we have an abundance of the Spirit of life. The problems between us and others and between us and God are due to our shortage of the Spirit of life. The reason we are short of the Spirit of life is that we are lacking in applying the death of Christ to our present situation. If most of the saints in a local church do not apply the death of Christ, that church will have many problems. But if we apply the death of Christ to ourselves, this application will bring in the living water to supply our need and solve our problems. Then, with our need supplied and our problems solved, we will live a victorious life in the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="THD-di8wGJMlaO716gw-DhC1kSEcoQbV18U2QgihgQryXjW6mpyEGOcguhQaI5k-h"> At this point I would like to say a further word concerning God’s holiness and fairness in taking care of the necessities of His people. When God’s people were contending for their necessities, God was not offended but was fair in taking care of these necessities. But when the people were lusting according to the flesh, God was angry with them. We may compare Him to a nourishing mother who sympathizes with the needs of her child. When her child cries out for milk, she will be sympathetic toward the child, cherish him, and supply milk to make him happy. This does not mean, however, that she loves her child blindly and does not discipline him when he is naughty. Concerning certain things the mother will cherish her child, but concerning other things she will discipline him. </p>
<p data-content-id="nM8Y5Wz2ywg4CN1_6gtQCkvY7Zh-LgKssqMiyD-dakeNC6drN0cRYEQTJ7y6zXvtD"> A mother’s care for her child is an illustration of what God is in His nature. It is God’s nature to be fair. When His people were contending for food, He was not angry with them but <span class="pg" data-page-id="224" id="224">[224]</span> supplied them with manna. When they were contending for water, He was likewise not angry with them but supplied them with water. However, when they were contending according to their lust, He punished them. </p>
<p data-content-id="6EZ7oiut5G7ZYj3fVU9kXEYzOeXLkv2-BMvHT6O93qKj4EGth2ACU0vty01b6A_6D"> God is not only fair but also rich and bountiful. In his anger with the children of Israel, Moses surely did not remember that God is bountiful and that He can supply His people’s need under any circumstances. Whether or not there is rain or water, He can satisfy the desperate need of His people for water. </p>
<p data-content-id="R2qYnpqtRGomTlcXmAAHyP08F39Q7C-wTRkJI_Sw9RV5N2W8gemugfOv9FQXr9QVG"> God is fair, rich, bountiful, loving, kind, and gracious. In order to serve Him, we must know Him in all these aspects. Because He is fair, bountiful, and gracious, He has no problems with His people when they contend for food and water. Since He is not angry with His people when they contend for their necessities, those who serve Him should likewise not be angry with them in such a situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="sagbDhA7pAxvKgcwYTawS7bsJhcCNiozwYjsNXQN0-DGbiFNnmUF8HY7mxgZVUtzf"> Serving God involves caring for God’s people. Therefore, it is not sufficient for us simply to be right with God; we must also be right in our attitude toward God’s people. Our attitude toward God’s people should be according to God’s nature. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41306" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> Moses should have had such an attitude toward the children of Israel. He should have realized that the people were in need of water. He should have also considered that since water is a necessity, God in His fairness would not be angry with His people but would instead supply them with water. They were not contending for their lust—they were contending for their need. In this matter Moses should have had regard for God’s nature and should not have cared for his own feeling. Because Moses cared for his feeling and not for God’s nature, he was offended and became angry. God, however, did not have a problem with His people on this occasion. In contrast to Moses, who was angry, God was fair, bountiful, and loving. </p>

These matters are treasures, and we need to have the insight to see their preciousness. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41319" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> shows us the divine way to receive the divine supply, the way to receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit. In the New Testament we do not have a chapter that reveals as clearly as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41320" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> the way to receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit.

Both chapters speak of the people’s contending. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41324" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> the children of Israel were contending for water. This contending was fair because it came from the people’s thirst. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41325" data-verses="Numbers 21:1">Numbers 21</span> the children contended again, but this time their contending was not fair, because it came from the people’s impatience.

<p data-content-id="8Nao4cbRs9AiSNlXRQNA9yIb1H-PfC6ZUe2gLXackKJJ2QeSyCCiLybrCyWPJHWD_"> God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt and had brought them into the wilderness, where the way was rough and very difficult. “The soul of the people became impatient because of the way” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41328" data-verses="Numbers 21:4">21:4b</span>). The way was harsh, and their patience was exhausted. In their impatience they “spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread and no water, and we loathe this contemptible bread” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41329" data-verses="Numbers 21:5">v. 5</span>). From God’s point of view, this contending, unlike the contending for water, was not fair. God had not promised that the way through the wilderness would be easy. They should have anticipated a difficult journey. Therefore, God was not happy with them and He punished them. </p>

So Moses made a bronze serpent, and set it on a pole; and if a serpent bit any man, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41334" data-verses="Numbers 21:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>). This bronze serpent typifies Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41335" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span>), and the pole typifies the cross (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41336" data-verses="1Peter 2:24">1 Pet. 2:24</span>). In typology bronze, or brass, signifies judgment. The Hebrew word translated “looked at” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41337" data-verses="Numbers 21:9">Numbers 21:9</span> may also be rendered “regarded,” or “looked intently at.” </p>
<p data-content-id="d38X8EOiMEk9dP_79EmbnyyR672Qg--9-XB3OqGiYKF1sxI6uIKUnB4ChkhxSbG8O"> The bronze serpent is a type, and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41338" data-verses="John 3:14">John 3:14</span> the Lord Jesus applies this type to Himself. “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” The bronze serpent had the form of a serpent but not the poisonous nature of a serpent. This is a full type of Christ coming in the likeness of the flesh of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41339" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Rom. 8:3</span>) to be our replacement. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41340" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20</span> we have a type of Christ as the crucified and resurrected One flowing out the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, but in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41341" data-verses="Numbers 21:1">Numbers 21</span> we have a type of Christ as our replacement and substitute. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMNNHzC1cNpRTwWtut-WjyUPZsqv1v75JSKuO1jimhfuoO5aaxSFW4a02nXRm6WnV"> When the children of Israel were bitten by the fiery serpents, they became serpents in the eyes of God. They were serpentine and had the serpentine nature. The bronze serpent, however, had only the form of a serpent but not the nature of a serpent. Therefore, the bronze serpent could be a type of Christ, who had the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin but not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin. The bronze serpent was put on a pole, which signifies the cross. Thus, in the wilderness there was a bronze serpent on a pole, portraying, in type, a replacement on a cross. The bronze serpent on the pole indicated that the children of Israel, who had become serpentine, were put on the pole where they were replaced by something that had the form but not the nature of a serpent. </p>
<p data-content-id="KczBxhEn9SA44FFZSVMXvfoJhB6h8ghOy5WWYqtP7LFq_5eOHT5zjQ8Bhcb9oDTxH"> Long after <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41342" data-verses="Numbers 21:1">Numbers 21</span> was written, Christ came, and in <span class="pg" data-page-id="232" id="232">[232]</span> His conversation with Nicodemus He referred to the type of the bronze serpent. The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to him, “Nicodemus, the picture of the bronze serpent on a pole signifies what I will be for you. That serpent was the replacement of your forefathers so that they could be saved from death and have life. I will do the same for you. I will die on the cross as your replacement so that you may have eternal life.” </p>
<p data-content-id="lGJMqXpxLr00FAOi_3oq91bbvm9yiel3q9IrhyEOb-mti2DuXEIULfVfV-8aXxhkd"> At the time the Lord Jesus spoke this word to Nicodemus, it is not likely that he understood it. Nicodemus surely did not regard himself as a serpent but as an ethical gentleman who came to the Lord Jesus for the purpose of receiving teachings about his behavior. However, in His word concerning the bronze serpent, the Lord Jesus appeared to be saying to Nicodemus, “You should not consider yourself a gentleman but realize instead that you are a serpent. You became a serpent when in the garden Adam was bitten by the serpent. Because you have a serpentine nature, I have come not to teach you but to be your replacement. In the eyes of God, you are a serpent. As your replacement, I will be lifted up in the form of a serpent.” It is a great blessing for us to know that, as the fulfillment of the type of the bronze serpent, Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin to die on the cross as our replacement and substitute. </p>
<p data-content-id="OZSjkV5USBSK_MP1WUozGm3Lu2VuazrsJs9t6GIBcxwgHMpXkI44nN0BaekRScDuy"> When Adam was bitten by the serpent, we all became serpents. Christ has come to be our replacement, and we have believed into Him. At this point we need to ask an interesting question: Are we who believe in Christ still serpents? The answer to this question depends on whether, in our experience, we are in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41343" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span>, which speaks of the bronze serpent, or in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41344" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span>, which speaks of coming to the Lord and drinking (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41345" data-verses="John 7:37-39">vv. 37-39</span>). If we are drinking of the living water, then we are no longer serpents. But if we are short of the living water, then we are contending serpents. </p>
<p data-content-id="4MK-wePHgeEAEGgR-z7X2M-1ixxZhE7RGIluVa5oEpcHV3stVAVn4-Tc5CTQh0iYn"> Christ today is no longer the bronze serpent—He is the life-giving Spirit. The One who died for us on the cross in the form of a serpent, in the likeness of the flesh of sin, has passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41346" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). This means that He has <span class="pg" data-page-id="233" id="233">[233]</span> changed His form. When He died on the cross, as indicated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41347" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span>, He was in the form of a serpent, but when He came back to His disciples, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41348" data-verses="John 20:1">John 20</span>, He was the life-giving Spirit. What kind of Christ is He to you today? Is He a bronze serpent or the life-giving Spirit? </p>
<p data-content-id="owSxjcqeZRVmxEIS3OihFHPsxKFdhdw0vmgvUEemAnltodyTzv6yHvYP90yMUcQyG"> As a believer in Christ, are you still a serpent? The answer depends on whether you are dry, lacking the life-giving Spirit, or are drinking of the Spirit. Apart from the life-giving Spirit, we are contending serpents. In the church life we may be either contending serpents or life-giving-Spirit drinkers. May we all be those who drink of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit! </p>

These kings were gate guards of the good land; their territory was east of the Jordan. In order for the children of Israel to enter into the good land, they had to pass through the territory controlled by these kings who were guarding the land of Canaan for Satan. These kings, therefore, were gate guards of the kingdom of darkness, and they had to be defeated before the children of Israel could enter into the land usurped and occupied by Satan. </p>
<p data-content-id="THD-di8wGJMlaO716gw-Dhi1tBEcoQbV18U2QgihgQryXjW6mpyEGOcguhQaI5k-h"> What does Canaan signify in typology? A common, shallow understanding is that Canaan signifies heaven. Certain hymns speak of crossing “the cold waves of Jordan” on the way to heaven. This understanding of the spiritual significance of Canaan surely is not accurate. In the land of Canaan there were all kinds of enemies. If Canaan signifies heaven, this would mean that there are enemies in heaven. If this were the situation, heaven would not be a pleasant place, and no one would want to go there. </p>
<p data-content-id="nM8Y5Wz2ywg4CN1_6gtQCkPYzKx-LgKssqMiyD-dakeNC6drN0cRYEQTJ7y6zXvtD"> In typology, Canaan signifies the aerial part, the heavenly part, of the dark kingdom of Satan. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41373" data-verses="Matthew 12:26">Matthew 12:26</span> indicates that Satan has a kingdom. As the ruler of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41374" data-verses="John 12:31">John 12:31</span>) and as the ruler of the authority of the air (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41375" data-verses="Ephesians 2:2">Eph. 2:2</span>), Satan has his authority (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41376" data-verses="Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span>) and his angels (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41377" data-verses="Matthew 25:41">Matt. 25:41</span>), who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, <span class="pg" data-page-id="240" id="240">[240]</span> and rulers of the darkness of this world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41378" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>). Hence, he has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41379" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Col. 1:13</span>). Satan and his kingdom are at war, at enmity, with God and His kingdom. Formerly, we were in the kingdom of Satan, but God’s salvation has brought us out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of God’s love (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41380" data-verses="Colossians 1:13">Col. 1:13</span>). Now we are no longer in the kingdom of Satan but are in the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="6EZ7oiut5G7ZYj3fVU9kXE4zOcXLkv2-BMvHT6O93qKj4EGth2ACU0vty01b6A_6D"> The point we would emphasize here is that Canaan does not signify heaven in a positive sense; on the contrary, Canaan typifies the main part, the leading part, the aerial part, of Satan’s kingdom, with its authorities and rulers. In typology, the giants in the land of Canaan signify the evil angels, the rebellious angels who follow Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41381" data-verses="Revelation 12:4">Rev. 12:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41382" data-verses="Revelation 12:7">7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="R2qYnpqtRGomTlcXmAAHyPU8F19Q7C-wTRkJI_Sw9RV5N2W8gemugfOv9FQXr9QVG"> During the past twenty-five years, we have stressed the fact that Canaan, the good land, is a type of Christ. Now we are saying that Canaan is a type of the kingdom of Satan, with its evil spirits. This may seem contradictory, but actually it is not. If we study the typology carefully, we will see that Canaan has two features. On the one hand, Canaan is a land of riches, as revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41383" data-verses="Deuteronomy 8:1">Deuteronomy 8</span>. Using this portion of the Word as the basis, we released the messages that have been printed in the book <em>The All-inclusive Christ.</em> On the other hand, Canaan was a land full of evil persons and enemies, all of whom were to be eradicated by the children of Israel. This feature, or aspect, of Canaan signifies the most evil part of Satan’s dark kingdom. As we consider these two features of Canaan, we see that whether or not we can enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive land depends on whether or not we defeat the enemies typified by the Canaanites. This indicates that the church as a whole, including all the members, should engage in the spiritual warfare revealed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41384" data-verses="Ephesians 6:1">Ephesians 6</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="sagbDhA7pAxvKgcwYTawS77sKh8CNiozwYjsNXQN0-DGbiFNnmUF8HY7mxgZVUtzf"> Ephesians is a book on the all-inclusive Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41385" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> tells us that the riches of Christ are untraceable. In order to enjoy such a Christ, we need to fight against the spiritual enemies, against “the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41386" data-verses="Ephesians 6:12">Eph. 6:12</span>). We must defeat and crush the enemies signified by the king of Arad, Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king <span class="pg" data-page-id="241" id="241">[241]</span> of Bashan. We all need to keep in mind that the Canaanites typify the fallen angels, who have become the powers, rulers, and authorities in Satan’s kingdom, and that a war is raging between these evil spirits and the church. The typology in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41387" data-verses="Numbers 21:1">Numbers 21</span> shows us how to fight in this war. The slaughtering of the gate guards in this chapter indicates our need to defeat the evil spirits in the kingdom of Satan. It is helpful to have this view as we now consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41388" data-verses="Numbers 21:1-3">21:1-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41389" data-verses="Numbers 21:21-35">21-35</span>. </p>

This portrays an aspect of the history of the church. Some saints in the church have been taken captive by the evil spirits. </p>

Israel vowed to destroy not only the people of Arad but also their cities. This indicates that we need to fight against the evil spirits, defeat them, and take over their territory. We need to exercise our Christ-given authority over the aerial powers. </p>

This portrays something that actually may take place in the spiritual realm. We may speak to the evil spirits, asking them to give us a way through their territory, but this stirs them to fight against us. </p>

This indicates that after we engage in spiritual warfare against the evil spirits, part of the territory of Satan in the air becomes ours. Throughout <span class="pg" data-page-id="243" id="243">[243]</span> the centuries, some of the saints have fought in such a way against the evil powers in the air. </p>

Bashan, which is mentioned several times in the Psalms, is a mountain standing in opposition to God’s dwelling place. Thus, Bashan is a type of the satanic authority in the air. </p>

In this message we will consider the matter of Balak’s evil intention (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41408" data-verses="Numbers 22:1-40">22:1-40</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="FRSfve2gXKF2q5U8QMttVfIQa_Ak8O0qwdoGc_QmQ-eQ8kJW69ciA8zsBiJhZIN53">A. Balak’s Evil Intention</h2><p data-content-id="Cmeet7LFEwA83Buuyy4WmpAGXwrqBpX55w_jk3kONkrrJH7N7b1Pyn3Qqcfwcq2SE"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41409" data-verses="Numbers 22:1">Numbers 22</span> the enemy changed not only his way of fighting but also his mode of fighting. At first, in Exodus, Satan used the Egyptian army to frustrate the children of Israel. When they were about to cross the Red Sea, the Egyptians were right behind them. Later, in the wilderness, God’s people had to fight against Amalek (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41410" data-verses="Exodus 17:8-16">Exo. 17:8-16</span>). As we saw in the last message, the Israelites also fought and defeated the kings of Arad, the Amorites, and Bashan, destroying their cities and taking possession of their land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41411" data-verses="Numbers 21:1-3">Num. 21:1-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41412" data-verses="Numbers 21:21-35">21-35</span>). After defeating these three kings, the children of Israel were ready to cross the Jordan and enter into the good land. The enemy, therefore, changed his mode of fighting against Israel. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="QMNNHzC1cNpRTwWtut-Wjy0PZuqv1v75JSKuO1jimhfuoO5aaxSFW4a02nXRm6WnV">1. Balak, the King of Moab,<br/>Joining with Midian, and They Sending<br/>Their Elders to Induce Balaam to Come and<br/>Curse Israel for Them</h2><p data-content-id="KczBxhEn9SA44FFZSVMXvfIJhD6h8ghOy5WWYqtP7LFq_5eOHT5zjQ8Bhcb9oDTxH"> “Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. And Moab was very afraid of the people, <span class="pg" data-page-id="246" id="246">[246]</span> because they were many; and Moab was distressed because of the sons of Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41413" data-verses="Numbers 22:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>). Balak, the king of Moab, was terrified by the children of Israel and their victories. He was afraid that they would defeat him and take over his territory. “Moab said to the elders of Midian, This congregation will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41414" data-verses="Numbers 22:4">v. 4a</span>). Balak seemed to be saying, “This mighty people will devour me and my land. What can I do to fight against them?” Realizing that he could not defeat Israel militarily or politically, Balak decided to take the religious way. </p>
<p data-content-id="lGJMqXpxLr00FAOi_3oq917bsmdyiel3q9IrhyEOb-mti2DuXEIULfVfV-8aXxhkd"> As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41415" data-verses="Numbers 22:1">Numbers 22</span> indicates, the religious way is linked to both Moab and Midian. Moab was a son born of Lot and one of his daughters through incest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41416" data-verses="Genesis 19:30-38">Gen. 19:30-38</span>). Hence, Moab represents the fruit of fleshly lust. Midian was very close to the children of Ishmael, who represents the flesh, in contrast to Isaac, who represents that which is born of the Spirit. Midian, no doubt, also signifies the flesh. Balaam had much to do with Moab and Midian, for Balak used them to induce Balaam to come and curse Israel. These four—Balak, Moab, Midian, and Balaam—became one. </p>
<p data-content-id="OZSjkV5USBSK_MP1WUozGmXLt21uazrsJs9t6GIBcxwgHMpXkI44nN0BaekRScDuy"> When the elders of Moab and Midian came to Balaam, he said to them, “Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as Jehovah speaks to me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41417" data-verses="Numbers 22:8">Num. 22:8a</span>). Balaam was saying that he would speak to God and see what God would say. Balaam seemed to be quite spiritual. At the least, he was quite religious. Balaam, however, was definitely wrong. He knew that Balak wanted him to curse God’s people, the children of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41418" data-verses="Numbers 22:6">v. 6</span>). If Balaam had been faithful to God, he would have said, “Balak, as long as you are planning to destroy Israel, I can have nothing to do with you. I love God, and the children of Israel are God’s people.” But even though Balaam knew that Balak’s evil intention was to damage God’s people, Balaam nevertheless told the messengers that he would ask God whether he should go with them or not. How ridiculous! </p>
<p data-content-id="4MK-wePHgeEAEGgR-z7X2Me1hwRZhE7RGIluVa5oEpcHV3stVAVn4-Tc5CTQh0iYn"> We today may do something that is just as ridiculous as what Balaam did. For example, suppose someone suggests that you participate in a certain kind of worldly <span class="pg" data-page-id="247" id="247">[247]</span> entertainment, and you tell that person that you would like to consider the matter before the Lord and see whether or not the Lord would agree with such participation. In principle, this kind of considering before the Lord would be the same as Balaam’s in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41419" data-verses="Numbers 22:1">Numbers 22</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="owSxjcqeZRVmxEIS3OihFHvsyLldhdw0vmgvUEemAnltodyTzv6yHvYP90yMUcQyG"> Let us take as another illustration the way we style our hair. Is the Lord happy with your hair style? Suppose a sister wants to style her hair in a very worldly way. She knows that the Lord does not agree with this style, but she tries to pray about it anyway. Her consideration is the same in nature as Balaam’s. </p>
<p data-content-id="3Y75k2O-GWhqOrdtGMwxU2o6DTats6BF3Ik8Rqg0fOcYDaq8QCBZ97FKiVycD9iDM"> There may be many occasions when we know that doing a particular thing is not of the Lord, yet we still try to seek the Lord’s leading in the matter. Although we know that the thing is wrong, we may ask the Lord whether we should do it or not. This can lead to self-deception. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41420" data-verses="Numbers 22:1">Numbers 22</span> Balaam was actually engaging in self-deception. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="GH2P9Y3tWVo3vwOnM-tmBAXhQFbUq0bMbEZhDa4imkkh08ueAdWa3Wq1nnlLdF8Wv">2. God Stopping Balaam from Going</h2><p data-content-id="c66RxjgPYhMLBezgrzhPy-H3gLRZ-jMxsmz68qF6tmK_P8z65dz6eCIYn-7KqSz3Q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41421" data-verses="Numbers 22:9-14">22:9-14</span> God stopped Balaam from going. God said to him, “You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41422" data-verses="Numbers 22:12">v. 12</span>). Balaam then told the officers of Balak that the Lord would not allow him to go with them. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="YHlejKwe4zJM9asMqbsyWuapu-a_w97ON3jvWMY9Q5agu8XBAHpB57Htd9BbOWaqj">3. Balak Again Sending Officers,<br/>More in Number and More Honorable<br/>Than the Former, to Induce Balaam</h2><p data-content-id="ERNBZk2fVc6bxOiCk-X4N58n6renRx3McXQ0hmXB6AJkXe9nyhLoNBrjCzDoOcA-M"> Balak was really devilish. When the officers told him that Balaam had refused to come with them, Balak again sent officers, more in number and more honorable than they, to induce Balaam to come (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41423" data-verses="Numbers 22:14-15">vv. 14-15</span>). These officers might have come to Balaam with presents from Balak. They spoke to Balaam on Balak’s behalf, urging Balaam to curse the children of Israel for Balak. </p>
<p data-content-id="DxVzNnfEqnwJJe7GyfHvbNwRQ_ybfwglxmBI07FipOB6QgwVm01HCCfjmiwJXMqx5"> “Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more. Now, therefore, stay here tonight also, that I <span class="pg" data-page-id="248" id="248">[248]</span> may know what more Jehovah will speak to me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41424" data-verses="Numbers 22:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>). If Balaam had been faithful, he would have told Balak’s officers that the Lord would not let him go with them. Instead, he told them that he would go to the Lord again and seek His leading. This also was a matter of Balaam’s self-deception. </p>

God Allowing Balaam to Go, and Balaam Going</h2><p data-content-id="gVK3NAkEMwsZE8Q-ot7YHLOdLgFfbM5Uya85eCH9oZZY7jOOGPbB82gui7YdXn6-O"> God allowed Balaam to go, and Balaam went (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41425" data-verses="Numbers 22:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41426" data-verses="2Peter 2:15">2 Pet. 2:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41427" data-verses="Jude 1:11">Jude 11</span>). God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them; but only what I tell you, that shall you do” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41428" data-verses="Numbers 22:20">Num. 22:20</span>). Balaam, therefore, went with the rulers of Moab (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41429" data-verses="Numbers 22:21">v. 21</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ezw1IvP5hJlLyGzJuXCMwfCQo7QUre2non4KkPYaTfhE1FqPcM2yCoPnLNpUj9vS2"> Balaam might have taken the Lord’s word to him as the basis for saying that in going with Balak’s officers he was doing God’s will. Actually, Balaam was pursuing his own will, not God’s will. Because he desired to go with Balak’s officers, God told him to go. Our situation today may be similar. If we want to do a certain thing and even insist on doing it, the Lord may eventually allow us to do it. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="56Tr4kCk5lYCc-MpfN0cnfmVpZUNGnXmAb1tHSRy7tzGpsD_p3ykJtYvDxOHS7R3k">5. God’s Anger Burning against Balaam<br/>because He Went, and the Angel of Jehovah<br/>Standing in the Way as His Adversary<br/>and Using the Ass He Rode On to Speak to Him</h2><p data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37CgQAbXVl8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e"> “God’s anger burned because he went; and the Angel of Jehovah took His stand in the way as his adversary” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41430" data-verses="Numbers 22:22">v. 22a</span>). When the ass on which Balaam was riding saw the Angel of Jehovah, she pushed against the wall (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41431" data-verses="Numbers 22:25">v. 25</span>). When she saw the Angel of Jehovah again, she lay down under Balaam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41432" data-verses="Numbers 22:27">v. 27</span>). Eventually, because Balaam was striking the ass with his staff, God opened the mouth of the ass, and she spoke to Balaam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41433" data-verses="Numbers 22:28-30">vv. 28-30</span>). This was a genuine miracle. Then “Jehovah unveiled the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the road and His drawn sword in His hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41434" data-verses="Numbers 22:31">v. 31</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5Fnmjgkatr34sAQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> Notice that in our text the Angel of the Lord is capitalized to indicate that this angel is Christ. In the Old Testament the <span class="pg" data-page-id="249" id="249">[249]</span> expression “the Angel of Jehovah” refers to Christ. For example, when Moses was called by God, he was called directly by the Angel of Jehovah, directly by Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41435" data-verses="Exodus 3:2">Exo. 3:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41436" data-verses="Exodus 3:4">4</span>). If we read <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41437" data-verses="Numbers 22:1">Numbers 22</span> carefully, we will see that the Angel of Jehovah here is the very God Himself. The Lord Himself was dealing with this greedy prophet. </p>

In this message we will begin to consider Balaam’s prophesying in parables (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41443" data-verses="Numbers 22:41">22:41—24:25</span>). The Hebrew word translated “parable” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41444" data-verses="Numbers 23:7">23:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41445" data-verses="Numbers 23:18">18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41446" data-verses="Numbers 24:3">24:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41447" data-verses="Numbers 24:15">15</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41448" data-verses="Numbers 24:20">20</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41449" data-verses="Numbers 24:21">21</span> may also be rendered “proverb.” Here we prefer to use the word parable. Balaam’s prophecies were not proverbs; they were parables. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="IflM7BbsLZ6u10ceoy3HbodyXM-Pm_DMYrFV0s5yiOLZE994aXHfO4p54nuE3Htm0">1.

<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="FRSfve2gXKF2q5U8QMttVe4QTtgk8O0qwdoGc_QmQ-eQ8kJW69ciA8zsBiJhZIN53">a.

In the Old Testament the high places were places where people worshipped idols. “Baal” was the name of an idol. Therefore, the high places of Baal were places where people worshipped the idol of Baal. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="PuIIleEPVSVfD8jhkWufiVVW1mt57_EJYxmruVj7g1UOrXT8awLuynKwbredYSK3_">b.

And Balak did as Balaam had spoken” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41452" data-verses="Numbers 23:1-2">23:1-2a</span>). Balaam’s word <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> indicates that the worship in which he was involved was a mixture. It is according to God’s way to build an altar. However, here Balaam mixed the worship of God with the worship of Baal. </p>
<p data-content-id="pitQJ6wzw9SLef7XU0zpptgX_w8z_ho3XM7OLfBcppeT-qU_lUsjRuGVn988HowAD"> “Balak and Balaam offered on each altar a bull and a ram” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41453" data-verses="Numbers 23:2">v. 2b</span>). To whom did they offer—to Jehovah or to Baal? Because of the mixture of the worship of God and the worship of Baal, it is difficult to determine to whom Balak and Balaam offered these offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="vAsrJ2nXSZSYEVPzp03QrPFU08TW9-L_Lgvah9JawmYMePT4WRb2Med_Jz2YQdYJK"> Such a mixture in worship can also be found in Catholicism. In the Catholic Church offerings are offered, but it is not clear to whom they are offered. Apparently, the offerings in the Catholic Church are offered to God; actually, these offerings are offered to different idols and images. Thus, the Catholic religion has mixed the worship of God with the worship of idols. In actuality, this worship is not even a mixture, for it is the worship of idols. </p>

Balak and All the Rulers of Moab<br/>Standing beside Balaam’s Burnt Offering,<br/>and Jehovah Putting a Word in Balaam’s Mouth,<br/>and Balaam Prophesying in a Parable</h2><p data-content-id="2E0ak2tPM0Mfc5DVkAQ7ac1v2eMY3fc09HxajrXJ90qanQxeb0N_D56Uhkk3_Uw5t"> Balak and all the rulers of Moab stood beside Balaam’s burnt offering (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41454" data-verses="Numbers 23:3">vv. 3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41455" data-verses="Numbers 23:6">6</span>). Jehovah put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and Balaam prophesied in a parable (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41456" data-verses="Numbers 23:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41457" data-verses="Numbers 23:7-10">7-10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="uVg-B0zfBhzFLu0-bfSRvmAd6DB4eF9Rnw_t3_6v1pD3tO9lSNhdpPMAef8L-UIGR"> The situation here was quite strange. The offerings were not offered to Jehovah; rather, in an ambiguous way, they were offered to Baal. Nevertheless, for the sake of His people Israel, God ruled over Balaam. No doubt, Balaam had the desire and the intention in his heart to curse Israel that he might please Balak and receive more money. But as the One who was watching and ruling, the Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and Balaam had no choice but to speak God’s word. </p>
<p data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyIXY9W80hC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS"> The word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41458" data-verses="Numbers 23:7-10">verses 7 through 10</span> was surely inspired by God. The human mind is not able to compose such a parable, a parable which Balaam spoke as a prophecy. This is strong evidence that the Bible was inspired by the living, almighty, <span class="pg" data-page-id="253" id="253">[253]</span> and speaking God. Let us now look into certain aspects of Balaam’s first parable. </p>
<p data-content-id="IflM7BbsLZ6u10ceoy3HbodydeePm_DMYrFV0s5yiOLZE994aXHfO4p54nuE3Htm0"> Balak had said to Balaam, “Come, curse Jacob for me, / And come, denounce Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41459" data-verses="Numbers 23:7">v. 7b</span>). However, this was impossible. Balaam said, “How can I curse him whom God has not cursed? / How can I denounce him whom Jehovah has not denounced? / For from the top of the rocks I see him, / From the hills I behold him. / Behold, a people that will dwell alone, /And will not reckon themselves among the nations!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41460" data-verses="Numbers 23:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>). The word about the children of Israel’s dwelling alone and not reckoning themselves among the nations indicates that they were a holy, sanctified people, a people set apart from the nations. </p>
<p data-content-id="HPFjB-1Auz0yuOHKiO7sUHxB5_nuErvnZ-3dB9TpN-DIjpt7vl1AN1EJ-KBTMrfRS"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41461" data-verses="Numbers 23:10">verse 10</span> Balaam went on to say, “Who can count the dust of Jacob, / Or number the fourth part of Israel? / Let me die the death of the upright, /And let my end be like theirs!” Here we see the blessing of increase. Jacob, like the dust, will be numberless, countless. No one will be able to count even the fourth part of Israel. Furthermore, the word concerning the death of the upright is a word of great blessing and appreciation. </p>
<p data-content-id="XLLTDppJ60HGrEjQbd3j9RDU8XkvU58jcqP7x6v7IGu3acmlClR7B0TiVrBD0lZqc"> The first parable was a blessing upon the children of Israel as a separate people, a particular and special class of people who dwell alone and who are not reckoned among the nations. Because this people will be blessed with abundant increase, no one will be able to number them. After uttering this great blessing, Balaam expressed his appreciation of Israel. </p>

This was the reason Balak said to him, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and you have altogether blessed them!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41462" data-verses="Numbers 23:11">v. 11</span>). To this Balaam replied, “Must I not take heed to speak what Jehovah puts in my mouth?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41463" data-verses="Numbers 23:12">v. 12</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="zlDFwvjlbRNSVPZMsJoAOoY-0uIUl9T_qTJ0b8-Djp239rcyY1bn_iJnFc_BwAY5_">2.

Balak brought Balaam to another place, a mountain, and, as in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41466" data-verses="Numbers 23:1-2">verses 1 and 2</span>, built seven altars. </p>

<p data-content-id="0I15hg85dOcthbcFQOxX5fHEl1ObfxmdReoS22AKOrqla8tAqHC6ayC5UH6a1tzmM"> One of the most striking lines in this parable is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41468" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">verse 21</span>: “He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob; / Nor has He seen trouble in Israel.” How could Balaam speak such a word, since Israel was not perfect and since God could see all the iniquities of His people? The answer is that this word was spoken not according to the human view but according to the divine view. God’s view is different from our view. If we realize this, we will be careful whenever we speak of the defects of the saints. According to our view, a certain saint may have many defects, but according to God’s view, this saint is perfect. </p>
<p data-content-id="7yTIaBOhlCkC6wnzpdOni4v82SO4cU6JN5dp73tdKZs9iz_xB3_gpvjWsQcHJJNa-"> How can we reconcile the word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41469" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">verse 21</span> with the obvious fact that the children of Israel had many iniquities? This apparent contradiction is reconciled by the fact that God’s redeemed people have a twofold status: their status in themselves and their status in God’s redemption. This is our situation as believers today. In ourselves we have many defects, but in God’s redemption and in Christ we have no <span class="pg" data-page-id="255" id="255">[255]</span> defects. When God looks at us, He does not see us according to what we are in ourselves but according to what we are in Christ. God does not look at what His redeemed people are in themselves. We may even say that He has forgotten what we are in ourselves. Our basis for saying this is that God has forgiven us, and when God forgives, He forgets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41470" data-verses="Hebrews 8:12">Heb. 8:12</span>). God has put us all into Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41471" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>). Since He has put us into Christ, when He looks at us, He sees us in Christ. God’s view of us is that in Christ we do not have any iniquity. </p>
<p data-content-id="_hRt6BaEalb59wfF8M4rOd011m0pSheCpOP0cpOmV8IJSJlfGzEGzh_y08rbJRoeV"> The principle is the same with God’s view of the church life. According to our view, the church life may be very poor. But according to God’s view, the church life is glorious. God has not beheld iniquity in the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="Br6Kg7546HFKM2GARtGpoB7aECTJvJXn1XnlscnO9mIErIt9z5oiyXgJPhz_m6igQ"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41472" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">Numbers 23:21</span> says that God has not seen trouble in Israel. Here the word <em>trouble</em> means hard things, evil things that cause people to be troubled. This kind of trouble is even worse than iniquity. In the sight of God, there was neither iniquity nor trouble in His people Israel. </p>

The phrases “whose eye is opened” and “who hears the speaking of God” indicate that the prophet was on the alert. His falling down with his eyes uncovered indicates that he cooperated with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="56Tr4kCk5lYCc-MpfN0cneGVqZ0NGnXmAb1tHSRy7tzGpsD_p3ykJtYvDxOHS7R3k"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41487" data-verses="Numbers 24:5">verse 5</span> Balaam says, “How fair are your tents, O Jacob, / Your dwelling places, O Israel!” This reminds us of Balaam’s word concerning Israel in his first two parables. In the first parable he said, “Behold, a people that will dwell alone, / And will not reckon themselves among the nations” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41488" data-verses="Numbers 23:9">23:9b</span>). This word indicates that Israel is a holy people, a people separated, or sanctified, unto God. In the sight of God, Israel stands alone. According to God’s view, Israel, even today, is not reckoned among the nations. If we have God’s view, we will regard Israel as a particular and separate people, as a sanctified and holy nation. In his second parable Balaam said, “He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob; / Nor has He seen trouble in Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41489" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">23:21a</span>). This means that, in the sight of God, Israel is without fault. </p>
<p data-content-id="NFJXF40TVkAzHzBXd37CgRgbUWF8Qt_VsrtT0UhU_lCRnzkXX_fMPxUmwjctCUf5e"> The first parable reveals that Israel is holy, and the second, that Israel is perfect. Now we need to see that, according to the third parable, Israel is beautiful. Israel’s beauty is indicated by the word “fair.” In the sight of God, Israel is holy, sinless, and beautiful. In standing she is holy, in kind she is perfect, and in appearance she is beautiful. This reveals that God has chosen, redeemed, saved, separated, uplifted, perfected, and beautified this people. </p>
<p data-content-id="tkL3WfHUrbTjG5FnmjgkasL37vgQ7CqRUmOwmEABFfNvl1Go8obWGCNdHnjQm7soa"> According to the Bible, this will be the actual situation of Israel during the millennium. The Jews are not welcomed by <span class="pg" data-page-id="259" id="259">[259]</span> the nations in this age, but they will be welcomed by the nations after the Lord Jesus comes back. God promised that the descendants of Abraham would be a blessing to all the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41490" data-verses="Genesis 12:2-3">Gen. 12:2-3</span>). Eventually the Jews will be fully blessed by God, and they will be a blessing to the entire human race. </p>
<p data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk1srEslZhK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41491" data-verses="Numbers 24:6">Numbers 24:6</span> Balaam continues his description of Israel: “Like valleys that stretch afar, / Like gardens beside a river; / Like aloes that Jehovah has planted, / Like cedar trees beside the waters.” Here Israel is likened to valleys, which usually are green, and to gardens beside a river. Aloe is a plant known for its healing effect. (The Lord Jesus was buried with aloes—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41492" data-verses="John 19:39">John 19:39</span>.) After the coming back of the Lord Jesus, Israel will be a healing to the nations, and that healing will be a great blessing. </p>
<p data-content-id="UdegCvQnXR5xgUhUaUGVcBvjleq-Cu7dqw2JPQOIsoKn_Y8dqhxtHLn_1Zya9Y6Px"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41493" data-verses="Numbers 24:7">Numbers 24:7a</span> says, “Water shall flow from his buckets, / And his seed shall be in many waters.” This indicates that Israel will have an abundant supply of water. The water of a country is related to the riches of that country. The more water a nation has, the more riches it will have. Without water, the land would be a desert. </p>
<p data-content-id="MNYPxEBRKCjGvjYcSm_-y6G61njZBONkc_BXexp5aMeJNuq4a-EbRUgKX-x3mauLs"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41494" data-verses="Numbers 24:7">verse 7b</span> Balaam goes on to say, “His king shall be higher than Agag, /And his kingdom shall be exalted.” Agag was the king of the Amalekites. Balaam’s word here is a prophecy that eventually has its fulfillment in Christ. </p>

The Scepter is Christ as the One with power and authority. In this prophecy, therefore, Balaam speaks of Christ. The greatest blessing to the children of Israel is Christ. As the Star and the Scepter, Christ will be the almighty One with all-inclusive power and authority. This Christ will crush the corners of Moab, one of Balak’s countries, and will break down all the sons of Sheth. </p>
<p data-content-id="L9HftOmYqjmYA0hV0PtiWVPLDDCl6jSE9MY_rfUhPEuKy3ijGqB94J8MCZIyjUWvw"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41505" data-verses="Numbers 24:18-19">verses 18 and 19</span>, Balaam continues, saying, “Edom shall be dispossessed, / Seir also, his enemies, shall be dispossessed. / But Israel shall do valiantly; / By Jacob shall <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> dominion be exercised, /And those who remain from the cities shall be destroyed!” “His enemies” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41506" data-verses="Numbers 24:18">verse 18</span> are Christ’s enemies. These enemies will be destroyed, but because of Christ Israel will remain. After these nations have been destroyed, Israel will remain with Christ. Christ will surely be Israel’s greatest blessing. This prophecy, as the New Testament indicates (see <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41507" data-verses="Romans 11:1">Rom. 11</span>), will be fully fulfilled in the coming days, that is, in the millennium. </p>

However, I would first like to review the crucial matters, the intrinsic elements, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41513" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">chapters twenty through twenty-four</span> of Numbers. </p>
<p data-content-id="KczBxhEn9SA44FFZSVMXveYJnRKh8ghOy5WWYqtP7LFq_5eOHT5zjQ8Bhcb9oDTxH"> In typology, these five chapters present us a picture of Christ and the church. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41514" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Chapter twenty</span> shows us Christ as the smitten rock who, in resurrection, is flowing out living water to meet our need (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41515" data-verses="Numbers 20:8">v. 8</span>). Christ has been smitten, crucified, and there is no need for Him to be smitten again. Now He is in resurrection flowing with living water to quench people’s thirst. The crucified and resurrected Christ is here to meet us in our need. As long as we have Him, God has no problem with us and we have no problem with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="lGJMqXpxLr00FAOi_3oq90rbl0dyiel3q9IrhyEOb-mti2DuXEIULfVfV-8aXxhkd"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41516" data-verses="Numbers 21:1">chapter twenty-one</span> we have further aspects of Christ. First, as the bronze serpent, Christ is our replacement (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41517" data-verses="Numbers 21:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>). He became the same as we in nature with the exception that in Him there was no sin. He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41518" data-verses="Romans 8:3">Rom. 8:3</span>), but He did not have the sinful nature, just as the bronze serpent had the form of a serpent without having the poisonous nature of a serpent. Because Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He could be our replacement, bearing God’s judgment and accomplishing redemption. As our replacement, Christ has solved not only the outward problem of sins but also the inward problem of our sinful nature. Having solved these problems through His crucifixion, in resurrection this One has become a fountain, a well (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41519" data-verses="Numbers 21:17">Num. 21:17</span>), springing up with living water, which <span class="pg" data-page-id="264" id="264">[264]</span> is the consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God. In our experience we need to dig this well (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41520" data-verses="Numbers 21:18">v. 18</span>). If we dig the well, we will become nobles and leaders. Furthermore, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41521" data-verses="Numbers 33:1">Numbers 33</span> indicates, Christ is our destination, our land of rest. Therefore, Christ is our replacement, our well, and our land of rest. When we enjoy Him as our land of rest, we do not have any lack or shortage. </p>
<p data-content-id="OZSjkV5USBSK_MP1WUozGnHLlkluazrsJs9t6GIBcxwgHMpXkI44nN0BaekRScDuy"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41522" data-verses="Numbers 23:1-2">Numbers 23 and 24</span> we have four parables spoken by Balaam, a Gentile prophet. These parables reveal much concerning the church, with the fourth parable revealing something concerning Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="uVg-B0zfBhzFLu0-bfSRvmgd6BB4eF9Rnw_t3_6v1pD3tO9lSNhdpPMAef8L-UIGR"> Let us first consider what these parables show us concerning the church. “Behold, a people that will dwell alone, / And will not reckon themselves among the nations!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41523" data-verses="Numbers 23:9">23:9b</span>). This indicates that the church is composed of a separate people, a particular people, a people sanctified to God. The church is not mixed with the nations but stands alone. “He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob; / Nor has He seen trouble in Israel” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41524" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">23:21a</span>). This indicates that, in the sight of God, the church is perfect, having no iniquity. The church is perfect because the church is in Christ. “How fair are your tents, O Jacob, / Your dwelling places, O Israel!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41525" data-verses="Numbers 24:5">24:5</span>). This indicates that in appearance the church is beautiful. In summary, we see in the first parable that the church has a particular standing; in the second parable, that the church is perfect in the sight of God; and in the third parable, that the appearance of the church is fair, beautiful. </p>
<p data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyIX49W-0hC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS"> Balaam’s fourth parable contains a prophecy concerning Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41526" data-verses="Numbers 24:17">24:17</span>). A church that is sanctified, perfect, and beautiful is a church that is full of Christ. The church can be holy, perfect, and beautiful because the church has Christ. Christ is the content of the church. Christ is the constituent of the church and every part of the church. In the church as the new man Christ is all and in all (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41527" data-verses="Colossians 3:10-11">Col. 3:10-11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="IflM7BbsLZ6u10ceoy3Hbo9yee-Pm_DMYrFV0s5yiOLZE994aXHfO4p54nuE3Htm0"> The Christ prophesied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41528" data-verses="Numbers 24:17">Numbers 24:17</span> is not an earthly Christ but a heavenly Christ. He is the Star that comes forth out of Jacob and the Scepter that arises out of Israel. Out of the church comes forth the Christ who is the Star, and this Star is the Scepter. This means that the heavenly Christ is <span class="pg" data-page-id="265" id="265">[265]</span> the authority in the universe. Today Christ is our Star, but in the future He will be the Scepter, the One with universal authority. </p>
<p data-content-id="HPFjB-1Auz0yuOHKiO7sUHRB6_HuErvnZ-3dB9TpN-DIjpt7vl1AN1EJ-KBTMrfRS"> In Balaam’s prophetic parables we see not only certain aspects of Christ and the church but also many of the riches related to the church. The church “has as it were the horns of the wild ox” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41529" data-verses="Numbers 23:22">23:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41530" data-verses="Numbers 24:8">24:8</span>). This indicates that the church is victorious. The church is also likened to a lion and a lioness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41531" data-verses="Numbers 23:24">23:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41532" data-verses="Numbers 24:9">24:9</span>). This is a further indication that the church is victorious. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41533" data-verses="Numbers 24:6-7">Numbers 24:6 and 7</span> speak of “valleys that stretch afar,” “gardens beside a river,” and water that flows from buckets. This reveals that the church is like a garden, that the church has valleys, and that in the church there is an abundance of water. </p>
<p data-content-id="XLLTDppJ60HGrEjQbd3j9RjU_WEvU58jcqP7x6v7IGu3acmlClR7B0TiVrBD0lZqc"> Ephesians is a heavenly book on the church, but we do not find in Ephesians the aspects of the church presented in Balaam’s parables in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41534" data-verses="Numbers 23:1-2">Numbers 23 and 24</span>. Ephesians does not tell us that the church is a garden by a river or that in the church water flows from buckets. Moreover, Ephesians does not reveal that the church has valleys or that we in the church are lions and lionesses. In the church there are lions that can devour the enemy. Even Moab realized that God’s people are like an ox that licks up the grass of the field (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41535" data-verses="Numbers 22:4">Num. 22:4</span>). If we see the church as it is revealed in Numbers, we will not despise the church or look down on the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1dF6aJscO4mjEVXwfZzrvOldgNKXAM-f35W2Fgo9MGMHdxxaD2W6l_abXuvSctvM"> Seemingly Numbers is merely a book of history concerning Israel’s journey in the wilderness. However, the intrinsic contents, the intrinsic constituents, of this history are nothing other than Christ and the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="JURneMwwUjjCukjzuls447YaCvBXJw4OHc1FWynSIUK5iiWwT0Qsz8EketofHftLD"> Having seen the picture of Christ and the church presented in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41536" data-verses="Numbers 20:1">Numbers 20—24</span>, let us now go on to consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41537" data-verses="Numbers 25:1-18">25:1-18</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="zlDFwvjlbRNSVPZMsJoAOo4-3uoUl9T_qTJ0b8-Djp239rcyY1bn_iJnFc_BwAY5_">D. Israel’s Fall into Fornication and Idolatry</h2><p data-content-id="aECWv_lTxwekQyYAZotocRUeHHFmniOA1d0SzbnD0g14YSu3QLsjuz5hjx3S9YWCt"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41538" data-verses="Numbers 23:21">Numbers 23:21</span> says that God has not beheld iniquity in Jacob. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41539" data-verses="Numbers 25:1">Numbers 25</span>, however, we have a record of Israel’s iniquity. This iniquity comprises two ugly things: fornication, which destroys the person of the God-created man, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="266" id="266">[266]</span> idolatry, which insults the divine person of God. According to the record of the Bible, fornication and idolatry go together. Where there is fornication, there is idolatry. The Roman Catholic Church is an illustration of this. In the New Testament the Catholic Church is likened to Jezebel, a woman of fornication (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41540" data-verses="Revelation 2:20">Rev. 2:20</span>). Furthermore, in the Catholic Church there is idolatry. For example, in his book <em>The Great Prophecies,</em> G. H. Pember points out that even Buddha, under the name of Saint Josaphat, has entered into Catholicism. In the Catholic calendar there is a saint named Josaphat, whose story is actually that of Buddha. </p>
<p data-content-id="bE_9bUDz2n1OFoQ6MqyJyN3YUlf35hIg2SkRB_DtOR76JTH0rYg8plcGGDpWELP1w"> Balak was unable to defeat Israel militarily or politically. Neither could he defeat Israel through the use of religion. Therefore, under the influence of Balaam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41541" data-verses="Revelation 2:14">Rev. 2:14</span>), he induced Israel to fall into fornication and idolatry. It is likely that Balak and Balaam joined in a conspiracy and plotted against Israel, with Balaam being Balak’s counselor and advisor, teaching Balak how to stumble God’s holy, perfect, and beautiful people. The plot was initiated by Balaam, and it was put into practice by Balak. Israel’s positive characteristics were annulled by the fall into fornication and idolatry. Instead of being holy, perfect, and beautiful, they became a people of fornication and idolatry. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="qGcKu1ZVR5xTox402-R1coLvj-yO0c7yKDvJ8DBs_v_SpNT-ALQWUMIgMeeSUavPV">1. The Israelites Committing Fornication<br/>with the Daughters of Moab<br/>and Yoking Themselves to Baal of Peor</h2><p data-content-id="yogGGgbIJieS7MU0cVjEQwjlOxvQCcAm9w46WVr1gAb6TJLAvX8-z2ryALdGL70w9"> “While Israel dwelt in Shittim, the people began to commit fornication with the daughters of Moab. And these invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. Thus Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41542" data-verses="Numbers 25:1-3">Num. 25:1-3a</span>). These verses indicate that those who committed fornication became yoked to Baal, the god of fornication. Hence, there was a combination of fornication and idolatry. The worshippers of Baal were fornicators, and they induced others to commit fornication with them and to worship the idol of fornication. This was the evil counsel of Balaam (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41543" data-verses="Numbers 31:16">31:16</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="267" id="267">[267]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="8Nao4cbRs9AiSNlXRQNA9z4b2HePfC6ZUe2gLXackKJJ2QeSyCCiLybrCyWPJHWD_">2.

The failure in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41564" data-verses="Numbers 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> was the greatest failure of God’s people in the wilderness. This is proved by the fact that twenty-four thousand people died by the plague (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41565" data-verses="Numbers 25:9">25:9</span>). This plague was a purification of God’s people, and this purification was a sifting that dealt with the mixture among them. </p>

<p data-content-id="hYl9ceftJ45d5EFH33Sk1sLEvl5hK0P2q875zKKW3MtY9rcbn2WgxmDw60jIGZU9D"> Since the history of Israel is a complete type of the church, the mixture among the children of Israel is a type of the mixture in the church. There will often be some kind of <span class="pg" data-page-id="270" id="270">[270]</span> mixture in the church life. Even with the apostles chosen by the Lord Jesus there was one—Judas—who was not pure. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41567" data-verses="Acts 5:1">Acts 5</span> indicates that, at the very beginning of the church life, there was mixture in the church in Jerusalem. The mixture there was with Ananias and Sapphira, who were genuine believers but were not pure. Furthermore, the last of the epistles written by Paul, 2 Timothy, has much to say concerning mixture. Some, like Alexander the coppersmith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41568" data-verses="1Timothy 1:20">1 Tim 1:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41569" data-verses="2Timothy 4:14-15">2 Tim. 4:14-15</span>), hated Paul and opposed him to the uttermost. Many of those in Asia who had been raised up by Paul turned away from his ministry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41570" data-verses="2Timothy 1:15">1:15</span>), and Demas, a co-worker, because of his love for the present age, forsook Paul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41571" data-verses="2Timothy 4:10">4:10</span>). The point here is that there is mixture among God’s people, and God uses the failure and turmoil among His people to purify them. </p>

The punishment in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41573" data-verses="Numbers 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> was the last purification of the children of Israel before they entered into the good land. The twenty-four thousand who were killed by the plague should have included some of those who had been condemned for their failure in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41574" data-verses="Numbers 14:1">chapter fourteen</span>. Those who survived all the purifications in the wilderness, especially the last and greatest purification, were a purified people. These purified ones needed to be renumbered. </p>

The renumbering had the fighting and the distribution of the land as its goal (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41579" data-verses="Numbers 26:53">26:53</span>). The aim was to gain the good land and distribute it so that all the people could share it and enjoy it. </p>
<p data-content-id="jgnwUAKnb3LF-rKF2so0sfqi2jPYdu4JVjXaJif78hdaEK0IAPD6KUO8RgekuaJZh"> The purpose of the first numbering was absolutely for the formation of the army to follow Jehovah, to journey with Him, and to fight for His kingdom. We may say that the first numbering was for the way to reach the goal. The second numbering, however, was for the goal of entering into the good land. This, of course, still required fighting. In our Christian life there is always the need to fight. In order to fight, we need to watch, pray, and be one with the Lord all the time. </p>

Here we have the matter of divine authority, in particular, deputy authority. We cannot deny the fact that among God’s people there is such a thing as deputy authority, that is, the authority of God delegated to His representatives. We find such deputy authority both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. Concerning the renumbering of the people in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41581" data-verses="Numbers 26:1">Numbers 26</span>, the deputy authorities were to recognize the things that were done according to God’s regulations. </p>

<p data-content-id="qGcKu1ZVR5xTox402-R1crrvg-SO0c7yKDvJ8DBs_v_SpNT-ALQWUMIgMeeSUavPV"> In the Bible, inheritance is determined according to genealogy. A genealogy is a matter of life, and this life is related to tribes, houses, and families. The basic concept in <span class="pg" data-page-id="276" id="276">[276]</span> the typology in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41595" data-verses="Numbers 27:1">Numbers 27</span> is concerned with life.

<p data-content-id="yogGGgbIJieS7MU0cVjEQzDlNxPQCcAm9w46WVr1gAb6TJLAvX8-z2ryALdGL70w9"> Life has its source, and life is received by us in a certain way, through a particular channel. The way we receive the divine life is very important. As believers in Christ, we all have received the divine life, but there is a difference in the means or the channel through which we have received this life. The means of receiving the divine life involves the matter of our spiritual family. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Nao4cbRs9AiSNlXRQNA9wYb1G-PfC6ZUe2gLXackKJJ2QeSyCCiLybrCyWPJHWD_"> According to the type in Numbers, which is concerned with both the source of life and the means of receiving life, who we are and what we will be depend on our family. It matters a great deal through whom we were saved and received the Lord Jesus, for the Christian life with its activities depends on the source of life and the channel of life. This is the reason we are told, in the type, that the numbering of the people was carried out according to the houses of their fathers. This is a basic requirement. Anyone who did not have a house, even though he was a genuine Israelite, did not have a genealogy and was not qualified to be numbered. In order to be numbered, an Israelite had to have a strong standing related to the source of life and the channel of life. The principle is the same with us today. We must have a strong standing in the source of life, and we must have a proper channel for the receiving of the divine life. This channel is the means by which we came into existence in the divine life. </p>

In typology, this signifies having regard for the inheritance—grace—given by God; it signifies the desire to inherit God’s grace, to inherit Christ as the grace given to us by God.

<p data-content-id="rUqekoRmFH5ko70ziWtSd1_a8b5EL8JopHkKJur0RBOu5pxUAN_84W9dRCflBtDXA"> Apparently the daughters of Zelophehad were requesting something for themselves. (God is not pleased with a request that is for ourselves.) Actually, they were requesting something for the sake of their father, who had daughters but no sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41597" data-verses="Numbers 27:4">v. 4a</span>). In the law there was a statute which said that if a married man died without a male heir, his inheritance with his wife was to go to his brother, who, with the wife, was to beget a son for the first brother. A son born of the first brother’s wife through the second brother was to bear the name not of the second brother but of the first, so that the name of the first brother would remain among the people of God. In this way there would be a descendant for the remembrance of the first brother. The concern of the daughters of Zelophehad was that their father’s name would be taken away from his family and that his inheritance would go to someone outside his family. They wanted their father’s inheritance to go to someone born for him that his name may be remembered among his tribe. Their request, therefore, was not for themselves but for their father. Making a request based on life, they wanted the name of their father to be remembered. </p>
<p data-content-id="d38X8EOiMEk9dP_79EmbnwiR56WQg--9-XB3OqGiYKF1sxI6uIKUnB4ChkhxSbG8O"> This kind of request is pleasing to God. He does not want any of His children to be without a descendant.

The Death of Moses</h2><p data-content-id="mHOnKBa-6rL99a2gC8sce26tvfvYvfOyk6W1gSJKbbJlzuiLfBLqPv4sI-uBw0zXm"> At the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41616" data-verses="Numbers 27:12-23">Numbers 27:12-23</span>, Moses was one hundred twenty years old. Knowing that Moses was very old and that he could die at any time, thoughtful Israelites must have been concerned about God’s people and about God’s move with His people. They might have said to themselves: “What will happen when Moses is gone? Who will be his successor?” </p>
<p data-content-id="9E0RwvkihCfbWu-ZTtqacMCujD4N7t73TIeHLchn3Izflx0InPBI1FJa49wKFpuwV"> Actually, there was no need for the Israelites to worry about this. They could be at peace and enjoy the Lord’s presence, confident that He knows everything and that He would take care of the situation. This should also be our attitude in the church life today. Are you worried about the church? Do you think such worry is justified by God? Our kind of concern for the church and worry about the church may not be justified by God. Instead of justifying our worry, He might say: “Be at peace. Do not worry about the turmoil. I know the situation.” </p>

This verse says not that Moses would die but that he would be gathered. This gathering was somewhat like a harvesting. Moses was “ripe,” and soon he was to be “harvested.” This gathering, this harvesting, was to be the end of Moses’ life. </p>

Moses had acted contrary to God’s nature and God’s economy. This serious failure caused him to lose the right to enter into the land of Canaan. However, the fact that Moses could not enter into the good land because of this failure does not mean that he will not be in the millennial kingdom. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41622" data-verses="Matthew 16:28">Matthew 16:28—17:4</span> indicates that Moses will surely be in the kingdom. </p>

Moses’ concern was not for himself and for the loss of the right to enter into the land. He was not the kind of person <span class="pg" data-page-id="283" id="283">[283]</span> who cared so much for himself and his situation.

The breastplate contained twelve stones, and on each stone was written the name of one of the twelve tribes. In David Baron’s book <em>The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew</em> there is an appendix with an article on the Urim and the Thummim. According to this article, the twelve names on the breastplate included eighteen of the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The remaining four letters were put on a piece called the Thummim. The Hebrew word Thummim means perfecters or completers. Thus, on the breastplate with the additional piece called the Thummim, all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be found. These letters could be used to spell out words and sentences. <span class="pg" data-page-id="284" id="284">[284]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vAsrJ2nXSZSYEVPzp03QrMVU38zW9-L_Lgvah9JawmYMePT4WRb2Med_Jz2YQdYJK"> Furthermore, according to this article, the Urim was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate underneath the twelve stones. In Hebrew the word Urim means lights or illuminators. This article goes on to say that the Urim had twelve illuminators, one to illuminate each piece of stone on the breastplate. When the Urim and the Thummim were added to the breastplate, they caused it to become the breastplate of judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtQg4gkFxRAg6KQBybFiGZn_gaoSmMyCMdudfZSiSkioM0_3Ome8OLQclMyg824a5"> When God brought His people into the wilderness, He spoke to them through Moses. God spoke to Moses face to face. But Joshua, Moses’ successor, was to receive guidance not from God by His direct speaking in the way He spoke to Moses, but by the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate worn by Eleazar the priest. Whenever Joshua needed guidance concerning the move of the people, he had to go to the high priest, who then received guidance from God by means of the Urim and the Thummim. </p>
<p data-content-id="2E0ak2tPM0Mfc5DVkAQ7aflv1dsY3fc09HxajrXJ90qanQxeb0N_D56Uhkk3_Uw5t"> Although Joshua was made the leader, he did not have the right to receive the divine instructions directly. Instead, the high priest received God’s instructions and then passed them on to Joshua, who was responsible for their execution. Whereas the high priest had the right to receive the divine instructions, he did not have the right or the authority to execute these instructions. The authority to execute the divine instructions was given to the leader, to Joshua. The people would then go out and come in according to the instructions given to the priest and executed by Joshua. </p>
<p data-content-id="uVg-B0zfBhzFLu0-bfSRvlQd4BB4eF9Rnw_t3_6v1pD3tO9lSNhdpPMAef8L-UIGR"> God’s government among His people was a matter not of autocracy or democracy but theocracy. This divine government, this theocracy, was carried out through the coordination of the high priest, who received God’s instructions, and the leader, who executed these instructions. </p>
<p data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyIUI9U-0hC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS"> When Moses was leading the people in the wilderness, the divine government did not depend on the coordination of two persons, the high priest and the leader, but on one person—Moses. Moses was the leader, and he also functioned as a priest. (Aaron did not help much.) After Moses, however, the divine government depended on the two persons of the high priest and the leader. This was the case throughout the <span class="pg" data-page-id="285" id="285">[285]</span> generations in the Old Testament, the only exception being the time when David served as both the leader and as the priest wearing the ephod (a vest worn over the priest’s robe). When the children of Israel came back from captivity, Joshua was the high priest and Zerubbabel, a royal descendant, was the leader. The two worked together to execute the theocracy, the divine government. </p>

The Offerings by Fire,<br/>God’s Satisfying Fragrance—God’s Food </h2>
<p data-content-id="Br6Kg7546HFKM2GARtGpvA7aGDTJvJXn1XnlscnO9mIErIt9z5oiyXgJPhz_m6igQ"> Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, “Command the sons of Israel, and say to them, My offering, My food for My offerings by fire, My satisfying fragrance, you shall observe to offer to Me at its appointed time” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41633" data-verses="Numbers 28:2">28:2</span>). In this verse God speaks of His food. It seems that He is asking His people not to forget His food. He wants them to remember to give Him something to eat. Here God seems to be saying to His people, “I have done a great deal for you. I have prepared food and drink. Now I ask you to take care of My food. My food is the offerings you present to Me. These offerings are My satisfying fragrance.” God wanted Moses, before he was gathered to his fathers, to charge the people to take care of God’s food, to offer food to Him at the appointed time. Have you ever heard that God wants something to eat? As we are eating our food, we need to remember that God also desires food and that we need to prepare something for Him to eat. </p>
<p data-content-id="x30XFBmjVsgxZ2D79gWqQ0yKG7ddU6xfKVe4jISiWv2y8vVsZC3Hniqu3S7FO7vNY"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41634" data-verses="Hebrews 10:5-9">Hebrews 10:5-9</span> indicates that Christ is the reality of and <span class="pg" data-page-id="288" id="288">[288]</span> the replacement for the Old Testament offerings. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41635" data-verses="Hebrews 10:8-9">Verses 8 and 9</span> say, “Sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not desire nor take pleasure in (which are offered according to the law); then He said, Behold, I come to do Your will. He takes away the first that He may establish the second.” The will of God here is to take away the first, the animal sacrifices of the old covenant, that the second, the sacrifice of Christ of the new testament, may be established. The new testament offerings are Christ Himself. Today God’s desire and pleasure are not in animal sacrifices; God’s desire and pleasure are altogether in one person—Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="rUqekoRmFH5ko70ziWtSa3_a_bZEL8JopHkKJur0RBOu5pxUAN_84W9dRCflBtDXA"> Before we consider further the matter of God’s food in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41636" data-verses="Numbers 28:1">Numbers 28</span>, let us consider the sequence of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41637" data-verses="Numbers 25:1">chapters twenty-five through twenty-eight</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41638" data-verses="Numbers 25:1">chapter twenty-five</span> the children of Israel had a great failure, falling into fornication, a damage to their humanity, and into idolatry, an insult to God’s person. As a result of this failure, twenty-four thousand Israelites died by the plague. If we had been there, we might have thought that, due to this pitiful situation, God was finished with His people, upon whom He had been working for so long and for whom He had done so much. </p>
<p data-content-id="d38X8EOiMEk9dP_79EmbgyiR662Qg--9-XB3OqGiYKF1sxI6uIKUnB4ChkhxSbG8O"> God, however, was not finished with the children of Israel. This is proved by the renumbering in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41639" data-verses="Numbers 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span>. God still had His number, and the total of those numbered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41640" data-verses="Numbers 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span> was nearly the same as the total in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41641" data-verses="Numbers 1:1">chapter one</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41642" data-verses="Numbers 26:51">26:51</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41643" data-verses="Numbers 1:46">1:46</span>). At the time of the first numbering, there had not been any trouble or reduction in number through God’s punishment. The renumbering took place after much trouble and reduction through judgment. Nevertheless, in spite of all the trials, turmoils, temptations, failures, and reductions, God still had almost the same number for Himself as He had had in the beginning. Regardless of what the enemy had done and regardless of the people’s failures, God, by His sovereign grace and acts, still had a number greater than six hundred thousand. </p>
<p data-content-id="QMNNHzC1cNpRTwWtut-WkyEPZvqv1v75JSKuO1jimhfuoO5aaxSFW4a02nXRm6WnV"> After the renumbering in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41644" data-verses="Numbers 26:1">chapter twenty-six</span>, we have in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41645" data-verses="Numbers 27:1-11">27:1-11</span> the statute of judgment for the women’s inheriting of the land. The five daughters of Zelophehad came to Moses <span class="pg" data-page-id="289" id="289">[289]</span> with the request that, since there were no male heirs, they be allowed to possess their father’s inheritance. Their request, which was actually related to gaining more of Christ, was granted, for they had a high and pure motive—regard for the inheritance (grace) given by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="KczBxhEn9SA44FFZSVMXof4JhC6h8ghOy5WWYqtP7LFq_5eOHT5zjQ8Bhcb9oDTxH"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41646" data-verses="Numbers 27:12-23">Numbers 27:12-23</span> is concerned with the death of Moses and with Moses’ successor. Moses was one hundred twenty years old, and the Lord told him that the time had come for him to be gathered to his people. His going raised the question of leadership. Who would be his successor? When God told him that he would now be gathered to his people, Moses said, “Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the assembly, who will go out before them and come in before them, who will lead them out and bring them in; that the assembly of Jehovah may not be as sheep which have no shepherd” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41647" data-verses="Numbers 27:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). This indicates that Moses did not consider his loss of the leadership. His heart was not set on his situation but on God’s people. Moses seemed to be saying to the Lord, “It is right and fair for me to be gathered to my people. But, Lord, who will take care of Your people? If the people do not have someone to lead them out and bring them in, they will be as sheep without a shepherd.” The Lord responded to Moses’ word by telling him to take Joshua and cause him to stand before the priest and the whole assembly, to lay his hands on him in order to bestow upon Joshua some of his majesty, and then to charge him to be the leader (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41648" data-verses="Numbers 27:18-23">vv. 18-23</span>). In this way God raised up a new leader. </p>

The new people had been renumbered, the new army had been re-formed and strengthened, and the new leader had been appointed to serve, not by himself but with Eleazar the priest, who would receive divine instructions by means of the Urim and Thummim. This means that there was among the people a new theocracy. Hence, at the end of this chapter we see a new people, a new army, and a new theocracy. </p>

At the beginning of this chapter, God came in and seemed to say to the people, “Do you have everything you need? Are you satisfied and happy? How about Me and My satisfaction? You need to take care of My food. I have been taking care of you for years. I have prepared everything for you in a new, complete way, and now you are ready to possess the land which I promised to your forefathers. I ask you not to forget Me.

As we will see, God needs to eat daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. He wants to enjoy something daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. God’s yearly food is related to the annual feasts. </p>

This day was the first day of the seventh month, the beginning of the second half of the year. On this day a holy convocation was to be held with no laborious work. There was no need of human labor because everything had been done by God Himself. The offering for this feast was the same as that offered at the beginning of the month, with the exception that one young bull was offered instead of two. </p>

On the cross, Christ accomplished propitiation. To propitiate is to appease. Propitiation is not a matter of propitiating God but of propitiating the situation between <span class="pg" data-page-id="298" id="298">[298]</span> us and God. We should not think that God was angry with us and needed to be appeased. No, God loves the world, and propitiation is needed because of our fallen situation, not because God is angry. Our situation was full of problems, full of sins, and needed to be propitiated. Through His death on the cross, Christ dealt with our sins, and in so doing He propitiated our situation with God so that we could be redeemed, forgiven, and justified. When we repented, believed in Christ, and received Him as our Savior, we experienced this feast. </p>
<p data-content-id="Zjo9b_sbrL-1x6xy-0gyWP_IUq8ZurBOk8dWCpfBgyBR0D6E30f90C4kCu_Hzx6Aq"> The feast of propitiation has a double application. Spiritually this feast has been applied to us, and literally it will be applied in the future to the Jews. After the Lord Jesus has descended from the air to the earth, the Jews will repent, mourn, and return to God, receiving Christ as their Savior. This will be the literal fulfillment of the feast of propitiation. </p>
<p data-content-id="AQYzzKQWYTkaFQeLtwXyG8Dly-uydiCBfKdc5vmfXuwsxv0xS9OBpDz-8zAqA_-Qz"> The feast of propitiation was on the tenth day of the seventh month. A holy convocation was held with no work.

This feast lasted seven days, beginning from the fifteenth day of the seventh month. A holy convocation was held on the first day with no laborious work. The offerings, which typify different aspects of Christ, consisted of two rams and fourteen male lambs a year old without blemish and thirteen young bulls on the first day, reduced by one bull on each of the six succeeding days, with their meal offering and drink offerings, as a burnt offering. In addition, a male goat was offered as a sin offering. On the eighth day, which signifies resurrection, a solemn assembly was held. The offering on this day was the same as that offered at the beginning of the month, with the exception that one bull was offered instead of two young bulls. <span class="pg" data-page-id="299" id="299">[299]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="PuIIleEPVSVfD8jhkWuflUFW1nt57_EJYxmruVj7g1UOrXT8awLuynKwbredYSK3_"> The feasts of the blowing of trumpets, propitiation, and tabernacles all took place within a brief period of time in the seventh month. The fulfillment of these feasts will take place nearly at the same time. The feast of the blowing of trumpets will be fulfilled at Christ’s coming back (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41688" data-verses="Matthew 24:31">Matt. 24:31</span>), when God will call the Jews together from their dispersion back to the land of their fathers. The feast of propitiation will be fulfilled on the day of Israel’s return to God, after they have been gathered back to their fathers’ land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41689" data-verses="Romans 11:26-27">Rom. 11:26-27</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41690" data-verses="Zechariah 12:10-14">Zech. 12:10-14</span>). The Jews will afflict themselves by praying, fasting, and repenting. Then God will forgive them, and the feast of propitiation will be applied to them. Finally, the feast of tabernacles will be fulfilled in the coming millennium for a thousand years as a conclusion of all the ages of God’s old creation. The fulfillment of this feast will be a dispensational, joyful blessing for God’s redeemed people to enjoy with God for a full period of time in God’s old creation. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="-ygMnNXQK98Bslpy7nKLPmRVrnYMEgYLj3HQenBBRZnxyBXU7VW1OzWf6pxTP6q5S">i. Offerings in Addition to the People’s<br/>Vows and Their Freewill Offerings</h2><p data-content-id="pitQJ6wzw9SLef7XU0zpuswX_z8z_ho3XM7OLfBcppeT-qU_lUsjRuGVn988HowAD"> All the offerings for every day, for every Sabbath, for the beginning of every month, and for all the yearly feasts were offered for the people’s burnt offerings, meal offerings, drink offerings, and peace offerings, in addition to their vows and their freewill offerings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41691" data-verses="Numbers 29:39-40">Num. 29:39-40</span>). The people offered certain offerings as a fulfillment of their duty or responsibility. Those offerings were a fulfillment of their vows. They could also present offerings of their own free will. However, all the offerings described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41692" data-verses="Numbers 28:1">chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine</span> were in addition to their vows and freewill offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="vAsrJ2nXSZSYEVPzp03QsOVU0_TW9-L_Lgvah9JawmYMePT4WRb2Med_Jz2YQdYJK"> We need to see that, according to these chapters, God’s food is related to three things. First, God’s food is related to the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly life of His people. Second, God’s food is related to the spiritual life of the believers from the Passover through the feast of Pentecost, including the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of the first fruits. Each of these four feasts involves life. This means that in the Christian life there is a particular kind of food for <span class="pg" data-page-id="300" id="300">[300]</span> God. Third, God’s food is related to His people Israel. Christ will come back to blow the trumpet to gather the people of Israel back to their fathers’ land. Then there will be a day for their propitiation. On that day, they will afflict themselves and repent, and Christ will be their propitiation. This propitiation will lead to the feast of tabernacles. At the time of this feast, Israel will be at peace with God and enter into God’s enjoyment. The feast of tabernacles will be not only the last feast but also the conclusion of God’s work in the old creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="WtQg4gkFxRAg6KQBybFiBbn_gYoSmMyCMdudfZSiSkioM0_3Ome8OLQclMyg824a5"> In God’s old creation there are four ages: the age before the law, from Adam to Moses; the age of the law, from Moses to Christ’s first coming; the age of grace, from Christ’s first coming to His second coming; and the age of the millennium, the kingdom of the thousand years. These four ages are crucial steps of God’s work in the old creation for the new creation. In each of these four ages, God uses the old creation as the material for the producing of a new creation. The consummation of God’s new creation will be the New Jerusalem. Those believers who are overcomers in the age of grace will enjoy the New Jerusalem during the millennium. Eventually, after the millennium, all of God’s people will be fully perfected and consummated to be the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="2E0ak2tPM0Mfc5DVkAQ7ddlv1fsY3fc09HxajrXJ90qanQxeb0N_D56Uhkk3_Uw5t"> In the present age, the age of grace, we are enjoying Christ as our Passover, as our unleavened bread, and as the firstfruit offered to God in resurrection. Eventually, we offer Christ to God as our Pentecost, which is the consummation of God’s work for His new creation. The food offered to God by the believers who experience Christ as the reality of all the feasts from Passover to Pentecost has nothing to do with the old creation but is altogether in the new creation. Eventually, the church in this age of grace will consummate God’s will in His new creation. The church will be matured and will be raptured to be one with Christ in His joyous wedding. Then the church will come down with Christ to the earth, at which time He will blow the trumpet to gather the Israelites back to the land of their fathers. Christ will then be their propitiation, and the feast of tabernacles will begin. </p>

Concerning Vows</h2><p data-content-id="rUqekoRmFH5ko70ziWtSa3fa2JZEL8JopHkKJur0RBOu5pxUAN_84W9dRCflBtDXA"> The statutes concerning vows follow the statutes concerning the offerings, which are God’s food. It is our duty, our responsibility, to present the offerings to God, whereas vows are voluntary. God wants us to do something more than carry out our duty and responsibility to fulfill His requirements. He would like us to do something additional—to make a vow to Him. An example of a particular vow is the vow of the Nazarite in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41698" data-verses="Numbers 6:1">Numbers 6</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="d38X8EOiMEk9dP_79EmbgyCRyomQg--9-XB3OqGiYKF1sxI6uIKUnB4ChkhxSbG8O"> In the church life today, we also have the two matters of fulfilling God’s requirements and of making a vow to Him. If we simply fulfill God’s requirements, we have not yet come up to the highest standard. We need to make a vow to God, volunteering ourselves in a definite and particular way. </p>
<p data-content-id="4MK-wePHgeEAEGgR-z7XxMO1hxRZhE7RGIluVa5oEpcHV3stVAVn4-Tc5CTQh0iYn"> According to church history, all those who were used by God to fulfill His New Testament ministry were volunteers. They not only fulfilled God’s requirements but also volunteered to make a vow to Him. John Nelson Darby is an example of such a person. He fulfilled God’s requirements, and he also made a vow, for the sake of the need in the church life, to remain unmarried. </p>
<p data-content-id="owSxjcqeZRVmxEIS3OihCH_syKldhdw0vmgvUEemAnltodyTzv6yHvYP90yMUcQyG"> The extent to which the Lord will use us depends on our vow. Of course, a vow is not limited to the matter of marriage. <span class="pg" data-page-id="304" id="304">[304]</span> We may make a vow to the Lord regarding many different things. The higher our vow is, the more the Lord will use us. </p>
<p data-content-id="3Y75k2O-GWhqOrdtGMwxT246DSats6BF3Ik8Rqg0fOcYDaq8QCBZ97FKiVycD9iDM"> I hope that many of the young people in the Lord’s recovery will be touched and inspired to make a vow to God. The Lord’s recovery needs young people who have made vows to God. A young person who volunteers to make a vow may say, “Lord, by Your mercy and grace I have fulfilled Your New Testament requirements. But I would like to do something additional. I would like to make a vow to live for You absolutely.” We all need to make some kind of vow to the Lord. </p>

Rather, he was to do according to all that proceeded out of his mouth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41700" data-verses="Numbers 30:2">v. 2b</span>). This indicates that when we make a vow to God, we must keep it. If we break our word, we will suffer loss. </p>

This indicates that in relation to God the Father and Christ the Lord, the believers have lost their human rights. Neither before God the Father nor before Christ the Lord do we have any rights. </p>
<p data-content-id="56Tr4kCk5lYCc-MpfN0cgf2VpYUNGnXmAb1tHSRy7tzGpsD_p3ykJtYvDxOHS7R3k"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41705" data-verses="Numbers 30:3-15">Numbers 30:3-15</span> reveals how strict God is in the matter of authority. A young woman living in her father’s house had to submit to her father. A married woman had to submit to her husband. However, a widow or a divorced woman was on her own. I do not want to be like a widow or a divorced woman. I prefer to have a father—God the Father—and a husband—Christ the Lord. How good it is to have God as our Father and Christ as our Husband! Because I have God as my Father and Christ as my Husband, I can be at peace. The worldly people, on the contrary, behave like widows and divorced women. Instead of having God as their Father and Christ as their Lord, they stand by themselves, bearing their responsibility. We are different from the worldly people. We are females with the Father and the Lord. We should bring everything to and let the final decisions be made by our Father and our Husband. </p>

The Midianites</h2><p data-content-id="pitQJ6wzw9SLef7XU0zpusQX_x8z_ho3XM7OLfBcppeT-qU_lUsjRuGVn988HowAD"> What do the Midianites signify? In typology, the Midianites signify the filthiness of the lust of the flesh, which is related to the devil Satan and the world. With the flesh there is lust, and with lust there is filthiness, defilement, which is related to Satan and the world. </p>
<p data-content-id="vAsrJ2nXSZSYEVPzp03QsO1U09TW9-L_Lgvah9JawmYMePT4WRb2Med_Jz2YQdYJK"> The Old Testament gives us a picture of the Midianites. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham, born of his second wife, Keturah. Hence, by nature they were close to the Israelites in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41710" data-verses="Genesis 25:1-2">Gen. 25:1-2</span>). The Midianites were <span class="pg" data-page-id="308" id="308">[308]</span> united with the Moabites, the descendants of Lot through incest in the lust of the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41711" data-verses="Numbers 22:3-4">Num. 22:3-4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41712" data-verses="Numbers 22:7">7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41713" data-verses="Genesis 19:30-38">Gen. 19:30-38</span>). Furthermore, the Midianites were one with the Ishmaelites, the descendants of Abraham by the flesh, who sold Joseph into Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41714" data-verses="Genesis 37:27-28">Gen. 37:27-28</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41715" data-verses="Genesis 37:36">36</span>). The Midianites were also connected with the Amalekites, the descendants of Esau (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41716" data-verses="Judges 6:3">Judg. 6:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41717" data-verses="Judges 6:33">33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41718" data-verses="Genesis 36:12">Gen. 36:12</span>). Finally, the Midianites produced Balaam, who ensnared the children of Israel in fornication and idolatry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41719" data-verses="Numbers 22:7">Num. 22:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41720" data-verses="Numbers 31:16">31:16</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="WtQg4gkFxRAg6KQBybFiBbH_jYISmMyCMdudfZSiSkioM0_3Ome8OLQclMyg824a5"> We need to realize that as we are pursuing the Lord’s interests, there is an enemy—the filthiness of the lust of the flesh signified by the Midianites—right behind us. This enemy has a number of evil relatives and associates. Moreover, with this enemy, this filthiness, a false prophet is hidden. This false prophet seeks to ensnare us and frustrate us from fulfilling God’s desire. </p>

The Commandment of Jehovah<br/>to Avenge the Sons of Israel on the Midianites</h2><p data-content-id="uVg-B0zfBhzFLu0-bfSRonwd6AB4eF9Rnw_t3_6v1pD3tO9lSNhdpPMAef8L-UIGR"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41721" data-verses="Numbers 31:1-2">verses 1 and 2</span> we have the commandment of Jehovah to avenge the sons of Israel on the Midianites. By ensnaring the sons of Israel in fornication and idolatry, the Midianites offended Israel to the uttermost, with the result that more than twenty thousand lives were lost. God would not forget that and He charged Moses to avenge Israel on the Midianites. The Midianites were to be defeated and completely destroyed. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyPWo9W_0hC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS">C. The Strategy of Moses</h2><p data-content-id="IflM7BbsLZ6u10ceoy3Hcptyef-Pm_DMYrFV0s5yiOLZE994aXHfO4p54nuE3Htm0"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41722" data-verses="Numbers 31:3-6">verses 3 through 6</span> we see the strategy of Moses in dealing with the Midianites. “Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah’s vengeance on Midian. You shall send a thousand from each of all the tribes of Israel to the war” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41723" data-verses="Numbers 31:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). Therefore, out of the thousands of Israel, there were twelve thousand armed for war (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41724" data-verses="Numbers 31:5">v. 5</span>). In addition, Moses sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the war, “as well as the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41725" data-verses="Numbers 31:6">v. 6</span>). Because Phinehas had a heart filled with God’s jealousy and had done something very <span class="pg" data-page-id="309" id="309">[309]</span> acceptable to God when Israel fell into fornication and idolatry, God wanted Moses to send him out with the vessels of the sanctuary and with the trumpets. The vessels were for protection, and the trumpets were for sounding the alarm. Phinehas must have had a sober mind and good discernment to see the way to protect the army of God and to know at what time and concerning what matters to sound the alarm. </p>
<p data-content-id="HPFjB-1Auz0yuOHKiO7sTGBB6-HuErvnZ-3dB9TpN-DIjpt7vl1AN1EJ-KBTMrfRS"> Moses’ strategy in fighting against the Midianites required that the children of Israel be in one accord with no dissenting opinions. In the record here we cannot see any opinion, even though there must have been many wise men among the more than six hundred thousand who had been renumbered. If we had been there, we might not have agreed with Moses’ charge to send a thousand from each tribe to war. Instead, we might have proposed that, since the tribes differed in number, the larger tribes should provide more armed men and the smaller tribes should provide fewer. We might have thought that Moses was too old to discern the situation and to devise the right strategy. A proposal such as this is actually a cloak covering an opinion. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41726" data-verses="Numbers 31:1">Numbers 31</span>, however, no one, not even the women, expressed an opinion. The people acted according to Moses’ strategy. This indicates that they were in one accord. </p>
<p data-content-id="XLLTDppJ60HGrEjQbd3j6QzU_VEvU58jcqP7x6v7IGu3acmlClR7B0TiVrBD0lZqc"> We also need to be in one accord for the Lord’s move in His recovery today. In 1984, after studying the situation of the Lord’s recovery, I came to realize that there was the need for us to take a new way. For this new way, we need to be in one accord. Concerning this, I had the burden to call the elders together for some urgent meetings. In these meetings, which were held in February 1986, I spoke on the matter of one accord for the Lord’s move. I told the brothers that I did not expect everyone to take the new way, but that my hope was that no one would criticize this way or oppose it. Criticism and opposition cause trouble and result in division. Using Gideon’s army as an illustration, I pointed out that this army defeated the enemy for the nation of Israel. I also said that a church that does not follow the new way is still a church, just as the Israelites who were not in Gideon’s army were still Israelites. My hope was that many would join me in the army <span class="pg" data-page-id="310" id="310">[310]</span> to fight for the Lord’s interests and that the remainder of the saints, instead of criticizing or opposing, would support the army. Nevertheless, soon after the start of the training in Taipei in August of the same year, certain brothers “jumped the gun” and, not waiting to see what the result of the training would be, began to criticize and oppose it. First these brothers criticized, and then they opposed. This was followed by their attacking the Lord’s recovery and their efforts to destroy it. We need to learn from this that, in order to be in one accord for the Lord’s move, we should not express our opinion but come back to the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="k1dF6aJscO4mjEVXwfZzsueldjNKXAM-f35W2Fgo9MGMHdxxaD2W6l_abXuvSctvM"> I believe that Israel’s victory over the Midianites was due to the fact that the children of Israel were in one accord. Both those who went out to fight in this war and those who did not were one with Moses. To be sure, many of those who stayed home prayed for those who went forth to fight. Eventually, because the people were in one accord, the plunder was distributed not only among those who fought but also among those who stayed home. There was one accord among the fighters, and there was one accord also among the rest of the children of Israel, including the women. All the people, the older ones and the younger ones alike, were in one accord. For this reason, they gained the victory. </p>

They also slew Balaam and the five kings of the Midianites (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41729" data-verses="Numbers 31:8">v. 8</span>). Furthermore, the Israelites took captive the women and children of the Midianites and took as plunder all their cattle, livestock, and goods (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41730" data-verses="Numbers 31:9">v. 9</span>). They also burned all the cities of the Midianites and all their encampments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41731" data-verses="Numbers 31:10">v. 10</span>), and then they brought all the spoil and all the plunder to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the assembly of the sons of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41732" data-verses="Numbers 31:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). All this was due to the one accord among the children of Israel. </p>

A Desire to Receive What God Had Promised </h2>
<p data-content-id="zlDFwvjlbRNSVPZMsJoAJoI-3voUl9T_qTJ0b8-Djp239rcyY1bn_iJnFc_BwAY5_"> The request of the two tribes, Reuben and Gad (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41753" data-verses="Numbers 32:1-5">vv. 1-5</span>), was not wrong, but neither was it right. Their desire was to receive what God had promised, according to their choice as the best, not according to God’s choice as the best. The desire to receive what God had promised was not wrong. However, they were not right in wanting to receive this according to their choice as the best. Eventually, their land was the first part of the land of Israel to be taken over by the <span class="pg" data-page-id="318" id="318">[318]</span> Gentile invaders from the east. The tribes of Reuben and Gad suffered, and this suffering was related to their having their own choice. </p>
<p data-content-id="aECWv_lTxwekQyYAZotobRkeHEFmniOA1d0SzbnD0g14YSu3QLsjuz5hjx3S9YWCt"> In spiritual matters it is terrible to do things according to our choice. Whatever is according to our choice will not turn out to be profitable. We may think that our choice is the best, but it is actually the worst. Therefore, in spiritual matters we should try not to act according to our choice. It is much better for us to leave matters in the hand of the Lord and let Him do according to His choice. </p>

This was the reason for their choice. </p>
<p data-content-id="yogGGgbIJieS7MU0cVjEXwTlNwPQCcAm9w46WVr1gAb6TJLAvX8-z2ryALdGL70w9"> Self-choice, even in the church life, comes from two things—considering what we have and need and considering how a particular situation or opportunity that we see in front of us fits in with our needs. This should not be our situation in the church life or in the service of the Lord. Both in the church life and in the Lord’s work, we need to resist the temptation to have our self-choice for the purpose of taking care of our own welfare. </p>
<p data-content-id="8Nao4cbRs9AiSNlXRQNA6zIb1F-PfC6ZUe2gLXackKJJ2QeSyCCiLybrCyWPJHWD_"> We need to learn the lesson of not considering what we have or what is in front of us but leaving our future in the hand of the Lord. We should not try to have our own choice in the church life or in the Lord’s service. If you insist on having your own choice, be prepared to suffer as a result. Our choice is not the best selection. We are shortsighted and somewhat selfish, so it is difficult for us to be pure in motive, desire, intention, goal, and purpose. We should be willing to give up our choice and tell the Lord that we do not have any choice of our own. </p>

Here Moses was rebuking them for their selfishness. Moses seemed to be saying, “You are considering the welfare of your tribes. What about the other tribes?

This word indicates that they thought of themselves as quite capable, able to bring all the people to their place. In their self-confidence they dared to make such a promise. Instead of saying, “until we have brought them to their place,” they should have said, “until the Lord has brought them to their place.” </p>

These verses reveal that, after driving out the devilish inhabitants of the land, they were to destroy all the idols and high places, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="324" id="324">[324]</span> places where the idols were worshipped. Only then would they be qualified to take possession of the land and enjoy it. </p>
<p data-content-id="i-M7ojiJqGoJd-LWYW0H3PtKTKIEy22u_R9o2QysidURajdNowaOAucBwqV_zFWnD"> The principle is the same concerning our enjoyment of Christ today. Christ has been given to us as our portion for our enjoyment, yet there is a condition which we must fulfill in order to have this enjoyment. This condition is that we cooperate with God’s ordination to drive out everything in us which is other than God and Christ. This means that we must destroy all the idols within us. An idol is anything other than God that occupies us. A degree, a good job, a nice house, a position or rank, a good name—all these can become idols occupying us. We must destroy any idols that may be in us and not leave any ground within us for the worship of idols. Without dealing with the idols in us, we cannot have the genuine enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="1q83V7kEkTSAS8FhlVDsgxTbJR03QFqsrqbsu0A6Y9sDz6OYDLPkVWCpO4FO6tj8_"> Some may talk about the enjoyment of Christ, but for them this is merely a slogan. Whether or not we can have the real enjoyment of Christ depends upon the extent to which there is a clearance of our inner being. Today Christ as the good land is in us, but the enjoyment of this good land requires an absolute clearance of anything other than God that occupies us. To give even a little ground to the worship of something other than God will annul our enjoyment of Christ. May we all have a thorough clearing away of every kind of idol so that we can enjoy Christ as the good land. </p>

Here we see that the children of Israel were to inherit the land according to two things: according to their tribes and according to the lot. The size of the tribes was a matter of the increase in life, and the lot was a matter of God’s sovereignty. This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ today mainly depends on our increase in life and on God’s sovereignty. <span class="pg" data-page-id="325" id="325">[325]</span> </p>

If God’s people had not driven out the inhabitants, those whom they had allowed to remain would have been as pricks in their eyes and as thorns in their sides. Moreover, these inhabitants would have troubled them in the land where they dwelt, and God would have done to them as He thought to do to those inhabitants. This means that the portion of the Gentiles under God’s curse would have become the portion of Israel. </p>

In Himself, Christ is universally vast and does not vary in size, but our experience of this Christ may vary greatly and be different in size. For some, Christ may be only a narrow strip of land; for others, He may be a very large territory. Just as our experience of Christ as the offerings may be in different sizes—a ram, a lamb, or a pigeon—so our experience of Christ as the good land may also vary in size. </p>

<p data-content-id="k1dF6aJscO4mjEVXwfZzsvelVz9KXAM-f35W2Fgo9MGMHdxxaD2W6l_abXuvSctvM"> The Levites were not priests directly but were the serving ones of the priesthood. This means that they served the priesthood. In the priesthood, or in the ministry of the priests, there were many business affairs that required the service of the Levites. The Levites, therefore, were a tribe separated to these business affairs. As such a separated tribe, the Levites were not given a portion of the good land.

Forty-eight is a meaningful number. According to its spiritual significance, this number can be composed in two ways. The first way is six multiplied by eight. The number six denotes man, who was created by God on the sixth day. God spent six days in creating the old creation, and man was the completion of God’s creation. The number eight signifies resurrection. The eighth day, the day after the Sabbath, was the beginning of a new week. The man <span class="pg" data-page-id="330" id="330">[330]</span> who was created on the sixth day became fallen. However, man has been saved in resurrection and into resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="7yTIaBOhlCkC6wnzpdOnl4f80SO4cU6JN5dp73tdKZs9iz_xB3_gpvjWsQcHJJNa-"> The forty-eight cities given to the Levites signify the natural man, who became fallen, being brought into resurrection through the Levitical service. The Levitical service was a service to the priesthood, and the goal of the priesthood was to bring fallen man back to God in resurrection. The number of cities given to the Levites thus signifies the purpose of the Levitical service. </p>
<p data-content-id="_hRt6BaEalb59wfF8M4rJdE13m0pSheCpOP0cpOmV8IJSJlfGzEGzh_y08rbJRoeV"> The number forty-eight is also composed of four multiplied by twelve. Like the number six, the number four also signifies man as God’s creature. Twelve is the number of perfection and completion in God’s eternal administration. Hence, the number forty-eight as composed of four multiplied by twelve indicates that man, created by God, will be perfected and completed in the eternal administration of God. </p>

The high priest here signifies Christ, who died for our sins. The Old Testament saints like Abraham, David, and Isaiah remained, spiritually speaking, in the city of refuge until Christ died. This was a refuge prior to direct salvation. Since Christ, our High Priest, has died, He is our refuge, not in the Old Testament sense but in the New Testament sense. This refuge is a matter of direct salvation. Christ has died and has resurrected, and now we are in Him, not merely as a refuge in the Old Testament sense but as our direct salvation. Christ is both the refuge and the direct salvation. Before His death, He was the refuge for the Old Testament saints. But now, after His death, He is our direct salvation. </p>

<p data-content-id="8Nao4cbRs9AiSNlXRQNA6wYbyVePfC6ZUe2gLXackKJJ2QeSyCCiLybrCyWPJHWD_"> Before we consider <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41824" data-verses="Numbers 36:1">chapter thirty-six</span> of Numbers, I would like to say a further word on two matters concerning the refuge cities in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41825" data-verses="Numbers 35:1">chapter thirty-five</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="0I15hg85dOcthbcFQOxX-cHEhn-bfxmdReoS22AKOrqla8tAqHC6ayC5UH6a1tzmM"> First, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41826" data-verses="Numbers 35:25-29">35:25b-29</span>, the rescued killer was to remain in the city of refuge and live in it until the death of the high priest, who signifies Christ, who died for our sins. Since we, the believers in Christ, have God’s direct salvation, how should we apply the type of remaining in the refuge city until the death of the high priest? In the Old Testament time, Christ had not yet died, and those who fled into Him as their refuge had to wait there until He came and died on the cross. For the Old Testament saints, therefore, the refuge was like the sheepfold in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41827" data-verses="John 10:1">John 10:1</span>, which signifies the law, or Judaism as the religion of the law, in which God’s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody and ward until Christ came. </p>
<p data-content-id="7yTIaBOhlCkC6wnzpdOnl7v89AO4cU6JN5dp73tdKZs9iz_xB3_gpvjWsQcHJJNa-"> Since the Old Testament age is over, do we today still have a city of refuge, or do we only have God’s direct salvation? I would like to answer this question in relation to the assurance of salvation. As far as the forgiveness of sins and the assurance of salvation are concerned, many believers are still in the Old Testament. They seem to be waiting for this assurance to be given some time in the future. For example, if you ask such a believer if his sins have been forgiven, he might say, “I do not know. I have fled into Christ and I am in Christ, but I am not sure that my sins are forgiven. I may not have this assurance until I die. Only then will I know for <span class="pg" data-page-id="338" id="338">[338]</span> sure that I am going to heaven.” Such a believer is taking Christ as his city of refuge. However, we who believe in Christ may have the assurance of salvation and the assurance that our sins have been forgiven. We should be able to say to those who have fled into Christ as their refuge city, “Since you have entered into Christ and are in Him, your sins have been forgiven. Christ has already died for you and for your sins. His redeeming death on your behalf has already been accomplished. Since Christ died for your sins, your sins have surely been forgiven.” A believer who receives this word will no longer be like the Old Testament saints waiting in the city of refuge but will enjoy God’s direct salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="_hRt6BaEalb59wfF8M4rJe01_0kpSheCpOP0cpOmV8IJSJlfGzEGzh_y08rbJRoeV"> The point we need to see here is that there is an important, dispensational difference in the significance of the refuge cities for the Old Testament saints and for us today. In the Old Testament age, the refuge cities were places in which to hide and to wait for the death of the high priest. Those who enter into Christ today may do so with the assurance that He has already died and that their sins have already been forgiven. Christ died for us even before we were born. Now we simply need to apply what He has done for us, saying, “O Lord Jesus, I love You. You died for me before I was born. Hallelujah, my sins have been forgiven, and I have been released!” </p>
<p data-content-id="6EZ7oiut5G7ZYj3fVU9kQGYzOcXLkv2-BMvHT6O93qKj4EGth2ACU0vty01b6A_6D"> Second, God ordained that there were to be six refuge cities, three beyond the Jordan and three in the land of Canaan. This arrangement was according to God’s creation and sovereignty. God created the river Jordan and the land on the east and on the west of the Jordan. In type, the two groups of three refuge cities testify and declare to the universe that the Triune God is living on earth among human beings to be their city of refuge. </p>
<p data-content-id="R2qYnpqtRGomTlcXmAAH1N08F19Q7C-wTRkJI_Sw9RV5N2W8gemugfOv9FQXr9QVG"> Furthermore, the distribution of the six refuge cities in different places indicates that the Triune God is near and available. No matter where we may be, Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, is near and available. Because He is everywhere, He is wherever we may be. The Triune God has spread among men to be a city of refuge for all those who make mistakes. We all have made mistakes and continue to <span class="pg" data-page-id="339" id="339">[339]</span> make mistakes daily, but the Triune God has spread to the very place where we are. Now we simply need to turn to Him and come into Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="sagbDhA7pAxvKgcwYTawV5bsKh8CNiozwYjsNXQN0-DGbiFNnmUF8HY7mxgZVUtzf"> Now, as the final matter pertaining to the prearrangement of the distribution of the good land, let us consider the statute in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41828" data-verses="Numbers 36:1-13">36:1-13</span>. </p>

<p data-content-id="Cmeet7LFEwA83Buuyy4WhrwGfgbqBpX55w_jk3kONkrrJH7N7b1Pyn3Qqcfwcq2SE"> Here we see a difference between the view of the sisters and the view of the brothers. Often the sisters are finer than the brothers in their concept and opinion; however, the sisters may be shortsighted. The daughters of Zelophehad were very fine in their concept, considering their father’s house, but they were shortsighted, not considering <span class="pg" data-page-id="340" id="340">[340]</span> the tribe as a whole. The heads of the fathers’ houses had a view concerning the whole tribe and therefore requested the same kind of land for their tribe.

<p data-content-id="lGJMqXpxLr00FAOi_3oq63bbr0dyiel3q9IrhyEOb-mti2DuXEIULfVfV-8aXxhkd"> In this message we will begin to present a vital sketch of the divine revelation in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers concerning God’s economy with His chosen and redeemed people. We may use four slogans to summarize certain crucial aspects of this sketch: “Purchased, redeemed, and saved from the bondage of the fall”; “Enjoying Christ, receiving revelation, and being built up in the Triune God”; “Formed into a priestly army to fight for God and to journey with God”; and “Possessed by God to possess the all-inclusive Christ as the good land.” These slogans are a mingling of Old Testament typology and the fulfillment of this typology in the New Testament. This should not be surprising since the two sections of the Bible, the Old Testament and the New Testament, are one. We may say that the New Testament is hidden in the Old Testament and that the Old Testament is manifested in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="OZSjkV5USBSK_MP1WUozBk3LrkluazrsJs9t6GIBcxwgHMpXkI44nN0BaekRScDuy"> These four slogans apply to the saints in both the Old Testament and New Testament. The saints have been chosen, redeemed, and saved from the bondage of the fall. The Old Testament saints were saved from bondage in Egypt, and we have been saved from the bondage of Satan. Having been saved, we are now enjoying Christ. Like the children of Israel at Mount Sinai, we have also received the divine revelation and are being built up with the processed Triune God. We are being built up with the Son as the embodiment of the Father <span class="pg" data-page-id="346" id="346">[346]</span> and with the Spirit as the realization of the Son. Furthermore, we are being formed into a priestly army. The term priestly army may be an Old Testament term, but it also fits the New Testament fulfillment of Old Testament typology. This priestly army fights for God and journeys with God. While we are fighting for God and for His kingdom, we are journeying with Him. Finally, we have been prepared by God in every way to possess the all-inclusive Christ as the good land. This preparation is revealed in the last five chapters of Numbers, where we see the prearrangement of the distribution of the good land. This prearrangement was the preparation of God’s people to enter into the land and possess it. </p>
<p data-content-id="4MK-wePHgeEAEGgR-z7XxO-1ojxZhE7RGIluVa5oEpcHV3stVAVn4-Tc5CTQh0iYn"> In this message and in the four following messages, we will present a vital sketch of the divine revelation in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers concerning God’s economy with His chosen and redeemed people. The word economy is not used in the Old Testament, but it is found in the New Testament, especially in the writings of Paul, which strongly emphasize the matter of God’s economy. Although this word may not be used in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, the typology in these books unveils God’s economy. God’s economy is His administration with His plan, His purpose, and His arrangement to accomplish His plan and attain His purpose for the fulfillment of the desire of His heart. This desire is to have a people not only created by Him but also regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Eventually, this people will be brought into glory, into the expression of the Triune God. This is God’s economy. In the Old Testament we have a picture of God’s economy; in the New Testament we have a clear speaking concerning God’s economy. </p>

God brought the people out of Egypt to the mountain of God, Mount Sinai, and there gave them a full revelation of His dwelling place among the human race on earth. We may say the revelation contained the “blueprints” for the building of God’s dwelling place. In order to dwell among the human race, God needs a people who are not only chosen and redeemed but also ready to receive the divine revelation concerning Him and His dwelling place. As the book of Exodus shows us, God’s people did receive this revelation and they built the tabernacle according to it. When the tabernacle was set up, God’s glory descended upon it. </p>

To Receive the Divine Revelation<br/>concerning God Himself<br/>That They Might Be Separated<br/>unto the Holy God as His Sanctified People</h2><p data-content-id="ERNBZk2fVc6bxOiCk-X4K7cn6renRx3McXQ0hmXB6AJkXe9nyhLoNBrjCzDoOcA-M"> At Mount Sinai God’s people received the revelation concerning God Himself that they might be separated unto the holy God as His sanctified people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41859" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exo. 20—24</span>). By the revelation of God Himself, we refer to the law. The law is a portrait of God. Before the children of Israel received the revelation concerning God’s building, God gave them a portrait of Himself to show them what kind of God He is. The law reveals that God is a God of love and light and that He is holy and righteous. Therefore, love, light, holy, and righteous are crucial words describing the characteristics of the almighty, Triune God. As the God of love and light, He is altogether holy; that is, He is uncommon, different, and separate from everything else in the universe. Furthermore, God is altogether righteous. He is righteous with Himself, He is righteous in all He does, and He is righteous toward man and all His creatures. This is God as He is revealed in the picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41860" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exodus 20—24</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="DxVzNnfEqnwJJe7GyfHvcPQRQ_ybfwglxmBI07FipOB6QgwVm01HCCfjmiwJXMqx5"> In the New Testament we have a description of God, but we do not have a picture of God. John tells us clearly that God is love and light, and Paul tells us that the very God who is love and light is absolutely holy and righteous. </p>
<p data-content-id="Se-6za1KSJE4D3ovoN7310q9mAnOfZxM7ef9Yu5iYbmakYgNBSFmwp3_76eSfWWkE"> The Ten Commandments are a type signifying Christ as the portrait of God, as the expression of God’s image. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41861" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> says that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, is the express image of God’s substance.

By studying the commandments of the law, we can see that God is love and light and that He is holy and righteous. Because the law is such a <span class="pg" data-page-id="349" id="349">[349]</span> picture of God, the law was called the testimony of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41862" data-verses="Exodus 25:16">Exo. 25:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41863" data-verses="Exodus 25:21">21</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41864" data-verses="Exodus 31:18">31:18</span>). The ark in which the law was placed was called the ark of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41865" data-verses="Exodus 25:22">Exo. 25:22</span>), and the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41866" data-verses="Exodus 38:21">Exo. 38:21</span>). In the Psalms the law is often referred to as the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41867" data-verses="Psalms 19:7">Psa. 19:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41868" data-verses="Psalms 25:10">25:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41869" data-verses="Psalms 119:2">119:2</span>).

<p data-content-id="ezw1IvP5hJlLyGzJuXCM3diQo7QUre2non4KkPYaTfhE1FqPcM2yCoPnLNpUj9vS2"> God’s people received the revelation concerning God Himself so that they might be separated unto the holy God as His sanctified people. This matter is given particular emphasis in the book of Leviticus. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41870" data-verses="Leviticus 11:44">Leviticus 11:44</span> says, “I am Jehovah your God; you shall therefore sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am holy.” </p>

Now we will see that God’s chosen and redeemed people also need frustrations. Do you believe that you need frustrations? Whether you believe this or not, the fact remains that frustrations occur and, in a sense, actually are needed. Let us now consider the different kinds of frustrations suffered by God’s chosen and redeemed people on their journey to the God-promised good land. </p>

Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="41918" data-verses="Numbers 16:3">16:3</span>).

This matter of jealousy concerning position and <span class="pg" data-page-id="364" id="364">[364]</span> leadership has always been a problem among God’s people. Often, those who are jealous in this way have ambition but do not have the capacity to match their ambition. Throughout the history of God’s people, rebellion has been caused by the combination of ambition and the lack of capacity. This was the situation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="41919" data-verses="Numbers 16:1">Numbers 16</span>.

Second, this sketch shows us that, in addition to enjoying Christ, receiving the revelation, being built up with the Triune God, and being formed into a priestly army, this people also needs to be disciplined. In order to be disciplined, God’s people in the Old Testament had to pass through certain difficulties. This is something which we need to realize today. The more difficulties we pass through, the more useful we will be to the Lord. Third, this vital sketch reveals that God’s chosen and redeemed people needed to undergo different kinds of frustrations. As a result of all these things, God’s people were ready to take possession of the God-promised land. <span class="pg" data-page-id="368" id="368">[368]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="AQYzzKQWYTkaFQeLtwXyH8zl6s-ydiCBfKdc5vmfXuwsxv0xS9OBpDz-8zAqA_-Qz"> With the exception of Joshua and Caleb, those who were qualified and ready to take possession of the land were younger ones. They were of the second generation. The older ones, those of the first generation, had passed through many things and had learned many lessons. However, they were not qualified to enter into the land. The lessons learned by the first generation surely became part of the heritage passed on to the second generation. Their children certainly inherited from their parents all the lessons they learned during the forty years in the wilderness. By their birth the younger ones were put into a position to inherit the tradition of their family and all that their parents had experienced. </p>
<p data-content-id="uVg-B0zfBhzFLu0-bfSRpngd6BB4eF9Rnw_t3_6v1pD3tO9lSNhdpPMAef8L-UIGR"> I believe that the fathers spoke to their children about their experiences in Egypt, in the exodus from Egypt, and in the wilderness. No doubt, the fathers spoke about how they were cruelly treated as slaves in Egypt, about how God in His mercy sent Moses to deliver them from bondage, about how they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month, and about how they marched out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea. The fathers must have also explained to their children that they entered into the wilderness without food but that God fed them with manna and supplied them with water from the smitten rock. They might have also explained that although they eventually felt that manna was loathsome, they nevertheless appreciated it. The people did not grow any crops, but for forty years they daily received the heavenly supply of manna. Furthermore, the younger ones learned about Moses and about the great help he rendered to the people of Israel. Moses himself was not allowed to enter into the good land, but he contributed many constructive factors to God’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="fndt9411axAVKvBxLHCyOW49W-0hC3DONB6RBD28hKonHHflYbd5G2mVvJ13xd0TS"> The second generation did not pass through as much as the first generation did, but they received the benefit of what the first generation experienced. I believe that the older generation told the younger generation about all they experienced, enjoyed, and suffered. This speaking was part of the raising up, or the building up, of the second generation. What the first generation experienced was not experienced in vain, for it was passed on to the second generation. What the older <span class="pg" data-page-id="369" id="369">[369]</span> ones experienced actually was not effective for them, but it was very effective in building up the younger ones. Therefore, God was able to prepare from the second generation more than six hundred thousand men with a rich inheritance and strong background who were qualified to be formed into an army to fight with Him and for Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="IflM7BbsLZ6u10ceoy3Hdp9yee-Pm_DMYrFV0s5yiOLZE994aXHfO4p54nuE3Htm0"> The principle is the same with us in the Lord’s recovery today. The recovery has been in the United States for twenty-seven years and has passed through many things. Do you think that all these things have been in vain? They certainly have not been in vain. These things are being passed on to the younger ones in the Lord’s recovery and will be very effective in building them up and preparing them to fight with God and for God. The younger ones in the Lord’s recovery have a rich inheritance.
