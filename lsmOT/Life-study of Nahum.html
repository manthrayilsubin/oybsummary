Both books deal with the city of Nineveh, but whereas Jonah brought, or extended, God’s salvation to that sinful city, Nahum brought God’s judgment upon Nineveh. Jonah reveals that God in His salvation is the God of all the peoples of the earth, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles. Nahum reveals that God is also the God of all peoples in His judgment. Thus, God is the God of all peoples both in judgment and in salvation. </p>
<p data-content-id="EgR879v3ntwRKp0i6TdGdH1CVJBgHn97XSHPm6d4vyUFU9UPvfrViWwxSaw0l1D0S"> The book of Nahum shows us why God judges a city. In this book we see both the fact and the cause of God’s judgment on Nineveh. God extended His salvation to Nineveh, but Nineveh was sinful and invaded Israel. </p>

History tells us that Nahum grew up in Galilee, in a town called Elkosha, which is near Capernaum. The name <em>Capernaum</em> may mean “the city of Nahum,” indicating that it had much to do with Nahum. Although Nahum was a northerner, the place of his ministry was in the south. </p>

The cities of Babel and Nineveh were built by Nimrod (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60252" data-verses="Genesis 10:8-11">Gen. 10:8-11</span>) and became the capitals of the nations of Babylon and Assyria. Nimrod, the first type of Antichrist, was the first to oppose God, and both of these nations were strong figures of mankind in their opposing of God. Actually, Assyria was the first nation to come and devastate Israel, invading Israel in 713 B.C. (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60253" data-verses="2Kings 18:13">2 Kings 18:13—19:37</span>), more than one hundred years before the Babylonian invasion in 606 B.C. </p>

Nineveh was built on the Tigris River and was completely surrounded by water. This was a protection to Nineveh.

First, the Assyrians came to devastate Israel. Then God used Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar to defeat the Assyrians, and this became a kind of deliverance to Israel. </p>

The chapter goes on to describe in detail the devastation of the people of Nineveh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60282" data-verses="Nahum 3:2-17">vv. 2-17</span>). Significantly, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60283" data-verses="Nahum 3:17">verse 17</span> mentions locusts. “Your princes are like the locust swarm, / And your officials are like hordes of locusts, / Which camp in the hedges / On a cold day, / But when the sun arises, they flee away, / And the place where they are is unknown.” This indicates that the Assyrians also were locusts devastating Israel.

<p data-content-id="QmmLA78KF3kj-3vfQj2mf3xYprKQz-aOqFx4Gr8nP9Mxbk44gVcc-n2jHf-Sixopn"> The main point of the book of Nahum is that while God was chastising Israel and punishing the nations, He always did what was necessary to preserve Israel for the purpose of manifesting Christ. God’s wonderful preserving act was carried out by the locusts. God used one kind of locust to deal with another kind of locust in order to preserve Israel. God’s purpose in preserving Israel is to bring forth Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="K-muXwl1_PtWrglOhWn16QrRfxXc9lxyPU8JmyG7W5JVDKoP4ssqyfC-T8LPrRU1X"> Although this book does not say anything about Christ directly and does not refer to Christ, the goal is still the manifestation of Christ. The preserving of Israel is for the purpose that Christ might have a channel—the reserved and preserved Israel—through which to be brought forth. Regarding this, all the minor prophets are one, and the book of Nahum is just one small link on the chain of their revelation. Thus, once again we see that, according to the minor prophets, God’s chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations are for the manifestation of Christ. </p>
