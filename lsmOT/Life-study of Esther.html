<p data-content-id="2RfXrKJhp2YqFxn_5thsbs-2I_q_f-8hMV7G901h4wNqdMQS6yYTynUSXuUZa1MaU"> With this message we begin the life-study of the book of Esther. Esther is a sweet book, covering, as its central subject, the secret care and the open salvation of the hiding God in Israel’s captivity. God is omnipresent and also omnipotent, yet He is hiding. Nobody knows where He is. </p>
<p data-content-id="uq7aZ7Jfj1scTi9nfOwHXLVFvI18FWsWqggIC4aQaqBSej0-sCd5NOCv9h9ysLF8K"> The people of Israel had been scattered, dispersed, in their captivity. They probably told the Gentiles among whom they were living that their God was Jehovah. Gentiles, especially the rulers, might have said to the Israelites, “Where is your Jehovah? Is your Jehovah real and living? If He is, why are you here in captivity as slaves?” During the years of the captivity, God was hiding, and He is still hiding. Even today, in the church age, God is hiding Himself. Both for the children of Israel and for us today, it seems that there is no God in this universe. We need to realize that God is living and real, but He is hiding. He is a God who hides Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47193" data-verses="Isaiah 45:15">Isa. 45:15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="fN9hkaPFcZdp2C7teLZL_Gld58GCdQ0v3AR4HNfIE4RkGUg5qAmV0qYhoFm_Dh6xh"> Because God’s people became degraded and rotten, God disciplined and punished them by handing them over as slaves to the Gentile nations. Yet in His severity there is mercy (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47194" data-verses="Romans 11:22">Rom. 11:22</span>). While the people of Israel were in dispersion and captivity, God was taking care of them in a hidden way, and at the right time He came in openly to save them. Even when the captives of Israel were in the lowest situation, at the bottom, Christ was among them, suffering with them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47195" data-verses="Zechariah 1:7-17">Zech. 1:7-17</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="INSpSfIK9dk2baTcu86ZpFWw8XC21I4A0Swh_I8NAiyP1wSzK4-GkKa5pVgC0k248"> On the one hand, God used the Gentile nations as tools to discipline His people. On the other hand, the hiding God was with the people of Israel, caring for them. Eventually, God used the Medo-Persian Empire to overthrow the Babylonian Empire. Cyrus, the king of Persia, was even called God’s shepherd, one who would fulfill His desire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47196" data-verses="Isaiah 44:28">Isa. 44:28</span>), and His anointed, one who would serve God’s purpose (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47197" data-verses="Isaiah 45:1-4">45:1-4</span>). From this we see that the hiding God did many things for Israel in a secret way. </p>

This is the reason that this book does not mention the name of God even at occasions when the name of God should be mentioned (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47201" data-verses="Esther 4:3">Esth. 4:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47202" data-verses="Esther 4:16">16</span>).

The king commanded that the queen come before him wearing the royal crown in order that he might present her to those attending the banquet. However, the queen refused to come at the king’s command. As a result of her disobedience the queen was deposed, and the position of queen became vacant. </p>

Esther saved the king from being assassinated, telling the king in Mordecai’s name of those who planned to assassinate him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47209" data-verses="Esther 2:19-23">vv. 19-23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="CpBXMVIs74oH82PXNNzz3yLA3NOjy0dP8FNVBsr9zFQdg_KO07mrBD-J_y79rk0ar"> Our God is omnipresent, omnipotent, merciful, and full of forgiveness. Although He is such a God, He is also the hiding God. Because our God is a hiding God, others may check with us and ask, “Where is your God? Where is His kingdom?” <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> When we are questioned in such a manner, we may want to answer in this way: “My God is hidden. I cannot see Him, and you cannot see Him either. But you need to realize that sooner or later my hidden God will come in to do something on my behalf and to deal with those who do not believe in Him.” </p>
<p data-content-id="PZL0yOiqwKNH_okBBpq6TsZnIMDAq58gGTs8ZSSp4s1BOvW6UnadHSmdzhAJ0TjLt"> I can testify concerning this from my experience. More than forty-five years ago, I, along with several other co-workers, was arrested and imprisoned by a small Chinese army that betrayed China and worked for the Japanese military police. The entire Christian community in that city was shocked, because they knew that we could very easily be executed like other Chinese who had fallen into the hands of the Japanese invading army. We did not know what to expect, but the hiding God intervened in a wonderful way using a particular person as an Esther. </p>
<p data-content-id="-Ac8Oa8CoW6KbriDt5CRfl1JQ0TQo-laYYtFuUZGSZngmUd6AGZzHyJLOxo19-TWs"> The wife of the captain of the Chinese army under the Japanese military police had been the wife of a schoolmate of mine who had died of tuberculosis. When he was dying, his wife asked me to visit him, and I did so and had an intimate conversation with him. He eventually died, and some time later she remarried. After I was arrested and imprisoned, a medical doctor who was meeting both with us and with other Christians heard about my situation. He then went to speak to the woman who had married the captain of that Chinese army. The two were close friends, and the doctor who was meeting with us told the woman that I and several others had been imprisoned and that she should ask her husband to release us. She spoke to her husband about us that very day. He loved her and was willing to fulfill her request. </p>
<p data-content-id="pykTx87B0aVA7I9gwCWk-glBSdGYbfv46E8HlTixCgUOW3sH4YHFTYhmjyNTCWRhE"> That night he appeared to judge our case. We were taken from our cells and stood before him to be judged. I was the first one to be examined by him. He looked at me, asked me my name, and told me that everything was all right and that I was free to go home peacefully. He said the same thing to the others who had been arrested with me. At the time none of us knew what had taken place behind the scene. Later I realized that, in His secret wisdom, the hiding God had prepared an Esther for us. He had raised up a Chinese widow to become <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> the wife of the man who would judge our case. Just as the king of Persia listened to Esther and did what she said out of his love for her, so this man listened to his wife and released us from prison. This surely was due to the care of the hiding God. </p>
<p data-content-id="vhUZx41-8InaLh6EaF5OrT80BNfGju_ZGoNVbyWg4CRQuTWPfgDvwM4jH208ffwpj"> Today we need to realize that the omnipotent God whom we are serving is still hiding Himself, especially when He is helping us. We cannot see Him, and apparently He is not doing anything for us. Actually, He is with us all the time and, in a hidden way, He is doing many things for us. </p>

Although they fasted for their supplication to God, contrary to what we would expect, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47218" data-verses="Esther 4:16">verse 16</span> there is no mention of the name of God.

The king found in the records the report of how Mordecai had saved him from being assassinated by two of his eunuchs, and he decided to bestow honor and dignity <span class="pg" data-page-id="9" id="9">[9]</span> on Mordecai. While the king was considering this, Haman came into the court to ask the king about hanging Mordecai (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47221" data-verses="Esther 6:2-6">vv. 2-6</span>). The king was thinking about honoring Mordecai, and Haman was thinking about hanging him. When the king asked Haman what should be done for the man whom the king desires to honor, Haman answered, “Let a royal robe be brought, one which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal crown has been set. And let the robe and the horse be delivered into the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes; and let them array the man whom the king desires to honor and make him ride on horseback through the street of the city; and let them proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king desires to honor” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47222" data-verses="Esther 6:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>). At this juncture, the king commanded Haman to put on Mordecai a royal robe which the king had worn, make Mordecai ride through the street of the city on a horse on which the king had ridden, and proclaim before Mordecai, “Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king desires to honor” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47223" data-verses="Esther 6:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>).

The king immediately sentenced Haman to death and commanded his men to hang Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai.

<p data-content-id="xtX4pDcU6Kub4MIqKjS08NoGX2JiiSsO1Zd0yscO1ETg4rBeGhynsgqZpBamV-zK4"> We need to see that there is not only an eschatology of the world, the study of the end of the world situation, but also an eschatology of the church. Our study of this crucial matter is according to the divine revelation of the Scriptures. We believers in Christ are not only in the world but also in the church. The genuine church exists within Christianity. Christianity has become very great and includes mainly the Catholic Church and the Protestant church. The Catholic Church and the Protestant church were not there at the time of the apostle Paul. What was there at his time was the original and recovered church. The recovered church refers to the original church. These two are one. </p>
<p data-content-id="rAH76o_68GTPrQ0S93IoMFfd0KE1luT92DmH8unXnLQXRzacVP7MDc1uWihXrS9o7"> Paul rebuked the Corinthian believers in his first Epistle to them by telling them that they were trying to divide Christ. There were various parties in Corinth who were saying, “I am of Paul,” “I am of Apollos,” and “I am of Cephas.” The self-supposed “spiritual” ones said, “I am of Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47250" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:12-13">1:12-13a</span>). Thus, there were four divisions in Corinth. The church in Corinth was an original church, but it had degraded; it had lost something. At that juncture Paul wrote them. His Epistles to them were recovery books; they recovered the church in Corinth. </p>
<p data-content-id="dryNLDyUWbQ2ptJRRlWSmnbIhfHwRdO4-pGLLxgNW68EhkBgJv47nqjfHo9YIhiwB"> By reading Paul’s second Epistle to Timothy, we can also see that at Paul’s time the church had degraded. Some had left the Christian faith. Others, like Alexander the coppersmith, opposed Paul to the uttermost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47251" data-verses="2Timothy 4:14">4:14</span>). But Paul himself declared that he had kept the faith (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47252" data-verses="2Timothy 4:7">v. 7</span>). Second Timothy is a book of recovery. The original church existed only for about <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> half a century. The apostles established the original church within less than fifty years. But while Peter, John, and Paul were still living, the church fell from its original state to a degraded state, a deformed state, and even a transmuted state. This is why the Epistles were written. All the “second” letters of Peter, John, and Paul (e.g., 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, 2 Corinthians, etc.) were letters of recovery. All these letters were for recovering the lost church. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q91UofsTSdmi7kuWjXcAC-VlgMdzVyfRQuExdTnpoLbLwN7jFthXpBG0Df-ipIL7D"> At John’s time, some even said that Christ never came in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47253" data-verses="1John 4:2-3">1 John 4:2-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47254" data-verses="2John 1:7">2 John 7</span>). Others said that Christ was not the Son of God but eventually became the Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47255" data-verses="1John 2:22-23">1 John 2:22-23</span>). The church had become deformed, changed in form, and transmuted, changed in nature. Thus, John wrote to the believers to recover them. At the time of the apostles we can see the original and recovered church. </p>
<p data-content-id="K9Jga13Wk8Z0XH2MXs_Ct37UrfO4Us5-ry_q9rNH32RsOEiEBmmmCNhA34iSxMYnG"> The recovered church came into being just a little later than the original church. The original church lasted only for a short time. It was born into a sick situation, an unhealthy environment. When the apostle Paul was sent by the Holy Spirit from Antioch to Asia to preach the gospel and to set up churches, the opposing Jews came to frustrate him. After the churches were established, the Gnostics came in to make trouble. Thus, the church became sick either from Judaism or Gnosticism. The original church did not last too long, but God would not let the church be lost without any kind of recovery. This is why the Lord as the Head of the Body charged the apostles Peter, John, and Paul to write their later Epistles to recover the church. We have to realize that the Lord’s recovery began at the end of the first century. In every century afterward, the Lord raised up a number of “Ezras” and “Nehemiahs” to recover, to reconstitute, the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="lfXnv4lE-ySi66d3e2_iDRKL9fE0CYBhbFfVS5vT5gRGDvKbRJFQexP-Z4-kPk1oN"> In the first five centuries, there was only the original and recovered church. Then near the end of the sixth century the Catholic Church came into existence. At that time the pope was recognized as the authority of the Catholic Church. The Protestant church came into existence at the time of Martin Luther during the Reformation in the sixteenth century. Today there are still these three kinds of churches. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="OE4kUBamkbdHKYiWFKgYtERmyuz5pr9jrRaxQp-HtKT91r8hYrGn8Yeo3xe5GYUBL"> The church of the recovery is always taking a narrow way. All of those who participate in the recovered church learn the special lessons in the Christian life. They learn to know Christ, to know themselves, and to know the flesh. They learn how to be crucified to live the God-man life. All the members of the church should be God-men because the church is formed with the deified man. The high truth of God becoming a man that man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead was discovered by the church fathers in the second century. This was something of the Lord’s recovery. With us the Lord’s recovery began in mainland China seventy-two years ago. Today there are mainly three kinds of churches on earth: the Catholic Church, the Protestant church, and the original and recovered church. We must choose the original and recovered church because it is genuine. </p>

The first six verses tell us the condition, and the last three verses tell us the end. The condition is illustrated in a figure of speech by a golden cup (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47257" data-verses="Revelation 17:4">v. 4</span>). A cup signifies something that is presented to a person for him to drink to meet his need. The golden cup signifies that in outward appearance the apostate church does have something of God. The Catholic Church believes that Christ is God, that He was born of a virgin, and that He died for the sins of sinners and resurrected. In their recent catechism, they also pointed out that God became a man that man might become God. In today’s Protestant churches, on the other hand, there are modernists who do not believe that Christ is God, that He was born of a virgin, and that He died on the cross as the Redeemer. They consider that Christ was a martyr and do not believe that He resurrected. </p>
<p data-content-id="6vwrjrxIkI_SvgRLPpYp2l5HMRe6f7Dzfc8S8e8Kq2wJf3mCHONvl9rJjmNAnslff"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47258" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17</span> the Roman Catholic Church is called “MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47259" data-verses="Revelation 17:5">v. 5</span>). There are even some Catholic scholars who have recognized that the Great Babylon in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47260" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17</span> refers to the Catholic Church. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47261" data-verses="Matthew 13:1">Matthew 13</span> the Lord likened the Roman Catholic Church to a woman who <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> took leaven and put it into fine flour (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47262" data-verses="Matthew 13:33">v. 33</span>). Most fundamental expositors of the Bible say that the fine flour refers to Christ as food to both God and man. Leaven signifies evil things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47263" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:6">1 Cor. 5:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47264" data-verses="1Corinthians 5:8">8</span>) and evil doctrines (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47265" data-verses="Matthew 16:6">Matt. 16:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47266" data-verses="Matthew 16:11-12">11-12</span>). It includes all evil things such as heresy, idolatry, and adultery. Thus, the Catholic Church is a mixture. </p>
<p data-content-id="RGcRDAgL1Trtr91tjOBfzfRVT82GzdS-8fHEqTY2sGBhtCvtq77RT1Adj1laA_51s"> The cup which the woman has in her hand is golden, but it is full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47267" data-verses="Revelation 17:4">Rev. 17:4</span>). In figure, gold signifies the divine nature of God. Hence, the apostate church does have something of God, but she is full of evil things such as heresies, idolatry, pagan practices, spiritual fornication, and even physical fornication. For a woman to practice fornication means that she has many husbands. The church should be married to Christ and to the truth of the Bible. Not only is Christ the Husband, but also the truth, the Word of God, is the Husband. The Word of God and Christ are one. The Catholic Church has accepted Christ and the Word of God, yet it has also received many heresies and idols. This has made her a spiritual fornicator. </p>
<p data-content-id="skSuMDLe8Jpe9Aeq3fQnDRSzejtoy4OISy5oNcBbi1F2reLBJJUctjWcLLtNyY7cz"> The Catholic cathedrals are full of idols. G. H. Pember pointed out that one of the saints in the Roman Catholic Church is actually Buddha (see the <em>Life-study of Revelation,</em> Message 51, p. 585). In Manila there is a statue of a so-called Jesus at the entrance of a certain cathedral. The feet of this statue have been touched and even kissed by people so many times that there is a hole there. This is idolatry, but it is in a “golden cup.” </p>
<p data-content-id="wn8ZVaeB5a9h7gQydPGx-QSk7QR3VZNruo_Q_4Enmjtq1Wjfh2K5kJu4HY-kl8Fga"> One young person from a Catholic family received the Lord Jesus and then went to his parents to tell them that he had the Lord Jesus in him. His parents responded by saying that they already had Jesus, and they pointed to a picture of the so-called Jesus hanging on the wall. Because they had such a picture, they thought they had Jesus. </p>
