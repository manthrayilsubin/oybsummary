Christ is the eternal One, but in His incarnation He became a man in time by being born in the small town of Bethlehem. </p>

Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here.” As typified by Jonah, Christ, the Son of Man, was in the heart of the earth three days and three nights (implying resurrection) for the salvation of God to all the sinners. At the time of Jonah, God’s redemption and salvation spread from Jerusalem to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. It was a surprise to the Jewish prophet Jonah that God would care for the Gentiles and send him to Nineveh, an evil city built by Nimrod (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59290" data-verses="Genesis 10:9-11">Gen. 10:9-11</span>). The significance of the type of Jonah is that Christ died, was buried, and was resurrected to spread God’s redemption and salvation to the far away Gentiles. </p>

On earth there is darkness upon darkness, and there is unrighteousness upon unrighteousness. Who can deal with this situation? No one can. Our only hope, our only expectation, is that Christ is coming as the Sun to shine and to swallow the darkness and also as righteousness to be the righteousness to the nations. He will come with healing in His wings to heal the nations from darkness and unrighteousness. We are waiting for Him as the Desire of the nations and as the Sun of righteousness. </p>

In the time of the restoration Christ will not <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> remain in the heavens but will come physically to the earth, to the Jewish land, to the city of Jerusalem, to Mount Zion, to dwell there and to be a shelter and a stronghold to Israel. This is Christ’s future. </p>
<p data-content-id="AAtOde6E7SWyPur1GhPG-oT40WzXYjk6UgsO78LFDwGRMJoEvB9LTuo44ooiNE0g7"> In these verses we see many things concerning Christ: His eternity, His incarnation in time, His death, burial, and resurrection for the spreading of God’s redemption and salvation to all the nations on earth, His coming as the Desire of nations and as the Sun of righteousness, and His being the One dwelling on Mount Zion to be a shelter and a stronghold to God’s elect. As He rules among them, Christ will rule the whole earth from Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="Fnd3R84yaACGFCMQHU-rbRo3Wg4D40kovb0N7f2irXAUxBiCjoaOs9PQc9iqsg2ML"> In this introductory word, let us now go on to consider the composition, the contents, and the central thought of the Minor Prophets. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Cvb3rCZeqdvn9849FI4x5NvFL7vnDZeIuKi2gzgK7e1mlCQ2xQqZsC_gCTLHJxfRN">I. THE COMPOSITION</h2><p data-content-id="PuxTeg708UOGmCWq5Gs9LMFIh0B8ixkFoLeBJC8W_D9ub6Vd2Rlmucdx4JHKiqrxJ"> The Minor Prophets are composed of twelve books, from Hosea to Malachi. In ancient times these books might have been considered one book. “The book of the prophets” mentioned by Stephen in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59297" data-verses="Acts 7:42">Acts 7:42</span>, in his quoting of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59298" data-verses="Amos 5:25-27">Amos 5:25-27</span>, might refer to this collective book. Although these books are minor, they complete the divine revelation concerning God’s economy in His dealings with His elect—Israel—and the nations, which is covered in detail in the books of the Major Prophets—Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. All the books of both the Major Prophets and the Minor Prophets were called by the Lord Jesus “the Prophets,” in which things concerning Him were written (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59299" data-verses="Luke 24:44">Luke 24:44</span>). This indicates that the central point of all the prophets is not chastisement or judgment but Christ. When we come to the books of the prophets, we should care mainly for Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="-dX0Vulpo30iG0khBlsWI8iXZdiSxolhOz3Fs_7BTPFR26t4e2uY46PE7AgY4d0Uz">II. THE CONTENTS</h2><p data-content-id="pysUuvHuJchCQz02BqDZxnrG5GQgv5c3ravABLDzM4xeO6_FJtc0LN1IegJiw5-ZS"> The contents of the Minor Prophets include God’s economy in His loving chastisement of Israel, Christ as the centrality and universality of God’s economy, and a number of crucial points. <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="vApVs6c8CLXSyiFka4v9YYgsiZZzJCLwpTN3o-l5jKLoM5AKQU9hWLThUONehAV53">A.

According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59300" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>, Christ, God’s King, is the Lord, the Possessor, of the earth. The entire world is under Christ as the “General Manager.” He is not only the Lord but also the Manager, managing the entire world situation. At present this is somewhat hidden, but one day He will be manifested. God’s economy on this earth will eventually issue in the manifestation of Christ. When this manifestation takes place, all people will see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God’s economy to bring in the age of restoration. This is the first aspect of the contents of the Minor Prophets, an emphasis which is also found in the Major Prophets. </p>

In the Minor Prophets (not counting Zechariah, which reveals other aspects of Christ) this unveiling, this revelation concerning Christ, has sixteen points. We will now briefly consider these points according to the sequence of the facts. </p>

As God’s Messenger, He brought people God’s word, God’s message. This word, this message, is actually Christ Himself. We may say that He is the letter sent by God to us. </p>

<p data-content-id="e18iXMOHcSqMsiB3cnPRrwDauamp4aOQHSkuDpJLaeKu76mODlRlCzAnPvLdOktH4"> In Hebrew Hosea, the original name of Joshua, means “salvation (of Jehovah),” denoting that Jehovah is the salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59371" data-verses="Numbers 13:8">Num. 13:8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59372" data-verses="Numbers 13:16">16</span>). </p>

As to their condition they were adulterous; as to their position they were apostate. That was the situation of Israel as God’s wife. </p>

The Central Thought</h2><p data-content-id="SI8v2KCAJqXuoPcXdRsombhMp5HNPZsMXstHBCX4wJ5aSSSTUrJWn6IDGbWYrVS-i"> The central thought of this book is that regardless of how adulterous Israel is as the wife to Jehovah and how apostate Israel is as the people to Him, He still desires that she would return to Him. If she would return to Him, He would still receive her, bring her back, and restore her. </p>
<p data-content-id="gnuNonmNqUyQltpdq1D8CLuuMdiQbrrCfLqImucHlKN9Q6PNdJGoqZEsTgLEhs_DR"> Israel was given up by God at the time of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and also later when Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. The children of Israel became desolate and homeless, wanderers among the nations. Although they have been somewhat established in the land of Palestine, God still has not received them back or restored them. </p>

This indicates that although Israel became exceedingly evil, Christ still became organically one with them through incarnation to be a real Israelite. Christ is the Son of God, and the Israelites were sons of God. Christ joined Himself to them in this matter of being sons of God. In His humanity He was a genuine Israelite. </p>

First, God loves Israel with an everlasting love. There will be no change in His love. Second, although God is loving, He is also a God of purity and righteousness. He cannot tolerate any kind of uncleanness or unrighteousness. Wherever these things are found among God’s people, God’s chastisement comes in. For this reason, even though Israel has been re-formed as a nation, they are still under God’s chastisement. Nevertheless, as they are being chastised by God, they are still loved by Him. It is the Lord’s lovingkindness that they have not been consumed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59394" data-verses="Lamentations 3:22">Lam. 3:22</span>).

However, we should not indulge ourselves just because God is loving. We must be in fear and trembling as we enjoy His love. If we are even a little mistaken, God will come in to chastise us. Yet His everlasting love is always victorious. On the one hand, His dealing with us is a matter of His chastisement; on the other hand, it is a matter of His love. His love will gain the victory. </p>

As Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59406" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Romans 8:28</span>, all things, great and small, work together for our good.

However, eventually she will say, “I will go / And return to my first husband, / For it was better for me then than now.” This indicates that eventually she will return to God as her first Husband.

This refers to the time of God’s “honeymoon” with Israel. At the time of the exodus from Egypt, God considered Israel a young wife.

This means that there would be no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception. Even if they brought up their children, Jehovah would bereave them, so that not a man would be left. Indeed woe would also be to them when Jehovah turned away from them. Ephraim was planted in Tyre in a meadow, but he would still bring forth his children to the slayer. Jehovah would give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. All their evil was in Gilgal (the focus of idolatry—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59567" data-verses="Hosea 4:15">4:15</span>), for there Jehovah hated them. Because of the evil of their doings, Jehovah would drive them from His house; He would love them no more. All their princes were rebels. Ephraim was stricken. Their root was dried up; they would not bear fruit. If they brought forth, Jehovah would kill the beloved fruit of their womb. God had rejected them, for they did not listen to Him. They would be wanderers among the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59568" data-verses="Hosea 9:11-17">9:11-17</span>). </p>

This refers to the headship, the leadership, among God’s people. When the church is proper, the church has the headship, the leadership, representing God as His authority. But in a time of turmoil, some would say, “Why do we need God’s deputy authority? Why do we need to have any headship or leadership?” This issues in anarchy. </p>

He exalted himself in Israel, but he trespassed through Baal and died. Now they sinned more and more and made molten images for themselves out of their silver, idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of craftsmen. They asked those who sacrificed to kiss the calves (idols). Therefore, they would be like a morning cloud and like dew that departs early, like chaff driven by a storm wind from the threshing floor, and like smoke from a window vent (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59620" data-verses="Hosea 13:1-3">13:1-3</span>).

<p data-content-id="G2XH0SMnBuAI2xYjeLQFS3XCUnUGJS9d9eBQ3m1HYP_EjJjJSw7uTr93Z10jFmgna"> The first main emphasis of the book of Hosea is the metaphor of Hosea’s marriage with the harlot Gomer. Their three children were also metaphors. The son Jezreel symbolized that God would avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59628" data-verses="2Kings 10:1-11">2 Kings 10:1-11</span>) upon the house of Jehu and would bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59629" data-verses="2Kings 15:10-12">2 Kings 15:10-12</span>). The daughter Lo-ruhamah symbolized that God would no longer have compassion on the house of Israel. The son Lo-ammi symbolized that Israel was not God’s people. God used Hosea’s marriage to Gomer and his family to demonstrate how Israel as a wife to Jehovah had become unfaithful to her Husband. </p>
<p data-content-id="c_NXX3wFaum18h6MdrSx6IpI1XcKTW2lx7CBo63-p6AUapYnle4pCDlo_H5w-sHF1"> The second emphasis in the book of Hosea is the evils of Israel as the unchaste wife of Jehovah. Once a wife becomes unchaste, all kinds of evils follow. Once we forsake God, we too can do any kind of evil. As the unchaste wife of Jehovah, Israel was stubborn in her unchastity. This stubbornness is described in detail in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59630" data-verses="Hosea 11:1">chapters eleven through fourteen</span>. These chapters also reveal Jehovah’s unchanging love, and this is what we will consider in this message. </p>

But when God’s everlasting love is touched, Israel is called God’s son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59632" data-verses="Exodus 4:22-23">Exo. 4:22-23</span>), indicating that Israel has the Father’s life. Only real sons, not adopted sons, have their father’s life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59633" data-verses="Hosea 11:1">Hosea 11:1</span> also indicates that Christ joined Israel to be the Son of God and that He was called out of Egypt by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59634" data-verses="Matthew 2:13-15">Matt. 2:13-15</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="68KriSfVtIg-qQRLfEup7HNZ5UVGuX9sWNDKrOQrHQTv-SOBSHgotWpbzgvYeI0kS"> God’s everlasting love is not a love in affection, like the love of a husband toward a wife, but a love in life, like the love of a father toward a son. Love toward a wife is love in affection, but love toward a son is love in life. On the one hand, God loves us as His wife, and the Lord Jesus is our Husband. On the other hand, God is our Father, and we are sons of the Father. </p>

God’s love in teaching Ephraim to walk and in taking Ephraim in His arms shows us that God’s love is divine but on a human level. If He loved us on the divine level, we could not touch His love. His divine love reaches us on a human level. He has come down to the human level in order to reach us. This is what it means to say that He drew Israel with the cords of a man, with bands of love. </p>

<p data-content-id="NB6sZIOYbrsGQ5hfQDVrU1YNyHWW1Hpr-L-p5imcJMvHDLk0YQtlToFL62R3R9rdk"> The book of Hosea is very rich. Many of the riches in this book are not directly stated but rather are implied by Hosea’s poetic writing. Thus, we need to study the implications of the poetic writing in this book. It is not easy to know the significance of these implications. In this message I have the burden to give a brief word on three implications concerning Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59664" data-verses="Hosea 11:1-4">11:1-4</span>. The three matters in these verses that imply Christ are God’s calling His son out of Egypt, His drawing Israel with the cords of a man, and His gently causing them to eat. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tkXPN9_aE0R0ILy6zLPHVO-Lmi1N0SyrPdMQdugOZXef8-omaPOwM4LspAUHEdcQH">CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD,<br/>BEING CALLED OUT OF EGYPT BY GOD</h2><p data-content-id="hmriI-mLSVfT7JkSCqPT8t3kyF55lofZCkZmcPC0VhpO-OEID7OClzTXqe2EW-NA0"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59665" data-verses="Hosea 11:1">Hosea 11:1</span> says, “When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son.” This verse implies Christ in His union with Israel as the Son of God and as the One called out of Egypt by God. The fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ in this verse is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59666" data-verses="Matthew 2:15">Matthew 2:15</span>, which speaks of Christ’s being called out of Egypt by God. Thus, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59667" data-verses="Hosea 11:1">Hosea 11:1</span> implies Christ as the Son of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="Uhq3eWVL5QK1mJW4oFM_kk5phH7-HAMwLIIEIE9H-4W1TP-mZbyD3O_ig6G0XWRVz"> A further implication of this verse is that with Christ we, the believers in Christ, are also sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59668" data-verses="Hebrews 2:10">Heb. 2:10</span>). In Christ we are sons of God. Apart from Christ we cannot be sons of God. Our sonship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59669" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">Eph. 1:5</span>) is altogether in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="MB8_YKLwW24URo3JZkP-wdrUtmLYiC3FVxaMwfsYJGieFcmb78zMVK4-atgdUMalv">The Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son</h2><p data-content-id="dM3CCiieJ3rfoFgEv35NSAuPM9sxEawNmqSr8o4SwZzJu9uYIx7vhNUaTU0bSLhxk"> Regarding Christ as the Son of God there are two aspects: the aspect of His being the only begotten Son of God and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> aspect of His being the firstborn Son of God. In eternity, Christ was God’s only begotten Son (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59670" data-verses="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59671" data-verses="John 3:16">3:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59672" data-verses="John 3:18">18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59673" data-verses="1John 4:9">1 John 4:9</span>). Christ was the unique Son of God. Besides Him there were no other sons of God. How, then, can there be the many sons of God? To answer this question we need to consider Christ’s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. One day Christ, the only begotten Son of God in eternity, was incarnated to be a man. On the cross He died an all-inclusive, vicarious death, and then He entered into resurrection. In resurrection and through resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God. As the only begotten Son of God in eternity, Christ did not have humanity; He only had divinity. Therefore, before His resurrection He was the Son of God only in His divinity. That was unique. But by His incarnation He entered into humanity and took on human nature as part of His being. However, He was not designated the Son of God in His humanity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59674" data-verses="Romans 1:4">Rom. 1:4</span>) until His resurrection. This is the reason that Paul says in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59675" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>, “God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, ‘You are My Son; today I have begotten You.’” This verse indicates that resurrection was a birth to the man Jesus. He was begotten of God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son among many brothers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59676" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). This means that, in addition to His being the unique, only begotten Son of God from eternity, Christ, after incarnation and through resurrection, was begotten of God in His humanity to become the Son of God in another sense, in the sense of being the firstborn Son of God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Qfn1kLEphB7_tG4QRuzMQWtWm1ZK3NfQHlwLJWrRwuzBZXhxs2PNldYiYYO1jEhPk">The Many Sons</h2><p data-content-id="KXY-wdUHk1CxkrNKveGFM4vtAz_ssSdR2IsGNB3KAPRGXbu8iJRigz1j3fkUB_Z1x"> The word “Firstborn” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59677" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Romans 8:29</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59678" data-verses="Hebrews 1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span> indicates that God has many sons. Without the many sons Christ could not be the firstborn Son; He could only be the only begotten Son. In order for Christ to be the firstborn Son, there must be other sons. These other sons were also born in Christ’s resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59679" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). This means that in His resurrection not only was Christ born to be the firstborn Son of God, but also in His resurrection we were regenerated and born to be the many sons of God, His many brothers, to be His <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> members for the constitution of the organic Body of Christ. All this is implied in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59680" data-verses="Hosea 11:1">Hosea 11:1</span>. How rich are the implications in this verse! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lc0pfqIuX6DOGzdkLfoceylq5imW5VW9bO3bRxCuZBbwVWQzZXv7g1iJu-3yRtg6O">CORDS OF A MAN, BANDS OF LOVE</h2><p data-content-id="OGkmaJ8EXcRNn3VrJgp8SEWxJ1Qc2j2g_x3ICZEF5UkmiSh3krovqoKZ5Os15D8Qf"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59681" data-verses="Hosea 11:4">Hosea 11:4a</span> says, “I drew them with cords of a man, / With bands of love.” God’s love is divine, but His love reaches us in the cords of a man. </p>
<p data-content-id="4GB9qqc9J-xbMHNYF4L9k64K41TC0mFv0n7LFYOy_FJOIKeBA3aYoWjlEcbUJoiWg"> It is important for us to realize that this verse does not speak of a <em>cord</em> but of <em>cords.</em> These cords include Christ’s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This means that the cords mentioned in this verse have different segments and that each segment involves Christ’s humanity. First, God was incarnated; He came to be a man named Jesus. Incarnation, therefore, is the first segment of the cords of a man. The Lord Jesus lived among us on earth for thirty-three and a half years, and His human living is the second segment of these cords. Eventually, He was crucified, dying on the cross for us, and then He was resurrected. His crucifixion and resurrection are also segments of the cords of a man. It is with such cords that God has drawn us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ocmBLItFBSuV2YkynsrOuUR-x9l8dqwud9LEJbQ9B2COXNR66UbnDJgolLuZ9NZQN"> We have pointed out that every segment, every part, of the cords of a man involves Christ’s humanity. After His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens in His humanity. This was the reason Stephen could see the ascended One as the Son of Man and testify, saying, “Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59682" data-verses="Acts 7:56">Acts 7:56</span>). When Christ comes back, He will come in His humanity. The Lord’s word to the high priest in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59683" data-verses="Matthew 26:64">Matthew 26:64</span> reveals this. “From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” The cords of a man, therefore, involve Christ’s humanity in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="3mqLgwVg0dkPc5cBkbp__sQe19LbZH-ImGFgzfpxj4PPW1ayMs68ikmPsFCka1ppj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59684" data-verses="Hosea 11:4">Hosea 11:4a</span> “cords of a man” and “bands of love” are in apposition. Hence, the words “cords” and “bands” refer to the same thing. The bands of love are the cords of a man. The love of God, the divine love, comes to us through Christ’s humanity. For this reason, the bands of love are the cords of a <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> man. Here Christ is revealed not directly but by the way of implication. What a rich, deep, marvelous, and mysterious implication concerning Christ we have here! </p>
<p data-content-id="G2XH0SMnBuAI2xYjeLQBS2jKUnUGJS9d9eBQ3m1HYP_EjJjJSw7uTr93Z10jFmgna"> God’s everlasting love, His unchanging, subduing love, is altogether in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ. Apart from Christ God’s everlasting love could not be prevailing. God’s unchanging love is prevailing because it is a love in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ. If Christ had not been incarnated, if Christ had not lived on earth, if Christ had not died a vicarious death for us, if Christ had not entered into resurrection and then ascended to the heavens, there would be no way for God to draw us with cords of a man, with bands of love. </p>
<p data-content-id="c_NXX3wFaum18h6MdrS16JNE1XcKTW2lx7CBo63-p6AUapYnle4pCDlo_H5w-sHF1"> We need to be impressed with the fact that Christ’s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are all for us, for it is by all these steps of Christ’s humanity that God’s love in His salvation reaches us. These steps are the cords of a man, the bands of love, with which God has drawn us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YA5IuQ6SmWngFo8eskHThher7ajOYstHEyPrpAwK5PGTCFPGlpHo8O_l065zjZPK-">GOD GENTLY CAUSING US TO EAT</h2><p data-content-id="EQpOAO_niE8LdMaEjhyjnrz8-Ied_tT_R5aU1oHNZgWdg0Vzq1xrcuvsmEdK1pvso"> A third implication concerning Christ is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59685" data-verses="Hosea 11:4">Hosea 11:4b</span>. Here Jehovah says, “I was to them like those / Who lift off the yoke on their jaws; / And I gently caused them to eat.” When did God do this? During the forty years the children of Israel were in the wilderness, God gently and patiently fed them with manna. Manna is a type of Christ as our heavenly food. Hence, this word concerning God’s gently causing them to eat also implies Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="D7SCk7dRycLIfEV--1q7LD112C6uFYlZtCnVjfLgnCx2Hua22eKmuTr4OA66usl6O"> When we were saved, God drew us with cords of a man, with bands of love, and now He is feeding us with Christ. I can testify that from the time I was saved God has been gently and patiently feeding me with Christ. Sometimes we may want to eat too much or eat in haste, but God wants us to eat slowly and gently with patience and endurance. This is the way God feeds us. </p>
