In the day of God’s anger, we need to be the treasure hidden in Him. </p>

One of his ancestors was another good king, Josiah. </p>

His judgment is first on Israel and then on the nations, but His salvation is first to the Gentiles and then to Israel. Today thousands of Gentiles have been saved, but very few among the millions of Jews have been saved. In God’s economy, this is the age for His salvation to go to the Gentiles. </p>
