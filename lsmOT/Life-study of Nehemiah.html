This signifies that the house of God as His dwelling and home on the earth needs His kingdom to be established as a realm to safeguard His interest on the earth for His administration, to carry out His economy. The rebuilding of the house of God typifies God’s recovery of the degraded church, and the rebuilding of the wall of the city of Jerusalem typifies God’s recovery of His kingdom. God’s building of His house and His building of His kingdom go together (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47055" data-verses="Matthew 16:18-19">Matt 16:18-19</span>).

Nehemiah stood on God’s word and prayed according to it. Thus, God was bound by His own word.

But you have no portion nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47071" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:20">v. 20</span>).

Half of Nehemiah’s servants labored in the work, and half of them held weapons, ready to fight. Some built the wall and some carried burdens, taking the loads with one hand doing the <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> work and with the other hand holding a weapon. The one who would sound the trumpet was beside Nehemiah, to gather them to fight, trusting that their God would fight for them. This indicates that, as the commander-in-chief, Nehemiah took the lead to watch. Thus, they labored and half of them held spears from the start of dawn until the stars came out, and Nehemiah and his brothers, servants, and the men of the guard, none of them took off their clothes. Each had his weapon at his right hand (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47077" data-verses="Nehemiah 4:9-23">vv. 9-23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="voxb03W-yPfdLsk9lrQz_4mkVJr2c1W6EHVHhbXcR3otbbWdveeLo5XjZB_PmNIWp"> On the one hand, the children of Israel were prepared to fight; on the other hand, they trusted in God that He would fight for them. In this matter also they were aggressive. Those who are cowardly might say that, since God will fight for us, there is no need for us to do anything. But in a very real sense, God will help those who help themselves. If you do not help yourself, God will not help you. According to history, God does not help the cowardly. It is the aggressive ones who have received help from God. </p>

In order for God to have a house and a kingdom on the earth, three sections of work were needed. First, there was a need for some of the captivity to come back from Babylon to Jerusalem to lay a foundation for the formation of a nation. This required a strong government, a strong administration. Second, there was the need of teaching and education to bring the people of God into a culture that was according to God. Such a culture was not an Egyptian kind nor a Canaanite kind nor a Babylonian kind but was God’s kind, a culture that expressed God. This kind of culture required a great deal of education. Third, there was the need to constitute the nation organically. This section of the work was concerned with the constitution of God’s people. </p>
<p data-content-id="1tD2l9uzlWrCz0XIS0CoFtvTmu7EwWwgbNurPGzjwR-cEFNzMwUpAYHgV8DFQMw1q"> The word <em>constitution</em> is ambiguous. According to the common notion, this word refers to a document which is the constitution of a country, for example, the Constitution of the United States of America. This understanding of constitution is too narrow. In our usage, the word constitution refers to something organic which has a number of elements. If the government of a country is constituted not <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> only organizationally but also organically, that government will not be lifeless. On the contrary, such a government will be something that is living and organic. </p>

Also, King Cyrus brought out the vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had put into the house of his gods (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47104" data-verses="Ezra 1:7">v. 7</span>). These vessels were then returned to Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47105" data-verses="Ezra 1:11">v. 11</span>). This return from captivity was under the kingly leadership of Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal family of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47106" data-verses="Ezra 2:1-2">2:1-2</span>). If we study carefully the record concerning him in the Bible, we will see that he was a strong governor and was very able in managing the people. </p>

Ezra was not a high-ranking official in Persia. Rather, he was a priest and a scribe who was skilled in the law of Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47107" data-verses="Ezra 7:6">7:6</span>). Although he did not have any rank there in Persia, he was bold, strong, and aggressive in presenting a petition to the king of Persia.

As the one who took the initiative in this matter, Ezra was a man who trusted in God and who was one with God. He was skilled in the Word of God and he knew God’s heart, God’s desire, and God’s economy. Because of all this, he was a person of excellent character and reputation before the king. If Ezra had not had such a standing in the eyes of the king, the king would not have authorized him to appoint magistrates and judges (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47108" data-verses="Ezra 7:25">v. 25</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> </p>

He was just a cupbearer, one who served wine to the king. But in his living and behavior he must have built up something that earned the king’s respect. Nehemiah had never been sad in the king’s presence (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47109" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:1">Neh. 2:1</span>). One day the king said to him, “Why is your face sad, since you are not ill? This is nothing other than sadness of heart” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47110" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:2">v. 2</span>). Being aggressive, Nehemiah took advantage of this opportunity and said, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ graves, lies in waste and its gates are consumed with fire?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47111" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:3">v. 3</span>). The king asked him what his request was, and Nehemiah asked the king to send him to Judah that he might rebuild the city of his fathers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47112" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:5">v. 5</span>). Nehemiah went on to request that letters would be given to him for the governors so that they would let him pass through. He asked also for a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the Park, so that he would give him timber (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47113" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:7-8">vv. 7-8</span>). The king granted to Nehemiah all that he had requested. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zqYrdPNIUbqdYp2VWEvJbtYGX4sU7sOTIJF0223rqoeRefmMWMzG987ajusWDvnfU">THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF NEHEMIAH<br/>IN VOLUNTEERING HIMSELF TO HIS BURDEN</h2><p data-content-id="a87Aafdcn-b8080_7PrL-C_e2KdBjtzytCZolyq34TKcw0Y-J8cFr47a1nbvLAkeW"> We are not told that Nehemiah was stirred up by God. Rather, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47114" data-verses="Nehemiah 1:1-2">1:1-2</span>, he asked one of his brothers and some others who came from Judah about those who were left from the captivity and about Jerusalem. They told him that the people were in an exceedingly bad state and reproach and that the wall of Jerusalem was broken down and its gates had been burned with fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47115" data-verses="Nehemiah 1:3">v. 3</span>). When Nehemiah heard this report, he wept, mourned, fasted, and prayed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47116" data-verses="Nehemiah 1:4">v. 4</span>). He did not call a prayer meeting, and he did not ask those who gave the report to pray about the situation. He prayed by himself with a real burden. </p>
<p data-content-id="bZC-yO-EGu6VygdPM1Mxyde_6N8EyVqfZ-pdiDskHRQ7Eu2pnsmxfhmNs_VsR-MDD"> In principle, these three sections —government, education, and constitution —have been present in the Lord’s recovery through the centuries. Some are raised up and stirred up by God, and some volunteer. Some are in a high position, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> some are common people. But all must be bold and strong in character and aggressive. All who have been used by God through history have been aggressive persons. For example, both Paul and Martin Luther were very aggressive. Brother Nee also, even though he was a gentleman, was very aggressive. </p>
<p data-content-id="qQMilNQOzzZPTKQbQYXIWetNx8kd62mB01IE5EfBUZPRdId7UeTcFGeS90-usQfA3"> Nehemiah surely was an aggressive person. He volunteered himself, in a sense, not to God but to his burden. He had a burden to rebuild the city of Jerusalem. His aggressiveness was very much used by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="yXZNhqIpsnQ4K5d3hu_P2AZW_rGmdYoVTN3-lo5rnumUl72v6Up1WFWkViXzm44BU"> In the Lord’s recovery today there are many good saints, but we are short of aggressiveness. If just five thousand among us were aggressive, the world would be turned upside down. If there were seven hundred aggressive ones in each continent, a great deal would issue forth for the carrying out of God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="8pk8X_4eajrOrQa-OgdZI57uFPPuy8NZK8-jbHefIYiILPBKsdYWikWGCcYBrw102"> In our reading of the book of Nehemiah, we need to pay attention to Nehemiah’s aggressiveness. Although he was a common man, a servant of the king, he was aggressive to volunteer himself to God and to his burden concerning the building up of the city. He was also aggressive in making his requests known to the king. When the king asked him about his sad face, he spoke to the king in a bold, aggressive way about his burden for the city of Jerusalem. It is important that we see this in the Word. </p>

In typology many persons were temporarily used by God according to their natural capacity and natural virtues to signify something spiritual. An example of this is Nehemiah and his aggressiveness, which was a virtue in his human conduct. Whereas in typology natural things were used by God temporarily, in the fulfillment of the types in the New Testament, <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> all the natural virtues and capacities should be brought to the cross. They need to be put to the cross and crossed out. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="mKBwRtuwhB7rsinVOkColMz6MeglLvopyuxnpk2Atjr3SyM3XspVw3J-IERkQchqU">A.

Suppose a fallen person wants to come back to God. If he would come back to God, he must come back to God’s word. No one can come back to God without coming back to His word. </p>
<p data-content-id="tzvA0G2aZZh0NABBhQhLj5NPlXU_MFecDrrgRtVl4cPuRSPr2EDFK4ap8GGxVXopd"> God’s word reconstitutes us. We all have our own kind of disposition and habitual behavior, but God is able to reconstitute us through His word. This is why we need to read the Bible. God’s word gradually changes our mind and our way of thinking. The word of God is one with the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47130" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17">Eph. 6:17</span>). When the word of God works within us, the Spirit, through the word, spontaneously dispenses God’s nature with God’s element into our being. We may not even be aware that such a dispensing is taking place within us. By this way we are reconstituted. </p>
<p data-content-id="hR3p9wEJdYp5Jfz4lX4i1BnNsYNHZ1NePkGeV8iWq8dm2KXiH56FRkiZ91B9hIvAM"> Most of those who had returned to Jerusalem from the captivity in Babylon had been born not in Israel but in Babylon, and they were raised in Babylon. The Babylonian element had been wrought into them and constituted into <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> their being. Therefore, after they returned to the land of their fathers to be citizens of the nation of Israel, they needed a reconstitution. Ezra was very useful at this point, for he was one through whom the people could be reconstituted with the word of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="UPFXJqlKggu6C5zfFz7rgsuIsKUJ0jQTCNC3LHq7pq7W57LYV8MDmBHIbr8npYHrw"> The constitution of a person provides the foundation for the constitution of a nation. A proper nation is not merely an organization but also a constitution. This is especially true of a nation’s army. The army of the United States, for example, is constituted with many elements, and these elements afford the way for the individual soldiers to be reconstituted as parts of the army. Thus, the army is a constitution and not merely an organization. </p>
<p data-content-id="MDsrzzylH0HuKhGUZwoht07avKZXNqWKsJvY_hMBwZ1JjvZLmoMoG6BYGiEY6KUAM"> God’s intention with Israel was to have on earth a divinely constituted people to be His testimony. In order for God’s people to be His testimony, they had to be reconstituted with the word of God. Under Ezra and Nehemiah the returned people of Israel were collectively constituted by and with God through His word to be a nation as God’s testimony. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="V1xr4zJNO04k8N3jHAPNScd64Rd8XlwXzfLiTLNBZb-Bwnz1QpnEv8nlVhpjiyDPn">1.

Ezra did it and blessed Jehovah the great God, and all the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” lifting up their hands; and they worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground. This indicates that rebellious Israel had been fully convinced and fully subdued by the word of God spoken through Moses. </p>
<p data-content-id="1tD2l9uzlWrCz0XIS0CoFtvXmsv0wWwgbNurPGzjwR-cEFNzMwUpAYHgV8DFQMw1q"> The word of God is the solid base for the Spirit of God, who is God Himself, to dispense God’s element into our being to cause us to be constituted with God. This should be our personal experience day by day. When we come together, we then need to read even more of the Word of God. To do this is to come together according to the way of the divine constitution. <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> </p>

Nehemiah charged them to have a feast without grief, a feast full of joy. It was hard for the people to do this, because they had been convinced and subdued by the word to realize they were sinful (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47132" data-verses="Nehemiah 8:9-10">vv. 9-10a</span>). Nehemiah said to them, “Do not be grieved, for the joy of Jehovah is your strength” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47133" data-verses="Nehemiah 8:10">v. 10b</span>). Then all “went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47134" data-verses="Nehemiah 8:12">v. 12</span>). </p>

Today many read the Bible without insight. Who has genuine insight into the word of the Bible? Here in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47136" data-verses="Nehemiah 8:13">verse 13</span> “insight” refers to the intrinsic significance. We all need to be helped to see the intrinsic significance of the word of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="Rg4if3UNIvDcIxpRW6lRJ6cNSTVhwFtI5Zv7ZyBXc6d80T1KE3uFWkQJyvP8CbCOm"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47137" data-verses="Nehemiah 8:14-18">Verses 14 through 18</span> tell us that they found in the law that Jehovah commanded the children of Israel to dwell in booths during the feast in the seventh month (the Feast of Tabernacles) and to publish and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem to go out to the mountain and bring olive branches and other kinds of branches to make booths. All the assembly did it accordingly for seven days with great rejoicing, <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> and day by day Ezra read in the book of the law of God. On the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.

Among all the leaders in the history of Israel, these three were the top ones. Nehemiah was very common with no rank. There is no indication that his family had a high standing in society, and he did not have a high profession. Even though he served in the palace of the king of Persia, he was just a household servant. </p>
<p data-content-id="J-rujgdRMMa8MywdbEGHDzFGuv9cja6VEJYF2T3rYCACZhezwGrGknT6WSThzFSWn"> Although Nehemiah was a common person without any position, he was placed in a very high position, a position which involved close contact with the king. Nehemiah was a cupbearer to the king (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47179" data-verses="Nehemiah 1:11">Neh. 1:11b</span>). While wine was being set before the king, Nehemiah would take up the wine and give it to him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47180" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:1">2:1a</span>). Eventually, the king appointed this cupbearer to be the governor of Judah. </p>

He was never sad in the king’s presence (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47181" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:1">v. 1b</span>). If Nehemiah had not been a pleasant person who fulfilled the king’s requests, the king would not have allowed him to continue serving as a cupbearer. <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> </p>

This interest included the good land, the temple, and the city of Jerusalem, all of which Nehemiah loved. Even though he was a common person without a rank such as that of a king or of a captain in the army, he took care of God’s interest on earth. </p>

When he heard that the people in Jerusalem were suffering and that the wall of Jerusalem had been broken down and that its gates had been burned with fire, he wept, mourned, fasted, and prayed (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47182" data-verses="Nehemiah 1:2-4">1:2-4</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47183" data-verses="Nehemiah 1:11">verse 11</span> he prayed, saying, “I beseech You, O Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to the prayer of Your servants, who take delight in fearing Your name; and cause Your servant to prosper today, and grant him to find compassion before this man.” Here Nehemiah was praying that he would find favor with the king. When the king asked him regarding his request, Nehemiah “prayed to the God of heaven” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47184" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:4">2:4</span>). </p>

Burdens were placed upon his shoulder by God, but in bearing these burdens he trusted in God. Nehemiah knew that the good hand of God was upon him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47185" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:8">vv. 8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47186" data-verses="Nehemiah 2:18">18</span>), and he asked God to remember him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47187" data-verses="Nehemiah 5:19">5:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47188" data-verses="Nehemiah 13:14">13:14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47189" data-verses="Nehemiah 13:31">31</span>). This indicates that he trusted in God and was one with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="wPMEAMPMC8KuQpBcVrr-zjs1EFoxYXUFqPi8DTQ0M5_rKl_c8mh5aReQclCbYDHUB"> It was not easy for God to gain such a person as Nehemiah. In rank and profession he was very low, but he loved God and God’s interest, he prayed for God’s interest, contacting Him in fellowship, and he trusted in God and <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> became one with Him. These are Nehemiah’s particular characteristics in his relationship with God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="LJLuiV0Y6PGyB0jBWmp1UgPN79GyAWhF1ci0GfHxDWuYeaADTuVxosjP6hyBxLr2O">Altogether Unselfish</h2><p data-content-id="mKBwRtuwhB7rsinVOkColMziMc0tLvopyuxnpk2Atjr3SyM3XspVw3J-IERkQchqU"> In his relationship with the people, Nehemiah was altogether unselfish. With him, there was no self-seeking. Even though he gained a high position as the governor of Judah —he was actually the acting king of Judah, representing the king of Persia —he never sought anything for himself. With Nehemiah there was no self-interest. He was always willing to sacrifice what he had for the people and for the nation. He was the governor, but he did not take any compensation for twelve years, because he realized that the building of the wall was a heavy burden on the people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47190" data-verses="Nehemiah 5:14-18">5:14-18</span>). He did not want to increase the burden on them. Instead of receiving compensation, he provided for the daily necessities of more than one hundred fifty men. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZYDmhHv0MYHMloqJsDsvlduGXowTR21CRUCB18lUgP4-ygZWtKAVyWDRU7Bm74eui"> Nehemiah also was among those who were ready to fight against the enemy, and he took part in the night watch (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47191" data-verses="Nehemiah 4:17-23">4:17-23</span>). He did not leave these matters to others but participated in them himself. </p>

I believe that, in contrast to the judges and the kings, Nehemiah had only one wife. He did not indulge in sexual lust. David and Solomon were both indulgent in this way. The indulgence in sexual lust was the main factor of the rottenness of David’s family and the main factor behind the loss of the kingdom for David and his descendants. Nehemiah, however, was altogether different. </p>
<p data-content-id="C0tVstyns3Hq3ZAl-8G8cvqFyHdJeWOZCWGBjvL5pkZ81pKLNbpWd97oXo17Uiq_j"> I believe that in the whole six thousand years of human history, there has never been such a one as Nehemiah. There were no complaints about Nehemiah from the people. Everyone appreciated him and was grateful for him. We may say that Nehemiah was an outstanding elder, the best example of what an elder should be. I hope that all the elders in the churches today will be like Nehemiah. <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> </p>

This is indicated by the fact that he recognized his need of Ezra. In reconstituting the nation, Nehemiah realized that he did not know God’s Word. But Ezra, who was famous for his knowledge of the Word of God, was still alive, and Nehemiah was willing to go to Ezra for help. Many of today’s leaders would not seek help in such a way. Instead, being ambitious, they would hold on to their position and not bring in an Ezra to help them. But because Nehemiah was not ambitious, he brought in Ezra. Nehemiah knew that without Ezra he could not reconstitute the people of God. </p>

This means that to reconstitute the people of God is to educate them by putting them into the Word of God that they may be saturated with the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="Wb6uAfQttFnbsMwIWLaLbY0CvHf9R7j6uOdjDVfxq_cqds2jaedaux9cjAFw408dk"> The Israelites had been in Egypt for at least four hundred years. During those years they must have been constituted with Egyptian learning. Then they were brought to Babylon for seventy years. Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah were all born and raised among the Babylonians. After the people of Israel returned from Babylon, they mixed themselves with the Canaanites. Thus, the Israelites were constituted with the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Canaanite culture. Nevertheless, they returned to be the testimony of God. But how could a people with a constitution of Egyptian, Babylonian, and Canaanite culture be God’s testimony, the expression of the God-man? Such a people were not the God-men. How could they express God? In order to be the testimony of God, His expression, they needed to be re-educated in the Word of God. </p>

Parents not only educate their children but spontaneously and unconsciously impart themselves, nearly their whole being, into their children. Parents transfuse what they are and what they think into their children. Eventually, this constitutes their children to be the same as they are. This is what the children of Israel needed. </p>
<p data-content-id="f2UUC2Jv7x4euqz6PXwaalHpf7YIXS3lQwm-1X9miXbGSEh9HahxhpK8E8V0f7p7j"> Before Nehemiah came back, the nation of Israel was a mess. The duties of the priests were not certain, and no one was taking care of the Levites and the serving ones. The singers were there, but no one had opened the way for them to sing and to be formed into companies. Nehemiah, with the help of Ezra, totally reconstituted the nation. Then Israel became a particular nation, a nation sanctified and separated unto God, expressing God. They were transfused with the thought of God, with the considerations of God, and with all that God is, making them God’s reproduction. Everyone became God in life and in nature by this kind of divine constitution. As a result, they became a divine nation on earth expressing the divine character. They were reconstituted personally and corporately to be God’s testimony. The returned captives became God’s testimony through the reconstitution which took place under the leadership of Nehemiah. </p>
