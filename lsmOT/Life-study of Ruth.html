After the eternal God created man, He was nearly silent for four thousand years. During that time no one knew what God was doing. The angels did not know, and the men in the Old Testament, such as Abraham, Moses, and David, did not know. Then the eternal God came out of eternity and entered into time. He came out of eternity with His divinity in order to enter into humanity to make Himself, the Divine, one with man, the human, to become a God-man. This is the greatest thing in the entire universe. The short <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> book of Ruth, containing only four chapters, is related in a particular way to the incarnation of Christ. </p>

THE CONTENT</h2><p data-content-id="aHgpE99yLGvPkNO9YLss9isExZpU617unygb1zZDJWX6vqV_Kue9U58fYqhYiNiyQ"> The content of this book concerns a Moabitess, Ruth. Ruth belonged to the tribe of Moab (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44015" data-verses="Ruth 1:4">v. 4</span>). Moab was the son of Lot, the fruit of Lot’s incestuous union with his daughter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44016" data-verses="Genesis 19:30-38">Gen. 19:30-38</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44017" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:3">Deuteronomy 23:3</span> the Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation. Thus, as a Moabitess, Ruth was an excluded one. Nevertheless, she was brought into the holy elect of God and became an important ancestor of Christ through her marriage with Boaz, the great-grandfather of King David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44018" data-verses="Ruth 4:21-22">Ruth 4:21-22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44019" data-verses="Matthew 1:5-6">Matt. 1:5-6</span>), which became a factor that ushered in the incarnation of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44020" data-verses="Matthew 1:5-16">Matt. 1:5-16</span>). From this we see that Ruth became an important ancestor to bring Christ into humanity. This ushered in the marvelous incarnation, which made God one with man. This is the intrinsic significance of the content of the book of Ruth. </p>

The following generations enjoyed rest under David. Then after one thousand years, they enjoyed the real rest with the Lord Jesus. Two thousand years later, this rest will be enjoyed in a fuller way in the millennial kingdom with Christ as the King. After the millennium, the enjoyment of this rest will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. This matter of rest is the key to the book of Ruth. </p>

Ruth chose to go to the land of Israel because she probably had heard a great deal concerning God, God’s promise, and the good land. She had heard the good news sufficiently for her to make a wonderful choice. After arriving in the land of Israel with Naomi, Ruth exercised her right. This matter is covered in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44064" data-verses="Ruth 2:1">chapter two</span>. </p>

Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44065" data-verses="Leviticus 23:22">Leviticus 23:22</span> says, “When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the alien.” A similar word is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44066" data-verses="Leviticus 19:9-10">Leviticus 19:9-10</span>. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44067" data-verses="Deuteronomy 24:19">Deuteronomy 24:19</span> says, “When you reap your harvest in your field and you forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not turn back to gather it; it shall be for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow, in order that Jehovah your God may bless you in all your undertakings.” This shows not only the lovingkindness of God and how great, fine, and detailed He is, but shows also the rich produce of the good land. </p>

The people would not be allowed to reap completely the corners of their field. However, in the ordinance of the law given by God through Moses regarding reaping, the size of the corners of the field was not specified. The size depended on the landlord’s faith in Jehovah. The larger one’s faith in Jehovah was, the larger the corners of the field would be. I believe that it was the practice of Boaz to obey this ordinance. He must have had great faith in Jehovah. Under God’s sovereignty this ordinance seems to have been written for one person—Ruth. </p>

When Boaz asked the young man who was set over the reapers concerning Ruth, the young man told him that she was the young Moabite woman who had returned with Naomi from the country of Moab and who had asked to glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. His word to Boaz regarding Ruth indicates that he was happy with her, considering her a woman of fidelity and virtue. </p>

He said to her, “Do not go to glean in another field, and also do not pass from here but stay close to my young women. Keep your eyes on the field that they reap; follow after them. I have charged my young men not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, you shall go to the vessels and drink of what the young men have drawn” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44076" data-verses="Ruth 2:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>).

Boaz replied that all that she had done for her mother-in-law since the death of her husband Elimelech had been made known to him. He also had learned how she had left her father and mother and the land of her birth and had come to a people whom she had not known before. Then he said to her, “May Jehovah recompense your work, and may you have a full reward from Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44078" data-verses="Ruth 2:12">v. 12</span>). In response, Ruth asked that she would find favor in his sight, for he had comforted her and had spoken kindly to her (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44079" data-verses="Ruth 2:13">v. 13</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="Dy3E752aKt87UXcVnLweKy0R-GYf41H6CL3NfqOKnHxVgG6Fp01cMXhrwnKvNUytt"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44103" data-verses="Ruth 1:1">Chapter one</span> shows Ruth’s choosing, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44104" data-verses="Ruth 2:1">chapter two</span> shows Ruth’s exercising of her right, and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44105" data-verses="Ruth 3:1">chapter three</span> shows Ruth’s seeking for her rest. We need to enjoy Christ to such an extent that we have rest. In order to have rest, we surely need a home. No place can give us as much rest as our home. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44106" data-verses="Ruth 3:1">chapter three</span> Naomi proposed and even pushed to gain a home for Ruth. </p>
<p data-content-id="SeGsSQRD8RJzQl1cUi_lZ4aLPKTInKYQd7U_hEQGTjusNM2cLLTaV6gEiI_FvlQ2o"> The steps taken by Ruth correspond to our spiritual experience. Before we were saved, we all had our own taste and choice. Under the Lord’s sovereign arrangement, we heard the gospel and made a resolution to become a believer of Christ. Our choice was to believe in Christ. By believing in the Lord Jesus, we were organically joined to Him. Now He is in us and we are in Him. With this intimate, organic union, we must begin to pursue Christ in order to gain, possess, experience, and enjoy Him. This is typified by Ruth’s exercising of her right to gain and possess the produce of the good land. Just as Ruth had the right to enjoy the produce of the good land after coming into the land, so we have the right to enjoy Christ as our good land after believing in Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="g6Emuu29_2-LAGGVkPBAS6_G7IdYOvMVQ4_33u3musE3tJ_nPKhiQMNiHFaCh3L9O"> It is a tragedy that Christianity, both Catholicism and Protestantism, has not seen this matter of enjoying Christ. The Lord Jesus said, “He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44107" data-verses="John 6:57">John 6:57</span>). Our Savior can be eaten; He is our heavenly food and manna. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44108" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">Revelation 2</span>, whoever overcomes may eat of Christ as the tree of life and as the hidden manna (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44109" data-verses="Revelation 2:7">vv. 7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44110" data-verses="Revelation 2:17">17</span>). The Bible reveals that Christ is not only our food but also our drink, clothing, and breath. He is our daily necessities. Every day we need to enjoy Him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> We must be like Ruth and exercise our right to enjoy Christ. Every morning we should “glean” from the “field” of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="edHaEhC06QOTawpuL0yiynM7LMlCicAUf9uSEpR6SiOBC3AV_1j8zRVjcOjYxHva7"> However, after our gleaning we still need a home so that we can have a settled rest. This kind of rest can come only through marriage. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44111" data-verses="Ruth 3:1">Ruth 3:1</span> Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, I must seek some resting place for you.” Naomi wanted to find a way to establish a home for Ruth. If Ruth was to have a home for her rest, she needed a husband. Naomi realized that the proper person to be Ruth’s husband was Boaz, who typifies Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="5tXhyxPBgv6HQ1EL7jYdRl_CJI9LnyXjORJ2Ua-nlVG9TakXl5d2Fuhaq-p2fvIy9"> I realize that many of us love the Lord Jesus, but have we taken Him as our Husband? Have you ever had a time with the Lord when you said, “Lord, You are my Husband”? Even though you are saved and you love the Lord, you will not have a home for your rest until you marry the Lord Jesus, taking Him as your Husband. </p>
<p data-content-id="9WXNk23jyOzOr9ypiH_a7m7XpBy18JIbUB4bZ9xieoB_axoRL4-fdaHI1ZFybHbYK"> In these messages on Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, the Lord has given us a clear view of how we should take Christ as our unique Husband. After the people of Israel entered the good land under Joshua, there was a history of miserable chaos because Israel was not faithful. She left God as her Husband to go to many husbands, to many idols. In this modern age there are many idols, such as entertainment, sports, and shopping, which cause Christians to be unfaithful. It seems as if they have never been married to Christ, that they have never actually taken Him as their Husband. As a consequence, they are roaming, wandering from place to place with no rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="jiriGg6OxPyaWmXlDCto3wjdntVZYOok3LdUIAsTFb-gIaAv5oCHa-PRbZ8hBsRbr"> The place to find our Husband is in our home, the church. Christ is the Husband in the church. To have a husband is not sufficient. We must also have a home. Without a home we have no rest. If we have Christ, enjoy Christ, and experience Christ, yet we do not have the church, we are still homeless. Therefore, we must stress not only Christ as our Husband but also the church as our home. Christ as our Husband and the church as our home are a complete unit for us to have a proper and adequate rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="Toqz-BImU7Z7hBLYytjQhmJHEUbr7XFYR49Lxihp9HDOH1RqVFgsFoEawrOQ1XZ58"> Ruth was enjoying her life with Naomi, but Naomi was <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> clear that Ruth needed to be married to Boaz. Although according to God’s law the Jews and the Moabites were to be separated, in His sovereignty God had a way to bring Ruth, a Moabitess, and Boaz together. By the time of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44112" data-verses="Ruth 3:1">chapter three</span>, Ruth and Boaz had already met in the field where Ruth was gleaning, and they were prepared, qualified, and ready to be married. I believe that Boaz loved Ruth and that she loved him. But this love was entirely inward, with no outward expression. Since this was the situation, there was the need for Naomi, as the person in the middle, to push Ruth and Boaz to get married. </p>
<p data-content-id="nKpdmu0ZJJ2tHpcvT9cU2G2eoRC7u55Gh6uHay4-nRHXj8cb13qA1YHV9R-WDFln-"> My burden today is like Naomi’s. I am seeking a resting place for you, and the only way for you to have rest is to take Christ as your Husband. Thus, I am here as a person in the middle to push you to marry Christ. I am quite concerned that you have never known Christ as your Husband and that you have not yet found a home for your rest. You may know Christ as your Redeemer, Savior, Master, and Lord. You may even know that He is your food, drink, breath, and clothing. But do you know Him as your Husband? Perhaps you glean daily in His field and recognize Him as the Landlord. You need to do more than to glean in His field—you need to take Him as your Husband. My burden, therefore, is to push all of us to marry Christ. I am pushing us to marry Christ so that we can build up a home and enjoy Him in this home, which is the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="6_mkxrsP6JgVAI_Xo3UYX63UhsPxpYY_WV7h6Bz4tNIjeUVakajkyHdorYsoBANuW"> Nothing is more intimate than marriage. Taking Christ as our Husband is a most intimate matter. If we marry Christ, taking Him as our Husband, our life will be changed. We will realize that we must have a wife’s fidelity, and we will learn how to enjoy Christ as our life, walking and behaving in oneness with Him. Then we will become those who gain Christ and enjoy Christ, loving Him, staying at home with Him, and living with Him at home, in the church. If we do this, we will truly know the church life in the Lord’s recovery. </p>

She further instructed Ruth not to make herself known to the man until he had finished eating and drinking. Then Naomi told her to notice the place where he lies down and go there, uncover his feet, and lie down. Naomi concluded by telling her that Boaz would tell her what she should do. </p>

<p data-content-id="VRjhf08_xg3ZZkMmsnKYFTu59IgAgD5GOpk-ouykwQhBaWQU5wCorD9y6y6ZLFhpM"> In this message we will consider Ruth’s reward for God’s economy. We have seen that Ruth made a choice for her goal and that she exercised her right to enjoy the rich land. Under the prodding of Naomi, Ruth sought for a resting place, and finally she received a reward, a gain, for God’s economy. A real seeker after God, Ruth eventually gained what she sought after. She chose her goal, she exercised her right, and she sought for a husband and a home as a resting place. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="iTBInsmxccddhsz8eC27fNXzaSo2YOUaw3QnYPtsW1RTOWrJAdSREcBl1Bonq4-1j">I. GAINING A REDEEMING HUSBAND</h2><p data-content-id="1bH6KEjyOCz4iM1ApNVtxzMvqzekYj3FIwvXmZWKqtF_5CiEMVPgtEAjcNxSC2pf1"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44137" data-verses="Ruth 4:1">chapter four</span>, there are four aspects of Ruth’s reward. First, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44138" data-verses="Ruth 4:10-13">verses 10 through 13</span> she gained a redeeming husband (typifying Christ as the redeeming Husband to the believers—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44139" data-verses="Romans 7:4">Rom. 7:4</span>). Ruth’s gaining of such a husband was witnessed and blessed by the people and the elders in the gate (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44140" data-verses="Ruth 4:11-12">Ruth 4:11-12</span>), and it was also blessed by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44141" data-verses="Ruth 4:13">v. 13b</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="9WXNk23jyOzOr9ypiHvay0bXpBy18JIbUB4bZ9xieoB_axoRL4-fdaHI1ZFybHbYK"> We need to be impressed with the fact that Ruth’s reward was for God’s economy. Man was created by God with a purpose according to His eternal economy. This economy is not a common plan or merely a small arrangement. In the universe the divine and eternal economy is second only to God Himself. According to His economy God created the heavens, the earth, and man. But God’s enemy came in to attempt to break the line that joins man to God and God to man. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44142" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> Satan cut this line, but eventually Christ as the promised seed of the woman (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44143" data-verses="Genesis 3:15">v. 15</span>) came to repair the line by redeeming man back to God. </p>
<p data-content-id="jiriGg6OxPyaWmXlDC9o_iTdntVZYOok3LdUIAsTFb-gIaAv5oCHa-PRbZ8hBsRbr"> In the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, there were not many on earth who had linked themselves to God. At the time <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> of Ruth the line between God and man was very thin. It was thin to such an extent that it consisted mainly of two persons, a couple—Boaz and Ruth. This couple was brought together in a marvelous and sovereign way. Although Boaz was born an Israelite and Ruth was born in Moab, an incestuous country, Ruth was brought to the good land, even to Bethlehem, the city of David. </p>
<p data-content-id="BpFKZry5-FfG8_5pNa72kxgom825Oh0V8n8NhuYaTkIxVW7au2Zyvlwxwdlm55Q1u"> Ruth had the right to glean from many different fields, but she went to Boaz’s field. When Naomi, Ruth’s mother-in-law, learned that Ruth had gleaned in Boaz’s field, she was very happy. Desiring to find a resting place for Ruth, Naomi instructed her about what to do (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44144" data-verses="Ruth 3:2-4">3:2-4</span>). Ruth followed Naomi’s direction, and she and Boaz were brought into a courtship. When they were at the threshing floor, she applied to be his wife. He said to her, “All that you say, I will do for you; for all the assembly of my people know that you are a worthy woman. And now it is true that I am a kinsman, yet there is a kinsman closer than I. Stay for the night; and in the morning if he will do the kinsman’s duty, fine; let him do it. But if he is not willing to do the kinsman’s duty for you, I will do it for you, as Jehovah lives” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44145" data-verses="Ruth 3:11-13">vv. 11-13</span>). In a very kind way Boaz was indicating that he would act in accordance with God’s ordinances (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44146" data-verses="Leviticus 25:25">Lev. 25:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44147" data-verses="Deuteronomy 25:5-10">Deut. 25:5-10</span>). Their courtship led to their marriage. Through that marriage Ruth, a Moabite widow, gained the holy citizens’ citizenship, becoming one among God’s elect. </p>
<p data-content-id="xvYUNdqwtmYAy1AU8PZ_YBWXkomNhfQGb5l-A0pzlgObstb418cXo9gsSxtGVKc7K"> The crucial point here is that, as part of her reward for God’s economy, Ruth gained a redeeming husband, who typifies Christ as the redeeming Husband to the believers. Only Christ can be both our Husband and our Redeemer. Before we were saved, we were in trouble and could not get out of trouble. Now as believers in Christ, we have a Husband who is our eternal, present, and daily Redeemer, rescuing us, saving us, delivering us, from all our troubles. What a gain this is! </p>

This typifies being redeemed from the sin of the believers’ old man. Ruth’s dead husband had sold his field, and the indebtedness of that transaction had fallen upon her in the marriage union and needed to be redeemed. Boaz said to the kinsman who was closer than he, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi’s hand, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead man, in order to raise up the dead man’s name upon his inheritance” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44149" data-verses="Ruth 4:5">v. 5</span>). That kinsman replied, “I cannot redeem it for myself, or else it will mar my own inheritance. Redeem for yourself what I should redeem, for I cannot redeem it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44150" data-verses="Ruth 4:6">v. 6</span>). Boaz did so, redeeming Ruth from her indebtedness. </p>
<p data-content-id="Qhw7XFQorTgw1dU0zcVt6lYxrocYnx6eCbH3hWg6Xl48MaWZJVn97mV2b-pZXVxPE"> Our Husband, Christ, is not merely capable; He is almighty. He has redeemed us from the indebtedness of our dead husband. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44151" data-verses="Romans 7:1">Romans 7</span> the dead husband, our old husband, is our old man. God created us to be His wife, but we rebelled against Him. We gave Him up and assumed the position of the husband for ourselves. Our sinful husband encumbered us with many debts. But on the day we married Christ, we received a Husband who is our almighty, omnipotent Redeemer. We all need Christ to be such a Husband to us. Having Him as our Husband, we should come to Him and simply say, “Lord Jesus, I need You.” </p>

This indicates that she had an all-inclusive and all-extensive gain with the position and capacity to bring Christ into the human race. She is thus a great link in the chain that is bringing Christ to every corner of the earth. We all are indebted to Ruth, for without her Christ could not have reached us. But wherever we may be on earth, Christ has reached us through Ruth. <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="OYASB8NWMRGs8KfUBzlq95svbIU59p-gcmw8XsgHxq2SVvnFzuxEU9raHhg5InHzG"> The burden of this ministry is to produce Christ in the believers. This means that the goal of this ministry is not to teach you to be humble or merely to glorify God in your behavior. Rather, the goal of this ministry is to “inject” you with Christ, to impart Christ as an “antibiotic” to you. The more we receive such an injection, the more we will be able to sing, “Christ liveth in me, / Christ liveth in me; / Oh! what a salvation this, / That Christ liveth in me” (<em>Hymns,</em> #507). On the one hand, this injection of Christ will kill our old man; on the other hand, it will make us producers of Christ, those who minister Christ to others. </p>

The incarnation of Christ was a matter of His being brought out of eternity into time with His divinity. In a practical way, this needs to take place in our daily living. Every day of our Christian life should be a continuation of Christ’s incarnation, with Christ being brought forth in order to be born into others through our ministering Christ to them. In order for this to happen, we all need to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and even speak Christ to others. Ministering Christ in this way will surely change us. </p>

<p data-content-id="u7Ogwfw4KQ80NaXaNAkET1FvEGf6Fib3XbUL9Wm5KJ5wmdJIU-cEPhUzbSYcYiTbA"> Ruth, being a woman in Adam in God’s creation and a Moabitess in man’s fall, thus becoming an old man with these two aspects, typifies the church, before her salvation, as men <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> in God’s creation and sinners in man’s fall being “our old man” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44179" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>). Ruth became a Moabitess not <em>because</em> of man’s fall but <em>in</em> man’s fall. The Moabites, an incestuous people, typify all sinners, because all sinners were born of incest (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44180" data-verses="John 8:41">John 8:41</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44181" data-verses="John 8:44">44a</span>). This means that Ruth was not the only one with an incestuous background. We all have the same background. Adam and Eve joined themselves to Satan; that is, they married Satan. As human beings created by God, we should have married our Creator, taking Him as our Husband (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44182" data-verses="Isaiah 54:5">Isa. 54:5</span>), but instead we married a fellow creature, Satan. This is incest. </p>

<p data-content-id="HX28jd0gqssmhDT17g10t0zRxMdQGSbOhgo9w-lA2Ucpgb5yJmRx3yh_IF-js0MHg"> We need to realize that the believers’ old man consists of a natural part created by God and a fallen part corrupted by sin. In God’s creation we are good—we are “doves”; but in the fallen Adam we are evil—we are “serpents.” The natural part is good and desires to do what is good, whereas the fallen part practices what is evil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44184" data-verses="Romans 7:19">Rom. 7:19</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44185" data-verses="Romans 7:21">21</span>). From this we see that in the old man typified by Ruth, we have two natures and that one of these natures is good and the other is evil. The evil nature, acting with the good one, assumed to be the husband, and together they became the old man, our incestuous husband. </p>
<p data-content-id="XFWW32TQ3RTngADhNIPkRQxsXJlWdZ7pFhIcpe9IZQJa3ZSVRZW7-j6K4Dxbply-V"> Our old man has been crucified with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44186" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>). Christ’s crucifixion destroyed the fallen part of our old man, but it redeemed the created part. Christ did not redeem the fallen part of our old man; on the contrary, He terminated it. However, He redeemed our created part in order to recover us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> Therefore, Christ’s death on the cross terminated the fallen part of our old man and redeemed the part created by God. </p>

Just as the redeemed Ruth became a new wife to Boaz, so the saved and regenerated church has become His new wife, His counterpart, in the organic union with Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="bRM0h2qj2wHL0MQscIROhqfUNp3Ty-y-o00J7dHiB04Em7k6A58NDRxqMrgiIboON"> The more we consider these aspects of Ruth as a type of the church, the more we can know our status as believers in Christ today. First, we were created by God. Second, we became fallen persons. Third, we were redeemed by Christ. Fourth, we were regenerated by the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Thus, we may summarize our status in four words: created, fallen, redeemed, and regenerated. </p>
<p data-content-id="qppg1A71t1EPZ7NKoJWBvWAF_iZWMSqcpihSFBZXB_C8mF1MHLdy_K8PtWpFkda3G"> Let us now consider further how, in typology, the various aspects of Ruth’s situation apply to us today. In God’s creation Ruth was good, but she became fallen in Adam. When she turned to Israel, she believed in the saving God and was redeemed. Then, having become a new person, she married Boaz and became his new wife. </p>
<p data-content-id="yAO7yf6YIMX8O2pAUy25exgNO9rNHPaWS3ry3NKeYKuPnQfVa2j3stp7i_GPzph8o"> As signified by the type of Ruth and her dead husband, Ruth’s natural part created by God and her fallen part cooperated to assume to be the husband, forsaking God as the Husband. This husband was the main part of her old man, which was composed of her God-created part and her fallen part. The old man as the illegal husband made many mistakes and incurred a great deal of debt, thereby selling himself and losing his right as a God-created being because of his sins. After Ruth’s husband died, she was not only a widow <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> but was also in a condition of indebtedness. The only way out of this condition was to be united in marriage to the proper person. When Ruth married Boaz, she was redeemed from her indebtedness, and she became his new wife for the producing of the needed heirs. </p>
<p data-content-id="8MxrDjhiSGUnd1EQkucW5vlHzLQ08M9AYwODwsEYmPZWXaNClWApl7W6wq2p4X0ds"> This is a picture of our situation today. Christ, our Husband, died to redeem us and to clear the indebtedness caused by the sins of our old man. Then in resurrection He, as the life-giving Spirit, regenerated us to make us, as created, fallen, and redeemed persons, a new creation married to Him. Now, in the organic union between Christ and us, we can bring forth Christ and spread Christ for His increase. </p>
<p data-content-id="0Fx6fSC003tT9l--KDujhsG9OGoMGevq7Bp8_pQqB_wvW3D3EYHIzsPjDB9cClkrd"> At this juncture, I would ask you to note the following five matters related to Ruth typifying the church. I hope that these matters will help us to grasp the intrinsic significance of Ruth as a type of the church. </p>

Fifth, she was a Moabitess, an incestuous Gentile abandoned by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44201" data-verses="Deuteronomy 23:3">Deut. 23:3</span>). Sixth, she became one who joined God’s elect, Israel, in partaking of God’s promises (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44202" data-verses="Ephesians 2:12-13">Eph. 2:12-13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44203" data-verses="Ephesians 3:6">3:6</span>).

Eighth, she was one who kept the line of Christ’s incarnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44206" data-verses="Matthew 1:5">Matt. 1:5b</span>). Ninth, she was the great-grandmother of David who brought forth the royal family of the God-ordained government on the earth.

First, as a God-created person with her status of a natural person with its rights by birth, Ruth typifies the believers as a natural man. Second, by her status as a fallen person—as a Moabitess, a descendant of an incestuous race—Ruth typifies the believers as the fallen man with all his corruption in nature. Third, in her status as the wife of her old husband with his indebtedness—that is, as a person involved with sin and indebted because of it—Ruth typifies the believers as the old man composed of the natural man and the fallen man. Fourth, in her status as a person redeemed by her kinsman, Ruth typifies the believers as those who have been terminated by the cross in the fallen part of their old man and redeemed back to God in the God-created part, with all the indebtedness of sin cleared up and with the birthright recovered. Fifth, in her status as the wife of Boaz in the marriage union, Ruth typifies the believers in God’s new creation as parts of the new man to be the counterpart of Christ in the organic union. Sixth, in her status as an ancestor of Christ to bring forth Christ to the human race and to minister Christ to all the people on earth, Ruth typifies the believers as ministers of Christ, who bring and present Christ to all men, supplying them with Christ universally. <span class="pg" data-page-id="35" id="35">[35]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="oS6SeE670MP9V9dhXLwRd5n0JfUuOUdfauYP9iTqe-tJsWfmYyMzEsJnjM7sX7Bmn"> From the typology of Ruth’s statuses, we can see that as a natural man, we became fallen and involved with sin. Because of this, we needed Christ as our Kinsman to be our Redeemer. After we were redeemed, we became a new wife to Christ, our new Husband in God’s new creation. As such, we have become the ministers of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="3gOpnVN70qCBRfCVZhf_wfqArzDWl3mUw9NL5A4ZCToHL8C2QLumEBA8jH65tfbmd"> May we all be impressed with the fact that in these great things Ruth typifies us, the believers in Christ: in God’s creation, in man’s fall, in the old man’s living, in Christ’s redemption, in God’s new creation, and in Christ’s ministry. Today we are ministers of Christ, bringing Christ forth and ministering Christ to people everywhere. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aHgpE99yLGvPkNO9YJ8s6yMExZpU617unygb1zZDJWX6vqV_Kue9U58fYqhYiNiyQ">GOD’S MOVE IN THE SPIRIT OF POWER<br/>AND GOD’S MOVE IN THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="bRM0h2qj2wHL0MQscLxOl4vUNp3Ty-y-o00J7dHiB04Em7k6A58NDRxqMrgiIboON"> This crucial point is that these books show us one picture with two sides. One side concerns God’s move in His economical Spirit, the Spirit of power; the other side concerns God’s move in His essential Spirit, the Spirit of life. With all the judges, and even with Joshua and Caleb, we can see only the work, the move, of God in power. In the books of Joshua and Judges it is hard to find even a hint of God’s move in His life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="qppg1A71t1EPZ7NKoK2BkEAF_iZWMSqcpihSFBZXB_C8mF1MHLdy_K8PtWpFkda3G">SAMSON AS A TYPICAL ILLUSTRATION</h2><p data-content-id="yAO7yf6YIMX8O2pAUxW5UjwNO9rNHPaWS3ry3NKeYKuPnQfVa2j3stp7i_GPzph8o"> Samson is a typical illustration of one who moves in the Spirit of power but not in the Spirit of life. Samson was very powerful, even at the time of his death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44218" data-verses="Judges 16:28-30">Judg. 16:28-30</span>), yet with him we cannot see anything of life. Yes, he was a Nazarite, keeping his hair long as a sign that he submitted to God as his Head, not drinking wine, and not eating unclean food. However, this was his following the divine regulations; it did not indicate that he had anything of the divine life. Even though Samson was a Nazarite, he did not know how to restrain the lust of his flesh. The matter of sex was a great stumbling block to him, and both among God’s holy people in the Holy Land and among the Gentiles, he practiced the <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> indulging of his lust. This shows that he was not a person in life. </p>
<p data-content-id="pHNIOQlhuYta9GTWKDg2748Zy4zVh9493mQgzD4Es3667YqArK31ARL1SXgaMwU_x"> Furthermore, the account of Samson, as the last judge, the conclusion of the judges, indicates that the entire situation of the judges consummated in the exercising of power without anything of life. It is difficult to understand how a Nazarite could be such a fleshly person. He was full of power and also full of lust. In his case, these two things went together. </p>
<p data-content-id="vgKWO0uwiaOf_gAGD8vXs6rYOrK4NNAFid6Mm-YGEEDHqUZL7Y_ScgiBepYNiAxJL"> This picture answers a question that I have had for many years. A number of Pentecostal preachers have been reckless, without any restraint, or control, of the lust of their flesh. Yet at the same time they have been genuinely powerful in their preaching. On the one hand, they powerfully preached the fundamental gospel concerning Christ, the Son of God, as our Savior; on the other hand, they were living in fornication. I have known a number of cases like this both in China and in the United States. For a long time I could not understand how there could be such a situation. Now I realize that these preachers are today’s Samsons. Jehovah’s Spirit came upon Samson (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44219" data-verses="Judges 13:25">Judg. 13:25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44220" data-verses="Judges 14:6">14:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44221" data-verses="Judges 14:19">19</span>); there is no doubt that he had the real power of God. Nevertheless, he and so many of the judges had no control over their indulgence in lust, such as Gideon, who had seventy-two sons of many wives (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44222" data-verses="Judges 8:30-31">8:30-31</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44223" data-verses="Judges 9:5">9:5</span>); Jair, who had thirty sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44224" data-verses="Judges 10:3-4">10:3-4</span>); Ibzan, who had thirty sons and thirty daughters, and brought in thirty foreign daughters from abroad for his sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44225" data-verses="Judges 12:8-9">12:8-9</span>); and Abdon, who had forty sons and thirty grandsons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44226" data-verses="Judges 12:13-14">12:13-14</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="WjgB26X6yEAzC1MSrbAN-ykBTGHQ9woha8j1AwRSoChwvrrLdK51Os9OeUYuuxE7x">THE BOOK OF RUTH BEING A BOOK OF LIFE</h2><p data-content-id="2LWlzLrOlNAloUlhiDzXiVfFhbWbJG6K2MQ9zjW2qVgXmB--dHkInEdT6gEpNbXsP"> In contrast, the book of Ruth is a book not of power but of life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="u7Ogwfw4KQ80NaXaNDEEQ0lvEGf6Fib3XbUL9Wm5KJ5wmdJIU-cEPhUzbSYcYiTbA">The Example of Naomi</h2><p data-content-id="fDCqSAXyIbc-yjs1xh7FUgOMpE4ZJojlxFjxIbBSIAJqSBI6MunnkcDzu0T0dQz3j"> Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, was punished by God because he did not live according to God’s eternal economy. He did not commit fornication; on the contrary, it seems that he just made a little mistake in leaving the Holy Land. But when he left the good land due to the famine, God came in <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> and dealt with him, leaving his wife and his two daughters-in-law with nothing, as widows without children. I believe that before going to Moab, Elimelech mortgaged all his property, including the inheritance of his two sons. Eventually, Naomi, a widow with two widowed daughters-in-law, returned from the land of Moab, owning nothing. Nevertheless, Naomi did not rebel against God’s dealing. Instead, admitting that God had dealt not only with her husband but also with her, she said, “The All-sufficient One has dealt very bitterly with me. I went out full, but Jehovah has brought me back empty” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44227" data-verses="Ruth 1:20-21">Ruth 1:20b-21a</span>). From her speaking we can see that she was a godly woman. She believed in God, regarded Him, and feared Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="Ig7OjOHccyYForn-eioVlaSi7o78RmfSNlbWHPTQkZHgIx6BJMb0WBkdfkvYxbBop"> When Naomi came back to the Holy Land, she came back to the rest in God’s economy to participate again in the enjoyment of the God-promised land, where there would be the possibility of being related to Christ’s genealogy. Her returning was a great thing, yet it was not accomplished by power. Rather, she came back as a poor beggar who sent her daughter-in-law Ruth to glean in the field. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="HX28jd0gqssmhDT17jV0u0TRxMdQGSbOhgo9w-lA2Ucpgb5yJmRx3yh_IF-js0MHg">The Example of Ruth</h2><p data-content-id="XFWW32TQ3RTngADhNLvkSTRsXJlWdZ7pFhIcpe9IZQJa3ZSVRZW7-j6K4Dxbply-V"> Ruth was outstanding in life. The purpose of the book of Ruth is not to tell us anything concerning power but to reveal the things of life to the uttermost. Naomi made it clear to Ruth that she had no capacity to produce a husband for her who could redeem her and bring forth a descendant for her father-in-law, Elimelech. Feeling that the situation was hopeless, Naomi encouraged Ruth to return to her mother’s house in order to have a future. Ruth’s reply was full of life. She would go with Naomi forever, being with her in poverty. Ruth said to Naomi, “Do not entreat me to leave you and turn away from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. Where you die, I will die; and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more as well, if anything but death parts me from you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44228" data-verses="Ruth 1:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). This is the real spirit of the New Testament believers—to follow Jesus by forsaking everything: parents, <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> children, relatives, houses, and so forth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44229" data-verses="Matthew 10:37">Matt. 10:37</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44230" data-verses="Matthew 19:29">19:29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44231" data-verses="Mark 10:29-30">Mark 10:29-30</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="44232" data-verses="Luke 14:26">Luke 14:26</span>). This is the way of life revealed in the New Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="kNpFHcxWku-yiKEFDbuaNXDbMunNU_GpTNqm18Wd8KtPNmq2ytVwOjvGXC1OesoQi">The Example of Boaz</h2><p data-content-id="J2vmJthFMEjj4p1kGlxgX8kU9eZiHGSbgb8DsUDRFeZlrj0E1hwwrV2xJJjvyu3Xw"> Like Naomi and Ruth, Boaz was a person in life to the uttermost. Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, I must seek some resting place for you, that it may go well with you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44233" data-verses="Ruth 3:1">Ruth 3:1</span>). Then Naomi charged her to wash herself, anoint herself, put on her best clothes, go down to the threshing floor, and, at the proper time, make herself known to Boaz. Eventually, Ruth identified herself to Boaz, saying, “I am Ruth, your maidservant. Spread your cloak over your maidservant, for you are a kinsman” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44234" data-verses="Ruth 3:9">v. 9</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="z14Sx-yFW_ePMDCtSu1KdUkqE6z3w8ZmX7OldKIJmkaZXEZ_HE4UyCZWzgPcP8QEM"> In his contact with Ruth at the threshing floor that night, Boaz was absolutely restrained, not moved, in his lust, absolutely different from the lust-indulging judges. Boaz blessed Ruth and highly appraised her. Then he told her that he was willing to bear his responsibility according to God’s ordinance to redeem Elimelech’s inheritance, yet he would not overstep the one who was ahead of him in this matter (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="44235" data-verses="Ruth 3:12-13">vv. 12-13</span>). Here Boaz seemed to be saying, “Daughter, wait until tomorrow. Yes, I am your kinsman, and we are free in God. But there is another kinsman who is closer to you than I am, and he must be allowed to go ahead of me. If I do not care for him in this matter, the holy people of God will condemn me for overstepping. Let the other kinsman go ahead of me. If he is not willing to do the kinsman’s duty for you, I will do it for you.” Boaz was lawful in every way, and his being lawful was based not on power but on life. This shows that Boaz had the highest standard of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="aHgpE99yLGvPkNO9YJ8s-gMExZpU617unygb1zZDJWX6vqV_Kue9U58fYqhYiNiyQ">TAKING THE WAY OF LIFE IN THE LORD’S RECOVERY</h2><p data-content-id="bRM0h2qj2wHL0MQscLxOgq_UNp3Ty-y-o00J7dHiB04Em7k6A58NDRxqMrgiIboON"> In the Lord’s recovery, should we take the way of the judges to be powerful and to do a great work? If we take the way of the judges instead of the way of life, whatever we accomplish will mean nothing. Not one judge was a forefather of Christ. The judges had nothing to do with keeping the line in humanity to bring in God in His incarnation. It was Ruth <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> and Boaz who participated in keeping this line. However, they did not fight a war; they did not exercise any power. </p>
