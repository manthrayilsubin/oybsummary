<p data-content-id="kL2zsn7q9bR6UxBu4mOMBf-Cvq83Th8Djg3SG4TbzjdztE4DxgKwEqoxOCKGU6mj3"> Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs are particular books. With this message we begin the life-study of Proverbs. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JgGgp6UD-4O4bSUiAWWwhesQpqXzm_IAq8g5UIUNjeIZ1J8LNGk_4qhU4NppsKvnh">I. THE TITLE</h2><p data-content-id="zNUBg9gO7g1yso1ue-BZwb2rUO7Z1s7B98FlqjGpkKVW5xHAhSj5ZDEszEdDUnzT0"> <em>Proverbs</em> in Hebrew is <em>mishle,</em> meaning “similitudes, proverbs, parables,” to represent general truths. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="at_lhq2MImmMdjEUQyA7y0NeCBQa65B81dl20IyTFbqS_5uGnvPM36C6hCgetfVFF">II. THE WRITERS</h2><p data-content-id="bs6ZyS2jJhGDJCO53NGicwJ2ftNEzNVWrRJ6IRj1YvjCUwncV2IilZYIrFmVV-ZCT"> Proverbs is a collection of the words of the wise. The main writers and collectors are Solomon, who wrote three thousand proverbs (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52067" data-verses="1Kings 4:32">1 Kings 4:32</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52068" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 12:9">Eccl. 12:9</span>), and Hezekiah, who added some proverbs of the forefathers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52069" data-verses="Proverbs 25:1">chapters twenty-five through twenty-nine</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NQRVYIQWlhZ_nO3os_D_wCHObBDAURooqWZUdNhRXQyV38fZZmmzcG6dwERjWstsx">III. THE TIME</h2><p data-content-id="tWUl9nlAAlnikvXtz8_6xmD_jNi9krw5AxEVY4drEB5iJmJfV0OdP-KBbPOkpTwRX"> The time of the writing of this book was about 1000 B.C. Whereas Solomon’s portion was written about 1000 B.C., Hezekiah’s portion was written about three hundred years later. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hxYil6J_XNHi2Z7-C91gVLh75g1Jp8gKFoTvVxSMwoJOpN8Kh2nS3KOhPT4yprS_h">IV. THE PLACE</h2><p data-content-id="UdBpzsM2lxu_HKz84Nockb36Et6_w5SbDoB6BxB2koE3bIk5rqHUNzp-tBhgdX11K"> Proverbs probably was written in Jerusalem. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MpIRc5y8aVKzVRFJFw4s_H5Vp1zew7euhbF2jwYd04czHHZL_z6bGxbvclKf5V-4S">V. THE THEME</h2><p data-content-id="VLc0DDuVXjuW11fmDcsZfZYORgIrgqpVnKdBUO2fTRZISs59ApwfqB_zE2dP34Y3e"> The theme of Proverbs is that this book consists of words of wisdom teaching people how to behave and how to build up their character in the human life. Humanly speaking, this is the great subject, and all religions and philosophies are concerned with it. The matters of behavior and the building <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> up of character have been the subjects of teaching ever since humankind came into being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ibeuvIHSF0kPb3ioFDHvJ5HQ0DfcLrmuF9wxWIahWIsYYyxa_2Dp7RzbrIjNPjfRw">VI. THE POSITION OF PROVERBS<br/>IN THE DIVINE REVELATION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</h2><p data-content-id="1Z_PL-n9_cIPuue0_MNP7WiPBb2w4yeEmcTvm8PCRbhVOj4hM1IUsZx0BtE7DFA3i"> Now we need to consider the position of Proverbs in the divine revelation of the Holy Scriptures. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9mMjE-163mHgt13KvNG1I-gMHgdrtyFDGROhniSCDV_aRPhm7RCtx0fOgBE2T2L4C">A. The Divine Revelation Being Progressive</h2><p data-content-id="jUaIeASrnrAstVi8KWZQaSZcbIjWoS3Lu3WXlZBOW2sogj0TzuoS71IJsw654CGnp"> The divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures is progressive, from the creation of man in God’s image in the first chapter of Genesis, through many processes in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, to the consummation of the New Jerusalem in the last two chapters of Revelation. Thousands of things are covered in the Bible. The first thing is God’s creation of the heavens and the earth, and the last thing is the New Jerusalem. Between these two ends, the divine revelation goes along with the course of human history. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="TWpTXfLf126waRfGjKMkQ4koY6oMo8yqbrSentqwu0tUKA9AE1MU6kYR_BxsfE-rL">B. Difficult to Locate</h2><p data-content-id="n-Yp8QThIXMRlUOeLQcWFyGlgpH6pOYZz8Keuu1s9d8imxX6RrPX4NvKh8HnOPuTo"> As Proverbs is a collection of the words of the wise of many centuries up to Hezekiah in the seventh century before Christ, it is difficult to locate it in the divine revelation of the Holy Scriptures. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6Ho10sXvCL97m43poIfq_1p8dOABA3UEnxvz08l4d2tqtwnrHVsVrPb7w3OgnnGHu">C. A Subsidiary to the Law</h2><p data-content-id="REz0od4t8iTNjAicnMqHakpVBNTB4_vUcYbGo0y8GHCgVc8Vxs996WQ4u5L2s0wfA"> Since the proverbs were collected mainly by two kings of Judah in the age of the law, the book of Proverbs may be considered a subsidiary to the law. The law is the portrait of God, demanding God’s people to keep it that they might be made copies of God for His expression and glorification. Proverbs as a subsidiary to the law helps God’s people to keep the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOhdSpTBzetBkuwi3kafnH9MuWz535QaTNZs2h--BmIWOIBy4R_yGdSsCw_VtlYr_"> Because the law was written according to what God is, the law tells man how to behave and how to build up himself according to God’s attributes. God is love and light, and God is holy and righteous. These are some of God’s attributes. For God to create man in His own image means that God created man according to what He is, that is, according to <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> His attributes. The law, which was written according to God’s attributes, demands that man behave and build himself up according to God. Regarding this, Proverbs is a subsidiary part of the law, instructing people how to behave and how to build themselves up according to what God is. This helps us to see what the position of Proverbs probably is in the divine revelation in the Scriptures. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wbiqXuNa33lWT9pinlCptE5lwofFPb3wi5-6vYzzC-jG6cGjaqI1WAaSwaJjTgnZp">D. The Sequence of the Five Books of Poetry</h2><p data-content-id="LEfkEDnTQtuBwteYyDQsTDHeIkUSvVyheeHQ3AE2DyNmy1rTa9jnkr7uxvoSZ8IOb"> The sequence of the five books of poetry—Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs—in their spiritual significances is excellent and sweet. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="mmOcroQGHHAhfWi_PzCxdnh0_84-toWJdwy6lb_PUZZcQJ8od5ZCtkqkmMjnHRufj">1. Job</h2><p data-content-id="ZIcjbWIVBnaIZAD8CR6hjEHqbsrySBT7oguAwFxhQ0SWNW_4aP33acERCfDfs9kvz"> Job stresses that God wants man to seek and gain God solely without any other blessings and prosperity, and that God wants man to seek Him for his perfection and not for his integrity. From this we see that God wants man to seek the kind of perfection that is God Himself, not a perfection based on human uprightness and integrity. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="Ahh_kgN8VVX17JPhwQKpTS27AtW7bplpHf0dHMTfql6fWOKAGNet_NUC1Um7viLQ3">2. Psalms</h2><p data-content-id="FNbY6bDOrAPFV9FIqYpaVjPM8Jk_Nnr5VxAh-eNswZRfXIGeQxF6z19b4fXU50i93"> Psalms stresses man’s seeking and contacting of God through his praises, prayers, and singing with exultation. The way to seek and contact God is to praise Him, to pray to Him, and to sing with exultation. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="CzeoRLdT_eErNC5O6Ob-5qNEj6_1vuOQHGC_Jxp2_uYEXyKfV5GZqvvOXc0yfPvU2">3. Proverbs</h2><p data-content-id="PtRQhkSAPI1OfONU6csr-tuTR4G7spdoQ0KTec0lAI5Zad_FeO8N-NQoOf5V9zpUk"> Proverbs stresses wisdom that man receives of God through his contacting of God and that teaches man how to behave in his human life. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="-934NcDdx-ro5zKBJ971s79ePebaFtzvzF7-pCeOE7AxC2znVqpSaOxjeS3KiFhza">4. Ecclesiastes</h2><p data-content-id="pRL4pqH4yQ185wO8I-AhQU8vQC5gqVXuF0sJ85H5qJA8nMFIyi3FsX0uuzi-oN9mP"> Ecclesiastes stresses the vanity of vanities of all the things under the sun, which is realized by man through the wisdom received from God. The things under the sun are vanity, but the things in the heavens are reality. If you have contacted God and have received wisdom of God, you will <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> see that everything under the sun is a vanity, a chasing of the wind. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="vH6ZhGINb0OZaQGIh-4DfHmjAX51Y1bPWC7MhrH41b3DFlU-O3kuRsEZjPlRc03qB">5. Song of Songs</h2><p data-content-id="W6mmvPG-eeldMlR8Oya0RggHZmbxccejKpLmtC9GXymCWfXw30mPC5LzqkpRf5ZnK"> Song of Songs stresses that Christ is the song of songs, the satisfaction of satisfactions to human life that is versus the vanity of vanities of all the things under the sun. Only Christ is the satisfaction, becoming our song which we sing to Him because we are satisfied. A lover of Christ should be one who is attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to pursue after Him for full satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="2o_nanNbfveUsRNC8G1iGYSCGak-IsPFD8ImJsX-i4mcLN43GGmQi7ueR-Nf_dQ2R"> The book of Proverbs is a particular book among the books of the Bible. It has a particular character; that is, it presents to us the words of wisdom by many ancient wise men, which is unanimously considered good by all the people who read it. But whether it is really good or not depends upon what kind of reader you are. </p>
<p data-content-id="uO3LqTIiOEfyT1a2-YYcGC-sgfQ0WLeu9tD3tshln1e9FEUH1nvzrvXsRnKxUYeEz"> If you are an ethical person with a strong mind and have a desire to be perfect as a genuine moral person, surely this book would help you to make a success in your pursuit of perfection. But it helps you to cultivate yourself, that is, to cultivate the human “bright virtue” created for man by God according to His attributes, that is, according to what He is. However, it does not help you to be a person who lives in his spirit according to the Spirit of God who dwells in you for the accomplishment of God’s eternal economy, that is, to produce and build up the Body of Christ which consummates the New Jerusalem as God’s heart’s desire and ultimate goal. In the Old Testament Job was exactly such a person. He was satisfied with his integrity, with his pursuit of human perfection. But that was not what God wanted of him; rather it replaced what God wanted of him and then it became an enemy of God frustrating him, a man created by God to fulfill God’s purpose. God’s purpose in creating man is to have man be filled with Him to be His expression, not an expression of human perfection. So the success of Job in human perfection was torn down by God. In this tearing down by God, God tore down Job also. Job was perplexed, not knowing what to do. Then God came in to reveal Himself to Job, indicating that He <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> Himself is what Job should pursue, gain, and express. Then Job had a big turn from pursuing human perfection to pursue God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="fR0eOt4Iv-sJdvESIWhMijBP5z1RSK2HdcU8yutUuep-pBs8X6MPRwqFZxpgzUk10"> If you are a person who is a law-keeper, surely you will appreciate all the proverbs in this book as words of wise men, thinking that they could help you to be a good or even better law-keeper. If so, you just make all the proverbs many, many laws and fall into the snare of keeping the law as many Jews do, who do not know God’s purpose in the dispensation of His law, that is, to expose fallen man’s weakness. </p>
<p data-content-id="INz_t8XmHAHBNVHoXkeGxPacKz_6POqQBeIXKtSc4okHGPkSgo4mnjopd80b9D9OY"> If you are a person who loves the Lord and pursues Christ, not self-perfection, and who loves the Lord’s word in the entire Bible and reads it with a praying spirit, not for the seeking of the doctrine of letters but for seeking the Spirit and word of life, not to get any help for self-cultivation but for the nourishment of your spirit that you may live a Christian life which is perfect not in human virtues but in the divine virtues which are the expressions of the divine attributes, then this book will render you nuggets and gems to strengthen your life of pursuing Christ for the fulfillment of God’s economy in producing and building up the Body of Christ. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="0NfVmAZX2qhH5ShNhQrV93ay2K5II71FfrxfVNJghjUSGPtdFEyjdN3CMrYpJjbMw">THE PRINCIPLES<br/>FOR MAN TO LIVE A PROPER HUMAN LIFE</h1><p class="scripture" data-content-id="7EfVLp3CuztJN_idN1K5EDbHwHfEityuDpGz3nVrv-QuoR_87ws3EDioXHVf-R2H0">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52079" data-verses="Proverbs 1:1">Prov. 1—9</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52080" data-verses="Proverbs 31:1">31</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="_1oBhdyqK3bZEVs1VifArvBaKVaIgUVaS6LdFuKZGnEDXnCOaD-Yo1cuK9e1sfjC3"> What the book of Proverbs is to us and what the entire Bible is to us depend on what kind of person we are. For the apostle Paul every book of the Old Testament was Spirit and life. But for many of today’s Christians the Bible, including the New Testament, is mainly a book of proverbs. Such Christians do not understand a verse like <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52081" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>, which speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ for the producing of the church to fulfill God’s economy. They may have no interest in these matters. However, they may be very interested in what <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52082" data-verses="Ephesians 5:1">Ephesians 5</span> says about husbands loving their wives and about wives submitting to their husbands. This illustrates the strong tendency among Christians to try to understand the New Testament according to their ethical mind. They are not interested in anything that cannot be understood in an ethical way. In particular, they do not understand the New Jerusalem and do not seek to understand it. From this we see that the kind of person we are determines what the Bible will be to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="BsuaHgjhsjNDNTPu90j0mOgo_OKeze70umchIN6bLZWKhxA3ViIkUy1wS6oz0Do12"> In this message we will consider from Proverbs the principles for man to live a proper human life. Each of these principles—revering God, needing wisdom, honoring one’s parents, and holding marriage in honor—is a nugget. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xWMDl6-jI4XI9k3ZxO5ufi_38nrYQlVy8ECiVP60FTojro-FkysO0E9Rk8Ps3Mkl9">I. REVERING GOD</h2><p data-content-id="rR11DPS-05LBD0CfcmhiNarG9fYwSL61lOFmkzUqCPd7SJzH1knnlg8EJLz6N5D7Y"> The first principle for man to live a proper human life is revering God. We should not only worship God but also revere Him. To revere God is to consider and regard Him in everything, never forgetting that He is the wonderful God who <span class="pg" data-page-id="8" id="8">[8]</span> has created us. When we are about to lose our temper, we should revere God. Revering God stops us from doing evil. Revering God also causes us to be touched by the sufferings of others and to show mercy and compassion to them. </p>
<p data-content-id="drhl611Y6x0lXQWzbOMzsSzHGiZD_uCbBYcePg5EwyqZF0AEDMHyxNWd30F65btXF"> Even though I was born into Christianity, before I believed in the Lord Jesus I never revered God. But from the day I got saved, I began to revere God. In everything I respected and regarded God. That caused a great change in my life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="at_lhq2MImmMdjEUQyA7y0NSCDEy65B81dl20IyTFbqS_5uGnvPM36C6hCgetfVFF">A. Fearing God</h2><p data-content-id="bs6ZyS2jJhGDJCO53NGicwJ6fvJozNVWrRJ6IRj1YvjCUwncV2IilZYIrFmVV-ZCT"> To revere God is to fear God. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52083" data-verses="Proverbs 1:7">1:7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52084" data-verses="Proverbs 9:10">9:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52085" data-verses="Proverbs 15:33">15:33a</span>). Knowledge, wisdom, and understanding come from God. If we fear Him, revering Him, these will be our possession. If we seek wisdom like silver and search for her like hidden treasures, then we will understand the fear of Jehovah and find the knowledge of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52086" data-verses="Proverbs 2:4-5">2:4-5</span>). The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52087" data-verses="Proverbs 8:13">8:13</span>). The fear of Jehovah prolongs days, but the years of the wicked will be shortened (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52088" data-verses="Proverbs 10:27">10:27</span>). He who walks in his uprightness fears Jehovah, but he who is perverse in his ways despises Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52089" data-verses="Proverbs 14:2">14:2</span>). In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence, and his children will have a place of refuge. The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, that one may turn aside from the snares of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52090" data-verses="Proverbs 1:26-27">vv. 26-27</span>). Better is a little with the fear of Jehovah, than great treasure and turmoil with it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52091" data-verses="Proverbs 15:16">15:16</span>). If we are rich in the fear of Jehovah, we will have peace. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="qKjPLsZRuKr-K5sU217k0HIR_17MRn2SI9RRfPfHE2DUPxcIbO5cMpo31N6NJDPS0">B. Trusting in God</h2><p data-content-id="yhBgdjxnJSWKETho1WTX5AfeEIfdtkazoxpXikas06jAn5H7PfNr0nE1P6bXZHz1i"> To revere God is also to trust in Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52092" data-verses="Proverbs 3:5-8">Proverbs 3:5-8</span> charges us to trust in Jehovah with all our heart and not to rely on our own understanding. In all our ways we should acknowledge Him, and He will make our paths straight. We should not be wise in our own eyes; we should fear Jehovah and depart from evil. This will be healing to our body and refreshment to our bones. </p>
<p data-content-id="892KiOTVD8-TXmdPyTR0O-0MN0ve0unz6Qtwn1p4aPmmg3-hjJT84SNZGQ4SjePca"> He who gives heed to the word will find good, and blessed is he who trusts in Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52093" data-verses="Proverbs 16:20">16:20</span>). In my frequent travels by airplane, many times Satan has threatened me within by <span class="pg" data-page-id="9" id="9">[9]</span> saying that my plane would crash. At those times I spoke to the Lord, saying, “Lord, I am not in a plane; I am in You. You are my plane.” This is to trust in the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="0NfVmAZX2qhH5ShNhQrV93ay2Kd0I71FfrxfVNJghjUSGPtdFEyjdN3CMrYpJjbMw"> According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52094" data-verses="Proverbs 3:26">3:26</span> Jehovah will be our confidence, and He will keep our foot from being caught. Every word of God is tried; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. We should not add to His words, lest He reprove us and we be found a liar (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52095" data-verses="Proverbs 30:5-6">30:5-6</span>). We must not change His word by adding something to it according to our point of view. This is dangerous. </p>

Then our barns will be filled with plenty, and our vats will burst open with new wine. If we make more money to lay up treasure for our future, that is pitiful. At least one tenth, the firstfruit, of our produce must be given to God. We should always be very generous in giving of the things which God has given us. This honors God. </p>

When He established the heavens, wisdom was there; when He inscribed a circle upon the surface of the deep, when He made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong, when He set for the sea its boundary, that the waters should not transgress His commandment, when He marked out the foundations of the earth; then wisdom was by Him, as a master workman.

<p data-content-id="3Ij9w8PTuH9rfb2g8iFDnPFntCs3vWPEZGsvIZzbT9U4BMMIRQLjPVHisUbl9i6SG"> When we come not only to the Proverbs but to any book of the Bible, especially Ephesians, the most spiritual book, we must be persons who are right. In reading the Bible, a right person is one who loves Christ, pursues after Him, and lives a life of denying himself and of being conformed to the death of Christ. This means that, on the negative side, we must deny the self, having all aspects of our being crucified, including our self, our natural man, our old man, our character, and whatever we have from birth. We have to put all these things on the cross. In other words, we must experience the cross of Christ, which has crucified us in every way. </p>
<p data-content-id="GxhdslJFLTck50QjE0dzuUP4kTRqweDt18u0e39qaBbik8RS1aGIxfqXl2Y6QZKnb"> God’s salvation, however, does not have only a negative aspect—termination. After termination there is a positive aspect—germination. After death there is resurrection. Death terminates and resurrection germinates. The human life, the fallen, rotten, corrupted life that has become satanic, must be terminated. In resurrection Christ dispenses the divine life which was released through His death. In the last step of His death, He released the divine life out from His humanity, and in resurrection He dispensed this released divine life into us through regeneration. This is germination. Now we have a new beginning with a new life and a new person. This new life is a life of both divinity and humanity. This is wonderful. </p>
<p data-content-id="cN0CHRVgLmPB1Sfq_qB_P_-NLtJZoT_N7UmIl6GD6oCAXMq7DWBSwRyyBFyGro1ah"> As lovers of Christ, we need to realize that, on the negative side, we are finished, terminated. Nevertheless, on the <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> positive side we have the processed and consummated Triune God to replace us as a new life. Therefore, we should live by this life every day. We have been crucified. Now we should be able to say with Paul in Galatians that it is no longer I who live, but another “I,” Christ Himself as our person, lives in us and we live with Him. We should live such a person by the power of resurrection and by the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Yhc1YByfA2SMIqSrXkxluGjU6HTawE_n_beBIPOKukiHMynZvTLpT6HeyKLdaA1rV"> When we are such persons, we can come to the Bible not merely by exercising our mentality but mainly by exercising our spirit. Our spirit will control our mind. In our spirit there is the marvelous, wonderful, processed, all-inclusive, sevenfold-intensified, life-giving Spirit. We live with Him, and He lives with us. Now when we come to the Bible by exercising our spirit, letting the Spirit move in us, every word of the Bible, in the Old Testament as well as in the New Testament, becomes spirit and life. Then our reading of any verse in the Bible will revive us. However, if we exercise only our mind, the words of the Bible will become death to us. </p>

Then when I come to the Bible, every word becomes a gem. We all need to read the book of Proverbs in this way. Then every word of Proverbs will become spirit and life to us. Every word will be living and become a gem to strengthen our life of pursuing Christ for the fulfillment of God’s economy in producing and building up the Body of Christ. </p>

In our daily life we mainly live an ethical life, spontaneously caring for matters of right and wrong. Those who live such an ethical life try their best to do what is right and to avoid doing what is wrong. </p>
<p data-content-id="hxYil6J_XNHi2Z7-C91gVLhv5ihpp8gKFoTvVxSMwoJOpN8Kh2nS3KOhPT4yprS_h"> What kind of life do you live day by day? Is your daily life a life of the new man? In your daily living do you put off the old man and put on the new man? In your married life is it your practice to love your wife or husband by the new man or by the old man? We should not think that loving in the old man is justified by God. That kind of love is according to the law, according to the old dispensation, not according to God’s New Testament economy and not according to the new creation. A brother may love his wife very much, but his love may be of the old creation, not of the new creation. </p>
<p data-content-id="UdBpzsM2lxu_HKz84Nockb3uEv-bw5SbDoB6BxB2koE3bIk5rqHUNzp-tBhgdX11K"> Among us in the Lord’s recovery today, who is living a daily life not ethically according to right and wrong but according to the new man through putting off the old man and putting on the new man? When we say that a particular brother is a good brother, we usually mean that he is an ethical brother, that he is not wrong in any way with his wife <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> and family, with the brothers and sisters in the church, and with the elders. Our basis for saying that he is a good brother is that he seems to be right with others. This evaluation is according to the old creation. On the other hand, we may criticize a certain brother because of his temper or his lack of patience. This criticism is based on the old creation. To evaluate and criticize others in this way indicates that we are living an ethical life according to the old man and that our daily life is not based on the new creation. Where can we find a person who is living according to the new creation? </p>
<p data-content-id="BsuaHgjhsjNDNTPu90j0mOgw_P-2ze70umchIN6bLZWKhxA3ViIkUy1wS6oz0Do12"> The book of Ecclesiastes tells us that everything under the sun is vanity. Only the new creation is above the sun and thus is not vanity. No matter how good, how excellent, how marvelous, and how wonderful something may be, as long as it is of the old creation, it is part of the vanity of vanities under the sun. </p>

We may study the Bible either by the old man or by the new man. Many Christians study the Word in a natural way, according to their old man. When you read the Word of God, do you read it by the old man or by the new man? If we merely exercise our mind to get knowledge from the Word, we are reading it by the old man. </p>
<p data-content-id="drhl611Y6x0lXQWzbOMzsSzfGgdn_uCbBYcePg5EwyqZF0AEDMHyxNWd30F65btXF"> To read the Bible by the new man is very different. Even before coming to the Bible, a person in the new man exercises his spirit to contact the Lord. He may confess, saying, “Lord, I am sorry that I live so much in my old man, not exercising my spirit to contact You, to live by my new man, as one of Your new creation. Lord, forgive this sin.” When we approach the Bible in this way, exercising our spirit, we have the deep feeling and sense that we are approaching, touching, and contacting God. By this I do not mean that the Bible is God but that in coming to the Bible we are coming to contact God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="QDdj4OROLRRW3PjnTvcw-b2Q3bSVd_4zcIdzRx2EPYv2ybkrGYA2Jfbb4BFc2R5f5">PRAY-READING THE WORD OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="Kp91rAbogj7KgoHJh6Rce5raKAbBo23ESmG4ZS7txAMb_CAQvq-Uhq-hLzIB2Q8cf"> When we come to the Bible to contact God, we should not <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> only read but pray-read the Word. No matter who we are, as long as we read the Bible without praying, we are reading by the old man. To read the Bible without praying is to contact the Word by the old man. The genuine reading of the Bible by the new man can never be separated from praying. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="lfeVQnHRVt_a63Zj6Aa-XG_MPSHMiI72F1f6AEgHz-42WdvHQx6bDCeS88584HGFf">Reading the Bible Prayerfully</h2><p data-content-id="OyOvTGXhfbbYvto_DLhXL47oLrdTEnvzayI9EOp7UnIkUYERVHVrYxnA_5c9vlYIY"> The term <em>pray-reading</em> has been in use for less than thirty years. This does not mean, however, that before we invented this term, there was no such thing as pray-reading. Many saints have practiced the pray-reading of the Word without using this expression to describe what they were doing. A number of seeking Christians have pointed out that the best way to read the Bible is to read it prayerfully. I have read certain books which said that we should read the Bible in a prayerful way. To read the Word prayerfully actually is to pray-read the Word. </p>
<p data-content-id="4xJszjZD3sFBBOWKdT9XkI9EmzT03fii8Q7cuEjbSmf9afpb0sAAMFbKmGF1m0Qku"> I can testify that long before we began to speak of pray-reading, it was my practice to read the Word with prayer. For example, I remember reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52229" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> and praying, “O God, thank You. You loved the world so much. O God my Father, You loved me so much that You gave Your Son, the Only Begotten, to me.” I had the feeling that I had touched God and that He had touched me. Through my prayer <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52230" data-verses="John 3:16">John 3:16</span> became Spirit and life to me. </p>

Pray-reading changes the Bible from letters to Spirit and life. Apart from pray-reading, the book of Proverbs is merely a collection of proverbs. But when we pray-read Proverbs, our pray-reading causes all the proverbs to become words of Spirit and life to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="GxhdslJFLTck50QjE0dzuUPkkSFGweDt18u0e39qaBbik8RS1aGIxfqXl2Y6QZKnb"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52231" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17-18">Ephesians 6:17-18</span> unveils the matter of pray-reading, and our invention of the term <em>pray-reading</em> was based on these verses. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52232" data-verses="Ephesians 6:17-18">Ephesians 6:17-18</span> tells us to “receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> every time in spirit.” Here we see that we should receive the word of God not merely by exercising our mind to understand but by means of all prayer and petition, praying by exercising our spirit. Prayer is general; petition particular. </p>
<p data-content-id="cN0CHRVgLmPB1Sfq_qB_P_-RLvt5oT_N7UmIl6GD6oCAXMq7DWBSwRyyBFyGro1ah"> We receive the word by reading. However, to receive (read) without praying is altogether a matter in the mind. Along with our reading we must pray. When we pray-read the Word by exercising our spirit, the word in black and white immediately becomes the Spirit. In this way the Spirit and the word are one. When we read, it is a word. When we pray with the exercise of our spirit, the word becomes Spirit and life. Whenever we come to the Word we must pray, and we should pray not merely with the mind but with the spirit. </p>

God is breathing out Himself as the word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52233" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16a</span>). This means that the Bible is God’s exhaling. The exhaling of God in the Bible is waiting for us to inhale. When we read any verse and pray, this praying becomes our inhaling of God’s breath. By this the Word becomes Spirit and life to us in our experience. If this is not our situation, then even in our reading of the Bible we are not in the new man but are still in the old man. </p>

He who loves pleasure will be a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52239" data-verses="Proverbs 21:17">21:17</span>). Do not be among those who get drunk with wine, among gluttonous eaters of flesh; for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them with rags (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52240" data-verses="Proverbs 23:20-21">23:20-21</span>). When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider carefully who is before you; and put a knife to your throat if you are a man of great appetite. Do not desire his delicacies, for they are deceitful food. Do not eat the bread of one who is envious, and do not desire his delicacies; for as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you, “Eat and drink”; but his heart is not with you. You will vomit up the morsel which you have eaten, and waste your pleasant words (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52241" data-verses="Proverbs 23:1-3">vv. 1-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52242" data-verses="Proverbs 23:6-8">6-8</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52243" data-verses="Proverbs 23:29-35">Verses 29 through 35</span> say, “Who has woe?

Who has redness of eyes? / Those who linger late over wine, / Those who go to seek out mixed wines. / Do not look upon the wine when it is red, / When it sparkles in the cup, / When it goes down smoothly; / In the end it bites like a serpent, / And stings like an adder. / Your eyes will see strange things, / And your heart will utter perverse things; / And you will be like one who lies down while at sea, / Or like one who lies down at the top of a mast. / They struck me, but I was not hurt; / They beat me, but I did not feel it; / When will I awake?

The whole universe is a mystery, and the center of this mystery is God. God created the heavens and the earth. Without God nothing would exist. </p>

First is God, then the Word, and then the Word became flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="GxhdslJFLTck50QjE0dzuUPskS1OweDt18u0e39qaBbik8RS1aGIxfqXl2Y6QZKnb"> We are accustomed to saying that God was incarnated. However, it may be more precise to speak of the Word becoming flesh. This Word-become-flesh is Christ in the flesh as the embodiment of God. Now we have three: God, the Word, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> Christ in the flesh. The Word, Christ the Son of God, became flesh. </p>

This corresponds to Christ’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52331" data-verses="John 6:63">John 6:63</span>: “The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.” Hence, we have God, the Word, Christ in the flesh as the embodiment of the Word, the Spirit, and the word again. </p>

Here I would point out that all of these issue from God, the Word, Christ as the embodiment of the Word, the Spirit, and the Spirit as the word. Without these five things as the factors, we cannot have the God-men, the new man, the new creation, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem. Furthermore, these five factors are one. God is the Word; the Word is Christ; Christ is the Spirit; and the Spirit is the word. Today all these five are in our regenerated human spirit and are even mingled with our spirit as one spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52332" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eTV-jb_HA5TidWltH5Y9gRKkHRAM1HHIEZrkeu-itDNsz0Q-aRaZRXuQH8wh9NVhi">THE BOOK OF PROVERBS<br/>NOT BEING THE WORD DIRECTLY FROM GOD</h2><p data-content-id="5T8KVjD7P5kLLj05h6Ur_g4cRXtAoAo55cVX0k7lN4wNp63lmooPzvd5yzGIVMK1x"> The book of Proverbs is recorded in the Word of God, but it is not the word directly from God. Rather, it is the word of many wise men, especially Solomon. In the same way, most of the Bible is not the word of God directly. However, much <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> of the Old Testament is God’s speaking, such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52333" data-verses="Genesis 1:3">Genesis 1:3</span>, where God said, “Let there be light.” Although Proverbs is a book in the Bible, when we contact it by our natural man, it is not the word of God to us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NQRVYIQWlhZ_nO3os_D_wCHSbBzIURooqWZUdNhRXQyV38fZZmmzcG6dwERjWstsx">THE WORD BECOMING SPIRIT AND LIFE TO US<br/>THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="tWUl9nlAAlnikvXtz8_6xmDjjNS1krw5AxEVY4drEB5iJmJfV0OdP-KBbPOkpTwRX"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52334" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25a</span> Paul said concerning marriage, “I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion.” Here Paul says clearly that what he is about to speak is not the word of God but his opinion. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52335" data-verses="1Corinthians 7:40">verse 40</span> he went on to say, “But I think that I also have the Spirit of God.” This is an illustration of the fact that the Bible is full of human words, the words of the people of God. These words are the word of God because they are in the Bible, and the Bible is God’s breathing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52336" data-verses="2Timothy 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16a</span>), God’s exhaling of Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="hxYil6J_XNHi2Z7-C91gVLhn5gFRp8gKFoTvVxSMwoJOpN8Kh2nS3KOhPT4yprS_h"> When we come to contact the word in the Bible by our natural man, by our mind, it is not the word of God to us. But when we come to the Bible by exercising our spirit to contact God, the word becomes the Spirit. This should be our experience as we read the book of Proverbs. The words in this book are the words of wise men, but when we contact these words by exercising our spirit in the spirit of prayer, every word becomes spirit and life to us. It is crucial that we all see this. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UdBpzsM2lxu_HKz84Nockb3mEtKnw5SbDoB6BxB2koE3bIk5rqHUNzp-tBhgdX11K">OUR NEED TO HAVE THE PROPER, SPIRITUAL PROVERBS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF<br/>OUR REGENERATED NEW MAN</h2><p data-content-id="MpIRc5y8aVKzVRFJFw4s_H5Jp1DWw7euhbF2jwYd04czHHZL_z6bGxbvclKf5V-4S"> As believers in Christ, we are no longer the old man—we are the new man. However, no matter how new we may be, we still have our humanity. Instead of casting away our created humanity, God regenerated this humanity. Yes, Christ crucified, terminated, the fallen old man, but He regenerated, germinated, our God-created humanity with God’s life. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="VLc0DDuVXjuW11fmDcsZfZYSRg4jgqpVnKdBUO2fTRZISs59ApwfqB_zE2dP34Y3e">Our Resurrected Humanity</h2><p data-content-id="ibeuvIHSF0kPb3ioFDHvJ5HM0DvkLrmuF9wxWIahWIsYYyxa_2Dp7RzbrIjNPjfRw"> Resurrection follows crucifixion, and without resurrection there can be no regeneration (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52337" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). What Christ terminated on the cross was the fallen humanity, the fallen <span class="pg" data-page-id="42" id="42">[42]</span> old man, yet the God-created humanity remained to be resurrected. In resurrection the divine element uplifted the regenerated humanity. Now after we have been regenerated to be a new man, we still have our humanity, but it is a resurrected, regenerated humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="1Z_PL-n9_cIPuue0_MNP7WiTBbGI4yeEmcTvm8PCRbhVOj4hM1IUsZx0BtE7DFA3i"> Because this is a difficult matter for believers to understand, we need to have a clear vision concerning the old man and the new man. On the one hand, our old, fallen humanity has been terminated in Christ’s crucifixion; on the other hand, our God-created humanity has been germinated, regenerated, through Christ’s resurrection. Thus, we have been terminated and also germinated. The humanity which we have today is not the old, terminated, fallen humanity but the new, germinated, uplifted humanity. </p>

Paul answers this question when he says, “Christ...lives in me.” Furthermore, Paul immediately goes on to say, “And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith.” First, Paul declares, “I am crucified...it is no longer I who live,” but then he says, “I live.” The crucified “I” is the old “I.” The “I” who lives is the new, regenerated “I,” the regenerated humanity. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="TWpTXfLf126waRfGjKMkQ4k0Y64Eo8yqbrSentqwu0tUKA9AE1MU6kYR_BxsfE-rL">Coming to Proverbs to Cultivate Our New Man</h2><p data-content-id="n-Yp8QThIXMRlUOeLQcWFyG5gpXypOYZz8Keuu1s9d8imxX6RrPX4NvKh8HnOPuTo"> Now we can understand the place that Proverbs should have in our Christian life. Because we still have our humanity, we need the proper, spiritual proverbs, not to cultivate our natural man but to cultivate our regenerated new man. For example, a certain brother may be able to speak much about doctrines, but he may be very slothful, careless, and disorderly with many things in his daily life. Such a person surely needs to have his regenerated humanity cultivated through the book of Proverbs. <span class="pg" data-page-id="43" id="43">[43]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="6Ho10sXvCL97m43poIfq_1pgdOQZA3UEnxvz08l4d2tqtwnrHVsVrPb7w3OgnnGHu"> We all need Proverbs for the cultivation of our new man. We need to come to Proverbs as a new man by exercising our spirit with the Spirit to contact the word. Then the word in Proverbs will become spirit and life to us, not to cultivate our natural man but to cultivate our regenerated new man. </p>

The sequence of the sixty-six books of the Bible was arranged by God. According to this sequence, God put Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs together and placed them immediately before the prophets. </p>
<p data-content-id="7EfVLp3CuztJN_idN1K5EDbvwEfEityuDpGz3nVrv-QuoR_87ws3EDioXHVf-R2H0"> There are two ministries in the Old Testament: the ministry of law, represented by Moses, and the ministry of the prophets, represented by Elijah. Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs are placed at the end of the section of the law, just before the prophets. Do these books belong to the law or to the prophets?

God raised him to the highest peak of humanity. What he was, what he had, and what he did were unparalleled. It is hard to believe that eventually he became degraded to the uttermost. These three books were written by Solomon, the last two after his degradation, repentance, and return to God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="54" id="54">[54]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="gRIkAABHyRTwI-jfT9tBEK6uQ7sbvo8UPOLBI16BaApSoZqtASqM8LKyehZa4Frcz"> Of these three books, the first is on wisdom; the second, on vanity; and the third, on satisfaction. Proverbs is on the real wisdom, and Ecclesiastes is on the real meaning of the human life under the sun, which is vanity of vanities, a chasing after wind. Song of Songs is the satisfaction of satisfactions. Apart from Christ, there is no satisfaction in the whole universe. The unique Christ, the embodiment of God, is the unique satisfaction not only to man but to the entire universe, which has been made subject to vanity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52404" data-verses="Romans 8:20">Rom. 8:20</span>). The fact that the creation is now subject to vanity means that everything under the sun is vanity. Today God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is realized as the compounded, sevenfold, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God. This indwelling One is our subjective satisfaction. </p>

Proverbs gives us wisdom to be a proper person and to do the right things. But for whom is this wisdom given, and how should this one use it? Is the wisdom in Proverbs for the fallen man? The Old Testament does not reveal the proper way to take the book of Proverbs because the divine revelation had not progressed to this extent at Solomon’s time. Solomon did not receive very much of the divine revelation. Rather, he wrote Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs according to his observations of humanity and of the universe and according to his experiences of falling away from God, of repenting, and of returning to God. </p>

Redemption indicates that something is wrong, requiring a rescue and a remedy. Redemption is needed because after God created man for the fulfillment of His economy, the subtle one, Satan, came in to seduce man from the line of God’s economy to sin. Man fell into sin, and sin as the sinful nature of Satan was injected by Satan into man’s nature. As a result, the God-created man became sin, poisoned by Satan. </p>

The Bible is like a big jigsaw puzzle with thousands of pieces scattered throughout it. We need to put all the pieces together in order to have the complete picture. Brother Nee read through over three thousand classical Christian books on various subjects and collected many precious items, or “pieces,” from them, which he passed on to me. During the past seventy years we have been putting together the pieces of this great “puzzle.” Now we have a picture of the whole Bible, and we can see in a detailed way how God’s redemption is related to His economy and how His redemption is carried out. </p>

He <span class="pg" data-page-id="56" id="56">[56]</span> created it, and although it has become fallen, He will maintain it and bring it back to Himself. Thus, in His redemption, God, on the one hand, destroys what is fallen and, on the other hand, rescues what was created by Him. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="n-Yp8QThIXMRlUOeLQcWFyGBgpHqpOYZz8Keuu1s9d8imxX6RrPX4NvKh8HnOPuTo">Uplifting the Redeemed Part of Created Man</h2><p data-content-id="6Ho10sXvCL97m43poIfq_1pYdOARA3UEnxvz08l4d2tqtwnrHVsVrPb7w3OgnnGHu"> In the third part of His redemption, God uplifts the redeemed God-created humanity. Sometimes when a certain thing which we have made becomes lost and damaged, we find that thing and repair it, making it better than it was originally. This is what God has done in His redemption. He made the man created by Him better than he was in the beginning. This means that God uplifted the redeemed humanity by dispensing Himself into it. </p>
<p data-content-id="REz0od4t8iTNjAicnMqHakpxBNTR4_vUcYbGo0y8GHCgVc8Vxs996WQ4u5L2s0wfA"> The God-created humanity was very good, but it did not have anything of God’s nature. It was only human, without divinity. After this humanity became fallen, in His redemption God destroyed the fallen part, rescued the God-created part, and then dispensed Himself into this redeemed humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="sOhdSpTBzetBkuwi3kafnH9ouWzJ35QaTNZs2h--BmIWOIBy4R_yGdSsCw_VtlYr_"> At this juncture we need to point out that, according to the Bible, God’s redemption includes not only death but also resurrection. Without resurrection, God could not bring back to Himself the lost created man. To bring back the lost God-created man is actually to resurrect the God-created man. In resurrection God used His own life, nature, and element as the substance to uplift the redeemed created man. Furthermore, in resurrecting the dead humanity, God put Himself into man. Now this man is regenerated and uplifted, having all that God is within him. The entire God has entered into this resurrected, regenerated, and uplifted man. This man is what the Bible calls the new man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52405" data-verses="Ephesians 4:24">Eph. 4:24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="wbiqXuNa33lWT9pinlCptE5Bwof1Pb3wi5-6vYzzC-jG6cGjaqI1WAaSwaJjTgnZp"> God’s intention is no longer with the old man. In the sight of God, the old man has been finished, terminated, and thus he no longer exists. In His redemption God’s eyes are always on the new man. We all need to see this. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="LEfkEDnTQtuBwteYyDQsTDH6IkEKvVyheeHQ3AE2DyNmy1rTa9jnkr7uxvoSZ8IOb">God’s Redemption Being according to His Economy</h2><p data-content-id="mmOcroQGHHAhfWi_PzCxdnhQ_8omtoWJdwy6lb_PUZZcQJ8od5ZCtkqkmMjnHRufj"> God’s redemption is according to His economy. In one sense, God’s redemption has already been accomplished, but <span class="pg" data-page-id="57" id="57">[57]</span> the application, or the practice, of God’s redemption requires a long process. In the view of God’s economy, we became fallen in Adam six thousand years ago (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52406" data-verses="Romans 5:12">Rom. 5:12</span>); Christ as the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52407" data-verses="Revelation 13:8">Rev. 13:8</span>); and we were regenerated through Christ’s resurrection almost two thousand years ago. This is the view according to God’s economy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ZIcjbWIVBnaIZAD8CR6hjEHObs7aSBT7oguAwFxhQ0SWNW_4aP33acERCfDfs9kvz">Sealed with the Spirit until the Day of Redemption</h2><p data-content-id="Ahh_kgN8VVX17JPhwQKpTS2fAtGTbplpHf0dHMTfql6fWOKAGNet_NUC1Um7viLQ3"> Nevertheless, it takes time in God’s economy for us to experience the redemption in Christ’s death, in Christ’s resurrection, and in the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. We were sealed by the Spirit when we were saved initially, and this sealing will proceed until the day of redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52408" data-verses="Ephesians 4:30">Eph. 4:30</span>). Redemption here does not mean to redeem our spirit or our soul but to redeem our body. Our body still remains unredeemed. Redemption in its entirety was accomplished by God in an instant, but in practice and application redemption is still not finished. </p>
