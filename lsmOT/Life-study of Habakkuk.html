<p data-content-id="H6-RpkyQLZlFA-KLEytePxWFrQ4YSCqcqgF4f_n8fMn2NIThyWtOLXxk_FGuamL7s"> In this message we will begin to consider the book of Habakkuk. We will cover the introductory word, the first dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah, and the first part of the second dialogue between these parties. As we will see, the one golden verse in Habakkuk is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60286" data-verses="Habakkuk 2:4">2:4</span>: “The righteous one will live by his faith.” This verse is related to God’s eternal salvation, to His salvation of our whole being—spirit, soul, and body. Everything else in Habakkuk is a background for the release of the revelation concerning God’s eternal salvation of sinners. We may compare the book of Habakkuk to a walnut and then say that this verse is the “kernel” of the “walnut.” Thus, as we read Habakkuk, we should focus our attention on this one verse. </p>

THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2><p data-content-id="kqcO5rRkP3ge0rS73bHdyktCbiChfOjX-JqI1DI3hj9-vEatFKDuHaYYmv3UlKTq1"> The introductory word is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60287" data-verses="Habakkuk 1:1">1:1</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="JvQ7JBIhs30DbERU2H4DTT6Y40PXQ3g0Uey6tozEFww9fUe8jprBcIfO32DMdBfIM">A. The Meaning of the Name Habakkuk</h2><p data-content-id="zjadQ6biywTWFRLI0cex7zghgvXbJdNFlu2jGUYRupaRbrA_Tozt0YGzmq4-lu1Ep"> The name Habakkuk in Hebrew means “embracing” or “clinging to,” signifying that we need to seek God by embracing Him or clinging to Him. For us to receive God’s eternal salvation, we need to be embraced by God, and we need to cling to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="PyOIkoC_-7hxaopJWHcSH74lXTTFqojnhs7kvsGsT0HCrSCrvVVQlpyzQKBAA4uDz"> Eternal salvation is actually God Himself. God does not save us by remaining in the heavens and stretching out His arm to reach the earth. In order to save us, God became a man <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> on this earth and came to us. The central thought of the four Gospels is that the saving God came out of eternity into time, out of the heavens to earth, and out of divinity into humanity to be a man. In this way He could embrace man and man could cling to Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="-XoskPHDMmdvxxr0nitUYEyj6KssJIMYV7CRRa3RfDx4y0CMo3gwf7tg-ndo3b26f"> While God was saving us, He was not in the appearance, the form, of God. Rather, He was in the form of a man named Jesus. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60288" data-verses="Hosea 11:4">Hosea 11:4</span> tells us that God draws us with the cords of a man, with the bands of love. The saving cords of love are Christ’s humanity. The account of Zaccheus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60289" data-verses="Luke 19:1-10">Luke 19:1-10</span> shows us the way God saves us by coming to us. In order to be saved by God, we must be embraced by God and we must cling to Him. </p>

Today God’s salvation has come to us through the preaching of the gospel. We have received and applied God’s salvation by faith. This is what is mentioned in the one golden verse in the book of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60333" data-verses="Habakkuk 2:4">Habakkuk, 2:4</span>: “The righteous one will live by his faith.” By faith we have received the salvation that was prepared, completed, and consummated by Christ’s coming forth, and as a result we now are believers constituting the Body of Christ. Eventually, those believers who are the overcomers will be with Christ when He comes to defeat His enemies and to set up His kingdom on the earth. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="e-_EPDzi4qqvljCkFxZH4VTmTy4TuT0Izbq_Xf2RrzkuCDEbG4LHtjNS-LCtBluty">The Need to See Something Intrinsic</h2><p data-content-id="5xOxBfS1dNf2zY0YCSSGOBaitaexscsqFSjECR1EQeLOIt-uxQwwRN1IJyL7o1IbW"> From the foregoing we can see that Christ Himself is the linking factor in the Minor Prophets. We have seen His origin, birth, death, and resurrection. We have also seen that through His going forth after His resurrection, God’s complete salvation has come to us and that we have received it by faith. </p>
<p data-content-id="NAuYO1dL1cpgi4a-sAke2f3iVf1RSQkxYiYvrAwA8xiw_ssz-RZOpyi_2pq5e53zZ"> Whereas we can see Christ as the linking factor, the worldly people see only the consuming factor (the locusts) and the suffering factor (Israel). For twenty-seven centuries Israel has been suffering under the locusts with their cutting, swarming, licking, and consuming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60334" data-verses="Joel 1:4">Joel 1:4</span>). The newspapers <span class="pg" data-page-id="9" id="9">[9]</span> are full of reports concerning the locusts and Israel. We need to see something more than what is reported in the newspapers. We need to see something intrinsic. This means that we need to see that Christ, the eternal One, has gone forth in His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and that His going forth is continuing today as more believers are added to Him. We may compare His going forth to the movement of a train that makes various stops so that more goods can be loaded onto it. Christ is the “train” and we are the “goods” that are in Him. Eventually, this train with its goods will reach its destination. </p>

Regarding this, we need to realize that it is not easy for God to speak to human beings directly. In the Old Testament the incarnation had not yet been accomplished; however, God knew that He intended to become a man. His being incarnated was the first step of all His goings forth, and God was anticipating this. The principle according to the divine revelation is that God would not do anything directly but would do everything through man, with man, and in man. </p>

We believe <em>into</em> the Lord Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60337" data-verses="John 3:16">3:16</span>), and now we are in Him. Before believing we were outside of Christ; we were in Adam. But one day we were transferred out of Adam and into Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God. Now we are persons in Christ. Unfortunately, not many Christians realize that genuine, living Christians are those who are actually and practically in Christ. The importance of being in Christ is stressed by Paul in his Epistles, where, especially in Ephesians, the short phrase <em>in Christ</em> is so frequently used. <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> </p>

Nevertheless, in each of the prophets’ books, wherever they speak concerning Christ, that is the great point, the strong accent, of that book. For example, the strong accent of the book of Joel is not the locusts but the outpouring of the consummated Spirit. Actually, this is the accent of the entire Old Testament, for the outpouring of the Spirit is the practical realization of Christ, who is the living, compound, consummated, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit. This Christ is just the Triune God, consummated through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. But this is not all. Following His ascension is His being poured out, His coming down, to indwell man and mingle with man. This mingling implies a dispositional sanctifying, renewing, transforming, conforming, maturing, and glorifying. Eventually, this mingling makes us one with the divine person of the processed Triune God, whose embodiment is Christ and whose reality is the Spirit. Today this Spirit is the all-inclusive One indwelling us, moving in us, anointing us, and mingling with us. </p>

The types of Christ, the prophecies concerning Christ, and the historical writings do not need to be purified, but we must study the Psalms in a purifying way. Among the first forty-one psalms, only seven present a clear revelation of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60338" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psa. 2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60339" data-verses="Psalms 8:1">8</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60340" data-verses="Psalms 16:1">16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60341" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">22—24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60342" data-verses="Psalms 40:1">40</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60343" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> is good, but it is good according to the natural concept.

<p data-content-id="jUwwJcqJ3zTRq_2fGJlEGdbqZ75rB4d0IL7_jas3HbulqUS9HVJ0bwaMHUK2uNrmS"> Let us use an orange tree as an illustration. In order to grow, an orange needs not only its peel but also the whole tree with the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. However, none of these should be eaten. Actually, to eat or drink, <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> the only thing we need is the orange juice. This illustration points to something crucial related to the enjoyment of Christ, the eating of Christ. In order to see Christ in reality, we need all one hundred fifty of the psalms, but to enjoy Christ, to feed on Christ, we need to come to the revelation of Christ in the Psalms. </p>

Even Habakkuk’s concept of trusting in Jehovah during a time of need was natural. There is no comparison between these verses and Paul’s writings. Paul’s concept was different. When he was troubled, he prayed three times, but the Lord told him that He would not remove the thorn and that His grace was sufficient for him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60370" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7-10">2 Cor. 12:7-10</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span>). When Paul was short of food, he did not “trust” in the Lord in the way Habakkuk did; rather, he took the opportunity to fast. In a very real sense, he did not need to trust in the Lord, for he was in the Lord already, and the Lord was in him. Furthermore, instead of trying to keep the law, he lived Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60371" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60372" data-verses="Philippians 1:21">Phil. 1:21a</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="o6Kib_4fBm7QoYQpCSv1ubTecRdAWdYAcFQDZ1y6yWnVTXKRQxjg62Ti_xh_8bbdv"> Whereas many Christians appreciate verses such as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60373" data-verses="Habakkuk 3:17-19">Habakkuk 3:17-19a</span>, we need to be brought into another realm, the realm of Christ. These verses are not according to the divine revelation concerning Christ but according to the prophet’s natural, human, and religious concept. If we are brought into the realm of Christ, we will not appreciate the natural, religious thought expressed in much of the Old Testament. Rather, we will treasure the divine revelation in the Word. Moreover, instead of “trusting” in the Lord like Habakkuk did, we will see that the crucial matter is not trusting but realizing that we are in Christ and that Christ is in us. </p>

<p data-content-id="GRlET4BYLsM2Y7nP-emutWi9leQM-1ROvf28Wk0pWBYrucl0Cr29F6TWTyqPuq7E9"> More than sixty years ago I read something by Brother Nee which said that it is wrong to pray and ask the Lord to help us. At that time I did not understand what he meant. However, I have learned from experience that the only prayer that gives me joy is this: “Praise You, Lord. You are one with me. Regardless of how weak and poor I am, I am in You and You are in me.” But suppose I pray, “Lord, I still need Your help. I am weak and poor, and I have nothing. I ask You to come in to help me.” If I were to pray in this way, the joy would be gone. </p>
