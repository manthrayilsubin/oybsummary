<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="PXaGGi5s3JW5LFR1xpAigXRcdu053X7vsk8Uu12xqhoTYNKkvmPBpARW45C7g9GYp">A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL</h2><p data-content-id="-JXBrp29xO5tBCZcKXo6Y4570ZzNbzsBfUFtW3bC7nHa-UYatlECIjhVAXt3kHiw8"> I believe that in eternity past God determined that, after the confusion of Babel, He would choose a man by the name of Abraham. After calling Abraham God spent many years to train him. Eventually, Abraham produced a son, Isaac. Isaac had two sons—Esau, whom God hated, and Jacob, whom God loved (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46908" data-verses="Malachi 1:2-3">Mal. 1:2-3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46909" data-verses="Romans 9:13">Rom. 9:13</span>). For many years Jacob was dealt with under God’s hand. Jacob produced twelve sons, and these sons became the twelve tribes of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="pQXMkkMUOusWoF9IBJ1NOxq8xXSxmGcBTwClw4xVPEncIcug87gqQ0I10EO05F8NE"> When God called Abraham out of Chaldea, the land of Babel, He promised to give him the good land, the land of Canaan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46910" data-verses="Genesis 12:1">Gen. 12:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46911" data-verses="Genesis 12:7">7</span>), and He brought Abraham into this land. Abraham, therefore, was the first one of God’s chosen people to enter into the good land. Later, the twelve tribes drifted away from the good land to Egypt, where they remained for hundreds of years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46912" data-verses="Exodus 12:40-41">Exo. 12:40-41</span>). During this time in Egypt, the twelve tribes of Israel became a nation of about two million people. They were usurped, enslaved, and persecuted by Pharaoh, king of Egypt. They cried out to God, and He sent Moses to deliver them out of that land of slavery into the good land. God brought the people of Israel to Mount Sinai to train them and to give them the covenant, the testament, which included both the moral law and the ceremonial law. In giving Israel the law, God’s intention was that they would be a nation of priests. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="vBR9OZfW0uwFJHjfO-ZRkxaKx-pXGQrdpuEWz9gHuRGyn8WtNXjmlc_UeiBumRsE_"> When the people of Israel were about to enter into the land of Canaan, God charged them through Moses to slaughter all the Canaanites. He also charged them to destroy all the idols and everything related to idolatry. Joshua took this charge and he was faithful to it, but he was not faithful absolutely. Instead of slaughtering all the Canaanites, he allowed some to remain. </p>
<p data-content-id="B_m_0i4Of1hvspafMmQZAkHEvJwcZiVFN2zsEq_GW2327ZeUI79bx7oRJeicRgysA"> In the law given on Mount Sinai, God commanded the people of Israel concerning how to behave in relation to Him and in relation to one another. He did not want them to forsake Him, the fountain of living water, and hew out cisterns (idols) which are broken and which cannot retain water. He wanted them to love one another and not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to lie, and not to covet. They were to take care of others, even returning lost things to their owner. This was the kind of life that was ordained by God. It was a heavenly life lived by earthly people. A people with such a living could surely be called the kingdom of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="xKQjIU6TtG2zIRXXArOMaAcuFf-nQ9EkEw9qQwD7n44h1iz3IldbcALwILnJ-oX6G"> However, after Israel entered into the good land, they were not faithful to God. The people of Israel failed God and eventually were divided into the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel. The kingdom of Israel became apostate; they forsook God and set up other worship centers in addition to the unique center at Jerusalem. The kingdom of Israel was captured by the Assyrians, and later the kingdom of Judah was captured by the Babylonians. At that time the city of Jerusalem was captured and was not returned to Israel until 1967. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rj_qlG8o3-vtXmEgEo7fHHoNxdo4rW6-V748D3SMieU549hYiMNSIbdNkbR5TdDtj">GOD GIVING UP THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL<br/>TO CAPTIVITY AND PROMISING<br/>TO BRING THEM BACK FROM CAPTIVITY</h2><p data-content-id="degpMhz4PaIRdq0YRofYdVpOe-zpQoKZoMu1mkQB0osLHi5uFLACkXtl5Kt_yPoHI"> At the end of 2 Chronicles, in God’s eyes the condition and situation of Israel were miserable. The land was usurped and taken over by pagans, and the people of Israel were given by God as captives to the heathens. Furthermore, the temple was burned and the wall of Jerusalem was torn down. The entire good land, the so-called holy land, was devastated. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="QEAHmunKYlSHocXbNG8-5oVTrjAAVL6rtQtpxeyrSWnw2WOS3GWvoeZHmO5O2cCeU"> When Jeremiah saw all this, sitting on the top of Mount Zion and looking down at Jerusalem, he lamented bitterly. All the leading ones and all the noble ones of his countrymen had been taken away to captivity in Babylon, and only the poorest of the people were left to keep the land. It is no wonder that Jeremiah lamented. Eventually, he himself was taken captive to Egypt and there he was put to death. What a pitiful situation! </p>
<p data-content-id="K4-Yy3OW5HhyLpaiheh7NTAQiUbqCZ23HgNtCV4g4N1unda8uuz9ApM6NCS9TPEPp"> Such a condition lasted for seventy years, as Jeremiah himself had prophesied. While Jeremiah was lamenting, God came in to comfort him with the word that the captivity would not be forever but would last only seventy years (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46913" data-verses="Jeremiah 25:11">Jer. 25:11</span>). God assured him that the miserable situation of his country and his people, of the temple and the city, would last for just seventy years. Some of the captured ones, such as Daniel, would still be alive at the expiration of the seventy years. When Zerubbabel led the first return from Babylon to Jerusalem, Daniel was still alive there in Babylon. Therefore, God comforted Jeremiah by assuring him that just as He gave the people up to captivity, He would also bring them back from their captivity. God would bring them back, not as captives but as triumphant warriors. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lv--PbtNE34XQ_pUzn3Xv_bhKoICEXmQqFvN8lCtQKQZacxx6_hAc3wd-jCpUZJx6">THE RETURN FROM CAPTIVITY<br/>THROUGH THE SECRET PRESERVING CARE<br/>OF THE HIDING GOD</h2><p data-content-id="OIIS_NlNHuWucMHcxICXx9NDdTkvYfYbXZwdw38ZOLPvGtJ3OYQToeAKy597V0fZu"> Following 1 and 2 Chronicles, we have the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther. The book of Ezra is concerned with the return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple, and the book of Nehemiah is concerned with the repair, the rebuilding, of the city. The book of Esther shows us how the omnipresent and omnipotent God became the hiding God in protecting His captured elect, who were scattered in their captivity. </p>
<p data-content-id="4Bt8MdJMvbd4F10BM0q3AjHHS10MBea2BnqxCVH4vLDxJ4UYqHoNAv3y3vVFgTSlV"> Apparently God would not do anything for His people, for He is a God who hides Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46914" data-verses="Isaiah 45:15">Isa. 45:15</span>). This is why in the book of Esther God is not referred to by any of His divine titles. In this book there is no explicit mention of God; the word <em>God</em> is not even used. Yet this book shows us that God is present in a hidden way, exercising His sovereignty in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> wisest manner to preserve His elect. Because of this, His elect under the persecution in their captivity could survive and multiply, in order that one day they might be brought by God to their fathers’ land. </p>
<p data-content-id="o6JQ52In-TF7xRusGNNbTxqEOFTEMOJt8wV-rvUDSevoezSSpMpokOrAMskJLeHmA"> The first group returned under Zerubbabel, a descendant of David, of the royal family. He was appointed the governor of Judah by Cyrus the king. The second group returned under Ezra, a priest and a scribe. As we have pointed out, this return was made possible through the secret preserving care of the hiding God in their captivity. </p>
<p data-content-id="30E_2TLxjd3BrAsskzratJERcd5oMFYrOSyLETVA7sLAYukNZob-vCLIWPyxCxM5D"> God let His people be captured and then scattered in their captivity. He also let the holy land be usurped and occupied, and He left the city of Jerusalem to lie waste. Seemingly the omnipotent and omnipresent God was not doing anything for the people of Israel. Actually He was protecting and preserving them in a hidden way. </p>
<p data-content-id="Gd62yCBWk9Qpt4eavtvc62tux74jnI4lFxvpTWJlCRR0J9fn0y9M21gh6iy1yhBat"> The situation is the same today regarding the Middle East. The decision concerning Israel does not rest with the politicians and statesmen but with the hidden God. One day the omnipresent and omnipotent God will appear as the Son of Man, who will come back to take possession of the earth. He will place His right foot on the sea and His left on the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46915" data-verses="Revelation 10:1-2">Rev. 10:1-2</span>), indicating that He has come to take possession of the earth and the sea. This One who is coming back to the earth is Jesus Christ, the God-man. When He comes, other God-men—the overcomers—will be with Him. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cI7s9EIq7WrPwCN0Un-kxpmo1NwxtIA2Hxmh2NCErAK1RcbcasUEsRTPRjVWLW2uP">THE HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL<br/>BEING A TYPE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT<br/>BELIEVERS AS GOD’S ELECT</h2><p data-content-id="YvrTlbicPpQGYsIDdJpcGjnf-ltEXZV5OfeGANe18Pm8IfumD6_bkoz06MaQ9o_Zb"> We need to remember that all the history of the people of Israel is a type, typifying the New Testament believers as God’s elect. Israel, therefore, is a type of the church. The church was established by the Lord as the Head through His apostles in the first century. Yet by the end of the first century the church became degraded. This means that the church was captured. </p>
<p data-content-id="EIwJo0k6XXfp3Zl3oIml5K6FIxFVrioFM3Ki_m3hH32812lPWPEXZ6B4XHdrUlGdL"> Even among us, individually, whoever is defeated in the spiritual life has been captured. He will remain in captivity <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> until he repents. Through his repentance he will be brought back. If we are captured, we are captured away from the enjoyment of Christ. But our repentance brings us back to Him, back to the enjoyment of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="DWPS_b7uVD4-39f58Q4fCf28qyO6vNSx8aFhtZYokjqpett7Zt7chNO1JcAWcRsEn"> Today we are in a situation that is typified by the situation at Ezra’s time. Some of us have come back already, and others are still on the way. </p>

EZRA, NEHEMIAH, AND ESTHER<br/>BEING THE LAST THREE BOOKS<br/>OF THE HISTORY OF GOD’S CHOSEN PEOPLE<br/>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="k74Hwl3TlD00kTdreodPjYdR7mZSppf5EoHt6s4HVSxfluuL63xMUUbS8N3QN2RZr"> Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther are the last three books of the history of God’s chosen people in the Old Testament after 1 and 2 Chronicles. These three books all are related to God’s chosen people in their captivity. The first two cover in a public way the return of God’s people from their captivity (cf. Daniel, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi), and the last one presents to us a pattern of how the hidden God, in a secret way, takes care of His chosen people in their captivity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JxqwagXdGGL9ZER1UzXKHhj1LIILkINK3IuU6D2X5Kjzk_V3YbABhmtnywyI0JPuF">II. THE WRITER</h2><p data-content-id="zuMwTthKDXpFnqZYpKw_oxj4LDi4Zh5QBWs3FGXdAJiODRBGS_8T8UPbzLqkhg5Jz"> The writer of the book of Ezra was Ezra, whose name means “help” or “helper.” He was a descendant of Aaron (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46917" data-verses="Ezra 7:1-5">7:1-5</span>), a priest and a scribe skilled in the law of Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46918" data-verses="Ezra 7:6">vv. 6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46919" data-verses="Ezra 7:11-12">11-12</span>). There are three Ezras in the Bible: one was a priest who returned with Zerubbabel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46920" data-verses="Nehemiah 12:1">Neh. 12:1</span>), one was a descendant of Caleb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46921" data-verses="1Chronicles 4:15-17">1 Chron. 4:15-17</span>), and one was the writer of this book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="LOkKUYD6p4MhroveEh9mQOuFK7T3z1-fPTH6SffvH0EO0upr5TVKMKuDuVwunqGyX">III. THE TIME</h2><p data-content-id="m5RJplZRB3cm8Ab5o94pR6T5PI56cUJEv7Tgzs61Pe9UuB6Gl3i3nymBFjLaOaY5G"> Regarding the time of writing, the contents of this book cover a period of about eighty years, from 536-457 B.C. <span class="pg" data-page-id="8" id="8">[8]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ZjucA4BqFbkDdcMczH9GZJ-9WPFIBc22LD_9yokaTJlXZfRAn1Ts-0hHsYu8EP5IR">IV. THE CONTENTS</h2><p data-content-id="AW35rKrW7VAd8ZeVj3hQwxaf-Xj1Ao3Emh66pSj_k4--LD8dLatkBbgiUOD3VNBTw"> It is very important for us to know the contents of the book of Ezra. This book gives us a record of the two returns of the children of Israel from their captivity. The first return was under Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal family of David (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46922" data-verses="Ezra 1:1">chs. 1—6</span>). Zerubbabel should have been the one to succeed the throne of David, but he was appointed to be the governor of Judah by Cyrus. The second return was under Ezra, a priest as the descendant of Aaron (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46923" data-verses="Ezra 7:1">chs. 7—10</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="FE-3-EIqgeH6Fsiq5FMSLNYmNxhzEw2VU1OsMLrenqLK0FVzy7zeRRgI1Dde1-yRs"> It is significant that Zerubbabel was of the royal tribe (Judah) and that Ezra was a descendant of a priestly family. The priests took care of God’s speaking, and the kings took care of God’s ruling. All that God has been doing is mainly in these two matters of speaking and ruling. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CBorsiZQgmQw1muQtruU6PP09SEb6jky6Wo2YUuztVFIqf3P78fCqzc58QYfFyZ6N">V. THE CRUCIAL POINTS</h2><p data-content-id="PXaGGi5s3JW5LFR1xpwinERcdu053X7vsk8Uu12xqhoTYNKkvmPBpARW45C7g9GYp"> The book of Ezra stresses the return of the children of Israel from their captivity. This return is crucial in four points. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="-JXBrp29xO5tBCZcKXY6erp70ZzNbzsBfUFtW3bC7nHa-UYatlECIjhVAXt3kHiw8">A. The Return of the Children of Israel<br/>from Their Captivity Recovering the Purpose<br/>of God’s Calling of Them</h2><p data-content-id="pQXMkkMUOusWoF9IBJFNHhK8xXSxmGcBTwClw4xVPEncIcug87gqQ0I10EO05F8NE"> The children of Israel were called by God and separated by God unto Himself as His testimony. Their captivity had annulled this purpose. The return of the children of Israel from their captivity recovered the purpose of God’s calling of them. </p>
<p data-content-id="vBR9OZfW0uwFJHjfO-pRshqKx-pXGQrdpuEWz9gHuRGyn8WtNXjmlc_UeiBumRsE_"> As a people, the children of Israel were supposed to be a testimony of God. In what way was Israel to be a testimony to God? If we would answer this question, we need to see that the law given through Moses was called the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46924" data-verses="Exodus 25:16">Exo. 25:16</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46925" data-verses="Exodus 25:21">21</span>) because it is a portrait of God. As the Giver of the law, God is portrayed in the law according to what He is. In particular, the Ten Commandments are God’s testimony. The ark was called the ark of the testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46926" data-verses="Exodus 25:22">25:22</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46927" data-verses="Exodus 26:33">26:33</span>), and the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of testimony (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46928" data-verses="Numbers 1:50">Num. 1:50</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46929" data-verses="Numbers 1:53">53</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="9" id="9">[9]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="WyjRbU6FQzFW7XSJcK0mEZCngkfDlCzbZ2LHxvOsOk3-zEC5k9Ob2ZhRYIhbLuyMY"> The Ten Commandments, inscribed on two tablets of stone, are divided into two groups of five commandments, like the ten fingers on our two hands. Each group of five commandments is divided into four plus one. </p>
<p data-content-id="2zrNlt8UqjpLrZ3TEWf6ucBmXHggnslWj8thkPyKALDkdN9qF_BarGfbKf14PdPsX"> In the first group, the first three commandments are concerned with God and charge us not to have any god other than God, not to worship idols, and not to take the name of God in vain. God must be the unique God to us. </p>
<p data-content-id="ueIH2b65PCQkh8mDrKicpaTyG_LmLgZI7oaqvljsABI2sSbUoG44BBxXxLL3APAlU"> The fourth commandment concerns the keeping of the Sabbath. The real significance of keeping the Sabbath is that we must stop ourselves in order to be one with God. Those who do not keep the Sabbath may gain a day for themselves, but they lose God. The commandment regarding the Sabbath is also related to God. Thus, the first four commandments are all concerned with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="fb3wG3bPs_5cheisrBtRgk779TJQRevyJNxUTEu0IDuhdAVVVOqSkNT9WNkPlZF5o"> The fifth commandment, concerning honoring our parents, ranks our parents with God and points to God as our origin. Our origin is our parents, and the origin of our parents is God. When we honor our parents, we honor God. From this we see that honoring our parents is a very significant matter. </p>
<p data-content-id="ItWpiv0eSTmx8q-s_DQt7BJdKun64Gu_pzWAzEfAEVkyj0z3FqlwarVqFt4BaRNOQ"> The second group of five commandments is concerned with our relationships one to another. These are the commandments not to kill, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to lie, and not to covet. How wonderful our society would be if there were no killing, no adultery, no stealing, no lying, and no coveting. Our community would be a marvelous place if everyone was loving, pure, truthful, and helpful. A people who keep these last five commandments would surely be a real testimony of God, testifying that their God is the God of love, purity, sympathy, and truthfulness. Such a people would surely be God’s particular people, God’s elect, separated unto Him and sanctified to the uttermost. </p>
<p data-content-id="Hpnk_XzB7_v4WmADuP-82C6G-OQ2dMXk1iEijDxdg12vNOPElNIwcNYZAkVoIREGq"> After the man created by God became fallen, mankind fell lower and lower until, at Babel, they became rotten to the uttermost. God gave up the created race after Babel. Then He called Abraham and gave his descendants the law as the testimony of God. He expected that Abraham’s descendants would be a people who had only Jehovah as their God, who rested with God in oneness, who honored their origin, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> who loved one another in purity and honesty. Such a people would be the same as God in expression. They would be the many reproductions of God on earth testifying of the one God in heaven. This was God’s purpose in calling the children of Israel and separating them to Himself. But the children of Israel failed God, breaking every one of the Ten Commandments and becoming the same as mankind. </p>
<p data-content-id="XO6mheniI9hT6rq2lK027FZjaM5vsg70wz5TTZyS4MrwbS6fTdcqzlMZuNTp9dYps"> The testimony of God is that we have one God and no other gods, that we stop ourselves in order to be one with God and to enjoy Him and have Him as everything, and that we honor Him as our origin, which is signified by our parents. Israel was carried away into captivity, and God lost such a testimony. They were called by God for the purpose of being His testimony, and their captivity annulled this purpose. But the return of the children of Israel from their captivity recovered the purpose of God’s calling of them. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="k74Hwl3TlD00kTdreodPmLNR7mZSppf5EoHt6s4HVSxfluuL63xMUUbS8N3QN2RZr">B.

They were a particular people in a particular place, and they were in oneness. But the captivity scattered them, some to Assyria, some to Egypt, and most of them to Babylon. This caused them to be divided and thus to lose their oneness as a people for God’s testimony. Their return from their captivity to the unique ground of Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="46930" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:5">Deut. 12:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="46931" data-verses="Deuteronomy 12:11-14">11-14</span>) recovered this oneness. However, as we will see, in their return elements of the captivity returned with them. </p>

For instance, the fourth commandment is about keeping the Sabbath. The details regarding this commandment are found in the statutes. The ordinances are statutes to which judgments have been added. When a judgment is added to a statute, that statute becomes an ordinance. Regarding the commandment to keep the Sabbath, there are not only statutes giving the details but also ordinances telling of the judgment that will come upon those who break this commandment.

Then Ezra declared that he was strengthened according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him. What the king did for Ezra, he did according to the hand of Jehovah.

<p data-content-id="NuTD1XSlKcNToickUEbPjPNxN1njMqhNuIuXxr9lWesmmyz_JzcfiKcuj2NeE5oRs"> God selected Abraham, whose descendants fell into Egypt. God sent Moses to them to deliver them out of Egypt as a great nation, numbering about two million, and brought them to Mount Sinai, where they stayed for nearly a year to be educated by God.

Then God raised up the second generation, and they crossed the river Jordan by a great miracle. As a heavenly constituted army they came to Jericho. When they shouted, the city of Jericho fell. This was God’s testimony. This was the move, the living, of God-men; it was God marching on. But when they came to the city of Ai, one among them caused them to fail. From that time onward, there was nothing among the Israelites but degradation. God sent the prophets to warn them and bring them back, but they refused to go along with God.

Therefore, there was the need for an Ezra, a priest who served God, and also a scribe, a scholar, who was skilled in the Word of God, skilled in the law of Moses (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47047" data-verses="Ezra 7:6">Ezra 7:6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47048" data-verses="Ezra 7:11">11</span>). He bore the totality of the heavenly and divine constitution and culture. Ezra called the people together and confessed not only his own sin but also the sin of Israel, to bring them back to the Word of God. </p>

The Bible says that one of the qualifications of an elder is being apt to teach (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47049" data-verses="1Timothy 3:2">1 Tim. 3:2</span>). Paul tells us that certain elders may not have a job but may “labor in word and teaching” and therefore should be supported by the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47050" data-verses="1Timothy 5:17-18">5:17-18</span>). However, I have observed that some elders are deficient in the knowledge of the truth and may not even be clear whether a particular matter is an item of the truth. </p>
<p data-content-id="MRo63gLbFD8HKAb2TynEMlWKPAKdcqz8FjW04_llT9EQBVCCsvEr3MVuCPy1mZQl0"> Let me check with you about calling on the name of the Lord. Is calling on the name of the Lord a truth? No, it is not a truth. Calling on the Lord is necessary, and we need to have such a practice in our daily life, but calling on the Lord’s name is not a truth. Likewise, baptism, presbytery, foot-washing, and pray-reading are not truths. On the other hand, justification by faith is a truth. Regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, transfiguration, being made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead—all these are truths. </p>
<p data-content-id="VZsgYksU4diy-QAepy71ywjW2CTR4qfL10cNyEA0DaTCn6EujoaP0GPe2ux8uifIu"> Some elders may speak about life-practices such as calling on the Lord, pray-reading, praying without ceasing, not quenching the Spirit, and not despising prophesying, but they do not know how to teach the truths to the saints. For example, if these ones are asked about sanctification, they may be able to say only that to be sanctified is to be separated unto God. If they are asked about the difference between sanctification and renewing, they may not be able to explain <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> the difference. Therefore, I say once again that all the elders need to know the truths and be able to teach the truths to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="iHNUVMdFVMQgODAc1ay34WuJIquO8qvZ3Sb_1C7rsdnxLRDRLS79UbCfhLrIbI9m9"> All the elders need to spend much time to learn the truths. This is the duty, the responsibility, of an elder. Anyone who accepts an appointment to the eldership must fulfill this responsibility. Like Ezra, all the elders and co-workers must be skilled in the Word of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1lU6rgd30Kwb8H_yOWYu3yLn81_pwnYJUGbO-z-QrEKr6XwAvpB-f4WkdPS6m_EHZ">A GREAT FAMINE THROUGHOUT THE EARTH</h2><p data-content-id="98g4Ph-lAZj3v8Z0PPTeGytQGUssRxR6o_02ljiKfAQfT06p97DDL-oMOWCYw2vD6"> Throughout the whole earth there is a great famine of God’s Word. In Christianity today, both in Catholicism and in Protestantism, there is very little teaching of the truth. In many places, instead of the truth there are superstitions and pagan practices. For instance, in all of Latin America there is very little of the truth. I believe that this is the reason why our publications, which are full of the truth, are so well received there. In Latin America the people who love God also love our publications. These publications cover the entire Bible from the first page to the last. </p>

Much of what we have learned has been put into print. We have almost completed the life-study of the Scriptures, and we have begun what we call the crystallization study. Today there is the need not just for Zerubbabels but for more Ezras. It would be unseemly for an elder to make decisions and expect the saints to follow them but not visit the saints with the truths. The real eldership is not to exercise authority. The real eldership is to visit the saints and to shepherd them, feed them, and take care of them by speaking to them concerning the truths. Today we need Ezras to teach the people, to educate them, and to constitute them with the heavenly truths. </p>
