The Gentiles, however, do things in excess, and this offends God, who then comes in to punish the Gentiles. God’s chastisement of Israel and His punishment of the Gentiles issue in the manifestation of Christ, and the manifestation of Christ brings in the restoration, which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth. All the Minor Prophets have this same basic thought, although they use different expressions to convey it. In Micah the expressions are very poetic. The entire book of Micah is a book of poetry. </p>

To work during those feasts would have been an insult to God. The people were only to rest, eat, drink, and enjoy their life before God. Their eating and drinking were their worship to God. According to the New Testament, at the Lord’s table on the first day of the week, we put aside our work, we rest in the Lord, and we eat and drink Christ to enjoy Him and to let Him enjoy our satisfaction. This is the top worship to God, and this is the Christian life—a restful life for worship. God is seeking such worshippers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60164" data-verses="John 4:23-24">John 4:23-24</span>). We have been called not to work and to labor but to worship. Every day and every night we should worship God by enjoying Him. </p>

This verse says <span class="pg" data-page-id="9" id="9">[9]</span> that His “goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.” His “goings forth” are His coming out. To the angels it is His going forth, but to us it is His coming out. </p>
<p data-content-id="F4NLz9zYN88uQnvxmixP_OZyeihPv5mHPESm1w77hxQhL9Ift4NQHc4PtkWBojRBQ"> “His goings forth are...from the days of eternity” means that in eternity, before the creation of the earth, Christ was preparing to come forth. His appearing, His manifestation, began in eternity. From the ancient times, from the days of eternity, the Triune God was preparing to come forth out of eternity into time, to come with His divinity into humanity. His creation of all things was His preparation to come out of eternity into time. This was the purpose of creation. Then while the locusts were operating (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60172" data-verses="Joel 1:4">Joel 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60173" data-verses="Joel 2:25">2:25</span>), Christ came forth.

<p data-content-id="ClCfVC5uP9daVW121DAq91tBccGIlBz2F8JGu2dfHtwBXcdcZ3gUT4LUUJ-CRKw7B"> Christ’s going forth, His appearing, is a continuous matter. From the time of His incarnation, He began to come forth, and His coming forth is still taking place today. Christ’s coming forth will be consummated when He throws Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60174" data-verses="Revelation 19:19-20">Rev. 19:19-20</span>), when Satan is cast into the abyss (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60175" data-verses="Revelation 20:2-3">Rev. 20:2-3</span>), and when Christ sets up His throne to reign as King (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60176" data-verses="Matthew 25:31">Matt. 25:31</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60177" data-verses="Matthew 25:34">34</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60178" data-verses="Matthew 25:40">40</span>).

<p data-content-id="PXQMDnIXcZdnNSGshrViPp6m_88rfRL8mAL78IptXkrzW0qYe3Xnt7iFVWCU7nggA"> While Christ is on the way, He is taking care of the scattered Jews. On the one hand, Israel is under God’s chastisement; on the other hand, Israel is also under God’s shepherding care. This shepherding is His preservation of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="-8bMUC2CFxRJud0NGcX1cmCGATBu86r6vSW77u9nbRw29nETyw1pC8xUw5ZbcLhUT"> In the restoration Christ will be the Ruler, Shepherd, and peace to His elect, Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60179" data-verses="Micah 5:2-5">Micah 5:2-5a</span>). Today, in His goings forth, He is our Ruler, Shepherd, and peace.

Israel to Be Invaded by Assyria<br/>and Saved by Christ</h2><p data-content-id="vkKw5zImgbBVJD8YoivG21lRgObnWdvIxH1k-QMIVF8f9C72vl-sDbuzdzF7IoNJI"> “When Assyria comes into our land / And when he treads <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> in our palaces, / We will raise up against him seven shepherds / And eight princes of men. / And they will waste the land of Assyria with the sword / And the land of Nimrod at its entrances. / And He will save us from Assyria, / When he comes into our land / And when he treads in our border” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60180" data-verses="Micah 5:5-6">vv. 5b-6</span>). These verses reveal that Christ also will save Israel after they are invaded by Assyria. The coming Christ will take the full responsibility to deal with all of human government, represented by Assyria and Nimrod. </p>
<p data-content-id="WOKQO42bnMl3-1sipjC9sxthWiONF6WPDFggsNKPfGAdZ8DazUlU6lBPcQ6EngWgu"> The mentioning of Assyria and Nimrod in these verses is a reminder of the beginning of the locusts, a reminder of when and how the locusts were produced. For the Lord to deal with the Assyrians means that He deals with the first group of the locusts, and this indicates that He will go on to deal with all the locusts. </p>
<p data-content-id="2jWpArk91XfllBSYdCtq04fzUiWfSewDzMNY7MU_8Ukavpwc56uW327aGKQaOMCsx"> Here we need to consider once again the great human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60181" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>, with its head of gold (Babylon), its breast and its arms of silver (Medo-Persia), its abdomen and its thighs of bronze (Greece), its legs of iron (Rome), and its feet partly of iron and partly of clay (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60182" data-verses="Daniel 2:32-33">vv. 32-33</span>). The smashing of this image by the stone cut out without hands (Christ) begins not with the head but with the feet. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60183" data-verses="Daniel 2:34">verse 34</span>, this stone will strike the image at its feet and crush them. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold will be crushed all at once, and the stone will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60184" data-verses="Daniel 2:35">v. 35</span>). The point here is that the smashing of the feet, which signify Antichrist, involves the smashing of the entire image, signifying the destruction of human government from Assyria and Babylon to Rome. It is significant that Micah speaks of Assyria and Nimrod, the founder of Nineveh (the capital of Assyria) and Babel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60185" data-verses="Genesis 10:8-11">Gen. 10:8-11</span>). Actually, Assyria equals Rome, and Nimrod equals Antichrist. </p>
<p data-content-id="uygEvfAuen1ErjisdQnjOymv52n2tZ20zse_piiFJAVSTdXkEpqCTfm09S7sgezdP"> Eventually, Israel will be invaded by Antichrist and his armies. Having collected his evil world powers, Antichrist will besiege the city of Jerusalem, with the intention of putting it to an end. At this juncture Christ will come to destroy Antichrist and his armies and to save Israel. At that time, the great image will be crushed by the stone cut out without <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> hands; Assyria, Nimrod, the empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, and Antichrist will be no more; and the entire earth will become the kingdom of God for eternity. Then all of Jehovah’s elect will enjoy Him. This is His comfort to Israel, a comfort that is a matter of restoration. </p>

When Micah and the other prophets spoke concerning Christ, they were touching great things. However, when they turned from Christ to their own observations regarding the condition and situation of God’s people, they became small. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ClCfVC5uP9daVW121DAu90ppccGIlBz2F8JGu2dfHtwBXcdcZ3gUT4LUUJ-CRKw7B">SEEING NIMROD AND ASSYRIA<br/>IN RELATION TO CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="PXQMDnIXcZdnNSGshrVmPouK_88rfRL8mAL78IptXkrzW0qYe3Xnt7iFVWCU7nggA"> In his prophecy concerning Christ, Micah says, “His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60191" data-verses="Micah 5:2">5:2</span>). Then he goes on to say that this One, who is Israel’s Ruler and Shepherd, will be the peace when Assyria comes into the land (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60192" data-verses="Micah 5:5">v. 5</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60193" data-verses="Micah 5:6">verse 6</span> the prophet first speaks of the land of Assyria and the land of Nimrod, and then, prophesying about Christ, declares, “He will save us from Assyria.” In these verses we can see Nimrod and Assyria as they are related to Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="-8bMUC2CFxRJud0NGcXxckmmATBu86r6vSW77u9nbRw29nETyw1pC8xUw5ZbcLhUT"> Human government began with Nimrod, the first type of Antichrist. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60194" data-verses="Genesis 10:10-11">Genesis 10:10 and 11</span>, Nimrod built the cities of Babel and Nineveh. Babel issued in Babylon, the height of human government (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60195" data-verses="Daniel 2:31-45">Dan. 2:31-45</span>) and the first stage of the locusts, that is, the cutting locusts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60196" data-verses="Joel 1:4">Joel 1:4</span>). Human government, including the empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, has been used by God to carry out His work of the chastisement of Israel. Eventually, the entire human government—the four kinds of locusts mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60197" data-verses="Joel 1:1">Joel 1</span> and the four sections of the great image described <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60198" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>—will be smashed by a single stone, Christ as the stone cut out without hands that will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60199" data-verses="Daniel 2:34-35">Dan. 2:34-35</span>). In this way Christ will save Israel from Assyria. </p>
<p data-content-id="p68jTDxgAL5G4Tay44tMj1jG3u4igTG9i8lqzqZNHbKBKH1V--YyX5y7n95KTQerT"> Regarding the four locusts in Joel, the Lord has given us a bright revelation. This enlightenment, this shining, opens not only the Bible but the entire history of the world. Furthermore, this revelation opens up God’s eternal economy, for the four stages of the locusts occupy a great part of God’s economy in relation to mankind. It may be that before too long the locusts will be destroyed and, as <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60200" data-verses="Hosea 6:2">Hosea 6:2</span> prophesies, dormant Israel will be raised up on the third day. </p>

We may use Micah and Amos as examples. On the one hand, they both prophesied concerning Christ; on the other hand, they both spoke about such a small thing as deceitful balances. Amos said that the corrupt people made the ephah small and the shekel large and falsified the balances for deceit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60201" data-verses="Amos 8:5">8:5</span>). Concerning this, Micah said, “Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, / And a scant measure that is abominable? / Shall I be pure with wicked balances / And with a bag of deceitful weights?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60202" data-verses="Micah 6:10-11">6:10-11</span>). Both prophets observed that the people used one measure for buying and a different measure for selling and that their weights and balances were deceitful. The word of Amos and Micah about such a small matter cannot compare with the greatness of their word concerning Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="KOESw14J3aD46zL7hTBbvFeAvyYsUJ46VsNXrRoe_2CZHuGAKF_PHsBOq2VAwbOko"> The prophet Joel differs from Micah and Amos in that he did not speak regarding small things. Rather, in just three chapters he spoke concerning five great matters: (1) the four kinds of locusts (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60203" data-verses="Joel 1:4">1:4</span>); (2) the outpouring of the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60204" data-verses="Joel 2:28-32">2:28-32</span>); (3) the coming of Christ with all the mighty ones to defeat Antichrist with his armies to change this age (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60205" data-verses="Joel 3:11">3:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60206" data-verses="Joel 3:13">13</span>); (4) the judging of all the living nations to separate <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> the “sheep” from the “goats” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60207" data-verses="Joel 3:2">3:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60208" data-verses="Joel 3:12">12</span>; cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60209" data-verses="Matthew 25:31-46">Matt. 25:31-46</span>); and (5) Christ’s reigning among Israel in the millennial kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60210" data-verses="Joel 3:16-17">Joel 3:16-17</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60211" data-verses="Joel 3:21">21b</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lD3qvE4aiiXd51mKiunj5ZQtpsQytOXOBO9aBLOq9zLTCLLWGAWbDA7JrRm4T6mIH">PROPHETS, NOT PSALMISTS</h2><p data-content-id="OZKZpk4TBTskwtBl2J9oyR240_OR2PX3d5zdCau1ivfhMEuWONs24WWNhJvAE9TJr"> In contrast, Amos and Micah used many more chapters than Joel to speak of things other than Christ. When these prophets spoke concerning Christ, they spoke great things, but when they expressed their own natural concept and opinion, they were like some of the psalmists. For instance, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60212" data-verses="Micah 6:8">Micah 6:8</span> says, “He has declared to you, O man, what is good; / And what does Jehovah require of you, / But that you would execute justice and love lovingkindness / And walk humbly with your God?” Is this word according to the tree of life or according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Surely it is according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Is this word according to the divine revelation or according to the human concept of the prophet? This word is not a matter of God’s revelation but of the prophet’s concept. </p>
<p data-content-id="4TefUmgW3LfYjiu0-i0HC4WJ9YlIo3wzzdevijY6V1XwhgJC4TT4v0EcdrfXUgfIs"> My concern here actually is not with the shortcomings of these prophets but with our situation today. I am concerned that some of us may take the four governing principles, or the four factors, we have seen in the Minor Prophets and use them in a critical way to examine others in the church, especially the elders. Those who do this may be like certain of the psalmists, but they are not prophets speaking for God. </p>
<p data-content-id="oKdMkIOqUxTuDox-CSncCyAA4yFxn-9uJzRIKXjR8GAybIl05NodoRweqJfSDt9Am"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60213" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:1">1 Corinthians 14</span> Paul encouraged us to be prophets, not psalmists (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60214" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:24">vv. 24</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60215" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:31">31</span>). If we express our concept or opinion, we are like some of the psalmists. To prophesy is not only to speak for Christ but also to speak forth Christ and even to speak Christ. If we have an opinion or concept, that opinion or concept must be Christ. We should have no heart to express our opinion. Our burden, desire, intention, and goal should be just to speak Christ. I can testify that my aim in all the messages I put out is to speak Christ and Christ alone. <span class="pg" data-page-id="16" id="16">[16]</span> </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60216" data-verses="Amos 9:11">Amos 9:11</span> the prophet says, “In that day I will raise up / The fallen tabernacle of David, / And I will wall up its breaches / And raise up its ruins / And build it up as it was in the days of old.” We have seen that the tabernacle of David is the kingdom of David and the royal family of David. The kingdom of David was a type of the coming kingdom of Christ. When Christ comes back, He will rebuild, that is, restore and recover, the kingdom of His forefather David and fully make the kingdom of David the kingdom of Christ and of God for eternity. </p>

In this prophecy Christ is all-inclusive because He will be the Ruler, the Shepherd, and the peace of Israel, and He will also bring forth the seven shepherds and the eight princes (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60217" data-verses="Micah 5:2-5">5:2-5</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="SSQyFYSLh7iBkmjjlumsZbEgroVThltM9zwwu79t19SnqOEEMKii2HtlKzOLwviy8"> Christ came forth from Bethlehem, a small town called “David’s city” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60218" data-verses="Luke 2:4">Luke 2:4</span>). However, His goings forth were not from time but from eternity. In eternity past He selected us and predestinated us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60219" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4-5">Eph. 1:4-5</span>). When He was doing these things, He considered how He would come. If He had only selected and predestinated us without preparing to come out of eternity, He could do nothing with us. Whatever He will do and can do for us depends on His coming forth. He came in incarnation, and He went on through human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and the outpouring of the consummated Spirit, who is the reality of Christ Himself. All these are great steps in Christ’s going forth. His going forth has not stopped but is continuing today. </p>

His prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60223" data-verses="Micah 5:1">chapter five</span> is great, but his prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60224" data-verses="Micah 6:1">chapters six and seven</span> is not great but is very much according to the human concept. </p>

Then He asks them to remember what He did for them in bringing them out of Egypt. “For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, / And from the slave house I redeemed you; / And I sent before you Moses, / Aaron, and Miriam. / O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab counseled, / And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, / From Shittim to Gilgal, / That you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60228" data-verses="Micah 6:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> </p>

Israel had been busy in the worship of God for centuries, but their worship was not genuine. Much of what they offered was not offered to God but either to themselves or to their idols. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60230" data-verses="Micah 6:6">verse 6</span> the prophet asks with what he should come before Jehovah, saying, “Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, / With one-year-old calves?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60231" data-verses="Micah 6:7">verse 7</span> he asks if Jehovah would be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil, and then he says, “Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, / The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?” God would never require anyone to offer their children as a sacrifice, but the people of Israel actually did this in order to fulfill the requirements of their idols. Only idol worshippers would make sacrifices of their children. Here Jehovah was contending with Israel concerning their idol worship and their offering sacrifices to idols. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60232" data-verses="Micah 6:8">verse 8</span> Micah prophesies, saying, “He has declared to you, O man, what is good; / And what does Jehovah require of you, / But that you would execute justice and love lovingkindness / And walk humbly with your God?” </p>

His observation involved a close study and examination of the condition and situation of God’s people. His expectation was related to his attempt to find something with which he could encourage himself. Much of what he says in this chapter is an expression of his natural sentiment. <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> </p>

The Prophet’s Observation of Discouragement</h2><p data-content-id="WOKQO42bnMl3-1sipjClsxdpWiONF6WPDFggsNKPfGAdZ8DazUlU6lBPcQ6EngWgu"> First, the prophet observed the condition and situation of God’s chosen people and became fully discouraged (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60235" data-verses="Micah 7:1-6">vv. 1-6</span>). In his discouragement he said, “Woe is me! For I am like a gathering of summer fruit / And like a gleaning of the vintage; / There is no cluster to eat, / Nor first-ripe fig, which my soul desires. / The godly man has perished from the land, / And there is none upright among men; / They all lie in wait for bloodshed; / They each hunt their brother with a net” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60236" data-verses="Micah 7:1-2">vv. 1-2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="2jWpArk91XfllBSYdCty04vLUiWfSewDzMNY7MU_8Ukavpwc56uW327aGKQaOMCsx"> In Micah’s observation of discouragement there is a lesson for us today. From Micah’s experience we should learn not to look at ourselves. If we look at ourselves just a little, we will be discouraged. </p>

Although the condition and situation of God’s people caused Micah to be discouraged, he could still say, “But as for me, I will look for Jehovah; / I will wait for the God of my salvation; / My God will hear me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60239" data-verses="Micah 7:7">v. 7</span>). </p>

First, he said that there will be a day for the building of Israel’s walls (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60241" data-verses="Micah 7:11">v. 11a</span>). Then he went on to assure Israel, saying, “In that day they will come even unto you / From Assyria and from the cities of Egypt, / And from Egypt even to the River, / And from sea to sea and mountain to mountain” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60242" data-verses="Micah 7:12">v. 12</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> </p>

Thanking God for His Forgiveness<br/>of the Remnant of the People</h2><p data-content-id="bm3tBgYztHq50W7WS5G5AdHU7MxtzR5Lz_s8tcb_mOIu6PvA2lvVp7BAZ5sT2LJ8L"> The prophet concludes by thanking God for His forgiveness of the remnant of the people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60244" data-verses="Micah 7:18-20">vv. 18-20</span>). Micah could not praise God that the condition and situation of His people were wonderful, for they had nothing that He could appreciate. Instead, the prophet said, “Who is a God like You, / Pardoning iniquity / And passing over the transgression / Of the remnant of His inheritance? / He does not retain His anger forever, / For He delights in lovingkindness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60245" data-verses="Micah 7:18">v. 18</span>). Here Micah seemed to be saying, “O God, all we have is sin and iniquity. We do not have anything to give to You. But You are a God who pardons our iniquity. There is no God like You. You are also very particular in that You do not retain Your anger forever but delight in lovingkindness.” Micah’s praise here is centered not on the virtues of God’s elect people but on God’s attributes. Such a praise is very comforting. </p>
<p data-content-id="qjqTO3EoBtUYx5ASQ7iqGtEJOFuECh2It26hFb20EByA46NzYP68xuRgPze59SxDu"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60246" data-verses="Micah 7:19">verse 19</span> the prophet continues, “He will again have compassion on us; / He will tread our iniquities underfoot. / And You will cast into the depths of the sea / All their sins.” Once again, Micah confesses that the people have many iniquities but that God is a forgiving God and will tread their iniquities under foot and cast their sins into the depths of the sea. </p>
<p data-content-id="y3zJZu-1dDaxstVEPRauDm4HfM6PuDlnW1i7279aaHHCzMFHLPwq3KS0zqpwGk1Xe"> Finally, Micah says, “You will perform truth to Jacob, / And lovingkindness to Abraham, / Which You have sworn to our fathers / From the days of old” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="60247" data-verses="Micah 7:20">v. 20</span>). Here we see Micah’s hope and expectation. </p>
<p data-content-id="8aO1tO0UWP2TbLOTpTX7PNOqofjM7bLc8t-7f_eTfEGfofkNvz46YW67ztbg93NiI"> In a sense, Micah’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60248" data-verses="Micah 6:1">chapters six and seven</span> is good, but it cannot compare with his revelation concerning Christ in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="60249" data-verses="Micah 5:1">chapter five</span>. </p>
