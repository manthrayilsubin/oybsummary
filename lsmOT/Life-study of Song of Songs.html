<p data-content-id="OrsXaESnaLMJL03E9AcH5KDOh0k4lQVmDRzSJeO4xZQJBQmWCzDy_lYvW-wkG7v1A"> At the beginning of this life-study of Song of Songs, I would like to offer a word of appreciation and memorial of and an expression of gratitude to Brother Watchman Nee. The outline with all the headings and subtitles and the interpretation of figures in this present life-study of Song of Songs are based on Brother Nee’s particular study with a few co-workers in May 1935, in which I participated as one of not more than ten attendants, in a hotel on the shore of West Lake of the city of Hangchow, close to Shanghai. </p>
<p data-content-id="4emf3C7uLJhonUO_xeZGIEfD80aZTsbisDREK5tP44SESwA04pIG5lf5N6fEDGCYR"> The theme of Song of Songs is satisfaction of satisfactions. This book portrays the four stages in the experience of the lover of Christ and can be summarized by the following four sentences: </p>
<p data-content-id="oEVZhfDRl4-DnTStbc0LuXFPy8lEnkajNLmdQrqluMj_si5by190CSgTXTvzTJ6LC"> (1) A lover of Christ should be one who is attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to pursue after Him for full satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="3dNfvre1cYi-JGXwmlUK3uVXptDmu87pJAS75olueIYeIZTBEAt4_NNwK_uZR_gg7"> (2) A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him to be delivered from the self through his oneness with the cross of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="kaWWVwqve1peodHkeiDlym6e6RfpujgJHwPGntk_0cjwdveBRO7VQzEFbqSALKE21"> (3) A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him to live in ascension as the new creation of God in the resurrection of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="JBrfplAoyYbLihQlVGDLuoOiQV2GhJwV_jnPuv6jtNV0GzAbdzGPwJiw9y5u48lgL"> (4) A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him more strongly to live within the veil through His cross after the lover’s experience of His resurrection. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="zNiJnRZtgoCFByl5MyCQNFmJnCrHU_aJQj7neMG54oSC3ebUVVgtNVf4hAgX6_uxI"> In the first stage the lover of Christ is attracted by Christ to follow Him. In the second stage the lover of Christ experiences the cross for the breaking of the self. The cross saves us from the self in order to get us out of ourselves. In the third stage the lover of Christ lives in ascension. To live in ascension is to experience the new creation of God in Christ’s resurrection. In the fourth stage the lover of Christ lives within the veil, in the inner chamber of the whole universe, the Holy of Holies. In experience the cross comes first, followed by resurrection and ascension. Yet the experience of ascension is not sufficient. After ascension there is still the need of another following stage—living within the veil through further experience of the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="a5MPhcI09MtmRYA6lmJpMtj1J7wDOHPhT26Hd7hoDSlXU9pEX4060dEE7fojsK0p6"> In Song of Songs, a book of poetry, we cannot find the words <em>cross, resurrection,</em> and <em>ascension.</em> Neither do we have the expressions <em>new creation</em> or <em>within the veil.</em> How, then, can we say that this book unveils different stages of the Christian life? If we would answer this question, we need to see that in Song of Songs the stages of the Christian life are revealed, or unveiled, through many different figures. The word <em>cross</em> is not used, but there are figures of the cross. In like manner, instead of the words <em>resurrection</em> and <em>ascension,</em> there are figures of resurrection and ascension. There are also figures signifying the new creation and the life within the veil. In reading this book, the hardest thing is to interpret the figures. </p>
<p data-content-id="b8ZtozkeWef6-IIP3FjyyTIQTWm-CtUKWlyOmFpyp0mGW8zkJnUU0Ze46EmL3r_Hr"> In this message we will first give an introductory word and then begin to consider the first stage—the stage of being drawn to pursue Christ for satisfaction. </p>

In this life-study Solomon is called the beloved and the Shulammite is called the lover (lit., “love”—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52576" data-verses="Song of Songs 1:15">1:15</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52577" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:2">2:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52578" data-verses="Song of Songs 4:1">4:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52579" data-verses="Song of Songs 4:7">7</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52580" data-verses="Song of Songs 6:4">6:4</span>). <em>Solomon,</em> in the masculine gender, means “peace,” and <em>Shulammite</em> is <em>Solomon</em> in the feminine gender. One is the king in the palace at the capital in Jerusalem, and the other is a girl from the countryside. </p>
<p data-content-id="x1TS__4nGWswEVPEe7OJdr12TGgFhmV-UUF_XCUf1rNJ1jDEFhJ-6uTNhUt54WW3E"> In a sense, Solomon and the Shulammite were not a match. Concerning marriage most would agree that two people should match each other. Yet it is difficult to find a husband and wife who are really a match. Two people who are the same may become enemies, but two people who are different may become loving friends. Solomon fell in love with a country girl, and the two of them were joined together. After their union they remained in communion all the time. </p>
<p data-content-id="rOu-JG3kQERF_u5lLBSLnahjuCj8LpgNJfZSFBNE7A5WebtsD7SGAk0qDMYaLC44O"> In a similar way, God fell in love with man. Since God is great and wise and we are small and unwise, we may find it hard to believe that God could fall in love with us. Yet even though man does not seem to match God, God has nonetheless fallen in love with man. </p>

At the table where Christ is feasting with His lover (the king at his table), her love (spikenard) toward Him spreads forth its fragrance (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52637" data-verses="John 12:1-3">John 12:1-3</span>). In the church life the small groups are often a feast with the Lord as the invisible guest. In the built-up vital groups, the lovers of Christ spontaneously spread their pleasant fragrance toward Christ. </p>

In these verses we see that she enjoys Him privately (at night) in His death (a bundle of myrrh) in her embracing with love and faith (breasts—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52639" data-verses="1Timothy 1:14">1 Tim. 1:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52640" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:8">1 Thes. 5:8</span>). Every lover of Christ is full of faith and love and embraces Him with faith and love. Furthermore, she enjoys Him publicly in His resurrection (a cluster of henna flowers) in the churches (vineyards) of Christ as the fountain of redemption (En-gedi—“the fountain of the lamb”). In the churches Christ grows as clusters of henna flowers. In the churches there is also a fountain of redemption. The church is continually watered by the fountain of Christ’s redemption. From this we see that a major part of our spiritual life is related to the church life. </p>

The word for <em>rose</em> in this verse refers to a wild rose, despised in the land of Judea. Here the lover humbly realizes that she is but a small person, living on the one hand a pretty but despised life (rose) in the common world (Sharon, meaning “plain”), and on the other hand a pure and trusting life (lily) in the low place (valleys). This was her humble recognition and realization regarding herself. </p>

<h1 class="title" data-content-id="Ma3KHclUYMuhGWXwRKHEFcsdkGHBiSqKNeOeyij8gQkbluxMVU1QLaKdWKEdNlBCa">CALLED TO BE DELIVERED FROM THE SELF<br/>THROUGH THE ONENESS WITH THE CROSS</h1><p class="scripture" data-content-id="Vd8i3VutWlmcG0S8cYSYhaSxcT1DAqgC0d6Bc9K7_BIW5bs45HP6JTuBuNx8XrmnE">Scripture Reading: <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52660" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:8">S.S. 2:8—3:5</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="iAs1comjOulnmvmOKHngchiX1cyMIQhP2a6cWSLMsN828T4KIAgsbqH7aWeDfAWD3"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52661" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:8">Song of Songs 2:8—3:5</span> the lover of Christ is called by Him to be delivered from the self through her oneness with the cross. This is the second stage in the experience of the lover of Christ. Three critical words help us to interpret this section: <em>cross, self,</em> and <em>introspection.</em> </p>
<p data-content-id="11ma1A6Nrajs5kuA3ZbuJRc3wzy1LXwO7ElQEQxQ9KHFHfPMBwZoA0OGxxOHARedu"> The cross is signified by the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52662" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:14">2:14</span>). These are places of safety, but they are rugged, and few would be willing to go there. The clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice surely signify the cross as the place of safety for fallen man. The safest place for us to be is the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="9bSXN-mWk-QP1LY2x6yVrzvjY9e_UJcWXba133t5zXyGzD8ABxmgBOqBpkHPsehQm"> Although the self has no figure in Song of Songs, according to Christian experience it is manifested in the second stage. In the first stage, the lover of Christ pursues Him, receives help in the fellowship in the inner chamber, and enters into the church life, where she experiences transformation. She enters into the rest and enjoyment of Christ for her full satisfaction. Then the self rises up, and the lover of Christ begins to care only for being perfect. This is the self. </p>
<p data-content-id="jgoOQj2-ZIZmH6g-UOt-NhrdoIiYh47J2Kl0QKoIVufKSisLLeIlEtz-5X_9MS1O1"> The self is very subtle. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52663" data-verses="Matthew 16:1">Matthew 16</span>, after the Lord Jesus unveiled the way of the cross for the accomplishment of God’s economy, Peter showed his love for the Lord by saying, “God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52664" data-verses="Matthew 16:22">v. 22</span>). Peter thought that was his own word. Actually, Peter spoke from his self, which had become one with Satan. The Lord Jesus rebuked Peter saying, “Get behind Me, Satan!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52665" data-verses="Matthew 16:23">v. 23a</span>). Then the Lord spoke about denying the self (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52666" data-verses="Matthew 16:24">v. 24</span>). This reveals that the self is the satanic humanity; it is <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> man possessed and usurped by Satan. As a result, man in his fallen humanity cares only for himself. Because everyone is for himself, selfishness is seen in all kinds of relationships—between husband and wife, between children and parents, between employers and employees. </p>
<p data-content-id="T6lXjY7Nc8p3nwuYXkAEc9Ga5d_iOlA6Wj_sszFGhsMVaGr93khwU6-qbYoXssZLW"> We should not think that we can become so spiritual that we no longer have a problem with the self. Even a lover of Christ, one who yearns for Him, seeks Him, and gains Him, is still troubled by the self. We still have a part of us that is fallen and satanic, and this part will remain with us until our physical body is redeemed, that is, until we will have been redeemed to the uttermost from the old creation. This was the situation even with the apostle Paul. He had received so many visions and revelations, yet he realized that he was still in the fallen humanity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52667" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7">2 Cor. 12:7</span>). Although we also are still in the fallen humanity, we should not live in it and we should not live by it. As an elderly believer in Christ, I can testify that the older I become, the more bothered I am by the old creation, by the fallen, satanic humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="0bmcYP9ONkuFs2VWUDsNEKmHwo1BXpsGL6nBgxDbNXLIqS-bWWqJJ_YnOUfeGsNGj"> As we will see when we come to the end of Song of Songs, the lover of Christ eventually sighs because she is still in the old creation. She longs to be fully like Christ, who has absolutely nothing to do with anything of the old creation. She has been remade by God to be a new creation, yet according to God’s economy, God has allowed a part of the old creation to remain with her. </p>
<p data-content-id="7AdC9S_Us0yDhI0yfuCK1rumsBXtYo3u3eJJCaEm4GN3TMDMqNEdbfWmqN2dUGE6X"> We may have some success in pursuing after Christ and may attain a certain amount of satisfaction. But then we may ask, “How can I maintain this? How can I keep myself in this condition?” At this point the self comes in. </p>
<p data-content-id="_6LHN3hM5Dsl0N7TCZu1CEN6TZHY-KliwUSuPcQ-1Kl5wG4DsuktEH2ZMIyyDlnsC"> Self comes in under the false cloak of introspection. Actually, self is constituted with introspection. Introspection is to examine yourself by looking into yourself. The Bible teaches us to always look away unto Jesus (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52668" data-verses="Hebrews 12:2">Heb. 12:2</span>). We should not look at ourselves. Our self is not worthy to look at. Nevertheless, every spiritual person who reaches a situation of satisfaction in Christ eventually falls into introspection, not only examining the self but also analyzing it. When I was a young believer, I looked at myself quite often. I did not like to <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> do anything that would not glorify the Lord. But actually I was not caring for the Lord; I was caring for myself and for what others thought of me. Looking into ourselves in this way is the greatest weakness in the spiritual life and the greatest enemy. </p>
<p data-content-id="BzzNRWtJj4dWnZdzvFFph8XftPRgIvXro-Cda6SVFOPlukaiG-XW4S5wkfJVP6qxI"> In helping others who are seeking to be spiritual, we may encourage them to pray and to confess their shortcomings to the Lord. Such prayer and confession are normal. However, in some cases we should encourage others to cease from confessing and simply believe that the blood of Jesus cleanses them and that God is faithful and righteous to forgive them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52669" data-verses="1John 1:7">1 John 1:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52670" data-verses="1John 1:9">9</span>), reminding them that God is faithful to honor Christ’s redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="x1TS__4nGWswEVPEe7OJdr12TGgNhmlmUUF_XCUf1rNJ1jDEFhJ-6uTNhUt54WW3E"> When we are introspective, we may confess the same matter again and again, thinking that the more we confess, the more forgiveness we will receive. This kind of confession comes from the satanic self; it is the result of analyzing ourselves in spiritual things. Only the cross of Christ can deliver us from such a situation caused by introspection. Therefore, we need to be called to be delivered from the self through our oneness with the cross. When we become one with the cross, hiding ourselves in the clefts of the rock and in the covert of the precipice, we will be delivered from the self. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="rOu-JG3kQERF_u5lLBSLnahjuCj0LpQVJfZSFBNE7A5WebtsD7SGAk0qDMYaLC44O">I.

Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52672" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:8">v. 8</span>). This leaping and skipping signifies Christ’s power to overcome difficulties and barriers. As the One in resurrection, He surely has a way to overcome difficulties and barriers. All the troubles concerning our fellowship with Christ come from our side. Many “hills” and “mountains” frustrate us from coming to Him, but He is never frustrated, for He can “leap” and “skip.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="lKyRqOCIu7dkVdmTyDDyYtEniT7gI6Z__LRcKWOmxaK-IeVjITyo01UemKDB5RwGA"> How can we go to the cleft of the rock, to the covert of the precipice? We do not have the strength to do this. The only way that we can go to the cross is by the power of His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52673" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>). Therefore, Christ comes to the self-satisfied seeker in the power of resurrection. </p>

The word <em>hind</em> in the title of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52675" data-verses="Psalms 22:1">Psalm 22</span>, which is concerned with resurrection, signifies Christ in resurrection. Christ’s being like a young hart signifies that His power is the power of resurrection. </p>

His standing behind “our wall” signifies that the lover’s introspection as the problem in her self is a separation between her and Him. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="G8jHIZPAUMcQkgHYzBMmlmF-W5VQd7Bma7N1GiwPyES1RiKCkjGs3_7JoTSyldqIf">D.

The windows and the lattice signify the openings set up by God for Him to fellowship, to commune, with her. No matter how much we try to hide ourselves secretly, there is a window that Christ can see through. Because man became fallen, there seemed to be no way for God to touch man or have fellowship with man. But the conscience of man is the window with a lattice, which is open for God to come in to contact fallen man. We should keep this in mind when we go out to preach the gospel. As we are preaching the gospel, we need to learn how to touch others’ conscience. </p>

<p data-content-id="Lg6xnyELi0GbxTTi48MhgyhrBAVs_SEB5jQj-UL3ludTCPeOui4CkM1qG_HU-VJKi"> In the second stage (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52708" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:8">S.S. 2:8—3:5</span>) the lover of Christ learned three basic lessons: the power of resurrection, the riches of resurrection, and the life of the cross. The power of Christ’s resurrection is signified by Christ as a gazelle and a hart leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52709" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:8-9">2:8-9</span>). The riches of Christ’s resurrection are signified by the plants, the voice of the turtledove, and the various fragrances in the spring (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52710" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:12-13">vv. 12-13a</span>). The life of the cross is signified by the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52711" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:14">v. 14</span>). The life of the cross is lived by the power of resurrection and is encouraged by the riches of resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="m0LPs9B43v0CBmP1A3vv87qAyK-onizovj8OsjZbWqcDF6p_Xjh3mFY0MZnrWBBe2"> In the next stage—the call to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52712" data-verses="Song of Songs 3:6">3:6—5:1</span>)—we need to learn the lesson of discerning the spirit from the soul (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52713" data-verses="Hebrews 4:12">Heb. 4:12</span>). Few of today’s Christians are able to discern the spirit from the soul. Many actually believe that in the Bible the words <em>spirit</em> and <em>soul</em> are synonyms, even though <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52714" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span> speaks of “spirit and soul and body.” If we do not realize that the spirit is different from the soul, we cannot reach the stage of being called to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZvLAZDtU7F-dCMJzIBychalUNwSrAY63y-p5WlULGSMxNc0g4IKCROCWUE-4yobR6"> Ascension is in the heavens. Although we are on earth, as believers in Christ our regenerated spirit is joined to God the Spirit in the heavens. These two spirits are one. This is like electricity: It is in the power plant and also in our room, yet there is one current. When we are in our spirit, we are joined to the ascended Christ in the heavens. <span class="pg" data-page-id="28" id="28">[28]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="AWCN_tVb61u_DCVVenTfqrYFnNjFYKsEEuLyuVhSuzolQ1j9xTYgWCHnSc8FZnloJ"> To live in ascension means to have a Christian life all the time in our spirit. This requires that we discern our spirit from our soul. If we love others by our soul, we are on the earth, not in ascension. But if we love by our spirit, we are in ascension. We have been seated in the heavens with Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52715" data-verses="Ephesians 2:6">Eph. 2:6</span>). Positionally, we are seated there, but we need to live in ascension. After calling us to the cross, Christ calls us further to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection. </p>

She is <span class="pg" data-page-id="29" id="29">[29]</span> the victory (bed for rest and victory in the night) of the victorious Christ, full of the power of the overcomers among God’s elect which carries Christ even in times of difficulties, and these overcomers are experts in war, fighting with their weapons at the time of alarms. </p>

She is a palanquin (for the day) as a carriage of Christ, made by Christ Himself of the resurrected, uplifted, and noble humanity (the wood of Lebanon), having God’s nature (gold) as its base, Christ’s redemption (silver) as its supports, the royal (purple) throne as its seat, and the love of the believers covering the inside. </p>

Here the Spirit bids the overcoming believers to look away from themselves unto Christ in His humanity of incarnation as a crown of His boast, at the time of the believers’ betrothal to Christ, a day of the gladness of His heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="pJQRUlRiRFYXSZXu0BX6-C_zoksL8bQorVrIiVR23HnohyG3qosiivqjtvUJZSDOO"> If Christ did not have humanity, He could not marry us. Because we are human, we could not be betrothed to Him unless He also had humanity. Thus, our betrothal to Christ depends on His humanity, which is His crown. The humanity which Christ put on in His incarnation and uplifted in His resurrection is His crown. We need to look away to Christ in His humanity. </p>
<p data-content-id="vCMCry1rPGM7oet4svfXn_7gnpm86nyCz8TTtJgmhzjNi_aC61xCVo6d8sSiLs9XF"> At this juncture we should note that the union of the bed with its sleeper, the union of the palanquin with its rider, and the union of the bride with her bridegroom, indicated in the three items above, all signify the complete union of the <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> lover with Christ.

This speaks of the beauty in her receiving the divine food by her power that has been dealt with by the cross, made clean by the Spirit’s washing, and strengthened twofold and balanced, without losing strength. </p>

Earlier, she was afraid of the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice, but now she is willing to be there, remaining in Christ’s death and resurrection. </p>

Before doing anything—in this case helping a brother—we must first pray to contact the Lord in our spirit, asking Him what He feels about what we intend to do. Then in our spirit we may have the sense that the Lord is happy. This is an indication that the Lord wants us to do this particular thing. Then we should proceed to do it in our spirit. This is to live in the spirit. </p>

The things we do may be good, but we are nevertheless on the earth because we are living in the soul. Today there are many good people who are doing good things, but these people are all living in the soul. As lovers of Christ, we need to realize that our old man, including our soul, has been crucified (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52761" data-verses="Romans 6:6">Rom. 6:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52762" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20a</span>). It is no longer “I” who live, but another man—Christ—lives in me (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52763" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20b</span>). When we live by this other man, we are the new man, for we are living in the spirit, not in the soul. <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="No1kZrgDJgas_mRxVlhA1OPsQaXhB-YY2U0ta90dYUNmAl03XRi4Joi1k83e-URmY">Living in Ascension by Living in Our Spirit</h2><p data-content-id="t4pY996rQhJj9US8jnqGiyRwIsZx-oZ4t8jnHnn6IqPhpBI_bJg5SvlHsziVQhGhr"> Our spirit is connected to the heavens by God as the Spirit. In spirit we are therefore in the heavens, in ascension. To live in ascension requires that we live, act, move, and do everything in our spirit. Thus, we must learn how to discern our spirit. If we do not know our spirit, if we do not know how to discern our spirit from our soul, we cannot be a spiritual person. When we live in our spirit, we are in ascension as the new creation in resurrection. We are a new person living in a new universe. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="hYOpckmhS4dUYVBDjMKsgTuTRSaQ56C3jy8CYfjx0BPqjl4pzEXha6bSAHxa47F1G">The Need for Practice</h2><p data-content-id="UDMq8Fm_0G9bwAlhs4zToRcpxaIIelfK4CoywPDEnxynQWqvCrTaHjrtL1YHxhpNN"> We should not think that discerning the spirit from the soul is something that is too difficult for us to learn. We all can learn how to do this if we practice one thing: We should always inquire of the Lord: “Lord, is this the old man, the soul, the old ‘I’ only, or You with me?” If we sense that we are alone in the old “I,” then we are in the soul, in the old man. If we sense that we are one with the Lord and that He is with us, then we are in the spirit. If we have proper fellowship with the Lord, inquiring of Him before doing things, then in our spirit we will have a deep sense of the Lord’s feeling. We will know whether He is happy or not. This is to discern the soul from the spirit to live in ascension. May we all learn to have this most important practice in our daily living. </p>

<p data-content-id="b8ZtozkeWef6-IIP3FjyyTIQTWmiCsgyWlyOmFpyp0mGW8zkJnUU0Ze46EmL3r_Hr"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52765" data-verses="Song of Songs 5:2">5:2—6:3</span> the lover of Christ is called more strongly to live within the veil through the cross after resurrection. In the heavenly tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52766" data-verses="Hebrews 8:2">Heb. 8:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52767" data-verses="Hebrews 9:11-12">9:11-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52768" data-verses="Hebrews 9:24">24</span>) a veil separates the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. The veil is a figure of our flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52769" data-verses="Hebrews 10:19-20">10:19-20</span>). For us to enter into the Holy of Holies the veil must be rent. This indicates that no matter how much we are in ascension, in our spirit, we are still in the old creation and we still have our flesh. Thus, even after the experience of living in ascension, we still need the experience of the cross. </p>
<p data-content-id="q3higZIgfAHILi5gaV5McmPLCYQMJH-BmLZ4rQfLWWLBYE-L_lLlboyBUAB6iD-Xd"> We should never think that while we are still in the old creation we can attain such a high degree of spirituality that we are no longer in the flesh. Consider the case of the apostle Paul, who surely was a very spiritual person. After God gave Paul high revelations, there was given to him “a thorn in the flesh” to warn him that he still had the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52770" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7">2 Cor. 12:7</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="y07wibaKf8Mxx8vkjiEtuxAWsVUbQsNg03-aNYhl_Ykioucd1paD9F25-H8SMI0i0"> We must never consider that we are a “saint” or an angel. We are proper believers in God’s process of His economy. God’s economy is first to regenerate our spirit and then to transform our soul, but the flesh is still here. We need to be warned that if we are careless with the flesh, we will damage our spiritual life. </p>
<p data-content-id="848jZ0A3hJNw4TRUw5zySRuIutOhNiqfXSmaOgfJjk2tF8QBJmFNfbQWSzKK6j2Uz"> Because Christians are often careless concerning the flesh, divisions among believers are common. According to the book of Acts, Barnabas became dissenting with Paul and separated himself from him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52771" data-verses="Acts 15:35-39">15:35-39</span>). This division was caused by Barnabas’s intention to take his cousin John, who was also <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> called Mark, with them on a proposed journey to visit the churches. “Paul did not consider it suitable to take with them this one who withdrew from them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work. And there was a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking Mark along, sailed away to Cyprus” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52772" data-verses="Acts 15:38-39">vv. 38-39</span>). Every argument involves something of the flesh. Probably Paul was in the spirit as he was contending, but Barnabas was arguing according to the flesh. This indicates that even with spiritual persons the flesh remains and can cause damage. </p>
<p data-content-id="CjwVCk3gKHb6eOe4z9l4nNCDgpW9CHsW5Wu2v5Clbhi2ALGvKkTQXwEYK0r1kiGj9"> We should not think that if we are living in ascension the flesh is no longer with us. No, the flesh is still here. We may be in ascension, but the veil, the flesh, is still present. When Christ was crucified, the veil in the temple was split in two from top to bottom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52773" data-verses="Matthew 27:51">Matt. 27:51</span>). With Christ the veil was riven, but our veil still remains. Therefore, we need a stronger call, not merely to remain in ascension but to learn the lessons of the cross and live within the veil. In our experience the veil, the flesh, must be riven, and then we need to pass the riven veil to live in the Holy of Holies. For this, we daily need to learn the lesson of the cross. </p>

My beloved is knocking: / Open to me, my sister, my love, / My dove, my perfect one; / For my head is full of dew, / My locks with the drops of night.” In His calling of the lover, the Beloved regarded her as His sister. This means that she had the same nature as He. Here the lover realized that her old man, the outward man, was crucified and her new man, the inward man, is living. She heard her Beloved knocking and asking her to open to Him, reminding her of His suffering as He suffered at Gethsemane <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> for His crucifixion. His head being “full of dew” and His locks with “the drops of night” refers to Christ’s suffering at night in Gethsemane before His death. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Wga87qee1jYAk-dIc8bkvvMe_-cJI0BEhg6zNoZNZcp3owMeAaducBaVlc-J_jDxo">B.

Since she had put off the former manner of life of her old man through the dealing of the cross, how could she put it on again, for this would need her Beloved to repeat His suffering for crucifixion? Since she had been cleansed by His redeeming blood, how could she defile herself, since this would need her Beloved to repeat His suffering of death? These were her reasons for refusing the Beloved’s call. </p>

Her Beloved showed His pierced hand through her narrow opening so that her inner parts were moved to yearn for Him. From experience we know that, on the one hand, we may reject the Lord, but, on the other hand, we may not close the door entirely. After closing the door, we may leave a little opening through which the Lord can stretch His hand. Here the Beloved’s pierced hand reminded her that He was crucified for her. </p>

She opened to her Beloved, but He had withdrawn and gone. Her soul was discouraged when her Beloved spoke. Then she sought Him, but she did not find Him. She called Him, but He did not answer. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="a5MPhcI09MtmRYA6lmJpMtj1J7wfOH_5T26Hd7hoDSlXU9pEX4060dEE7fojsK0p6">E.

The ones who watch over God’s people (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52782" data-verses="Hebrews 13:17">Heb. 13:17</span>), not knowing her problem, struck and wounded her, thinking that she would be helped by their striking. The guards of God’s people took away her veil, her covering, shaming her publicly. Sometimes we may think that we can help others by rebuking them. However, instead of helping them, this rebuking wounds them. </p>

This indicates that because her sense of failure was so deep, she felt that even the younger believers could help her. She charged them to tell her Beloved that she is sick with love, considering that her Beloved may have some concern about her love for Him. </p>

<p data-content-id="5wt653mRz2g7UYGzxuJ6mYDT1k65_8pjHZFuP6BgrLCCeZ1XfSdI7ulC04xnFrWIB"> The next stage is that of living in the heavenlies as God’s new creation in resurrection. After experiencing this stage we need to go on to experience the rending of the veil. The veil in the temple was split by Christ’s death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52819" data-verses="Matthew 27:51">Matt. 27:51</span>). However, the veil of the flesh has not been taken away. Rather, the veil still remains for God to use in perfecting His seeking saints. For example, Paul was surely a matured brother, having passed through the stage of living in the heavens as the new creation of God in resurrection. But according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52820" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:1">2 Corinthians 12</span> God allowed a “thorn in the flesh” to be given him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52821" data-verses="2Corinthians 12:7">v. 7</span>). Here we see that even such a mature and spiritual person could still be troubled by the flesh. This indicates that no matter how much of God’s element we may have in our regenerated spirit, or how much we have been sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of <span class="pg" data-page-id="49" id="49">[49]</span> the firstborn Son of God, as long as we are living on earth, we still have the flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="No1kZrgDJgas_mRxVlhA1OPsQaXpB-oQ2U0ta90dYUNmAl03XRi4Joi1k83e-URmY"> Whereas the regeneration of our spirit was instantaneous, the transformation of our soul is progressive. The redemption of our body is also progressive. Paul said that our inner man is being renewed but that our outer man, our body, is decaying day by day. This is God’s arrangement according to His economy. God has no plan for us to reach such a high standard of spirituality that the flesh is no longer present. God’s economy is to keep us living in ascension as a new creation in resurrection, no matter how spiritual we may be. We might think that in resurrection there should no longer be the flesh, but God still needs it in order to work something in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="t4pY996rQhJj9US8jnqGiyRwIsZ5-opAt8jnHnn6IqPhpBI_bJg5SvlHsziVQhGhr"> Because the flesh is still with us, we need to deal with the flesh every day by watching and praying. If we do not watch, the flesh will act. In our prayer we need to be watchful, praying in the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="hYOpckmhS4dUYVBDjMKsgTuTRSaY56yPjy8CYfjx0BPqjl4pzEXha6bSAHxa47F1G"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52822" data-verses="Song of Songs 6:4">Song of Songs 6:4</span> Jerusalem is a sign of royalty. The more heavenly we are, the more royal we become. To be royal is to reign like a king. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52823" data-verses="Romans 5:1">Romans 5</span> says that those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52824" data-verses="Romans 5:17">v. 17</span>). Nevertheless, even though we may be royal and live in ascension as God’s new creation in resurrection, there is still a veil in the heavenly sanctuary. This indicates that no matter how spiritual we may be, we are still in the flesh, which is the veil. Therefore, we need to learn to pass through the veil by the dealing of the cross every day. Then we will live within the veil, in the Holy of Holies, which is just God Himself. This is the highest stage in the experience of the lover of Christ as presented in Song of Songs. When we reach such a stage, we will have nothing to do but to wait and hope for rapture. </p>

An Indication of Her Maturity<br/>in Life for God’s Building</h2><p data-content-id="9bSXN-mWk-QP1LY2x6yVrzvjY9evUIIqXba133t5zXyGzD8ABxmgBOqBpkHPsehQm"> Previously the lover was likened to a mare, a horse among Pharaoh’s chariots, a rose in Sharon, a lily in the valleys and among thorns, a dove, a pillar of smoke, a bed, a palanquin, a garden, and a fountain with a spring, but now she is likened to the heavenly dwelling of God and the heavenly Jerusalem, indicating her maturity in life for God’s building. </p>
<p data-content-id="jgoOQj2-ZIZmH6g-UOt-NhrdoIiIh6f52Kl0QKoIVufKSisLLeIlEtz-5X_9MS1O1"> For the building of the Body of Christ, we need the maturity of life. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52826" data-verses="Ephesians 4:12-16">Ephesians 4:12-16</span>, which speaks of the building up of the Body, tells us that we need growth to reach maturity so that the Body of Christ can be built up. To build up the church in a general way requires only the capacity to manage, arrange, and take care of things. This is not something organic but something organized according to human management. However, the building up of the Body has nothing to do with our ability to organize, manage, and arrange things. The Body of Christ is an organism, not an organization. The building up of this organism depends on growth and the maturity in life. The building of the Body is organic. </p>
<p data-content-id="T6lXjY7Nc8p3nwuYXkAEc9Ga5d_yOn0OWj_sszFGhsMVaGr93khwU6-qbYoXssZLW"> To build up the Body organically, we need to mature. This is the reason that we are now stressing the building up of the Body much more than the building up of the church. First Timothy is a book on the church as the house of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52827" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15">3:15</span>). There is nothing in this book on the building of the Body of Christ. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52828" data-verses="1Timothy 3:1">First Timothy 3</span> speaks of the arrangement of elders and deacons in their service, but Ephesians does not speak of elders and deacons. Instead, it speaks of members growing. First, we need to grow, and then we can perfect others. This perfecting is according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52829" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:1">2 Corinthians 13</span>, in which Christ is <span class="pg" data-page-id="51" id="51">[51]</span> living and growing in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52830" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:5">v. 5</span>) and we are enjoying the Triune God in the Father’s love, the Son’s grace, and the Spirit’s fellowship (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52831" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">v. 14</span>). This is the building up of the Body, not the building up of the church as a kind of organization. This building, for which we need the maturity in life, is unique. It is the organic Body of Christ, which will consummate the organic New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. </p>

She is now called <em>Shulammite</em> (the feminine form of <em>Solomon</em>—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52858" data-verses="Song of Songs 6:13">S.S. 6:13</span>), for she has become the same as Solomon in life, nature, and image to match him for their marriage. This couple’s becoming one indicates the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the redeeming God (signified by Solomon) and all His redeemed (signified by the Shulammite) become one. The New Jerusalem is a mingling of divinity and humanity to express the processed, consummated Triune God in human virtues. </p>
<p data-content-id="Yt9QTP24SJK8nB0FWsJfpRnuAyp_0cnfnOAfBRKjbAWTs9vhDquF2elqgRV_Bycuy"> At this point it seems that the book should end, yet it continues. Solomon is the lord of many vineyards, and these vineyards require much labor. Now the country girl, who has become his Shulammite, must become his co-worker. This indicates that eventually Christ’s lovers need to share in the work of the Lord. To share in the Lord’s work we need to be qualified, and our qualification depends upon the spiritual equipment, that is, it depends on our being equipped with all the attributes of the divine life. </p>

Romans also tells us that we can reign in this divine life of Christ. This life can make us kings; it can make us royal. Song of Songs indicates that a lover of Christ should reach the maturity in His royal life to reign as a king with Christ. This is the first virtue, the first qualification, for her to share in the Lord’s work. </p>

Here we see that when the lover hears what her Beloved spoke in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52913" data-verses="Song of Songs 8:5">verse 5</span>, she admits that by herself she is not able to stand and live in her Beloved until her rapture.

Since the lover has matured in life in pursuing Christ and in her ultimate consummation of her experience of Christ, before her rapture she with Christ is concerned for the younger lovers of Christ. She is concerned about how to perfect them to mature in life for the building up of the Body of Christ and to love Christ until they are betrothed to Him in love for the constituting of the bride of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52918" data-verses="Song of Songs 8:8">v. 8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52919" data-verses="2Corinthians 11:2">2 Cor. 11:2</span>). </p>

In the work of Christ He is the Lord of all the works (Baal-hamon and vineyard). The lover of Him participates in one part of the work (one vineyard) and gives to Him what He requires (a thousand shekels), and she as one joined to her Beloved gives to herself as a keeper of the fruit (not of the vineyard) two hundred shekels as a reward. This indicates that Christ as our Beloved is the Lord of all, possessing all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52928" data-verses="Acts 10:36">Acts 10:36</span>), and we as His lovers share in all His possessions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52929" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:21-22">1 Cor. 3:21-22</span>) freely in the grace of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52930" data-verses="Romans 3:24">Rom. 3:24</span>) which is the issue of the love of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52931" data-verses="2Corinthians 13:14">2 Cor. 13:14</span>). Yet, we as His lovers still should give Him as our Beloved what we should give, not as a duty but as a matter of love (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52932" data-verses="Galatians 5:13">Gal. 5:13</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="67" id="67">[67]</span> Christ as our Beloved, joining Himself to us as one, still likes to give us, as His lovers joined to Him as one, a reward of righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52933" data-verses="2Timothy 4:8">2 Tim. 4:8</span>). This implies that Christ as our Beloved gives us a reward for the residue of our labor as an incentive to our faithfulness in our labor for Him in love (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52934" data-verses="Matthew 25:20-23">Matt. 25:20-23</span>); hence, it is a reward of righteousness. </p>

In reading this book it is easy for us to lose our way. However, through the writings of those who have gone before us, especially through Brother Nee’s study of this book, Song of Songs has been opened to us. I am thankful that through Brother Nee we can see that Song of Songs is a spiritual life-story of Christian experiences, signified by a romance. In Song of Songs these experiences are in four stages. </p>

This stage includes many things: yearning to be kissed by Christ; the fellowship in the inner chamber; entering into the church life by following the footsteps of the flock; being transformed by the remaking of the Spirit; and participating in Christ’s rest and satisfaction. </p>
<p data-content-id="wYL25dttAadzaytFVatgfx9BLIT1oFA-RpDGO1bvg2jmqoC169drXZrasjeDV68_t"> In this stage a sinner saved by grace is stirred up, attracted by Christ’s love, and charmed by what He is. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52952" data-verses="Song of Songs 1:2">Song of Songs 1:2</span> says of Christ, “Your love is better than wine.” Nothing in the whole universe can compare with Him. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52953" data-verses="Song of Songs 1:3">Verse 3</span> goes on to speak of Christ’s “anointing oils” and says that His “name is like ointment poured forth.” This ointment, which is actually Christ Himself as the Spirit, is a compound of divinity, humanity, Christ’s death and resurrection, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="72" id="72">[72]</span> effectiveness of His death, and the power of His resurrection.

In brief, the second stage is the stage of the experience of the cross. In considering this stage, it is sufficient that we remember just one word—cross. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52956" data-verses="Song of Songs 2:14">Song of Songs 2:14</span> says, “My dove, in the clefts of the rock, / In the covert of the precipice, / Let me see your countenance, / Let me hear your voice; / For your voice is sweet, / And your countenance is lovely.” Here “the clefts of the rock” and “the covert of the precipice” are figures of the cross. Christ wants to see His lover’s lovely countenance and hear her sweet voice in her oneness, union, with the cross. The cross is the central stress in this section on deliverance from the self. </p>
<p data-content-id="q3higZIgfAHILi5gaV5McmPLCYAUJGatmLZ4rQfLWWLBYE-L_lLlboyBUAB6iD-Xd"> When we pursue after Christ and become satisfied with the rest and enjoyment in Christ, we may become very occupied with and concerned about the self and thereby fall into introspection. Thus, we need to experience the denying of the self and the breaking of the self by being one with the cross. We need to stay in the clefts of the rock and remain hidden in the covert of the precipice. This means that we should daily stay at the cross. We should be able to say with Paul, “I am crucified with Christ” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52957" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>). We—“I,” the self, the natural man, the old man—have been crucified, and now we should stay on the cross. This is to be in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the precipice. How can we reach the clefts and the covert, which are rugged places high up in the mountains? How can we remain there? We can go to the cross and remain there only by the power of Christ’s resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52958" data-verses="Philippians 3:10">Phil. 3:10</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> </p>

Christ’s death is followed by Christ’s resurrection, and in His resurrection we are a new creation. The new creation is a product of Christ’s resurrection. Anyone who is in Christ and in His resurrection is a new creation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52960" data-verses="2Corinthians 5:17">2 Cor. 5:17</span>). The matters of resurrection and a new creation are closely related to Christ’s ascension. Actually, Christ’s resurrection and ascension are one. If we are in His resurrection, we are also in His ascension. When we live in resurrection, we are surely living in ascension. </p>
<p data-content-id="0bmcYP9ONkuFs2VWUDsNEKmHwolNXpsWL6nBgxDbNXLIqS-bWWqJJ_YnOUfeGsNGj"> Proof that the third stage of spiritual experience in Song of Songs is the call to live in ascension is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52961" data-verses="Song of Songs 4:8">4:8</span>: “Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; / With me from Lebanon come. / Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions’ dens, / From the leopards’ mountains.” As we have pointed out, <em>Amana</em> means “truth,” <em>Senir</em> means “soft armor,” and <em>Hermon</em> means “destruction.” When we live in ascension, we have the truth (signified by Amana) and we have the victory (signified by Senir and Hermon) over the enemy. When we live in ascension, we realize that the war is over, that the victory has been gained, and that the enemy has been destroyed. The lions’ dens and the leopards’ mountains signify Satan and his evil forces. These evil powers are in the air, but when we live in ascension, we are in the heavens, far above them. Furthermore, when we live in ascension, spontaneously we are a new creation of God in the resurrection of Christ. How wonderful! </p>

The fourth stage is to be called by Christ more strongly to live <span class="pg" data-page-id="74" id="74">[74]</span> within the veil through His cross after the experience of His resurrection (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52962" data-verses="Song of Songs 5:2">5:2—6:13</span>). In ascension, in the heavens, there is the sanctuary of God, and a veil, which signifies the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52963" data-verses="Hebrews 10:20">Heb. 10:20</span>), divides this heavenly sanctuary into two sections. We should not think that once we have arrived at the heavenly sanctuary, we have already attained the highest point of spiritual experience. We may have come to the highest point, but we may not yet be in the inner chamber of the heavenly sanctuary. This inner chamber is the Holy of Holies—God Himself. The veil separating the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place was split in two at the time of Christ’s crucifixion (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="52964" data-verses="Matthew 27:51">Matt. 27:51</span>), but the veil has not been taken away. The veil is still there. After we reach ascension we eventually realize that with the sanctuary in the heavens there is an inner chamber and that we need to enter within the veil and live within the veil, that is, live in God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="BzzNRWtJj4dWnZdzvFFph8XftPBsIvX7o-Cda6SVFOPlukaiG-XW4S5wkfJVP6qxI"> We have seen that the veil signifies the flesh, which is worse than the self. After the first stage, the object of our dealing is the self. Later, in the fourth stage, the object of our dealing is the flesh. This requires a further experience of the cross, for we need to enter within the veil through the cross. This means that even after we have experienced resurrection and ascension, we still need the cross in order to live in the Holy of Holies within the veil. We experience the cross in the second stage, but we need to have the deeper experience of the cross in the fourth stage. </p>

When she was first drawn by the Lord, He likened her to a mare, a horse among Pharaoh’s chariots. Then she was likened to a rose in Sharon, a lily in the valleys and among thorns, a dove, a pillar of smoke, a bed, a palanquin, a garden, and a fountain with a spring. Now she is likened to the heavenly dwelling of God and the heavenly Jerusalem. The word <em>Jerusalem</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="52966" data-verses="Song of Songs 6:4">verse 4</span> is a sign of the New Jerusalem, indicating that all the lovers of Christ eventually will become the New Jerusalem—the ultimate <span class="pg" data-page-id="75" id="75">[75]</span> consummation of the Bible. Here in God’s Holy of Holies we have the highest spiritual experience. </p>
