<p data-content-id="BqZPFRLgw98kbSgb8Hi1c65nnPzmJXxKB-kWDRhfxRZL2fylKlegCgma_JzeWmXPQ"> In our life-study of the Word, we now come to the book of Jeremiah. Although many of us may not be familiar with Jeremiah, I hope that the Lord will stir up our interest in this book and show us its intrinsic purpose. </p>
<p data-content-id="xoS3aB8bggngik3368-UKcMfQce0sWuhgTPcP2VSkcf8UGJT53JBHpp4ILIlnAQx8"> The book of Jeremiah has as its particular nature and standing God’s tenderheartedness plus God’s righteousness. Our God is a tenderhearted God, and He is absolutely righteous. He is full of compassion, sympathy, and tender care, yet He is righteous. As the righteous God, He cannot spare those who have sinned against Him; He has to judge them. He is such a God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ryNgMdLLxGzNdPUZnHlJ-xZsWLsb7cXZyI_bjltu4X1W1mcuvEgdbXrzjpYp62B4L"> This book is also an autobiography in which Jeremiah tells us of his situation, his person, and his feeling, revealing his tender heart. Jehovah is the tenderhearted God, and in being tenderhearted Jeremiah is absolutely one with God. Because Jeremiah often wept, even wailed, he is called the weeping prophet. In his weeping Jeremiah represented God. Thus, God could use a prophet like Jeremiah to express Him, speak for Him, and represent Him on earth. </p>
<p data-content-id="dA9g112R6wtwAVhAjoQ_6pcq6BDG-favTe84a2fkR6ZKnV1iXOelgVWn5GULkVdQV"> This book also deals with Israel. Israel is stubborn, evil, wicked, and stiff-necked, knowing nothing of repentance or of returning to God. Israel is altogether not one with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="QOcu1PTGsauWKCuTN-ZLs8jQ-q5S9Yo4bls-LboSR19ZNV2y0006XK5EQhWcOdpBP"> Jeremiah also speaks much concerning the nations. According to this book, in the sight of God, all the nations, all the Gentiles, are animals, acting as if they do not have a human spirit. They do not bear any kind of image or likeness of God nor understand anything of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="_1Uw53Q8BnPZ6UV9p6rGA83Ua44DItX6hl4RPQlM89czdLHmlIdPqSLe5LQNTgYYg"> In the book of Jeremiah four parties are revealed. The first party is God, who is tender, loving, compassionate, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> righteous. The second party is Jeremiah, a timid young man raised up by God to be His mouthpiece to speak for Him and express Him. As God’s mouthpiece, Jeremiah is one with God in being tenderhearted, loving, and righteous. In contrast, Israel, the third party, is evil and stubborn, and the fourth party, consisting of the nations, is even worse. </p>
<p data-content-id="BqZPFRLgw98kbSgb8Hi1c65nnO3KJXxKB-kWDRhfxRZL2fylKlegCgma_JzeWmXPQ"> Let us now go on to consider, in an introductory way, certain important aspects of the book of Jeremiah. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xoS3aB8bggngik3368-UKcMfQdqUsWuhgTPcP2VSkcf8UGJT53JBHpp4ILIlnAQx8">I. THE AUTHOR</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ryNgMdLLxGzNdPUZnHlJ-xZsWKI_7cXZyI_bjltu4X1W1mcuvEgdbXrzjpYp62B4L">A. Jeremiah </h2>
<p data-content-id="dA9g112R6wtwAVhAjoQ_6pcq6DX--favTe84a2fkR6ZKnV1iXOelgVWn5GULkVdQV"> The name Jeremiah in Hebrew means “Jehovah exalts.” This name also means “Jehovah tears down.” The real contents of the book of Jeremiah are that God exalts some and tears down others. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="QOcu1PTGsauWKCuTN-ZLs8jQ-o9u9Yo4bls-LboSR19ZNV2y0006XK5EQhWcOdpBP">B. A Priest</h2><h2 class="head3" data-content-id="KO1Ppd7egl5MxDTzJ27MzdZ_sp8RuZube8axoy99zrV9Hfa79zsxHBf3C_6jMFB18">1. Born of Hilkiah </h2>
<p data-content-id="l_gYKm68xmWHDmvlR-_dO59Meo5QbMKJSISuKTTEgKhLDjdeuLU2Ksf0mFVTSIRGq"> Jeremiah was a priest, born of Hilkiah, a priest, in the small city of Anathoth in the land of Benjamin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55976" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:1">Jer. 1:1</span>). By birth Jeremiah had the position of a priest. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="OGG-FY948JCc0HrjqHM0n5uxXvmFayu1t3Rzs7YGi5Rsn8GmrQSi5Ks_NPFDtTRcK">2. Called to Be a Prophet over the Nations</h2><p data-content-id="4RV9VV4Mn4S9URwdDF3r82JrMWXFYZNpnncuPZB9ytI-xHUsBjp-XFeSekOIs7VuD"> Whereas Jeremiah was born a priest, he was called to be a prophet over the nations (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55977" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55978" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:5">5</span>). Hence, he was a priest-prophet not only over Israel but also over the nations. For this reason, he speaks very much concerning the nations. No other prophetic book speaks as much about the nations as the book of Jeremiah. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="o9vBX-P141WnchYVMJC2Pn0nyf9gSB0_q0WISuR6blpcC3G4PjPvM49r0nhG4rqrf">a.

Jeremiah ministered for forty-one years, and every one of them was a terrible year. Within these forty-one years, there were at least three exiles. Eventually, nearly all <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> of the children of Israel were exiled, ending, in the sight of God, their history as God’s elect. Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple was burned, and the people were carried away. This means that, in a sense, God gave up Israel. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="GavFbAHZwy2tSsSfbn19MOiQONEQhKNdN7EMYKvswdWTwhcWqG65aQqo-Zv3gW-TT">b.

He did not want to go to Egypt, but certain rebellious ones captured him and took him with them to Egypt. History tells us that he was murdered in Egypt. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="YPnJAtwqd1Hhbr5Ylak7V0EAwGR3WmxU0Dzx1ilygm_OB2v0Ozy0V8PkcAE9E1G2x">c. A Contemporary of Habakkuk,<br/>

<p data-content-id="EKTPt27qqN-F_WvBAInRg4lnbyqXUPZUoqJ-qKrlak6Pmjc1nLvSgz6EgxzVMBvKF"> Jeremiah was a contemporary of the prophets Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Daniel, and Ezekiel. Some of them were captured and taken to Babylon, but Jeremiah was not. He remained in the fathers’ land in Jerusalem. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="DmmIANvlEKFtJh61GaXU8jzOymZqGToEqAFPhhGAJVMQOx8FlApR50x7mhv3SQtTa">d. An Overcomer Speaking for God</h2><p data-content-id="S6RHs2MncWvor0QDq8uvg6khgXRN8JWrAC56dNTnFufpBbm4uq54a8wIPJG0xfP0T"> Jeremiah was an overcomer speaking for God in the process of the captivity of God’s degraded elect. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="gXNDhKVKPDNG-PSy0ap2-aArIvblOp3E22wW4wcjBrQr3eBubnsiSZW6jjx_GhUd-">e. His Book Being a Collection<br/>of History, an Autobiography, and His Prophesying</h2><p data-content-id="eK3U6TivBGpZoPSpFXbBpkdrNnm41kwZj3aus0PDhekjUWjEg8WYJwsu2zhwfFo9Q"> Jeremiah’s book is a collection of history, of his autobiography, and of his prophesying. He spoke much concerning the history of Israel, he presented a full story of his life, and he uttered many prophecies. Some of Jeremiah’s prophecies were negative, and others were positive. Negatively, Jeremiah predicted that Israel would be captured and that the temple would be destroyed. Jeremiah told Zedekiah to welcome the Babylonian army and thereby save the entire city of Jerusalem and the temple; otherwise, the city would be destroyed. However, Zedekiah was stubborn and refused to take Jeremiah’s word. When Zedekiah tried to escape, he was captured and brought to Nebuchadnezzar. The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and then he put out <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters of bronze to bring him to Babylon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55979" data-verses="Jeremiah 39:4-7">39:4-7</span>). Jeremiah witnessed these things. </p>
<p data-content-id="54BtkgWnr1OFzxnK-WTO8UcuRMqANJkcAKfLdwJt4vlukEyz_ZCCopi7yupUc-Fah"> The positive side of Jeremiah’s prophecy was wonderful. For example, he prophesied that Israel would be restored by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55980" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:3-8">23:3-8</span>). He also prophesied that God would raise up to David a righteous Shoot who would reign as a King and act prudently and whose name would be called “Jehovah our righteousness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55981" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:5-6">vv. 5-6</span>). This is a great prophecy concerning Christ, a prophecy not found in any other book. Furthermore, Jeremiah prophesied concerning the new covenant which God would make with Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55982" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33-34">31:33-34</span>). Paul quoted this prophecy and applied it to the covenant in the New Testament (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55983" data-verses="Hebrews 8:10-12">Heb. 8:10-12</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55984" data-verses="Hebrews 10:16-17">10:16-17</span>). Although this covenant is good for the New Testament believers, the Jews presently have no part in it because of their unbelief and rebellion. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="N1jAqv5oTUZsiM67xdhtjxAyY84J9pQqhzZJPgCwJVdPuEugqmvQSn33gGXqF_crO">II. THE SUBJECT</h2><p data-content-id="tZuu6-ZsQvsngbu5uCIxm9n_1ZVfyCrNhfC62kC3lx-DhC-UbaDxK6iX5Dah_P9Ma"> The subject of the book of Jeremiah is Christ being made the righteousness of Jehovah to God’s elect as their center and circumference in God’s dealings with Israel and the nations. No matter how stubborn, wicked, and corrupt Israel, God’s elect, may be, God will eventually make Christ the righteousness of Jehovah to them. Today Israel does not have any righteousness, but when Christ becomes the righteousness of Jehovah to them, no one, including Satan, will be able to accuse them. </p>
<p data-content-id="hu2uUJVINkEPiGiqQhpF1r9HLMbZiv_qnH1QQei2N4TdId-OJa1wlQfQxFBnO0l7V"> Furthermore, when Christ becomes righteousness to God’s elect, He also becomes their center and circumference in God’s dealing with them and with the nations. Jeremiah is a book concerning God’s dealing first with Israel and then with the nations. The center and circumference of God’s dealing is Christ. As God deals with Israel and the nations today, Christ is the center and circumference. For example, the recent changes in Europe and Russia are God’s doing for Christ to be the centrality and universality. The book of Jeremiah is not concerned merely with God’s tenderheartedness and righteousness and with His chastisement of stubborn, stiff-necked Israel. The intrinsic reality of this book is God’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> dealing with Israel and with the nations for Christ to be the center and circumference in everything. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="U0NfuDerr3yjfHzjUQGmjI8k1NQvBsnW8BvVDp0BMMdMDj-ghQalUZjd0pqZu7PCO">III. THE CONTENT</h2><p data-content-id="MkLsNIZK3KHO0_oIE9QK9OJ6trAX8ahuEp5CBI-vlF2dObKygQa8NZwLOoEsIS6-u"> The content of Jeremiah is God’s carrying out of His economy through the chastisement of Israel, His elect, in love with His tender care, compassion, and sympathy, and His judgment upon the nations in righteousness to match His love, that Israel may manifest Christ, who is their divine righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55985" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:6">23:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="55986" data-verses="Jeremiah 33:16">33:16</span>) as their centrality and universality, by their being made a new creation with the inner law of the divine life and the capacity of this life to know God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="55987" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33-34">31:33-34</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="VYllZLbCUbiBExfUA94TqMDZ3Ae797TJ-pxfQS8NrbJCdofbVI8ugl81WP6iomfOd"> According to the book of Jeremiah, God’s love is a composition of His tender care, compassion, and sympathy. Even while He chastises His elect people Israel, He is compassionate toward them. Regarding this, God can be compared to a father who weeps as he disciplines his child because he loves the child. In this book Jeremiah wept on God’s behalf; his weeping expressed God’s feeling. We may say that God wept within Jeremiah’s weeping, for in his weeping Jeremiah was one with God. </p>
<p data-content-id="iPhF8xszSoOCgN2Xb6a3aISYvO5_xRbxn9hHyTMqQThQoeveFmMf6Icc4HvFbfliP"> God carries out His economy not only by chastising Israel in love but also by judging the nations in righteousness. His righteousness matches His love. Actually, God’s judgment upon the nations comes out of His love for them and results in His salvation of them in His love. </p>

<p data-content-id="3nMDVhrLh74ojb_RJNZs3EcAkDQWKqixf0ynlY6Srv9hH_PqwSgh_oJSYyF81NQR3"> In the foregoing message we emphasized the subject, the content, and the central thought of the book of Jeremiah. As a way of reviewing these matters, in this message I would like to say a word concerning certain crucial aspects of the divine revelation in Jeremiah. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="GavFbAHZwy2tSsSfbn19MOicOMAwhKNdN7EMYKvswdWTwhcWqG65aQqo-Zv3gW-TT">THE BIBLE TESTIFYING CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p data-content-id="cOvD4v-Ua1QyiUboehqxb8nGWexO4w0WjZPfZSG04pLt2KTqjSTwdGH6tunLfFX2Z"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56017" data-verses="John 5:39-40">John 5:39 and 40</span> the Lord Jesus said to the Jewish religionists, “You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.” To “search the Scriptures” may be separated from “come to Me.” The Jewish religionists searched the Scriptures but were not willing to come to the Lord. These two should go together. Because the Scriptures testify concerning the Lord, they should not be separated from the Lord. We may contact the Scriptures, yet not contact the Lord. Only the Lord can give life. </p>
<p data-content-id="YPnJAtwqd1Hhbr5Ylak7V0EMwE1PWmxU0Dzx1ilygm_OB2v0Ozy0V8PkcAE9E1G2x"> From the time the Pentateuch was written until today, the Jews have been studying the Scriptures, but they do not know Christ or come to Him, even though the Scriptures testify concerning Him. It is quite possible that this may be our situation as we study the Bible and particularly, in the case of this life-study, the book of Jeremiah. Because of this, I would like to point out that my burden in these messages is not to have a Bible study but to seek Christ as life. Life is different from mere letters (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56018" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:6">2 Cor. 3:6b</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="EKTPt27qqN-F_WvBAInRg4lrbwerUPZUoqJ-qKrlak6Pmjc1nLvSgz6EgxzVMBvKF"> Furthermore, I am burdened that we would see God’s economy in this book. We should not understand the Bible in a natural way but according to the divine revelation regarding God’s economy. During the last thirty years, the Lord’s recovery of the truths has reached the matter of God’s economy, and my messages have therefore been focused on God’s economy. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="w7B2ly3akD68nMBqEd7c93z5PyTFxA198MFRr87lPFUoeqGN4RurJgqOvdEfsYiU-">CHRIST BEING MADE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS<br/>OF JEHOVAH TO GOD’S ELECT</h2><p data-content-id="LydA6pgW62hGE3L5Yo603Br1CCMU_oJx7RQ3MfY2dPGEnkNVqPXUHGsEyrbjQDODr"> The book of Jeremiah reveals that Christ is made the righteousness of Jehovah to God’s elect (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56019" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:6">23:6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56020" data-verses="Jeremiah 33:16">33:16</span>). Why is it necessary for Christ to be made God’s righteousness to God’s people? Someone might answer by saying that Christ must be made the righteousness of Jehovah to God’s elect people because in themselves they are wicked and corrupt and altogether without righteousness; and unless Christ becomes righteousness to them, God cannot have anything to do with them. Such an answer is good, but it is lacking in light and in vision and remains on the level of a mere Bible study. The best way to answer this question is to answer according to the revelation in the New Testament concerning God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="m-9_FZSSONBzYxqNbcHQ1AD5SXwPimxecKNlJ7BbA5XVzfunX5H58YZ8zzGNG7UoU"> God’s economy is to make Christ everything, to make Christ the centrality and the universality, for the producing of God’s increase, God’s enlargement, which is the church. The increase, the enlargement, of God is the fullness of God for His expression. The consummation of this fullness will be the New Jerusalem. If we consider the New Jerusalem as it is described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56021" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span>, we will see that the New Jerusalem is God’s eternal increase with Christ as the center and the circumference. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZiXhEknxjzatvebIYmZYSRgehVh4FJ6fk2B32pao_RfIz8F6WkGgFhS25xH7AYBWE"> We may say that in eternity past God was a “bachelor,” meaning that He was alone without anyone to match Him. In eternity future, however, God will no longer be a bachelor but will have the New Jerusalem as His wife (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56022" data-verses="Revelation 21:9-10">Rev. 21:9-10</span>). This wife will also be the tabernacle (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56023" data-verses="Revelation 21:3">Rev. 21:3</span>). This wife, this tabernacle, is the increase of God. Thus, the New Jerusalem, the consummation of God’s selected people, is the <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> enlargement of God. Christ is the centrality and universality of this enlargement. This is God’s economy. </p>
<p data-content-id="AQQB_dTYue1Rhzg91v0ifNMn95nXb0ZfZqyeUinh9hQWuj3H3gR5Pv0fS5qcnsAWW"> If we see this, we will know why it is necessary for Christ to be made the righteousness of Jehovah to God’s people. According to the book of Jeremiah, Israel was wicked and provoked God’s wrath, and because of this God came in to punish and chastise them. Actually, Israel’s evil and wickedness prepared the way for Christ to come in to be their righteousness. If Israel had been righteous, how could Christ have become their righteousness? It would have been impossible. But according to Paul’s thought, their unrighteousness and sinfulness provided the opportunity for Christ to come in and be made the righteousness of Jehovah to them. Therefore, the subject of Jeremiah is Christ being made the righteousness of Jehovah to God’s elect as their center and circumference. Eventually, Israel will manifest Christ, who is their righteousness, as their centrality and universality. This manifestation will consummate in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="F0z9H8uW6AZFrBLBWfOtEbdtqcMIESJMtyqly6gCslvW9uY3DyGu4FsQmX5vNfxqw">GOD’S WAY TO MAKE CHRIST EVERYTHING,<br/>THE CENTER AND THE CIRCUMFERENCE, TO ISRAEL</h2><p data-content-id="CPl51KuiUuVRd63WzIYRZqidPGzKELyPmm04MAeFUnbViUT5NigWropYLlUPwqHsA"> We have seen that the subject of Jeremiah is God’s carrying out of His economy through the chastisement of Israel, His elect, in love, with His tender care, compassion, and sympathy, and His judgment upon the nations in righteousness, to match His love, that Israel may manifest Christ, who is their divine righteousness as their centrality and universality, by their being made a new creation with the inner law of the divine life and the capacity of this life to know God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56024" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33-34">31:33-34</span>). Concerning this, I would like to ask the following question: In what way does God make Christ everything, the center and the circumference, to the people of Israel? Someone might answer this question by saying that the way God does this is for Christ to be incarnated as the Shoot of David, to be crucified, and then to become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection. This, however, is the <em>means</em> by which God makes Christ everything to us; it is not the <em>way</em> in which God makes Christ everything to us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="14" id="14">[14]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="PDVQoKtYAJxviuVZpI542wNH5jqS-tB7WnkkJaYx4dORlqr5PWsUundDNB1v_Kk9f"> God’s way to make Christ everything to His people involves righteousness, redemption, and the divine life. We have seen that Christ is made God’s righteousness to us. Now we need to see that this requires redemption. Without redemption Christ cannot be made righteousness to us. Apart from redemption God cannot give us anything. The basis on which the divine life is given to us is the redemption of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="-pRB9mox5gbAiy54pk53nHIwTTIc6bpB4xUJfSdQ6xeX6HdnYwDRmDkjXUbgVeafR"> Redemption is implied in Jeremiah’s prophecy concerning the new covenant in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56025" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33-34">31:33 and 34</span>. The last part of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56026" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:34">verse 34</span> says, “I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.” According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56027" data-verses="Ephesians 1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>, forgiveness is equal to redemption. This verse says, “In whom [Christ] we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses.” Here redemption and forgiveness are in apposition, indicating that they refer to the same thing. This is our ground for saying that redemption is implied in the word regarding forgiveness in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56028" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:34">Jeremiah 31:34</span>. God, in the new covenant, will forgive our iniquity. This is a matter of redemption. </p>
<p data-content-id="pHsKydqmaUhKn8rgfVm1M8oo0N3II37ZzNFmr3RCCcsZHdUu9aL5uGPm6fn0J985I"> God’s way to make Christ everything to His elect is by the way of righteousness and by the way of redemption. It is also by the way of the divine life. The divine life is given on the basis of Christ’s redemption through God’s justification, which is based on His righteousness. Life implies the law of life with its ability and capacity. These three matters—righteousness, redemption, and life—are fully developed in the New Testament. Although the way in which God makes Christ everything to us is developed in the New Testament, it is already revealed intrinsically in the book of Jeremiah. This means that in Jeremiah we see something of the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="v9rp0k517gBAnKqJ4IffO1djjdy6dxK5GywUqR5BgQleELuBpPD2r6-rllXVDLrSQ"> Apparently Jeremiah is a book concerned with Israel’s sin and wickedness and with God’s chastisement of Israel. Actually this is not the case. The book of Jeremiah, like the Bible as a whole, was not written for this purpose. The Bible, including the book of Jeremiah, was written for God’s economy. It was written to show us that God wants to be increased, to be enlarged, in order to have a fullness for the expression of Himself. Since this is the subject and content of the entire Bible, why should the subject and content of <span class="pg" data-page-id="15" id="15">[15]</span> Jeremiah be different? The basic element of the divine word in Jeremiah is not Israel’s sin and God’s chastisement; the basic element is God’s economy. This is a crucial matter that we all need to see. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="W3GVF7G-6II3g7lt4vzwS62mCtR11Xzb_MriHDTu-Cy9-nxliNf9ii5OP4HfFOY_O">THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION<br/>OF THE REVELATION IN THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH</h2><p data-content-id="2lER8AxxwspItTyYMiU6yp_bx3hx0V8kzSaDraltnXMVuU-joBfQBYpnzbodXQ886"> Finally, I would like to ask a third question: What is the ultimate consummation, the ultimate issue, of the revelation in the book of Jeremiah? The ultimate consummation of the divine revelation in this book is the New Jerusalem. We know this by the fact that the entire Bible consummates in the New Jerusalem. </p>

The goal of this enjoyment is to produce the church as God’s increase, God’s enlargement, to be God’s fullness for His expression. This is the heart’s desire, the good pleasure (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56040" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5">Eph. 1:5</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56041" data-verses="Ephesians 1:9">9</span>), of God in His economy. The full development of this thought is in the New Testament, but it is sown as a seed in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56042" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">Jeremiah 2:13</span>. <span class="pg" data-page-id="18" id="18">[18]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="OGG-FY948JCc0HrjqHM0n5u5Xvmlayu1t3Rzs7YGi5Rsn8GmrQSi5Ks_NPFDtTRcK"> God’s economy is to dispense Himself as the living water to produce His increase, His enlargement, to be His expression. This thought is developed in the writings of John. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56043" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56044" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span> we see that the Word, which was God, became flesh, full of grace and reality. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56045" data-verses="John 1:16">Verse 16</span> goes on to say, “For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56046" data-verses="John 4:1">chapter four</span> of John the Lord Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman concerning living water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56047" data-verses="John 4:10">vv. 10</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56048" data-verses="John 4:14">14</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56049" data-verses="John 7:38">John 7:38</span> He said, “He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56050" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> we have a vision of the New Jerusalem, which is a great sign of God’s increase for His expression. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56051" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Revelation 22:1 and 2</span> show us that in the New Jerusalem the river of life flows and that in this river grows the tree of life as the life supply to support and sustain the entire city. What we have in the writings of John is surely the growth of the seed sown in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56052" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">Jeremiah 2:13</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="4RV9VV4Mn4S9URwdDF3r82JjMWXlYZNpnncuPZB9ytI-xHUsBjp-XFeSekOIs7VuD"> This thought is strengthened by Paul’s writings. For example, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56053" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span> says, “In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body...and were all given to drink one Spirit.” To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and to be lost in Him; to drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and to have our being saturated with Him. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56054" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:3-4">1 Corinthians 10:3 and 4</span> Paul, using the Old Testament types, speaks not only of drinking but also of eating. “All ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.” The spiritual food refers to manna (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56055" data-verses="Exodus 16:14-18">Exo. 16:14-18</span>), typifying Christ as our daily life supply; the spiritual drink refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56056" data-verses="Exodus 17:6">Exo. 17:6</span>), typifying the Spirit, who flowed out of the crucified and resurrected Christ as our all-inclusive drink. Our drinking of God as the living water is for the church as His increase; our drinking is for the producing of His enlargement, His fullness, for His expression. </p>

This negative thing indicates that Israel, like Adam in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56058" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span>, had become fallen. Adam fell by forsaking the tree of life and turning to another tree—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Israel fell by forsaking God as the fountain of living waters and turning to a source other than God. This source is signified by the cisterns, which Israel labored to hew out for themselves. </p>
<p data-content-id="GavFbAHZwy2tSsSfbn19MOiYON0IhKNdN7EMYKvswdWTwhcWqG65aQqo-Zv3gW-TT"> God was burdened that Israel would drink Him to become His increase as His fullness that they might express Him. Israel should have drunk of God as the fountain of living waters, but instead they committed two evils. The first evil was to forsake God; the second evil was to hew out cisterns as another source. Those cisterns, however, were broken and could hold no water. This indicates that apart from God as the fountain of living waters, nothing can quench our thirst, nothing can satisfy us. Nothing apart from God Himself dispensed into us as living water can make us His increase for His expression. </p>

God’s elect may fail Him, but His compassions never fail; rather, they are new every morning. Because of His compassions, lovingkindness, and everlasting love, God would never give up His elect yet distracted people. </p>
<p data-content-id="EKTPt27qqN-F_WvBAInRg4lvbyafUPZUoqJ-qKrlak6Pmjc1nLvSgz6EgxzVMBvKF"> We should not think that we are better than Israel, and we should not read the Bible for others but for ourselves. Every book of the Bible has something to do with us. If we apply this principle, we will see that not only did Israel have idols, but we also have idols. Jeremiah said, “According to <span class="pg" data-page-id="20" id="20">[20]</span> the number of your cities / Are your gods, O Judah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56060" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:28">2:28</span>). Do we not also have idols in our daily life? Every day we offend God by worshipping idols. To treasure anything other than God is actually to worship an idol. Every day we treasure something other than God. We have idols, but God has compassions. We are evil, but God is compassionate. It is of His lovingkindness that we are not consumed. If it were not for God’s compassions, He would have given up on us long ago. But He has not given us up, for His compassions continue anew every day. His compassions keep us in His hand for His economy. </p>

This righteous Shoot is Christ incarnated to be the descendant of David. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56063" data-verses="Matthew 1:1">Matthew 1:1</span> Christ is called “the son of David.” He is the new branch, the new sprout, of David. As such a branch He is a righteous Shoot. From the time of His infancy, He has been altogether righteous. </p>
<p data-content-id="gXNDhKVKPDNG-PSy0ap2-aAjIvbFOp3E22wW4wcjBrQr3eBubnsiSZW6jjx_GhUd-"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56064" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:5">Jeremiah 23:5</span> tells us that Christ, the righteous Shoot, “will reign as King and act prudently.” This requires that He be in resurrection and ascension. If Christ were not in resurrection and ascension, He could not be the King. The word <em>King</em> in this verse therefore implies Christ’s resurrection and ascension. When Christ was a child, He could not be the King. But having passed through resurrection and entering into ascension, He is now the King of kings, the Lord of lords, and the Ruler of all the kings of the earth (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56065" data-verses="Revelation 17:14">Rev. 17:14</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56066" data-verses="Revelation 19:16">19:16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56067" data-verses="Revelation 1:5">1:5</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="21" id="21">[21]</span> Furthermore, in His resurrection and ascension, He acts prudently. </p>

Why does God desire to be the fountain of living waters for His elect people to drink that their thirst may be quenched and that they may be satisfied? God’s purpose in wanting to be the fountain of living waters for His elect to drink is that He would be increased and enlarged. Many Christians have not paid attention to this matter. Have you ever heard that God wants to be enlarged? When some hear this, they say, “How can God be enlarged? Is He not already large enough? It is blasphemy to say that God can be enlarged.” Concerning this matter of God’s enlargement, let us come back to the Bible and see what the Bible says. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="R3DAAp7LuTzr5QTywgPF9-39v-_LRBt-S7dzSfACjSpocGvQ54bAeboJIZavqJ8PK">God as the Satisfying Water to His Elect</h2><p data-content-id="sBp2800gseLZdTSAlTlwLce6d5uOUQ-V_g88lCODvCMQJVBjVieMZgQ8G6knVI1QC"> In the Bible there is the thought that God is the satisfying water to His elect. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56090" data-verses="Psalms 36:8-9">Psalm 36:8-9a</span> says, “They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life.” Here <em>fatness</em> means food, or the life supply, and the river is the river of life. In typology the fatness of God’s house refers to the rich produce of the good land. All <span class="pg" data-page-id="26" id="26">[26]</span> the riches that were offered to God became the fatness of His house. As we enjoy this fatness, we drink of the river of life, the river of God’s pleasures. </p>
<p data-content-id="-pRB9mox5gbAiy54pk53nHIoTTI86bpB4xUJfSdQ6xeX6HdnYwDRmDkjXUbgVeafR"> In the Bible there are a number of places where God is signified by a river. The first is in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56091" data-verses="Genesis 2:10-14">Genesis 2:10-14</span>. God created man in His own image and then placed him in the garden of Eden in front of the tree of life. The tree of life is first mentioned in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56092" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">verse 9</span>. Then <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56093" data-verses="Genesis 2:10">verse 10</span> goes on to say, “A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.” This river, therefore, is closely related to the tree of life. Another verse which speaks of a river is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56094" data-verses="Psalms 46:4">Psalm 46:4</span>. “There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God.” <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56095" data-verses="Ezekiel 47:1">Ezekiel 47</span> tells of the prophet’s vision of a river flowing out of the temple of God. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56096" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span> the Lord Jesus speaks of living water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56097" data-verses="John 4:10">v. 10</span>) and of a spring of water gushing up into eternal life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56098" data-verses="John 4:14">v. 14</span>); and in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56099" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span>, He speaks of rivers of living water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56100" data-verses="John 7:38">v. 38</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56101" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span> we have Paul’s word about spiritual drink.

What is God’s economy? God’s economy is to have an expression of Himself. God does not want to express Himself by Himself alone; rather, He wants to express Himself through His counterpart. For this reason, God created man and put him in the garden of Eden. Eventually, God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56103" data-verses="Genesis 2:18">Gen. 2:18a</span>). In typology this signifies that it is not good for God to be alone. This indicates that the first husband mentioned in the Bible was not a human being but God. Who is His counterpart? Adam, who was created in God’s image, was to be God’s counterpart. In order to be God’s counterpart, Adam had to drink of God, to receive God into him that he might have the divine life with the divine nature and the divine element in order to <span class="pg" data-page-id="27" id="27">[27]</span> be divine to match God. Because God, the Husband, is divine, the wife, His counterpart, should also be divine that she might match Him. Since it was not good for the man to be alone, God builded from Adam’s rib a woman to match him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56104" data-verses="Genesis 2:21-23">Gen. 2:21-23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="W3GVF7G-6II3g7lt4vzwS62-Cth91Xzb_MriHDTu-Cy9-nxliNf9ii5OP4HfFOY_O"> I would emphasize the fact that God needs to be the fountain of living waters to His elect because He has an economy, and His economy is to produce a counterpart, a bride, for Himself. The purpose of God’s economy is that God would no longer be alone but would have a wife to be His increase, His enlargement, and thus to match Him as the Husband. This is the significance of the word <em>increase</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56105" data-verses="John 3:30">John 3:30</span>. In this verse John the Baptist, speaking of Christ, says, “He must increase.” In the previous verse John had said, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom.” The increase in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56106" data-verses="John 3:30">verse 30</span> is the bride in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56107" data-verses="John 3:29">verse 29</span>. The Bridegroom is Christ, and the bride is His increase, His enlargement. Just as Eve was the increase of Adam, being built from Adam’s rib, so God’s elect as the bride are the increase of Christ as the Bridegroom. </p>

This forsaking of God began in the garden of Eden. Eve, the wife of Adam, was not faithful to God but was seduced by the serpent to turn from God to Satan, symbolized by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Through Eve Adam also was seduced and ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. In this way man turned away from God to idols. Every branch of the tree of knowledge is an idol. Whatever we possess, and even whatever we are, can be an idol. Israel was evil and unfaithful to God in forsaking God for idols. In the matter of such unfaithfulness to God, we are the same as Israel. </p>

When you sing this hymn, how do you understand the word <em>faithfulness?</em> If you understand God’s faithfulness in a natural way, you may think that He is faithful primarily in the matter of material provisions or physical blessings. When some say that God is faithful, they mean that He is faithful to take care of their material needs. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56109" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:9">1 Corinthians 1:9</span> Paul says, “God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” God is faithful in this matter, but He may not be faithful to provide you a large house or a well-paying job. I would not deny the fact that God is faithful in caring for our welfare. My point is that God’s faithfulness is not according to our natural understanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="HxbxQoIuGW5J3nC3vS7RQ5Z7aEaWnlViRTwQ0nltH0QqH5KMg8o8FS80UCDTC5N5U"> Consider the sufferings of the apostle Paul. He was called, commissioned, burdened, and sent by God, but wherever he went he had troubles. For example, as soon as he began to preach Christ, he began to suffer persecution. He even had to escape from Damascus by being lowered down the wall in a basket. Does this mean that God was not faithful to Paul? No, it means that God’s faithfulness is not according to our natural understanding. </p>
<p data-content-id="XNOHFqn3tTpHB-SEADN6JO5Xsd7tMKzJ-pw_IqoSFHXKEqAj_s4YABI_Y1eaeKgSP"> When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we might have expected to have peace and blessing. But instead we might have had many troubles and might have lost our security, our health, or our possessions. When some Christians experience such things, they may question God’s faithfulness and ask why He did not prevent hardships from happening to them. </p>

Jeremiah seemed to be saying, “Lord, how can I be a prophet? I do not know how to speak!” Many of the saints in the Lord’s recovery today offer such an excuse for not functioning in the church meetings. If they are encouraged to prophesy in the meetings, they may say that they do not know how to speak. </p>

He felt that he was too young to be a prophet. Some of the new ones among us may have the same feeling about speaking for the Lord. To such a person God would say, “You are not too young. As long as you have been born of Me and baptized, you are not too young to speak for Me.” God does not regard as legitimate the excuse that we do not know how to speak or the excuse that we are too young. </p>

They mean nothing. I am with you, and no one is stronger than I or greater than I.” </p>

We do not know and we cannot explain this. We only know that Jeremiah was in fact touched on his mouth by Jehovah’s hand. </p>

Jehovah said to him, “Behold, I have put My words in your mouth” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56125" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:9">v. 9b</span>). This enabled the prophet to speak for Him. The principle is the same with us today. When God puts His words into us, we have much to speak for Him. </p>

On the negative side there was to be the plucking up, the breaking down, the destroying, and the tearing down; on the positive side there was to be the building up and the planting. Here we are reminded of the two meanings of Jeremiah’s name: “Jehovah exalts” and “Jehovah tears down.” The plucking up, the breaking down, and the destroying are Jehovah’s tearing down. The building up and the planting are Jehovah’s exalting. Surely every negative thing—everything of Satan, sin, and the world—must be torn down. Along with this we have Jehovah’s building up and His planting, both of which involve His word. God’s word is a building up of Christ and a planting of Christ. This is for the exalting of Christ. </p>

<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="m-9_FZSSONBzYxqNbcHQ1ADlSXQPimxecKNlJ7BbA5XVzfunX5H58YZ8zzGNG7UoU">1. The Rod of an Almond Tree</h2><p data-content-id="ZiXhEknxjzatvebIYmZYSRgChVB4FJ6fk2B32pao_RfIz8F6WkGgFhS25xH7AYBWE"> The first vision was of the rod of an almond tree. “Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, I see the rod of an almond tree. And <span class="pg" data-page-id="36" id="36">[36]</span> Jehovah said to me, You have seen well, for I am watching over My word to perform it” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56128" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). The Hebrew word for <em>watch</em> is the root of the word for <em>almond.</em> Here the rod of an almond tree signifies that God was watching over His word (the word of punishment) to perform it. </p>
<p data-content-id="AQQB_dTYue1Rhzg91v0ifNM795HXb0ZfZqyeUinh9hQWuj3H3gR5Pv0fS5qcnsAWW"> Moses had warned Israel that if they did not obey the voice of Jehovah their God, they would be cursed in every way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56129" data-verses="Deuteronomy 28:15-68">Deut. 28:15-68</span>). For example, Moses said, “Your heaven, which is above your head, will be brass, and the land, which is under you, iron. Jehovah will make the rain of your land powder and dust” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56130" data-verses="Deuteronomy 28:23-24">vv. 23-24a</span>). After Moses spoke these words, God sent prophets to the people of Israel to remind them to keep His word. However, Israel did not obey God’s word. Therefore, at Jeremiah’s time, many centuries after the time of Moses, God came to watch over His word in order to fulfill it, that is, to execute His word to punish Israel. </p>

And I said, I see a boiling pot, and it is facing away from the north. And Jehovah said to me, Out of the north evil will be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56131" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:13-14">Jer. 1:13-14</span>). Here the word <em>north</em> refers especially to Babylon, and the word <em>evil</em> refers not to sinful things but to calamities. Thus, the boiling pot facing away from the north signifies that out of the north calamities would be let loose (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56132" data-verses="Jeremiah 4:6">4:6b</span>) upon all the inhabitants of the land of Israel. Prior to this time, the calamities had been restricted. But now God will call all the families from the kingdoms of the earth, and they will come and set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem and against all its walls round about and against all the cities of Judah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56133" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:15">1:15</span>). In this way Jehovah will utter His judgment on Israel concerning all their wickedness—their forsaking Him, offering sacrifices to other gods, and worshipping the work of their own hands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56134" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:16">v. 16</span>). Because of all these things, God was coming in to punish Israel. <span class="pg" data-page-id="37" id="37">[37]</span> </p>

This timid person was given a charge by Jehovah. In the first part of this charge, God said to him, “You therefore gird up your loins, and rise up and speak to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed before them, lest I dismay you in their presence” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56136" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:17">v. 17</span>). If Jeremiah had been dismayed before the people, God would have dismayed him. </p>
<p data-content-id="W3GVF7G-6II3g7lt4vzwS626Csx11Xzb_MriHDTu-Cy9-nxliNf9ii5OP4HfFOY_O"> Today, in the matter of functioning in the church meetings, many saints are dismayed. But we should not be dismayed by anyone, and we should not be afraid of anyone. No matter who is present in the meeting, we should not be dismayed. Rather, we should function to speak for the Lord. </p>

Of course, the ark was a type of Christ as the embodiment of God Jehovah. However, they became superstitious concerning the ark, and it became for them a kind of idol. They had no heart for God, yet they treasured the ark. Eventually, this ark did not help them or fight for them. They were defeated and captured, and the ark also was captured (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56188" data-verses="1Samuel 4:10-11">1 Sam. 4:10-11</span>). In their view God was defeated.

They treasure the Bible, yet they may care little for the very God revealed in the Bible. Such Christians have made the Bible something separate from God, when actually the Bible should be one with God. Today is a time of degradation, but a time will come when Christ, the embodiment of God, will be with us, and we will have no need for the Bible. Likewise, when Israel is revived, no one will care for the ark because Christ will be present with Israel and reign in Jerusalem. </p>

However, the Babylonians would harvest the “grapes” from the “vine” of Israel, and then come again to glean the vine thoroughly. This means that they would come more than once to take the people captive. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gXNDhKVKPDNG-PSy0ap2-aALIuftOp3E22wW4wcjBrQr3eBubnsiSZW6jjx_GhUd-">ISRAEL’S HISTORY</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="eK3U6TivBGpZoPSpFXbBpkdLNmy01kwZj3aus0PDhekjUWjEg8WYJwsu2zhwfFo9Q">In Egypt and in the Wilderness </h2>
<p data-content-id="54BtkgWnr1OFzxnK-WTO8UcOROeoNJkcAKfLdwJt4vlukEyz_ZCCopi7yupUc-Fah"> Israel was in Egypt under the yoke of the Egyptians and the tyranny of Pharaoh. God sent Moses to release them from this yoke and tyranny and bring them out of Egypt into the wilderness to Mount Sinai. At Mount Sinai the heavens were opened to Israel, and God gave them the revelation concerning the tabernacle and its utensils. He also gave them the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, telling them how to worship God and giving them detailed instructions regarding how to eat, dress, and conduct themselves. From that time Israel began to be a people under the divine revelation in every way. </p>
<p data-content-id="N1jAqv5oTUZsiM67xdhtjxASY-cl9pQqhzZJPgCwJVdPuEugqmvQSn33gGXqF_crO"> In the beginning Israel obeyed the divine revelation somewhat. They built the tabernacle according to the revelation they received, and, in keeping with this revelation, they also began to worship God by means of the priesthood and the sacrifices. However, as they were traveling in the wilderness, they began to degrade from the revelation they had received from God through Moses. The book of Numbers records many cases of their degradation from God’s law, that is, from God’s revelation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> </p>

This repetition is found in the book of Deuteronomy. (The word <em>Deuteronomy</em> means “second law” and thus signifies a respeaking of the divine law.) In this repetition Moses charged them especially that when they entered the good land, they were to tear down the idols, destroy the places of idol worship, and slaughter the idol worshippers. For example, concerning the idol worshippers Moses commanded Israel, saying, “You shall utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor shall you show them any favor....But you shall deal with them in this way: their altars you shall tear down, their pillars you shall shatter, their Asherim you shall hew down, and their idols you shall burn with fire” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56259" data-verses="Deuteronomy 7:2">Deut. 7:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56260" data-verses="Deuteronomy 7:5">5</span>). </p>

Instead, they spared them and did not wipe them out. As a result, Israel could not fully possess the good land. </p>
<p data-content-id="w7B2ly3akD68nMBqEd7c93zVPyTVxA198MFRr87lPFUoeqGN4RurJgqOvdEfsYiU-"> Because Israel spared the idol worshippers, there was war again and again between Israel and the people in the land. This war is described in the book of Judges. The judges were the strong ones, the leading ones, who fought for Israel against the idol worshippers. After the period of the judges, David, who was brought in by Samuel, fought all the inhabitants of the land and gained nearly the entire land. Although David was not allowed to build the temple, he received the design of the temple from God and prepared the materials and the temple site on Mount Moriah, the place where Abraham offered Isaac (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56261" data-verses="1Chronicles 28:11-12">1 Chron. 28:11-12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56262" data-verses="1Chronicles 28:19">19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56263" data-verses="1Chronicles 29:1-2">29:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56264" data-verses="1Chronicles 21:18-26">21:18-26</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56265" data-verses="2Chronicles 3:1">2 Chron. 3:1</span>). Following the design which his father received from God, Solomon, David’s son, built the temple in approximately 1000 B.C. That was the highlight of the nation of Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="LydA6pgW62hGE3L5Yo603BrZCCME_oJx7RQ3MfY2dPGEnkNVqPXUHGsEyrbjQDODr"> Solomon was a wise king. He was so wise that the queen of Sheba visited him in order to prove his wisdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56266" data-verses="2Chronicles 9:1-12">2 Chron. 9:1-12</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span>). However, Solomon did not remain in a good spiritual condition for his entire life. In his old age he was led by his many heathen wives to worship idols (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56267" data-verses="1Kings 11:1-8">1 Kings 11:1-8</span>). He took the lead to depart from God and to degrade from His revelation. Nearly all of Solomon’s descendants continued his apostasy. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="m-9_FZSSONBzYxqNbcHQ1ADVSXwfimxecKNlJ7BbA5XVzfunX5H58YZ8zzGNG7UoU">In the Time of Jeremiah</h2><p data-content-id="ZiXhEknxjzatvebIYmZYSRgyhVhoFJ6fk2B32pao_RfIz8F6WkGgFhS25xH7AYBWE"> This apostasy continued until the time when Jeremiah was charged by God to prophesy. Jeremiah began to prophesy in 629 B.C., twenty-three years before Jerusalem was captured by Nebuchadnezzar. God charged Jeremiah to condemn Israel’s sins in forsaking God and becoming wicked in their conduct. They had forsaken God, the fountain of living waters, and, hewing out broken cisterns, they had turned to idols and were worshipping them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56268" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">Jer. 2:13</span>). Furthermore, society was filled with murder, fornication, greed, lying, and stealing. Even the king was greedy, for, as we will see, he commanded the people to build him a palace but did not pay them for their labor. The people were not faithful either to God or to one another. For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56269" data-verses="Jeremiah 5:7-8">5:7 and 8</span> Jehovah says, “Why should I pardon you? / Your children have forsaken Me / And sworn by those who are not gods. / When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery / And trooped to the house of harlots. / Like well-fed horses they roam about, / Each one neighing after his neighbor’s wife.” </p>
<p data-content-id="AQQB_dTYue1Rhzg91v0ifNML95nnb0ZfZqyeUinh9hQWuj3H3gR5Pv0fS5qcnsAWW"> Before the time of Jeremiah, Isaiah prophesied against Israel, saying that Israel had become like Sodom and Gomorrah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56270" data-verses="Isaiah 1:9-10">Isa. 1:9-10</span>). However, Israel did not change but continued in her wickedness until Jeremiah’s time. Nevertheless, through Jeremiah God spoke to Israel as her loving, sympathetic, and compassionate Husband, saying that He remembered the love of her bridal days (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56271" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:2">Jer. 2:2</span>). God sighed over Israel and longed for her to return to Him. Israel had forsaken Him as the unique Husband and had gone to many other husbands. Moreover, the people were evil to one another, killing, fornicating, lying, and stealing. </p>
<p data-content-id="F0z9H8uW6AZFrBLBWfOtEbdBqcM4ESJMtyqly6gCslvW9uY3DyGu4FsQmX5vNfxqw"> Israel was so corrupt that it was difficult for God to find a prophet to speak for Him. The princes, priests, and prophets were all corrupt. Where could God find a faithful, honest <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> prophet? Unable to find such a prophet in Jerusalem, God went to the city of Anathoth in the land of the small tribe of Benjamin, and there He called a young man named Jeremiah and commissioned him to speak for Him. When Jeremiah excused himself by saying that he was a youth and that he did not know how to speak, Jehovah said to him, “Do not say, I am a youth; / For everywhere I send you, you shall go; / And everything I command you, you shall speak. / Do not be afraid of their faces, / For I am with you to deliver you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56272" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:7-8">1:7-8</span>). Jehovah went on to say that He would make Jeremiah into a fortified city, into an iron pillar, and into walls of brass against the whole land. The kings, princes, priests, and people would fight against him, but they would not prevail against him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56273" data-verses="Jeremiah 1:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>). Those who fought against Jeremiah were actually fighting against Jehovah. He was Jehovah’s one-person army. No one would defeat him because Jehovah was with him. Thus, Jeremiah could not escape God’s commission but was constrained to accept it. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="CPl51KuiUuVRd63WzIYRZqixPGDSELyPmm04MAeFUnbViUT5NigWropYLlUPwqHsA">THE SUNSET OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="PDVQoKtYAJxviuVZpI542wNr5jaK-tB7WnkkJaYx4dORlqr5PWsUundDNB1v_Kk9f"> As Jeremiah went forth to fulfill God’s commission, he spoke to the king, the princes, the priests, and to the people. Jeremiah told the king that he was sinful and that if he did not repent and return to God, he would be taken captive. He rebuked the princes and the rulers for deceiving the people and for wrongly taking things from them. He exposed the prophets for prophesying falsely and the priests for ruling by their own authority and not by the divine revelation. He told the people that they were not executing justice or seeking faithfulness. Rather, they were treating the needy ones unjustly. Instead of heeding Jeremiah’s word, they hated him and even put him in prison. The priests arrested Jeremiah and handed him over to the princes, who then cast him into prison. This indicates that Israel had no regard for God’s law, for His revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="-pRB9mox5gbAiy54pk53nHIcTT406bpB4xUJfSdQ6xeX6HdnYwDRmDkjXUbgVeafR"> At that time Israel was in the sunset of the divine revelation. When Israel was at Mount Sinai, that was the dawn of the divine revelation. That was the time of sunrise. But afterward, concerning the divine revelation, Israel was in a situation of decline. Eventually, by the time of Jeremiah, <span class="pg" data-page-id="65" id="65">[65]</span> Israel was in the sunset. They had given up everything concerning God and His revelation, and eventually they came to be in a dark night. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="pHsKydqmaUhKn8rgfVm1M8oE0NHgI37ZzNFmr3RCCcsZHdUu9aL5uGPm6fn0J985I">Jehovah the Husband<br/>Chastising Israel the Unfaithful Wife</h2><p data-content-id="v9rp0k517gBAnKqJ4IffO1dPjdyqdxK5GywUqR5BgQleELuBpPD2r6-rllXVDLrSQ"> Israel’s situation forced God to chastise them, to punish them. When God chastised Israel, He regarded Himself as the Husband and Israel as the wife who had fallen into fornication. For this reason, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56274" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:1">chapters two through six</span> God’s tone in rebuking Israel is that of a husband speaking to an unfaithful wife. </p>

It is very important that we have this view when we read the book of Jeremiah. Otherwise, we will not have a clear and proper understanding of Jeremiah’s writing. Thus, in this message I am burdened to give a word regarding God’s economy with His dispensing in the book of Jeremiah. </p>

This indicates that the New Jerusalem is God’s goal. The vision of the New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the Bible, which has one thousand one hundred eighty-nine chapters. All the books of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, are related in some way to the New Jerusalem as God’s goal. However, because the Bible speaks of so many other things, in our reading of the Word we may easily be distracted and not see God’s goal. In His wisdom, God does not directly say in the Scriptures that His goal is to have the New Jerusalem. Instead, knowing that the New Jerusalem is too wonderful for us to imagine, He reveals this matter by using the Bible with its plain words, stories, histories, types, figures, and shadows. By all these different means, He reveals His thought concerning the New Jerusalem and depicts the various aspects of the New Jerusalem. <span class="pg" data-page-id="82" id="82">[82]</span> </p>

God’s aim in His economy is to have a group of human beings who have His life and nature inwardly and His image and likeness outwardly. This group of people is a corporate entity, the Body of Christ, to be one with Him and live Him for His corporate expression. As God is expressed not only by the Body but also through the Body, He is glorified. When He is glorified, His people are also glorified in His glorification. In this way God and man are one in glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="GavFbAHZwy2tSsSfbn19MOycON0YhKNdN7EMYKvswdWTwhcWqG65aQqo-Zv3gW-TT"> In this oneness we, God’s people, are not separate from God, but we definitely remain distinct from Him. We are one with God in life, in nature, in element, in essence, and in constitution. We are also one with Him in purpose, goal, image, and likeness. Nevertheless, no matter how much we are one with God, we do not share His Godhead and will never share it. Man remains man, and God remains God. Yes, in the incarnation of Christ, God became a man, but He did not give up His Godhead. Rather, He has reserved and preserved the Godhead for Himself alone. Thus, man is still limited, and God still possesses the unique Godhead. </p>
<p data-content-id="cOvD4v-Ua1QyiUboehqxb83GWfVi4w0WjZPfZSG04pLt2KTqjSTwdGH6tunLfFX2Z"> The group of human beings who are one with God in every way except in the Godhead is symbolized, signified, depicted, and portrayed by a wonderful, holy city—the New Jerusalem. We need to keep this vision before us as we come to the book of Jeremiah. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="YPnJAtwqd1Hhbr5Ylak7V0UMwGhvWmxU0Dzx1ilygm_OB2v0Ozy0V8PkcAE9E1G2x">GOD PRESENTING HIMSELF<br/>TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL<br/>AS A FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATERS</h2><p data-content-id="EKTPt27qqN-F_WvBAInRg41rbyaPUPZUoqJ-qKrlak6Pmjc1nLvSgz6EgxzVMBvKF"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56376" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">Jeremiah 2:13</span> we have the first crucial matter in this book concerning God’s economy. In this verse God, through the prophet, presents Himself to the children of Israel as a fountain of living waters. In principle, God did the same thing in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56377" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, after the creation of man. God did not say to man, “You must know that I am your Creator. Remember that you are My creature and that you should be holy and loving, just as I am.” Instead of giving such a charge to man, God <span class="pg" data-page-id="83" id="83">[83]</span> placed him in a garden, in front of two trees—the tree of life, which signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56378" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>). Then God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56379" data-verses="Genesis 2:16-17">vv. 16-17</span>). This indicates that God wanted man to partake of Himself as signified by the tree of life. Immediately after the first mention of the tree of life, we are told that “a river went out of Eden to water the garden” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56380" data-verses="Genesis 2:10">v. 10</span>). It is significant that the last chapter of the Bible also speaks of the tree of life and the river of water of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56381" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Rev. 22:1-2</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="DmmIANvlEKFtJh61GaXU8jjCympiGToEqAFPhhGAJVMQOx8FlApR50x7mhv3SQtTa"> The picture in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56382" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> of the tree of life and the river indicates that God is both the tree of life and the living water for man’s existence. What God desires of man is that man would eat of Him as the tree of life and drink of Him as the water of life. Through our eating and drinking of Him, God is able to dispense Himself into us as our life and our life supply. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="S6RHs2MncWvor0QDq8uvg60tgXhF8JWrAC56dNTnFufpBbm4uq54a8wIPJG0xfP0T">AN ABSTRACT OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</h2><p data-content-id="gXNDhKVKPDNG-PSy0ap2-aQnIvrdOp3E22wW4wcjBrQr3eBubnsiSZW6jjx_GhUd-"> As I have been carrying out the life-study of the Scriptures, I have sometimes pointed out that the particular book we were studying is an abstract of the Bible. The reason I say this is that all the books of the Bible are concerned with the same thing. Thus, now I wish to say about Jeremiah what I have said about other books: The book of Jeremiah is an abstract of the entire Bible. We have already seen that the book of Jeremiah is an abstract of the Bible in the sense that it presents God as the fountain of living waters. Let us now go on to consider another way in which this book is an abstract of the Scriptures. </p>
<p data-content-id="eK3U6TivBGpZoPSpFXbBpkNnNnWA1kwZj3aus0PDhekjUWjEg8WYJwsu2zhwfFo9Q"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56383" data-verses="Genesis 3:1">Genesis 3</span> the devil appeared in the form of a serpent, and both Adam and Eve were seduced by him to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In Jeremiah the serpent also comes in to distract God’s people from the tree of life to the tree of knowledge. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56384" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">Jeremiah 2:13</span> says, “My people have committed two evils: / They have forsaken <span class="pg" data-page-id="84" id="84">[84]</span> Me, / The fountain of living waters, / To hew out for themselves cisterns, / Broken cisterns, / Which hold no water.” This tells us that Israel had been distracted from the tree of life to the tree of knowledge, from the fountain of living waters to the idols (the cisterns). The children of Israel might have said, “We are not worshipping idols—we are hewing out cisterns.” They did not realize, however, that by hewing out cisterns they were turning to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. My point here is that in Jeremiah we can see the two trees. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56385" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:1">Chapters two through ten</span> show us the same two trees that were in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56386" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>. In these chapters of Jeremiah, God seemed to be saying, “Foolish people! Why do you not come to Me? Why do you not partake of Me as the tree of life? Why do you go to the other tree, to the idols?” By turning to the other tree, Israel had forsaken God and His law. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="54BtkgWnr1OFzxnK-WTO8UMiRMKgNJkcAKfLdwJt4vlukEyz_ZCCopi7yupUc-Fah">A WORD CONCERNING THE LAW</h2><p data-content-id="N1jAqv5oTUZsiM67xdhtjxQ-Y8Yp9pQqhzZJPgCwJVdPuEugqmvQSn33gGXqF_crO"> At this juncture I would like to say a word concerning the law of God. Paul tells us that the law was not a part of God’s original purpose. Originally, God did not intend to give us the law. Why, then, was it given? Why did God come in to give the law? In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56387" data-verses="Galatians 3:19">Galatians 3:19</span> Paul explains that the law “was added because of the transgressions.” This means that after God presented His purpose to man, man did not accept God and His purpose but instead began to do things according to himself. For this reason, God came in to add the law. </p>
<p data-content-id="tZuu6-ZsQvsngbu5uCIxm93z1ZFXyCrNhfC62kC3lx-DhC-UbaDxK6iX5Dah_P9Ma"> Although the law is something added, it nevertheless has a positive function. The positive function of the law is to present a portrait of God. In the Ten Commandments we see a picture of what God is. The first five commandments are based on Jehovah God’s uniqueness and jealousy, and the last five commandments are based on Jehovah God’s attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. By using the law to present a picture of Himself, God was indicating that He wanted His people to become His duplication. </p>

<p data-content-id="XNOHFqn3tTpHB-SEADN6JOpLsd7dMKzJ-pw_IqoSFHXKEqAj_s4YABI_Y1eaeKgSP"> It is significant that in the arrangement of the Ten Commandments, the commandment concerning honoring our parents, the fifth commandment, is ranked with the commandments regarding God and the keeping of the Sabbath. This indicates that, as children, we need to realize that our parents are our source, and as our source they should be considered God’s representatives. Thus, the commandment concerning honoring our parents is ranked with the first four commandments concerning God and His Sabbath. To disobey, dishonor, despise, and do evil to our parents means that we reject God. </p>

In these verses there are three parties: Jeremiah, his mother, and God. Jeremiah was disappointed and said to his mother, “Woe is me, my mother, because you bore me, / A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land. / I have not lent with interest, / Nor have they lent to me; / Yet everyone curses me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56506" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:10">v. 10</span>). Surely, no mother would be happy to hear such a word from her son. Whereas Jeremiah’s mother was silent, God came in to say something to him. <span class="pg" data-page-id="102" id="102">[102]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="qPEtYgsnw9DtC6P-ho1X_5gAebkAtjw99kVW4BEgCfblL041Oqy3UdOX5R1CMSJ7p"> I feel that it is very significant that as Jeremiah was speaking to his mother, God came in to speak to him. This indicates that God was always with Jeremiah. Wherever Jeremiah went, God was there with him. Whenever Jeremiah spoke, God was present to participate in the conversation. God was with Jeremiah even when he, in his disappointment, was talking to his mother. She might have been very happy about how God spoke to her son to encourage and strengthen him. </p>
<p data-content-id="yB54I3Z-wPZFRWis37JuAiW3dTQTJk4FPUR7_CvFFqaSXnCbOhjnjSopuViHa12KC"> In His speaking to Jeremiah, God spoke not as the Divine Being, as the mighty One, but almost as if He were a man, talking in a very human and personal way. According to the record of this book, as God dealt with His people, He often spoke to them in such a way. For instance, when He addressed Israel as His apostate wife and lovingly pleaded for her to return, He spoke in a human way. </p>
<p data-content-id="8XPZHdfo_xBvcKwjljmJJORFv_lKp8nfEvkJKYKizadJO2nJ4lfaNJTZ2qbaZw81A"> After Jeremiah told his mother that everyone was cursing him, Jehovah intervened and said to him, “Surely I will set you free for your good; / Indeed I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you / In a time of trouble and in a time of distress. / Can one break iron, / Iron from the north, or bronze? / Your wealth and your treasures / I will give as plunder without price, / And that for all your sins, / And within all your borders. / I will cause your enemies to bring it / Into a land which you do not know; / For a fire is kindled in My anger, / Which will burn against you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56507" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:11-14">vv. 11-14</span>). We need to pay attention to the pronouns <em>your</em> and <em>you</em> in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56508" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:13-14">verses 13 and 14</span>. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56509" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:13">verse 13</span> God refers to “your wealth” and “your treasures.” Whose wealth and treasures are these? They must be the wealth and treasures of Israel. However, God spoke this word not directly to Israel but to Jeremiah. Surely, the word <em>your</em> here includes the addressee. This means that God regarded Jeremiah the prophet as being one with Israel. Israel’s wealth and treasures were also Jeremiah’s wealth and treasures. This indicates that God considered the entire nation of Israel as one entity. Because Jeremiah was a part of this entity, when the wealth and treasures of Israel were given to their enemies, Jeremiah also became poor. The wealth and treasures of Israel, and also of Jeremiah, would <span class="pg" data-page-id="103" id="103">[103]</span> be brought to a land which they did not know. God had kindled a fire in His anger, which would burn against them. In this matter also, Jeremiah was included. </p>
<p data-content-id="0R8I3Wh5f40wZoXfJwUCOO0NRXqlvPfjOMW-c-oNYxLoUPy8yNdoAk3rFV5QErhyU"> Here we have not only three parties—Jeremiah, his mother, and Jehovah—but also a fourth party—Israel. God’s word was addressed to Jeremiah, but in speaking to Jeremiah He included the children of Israel together with Jeremiah. In speaking to Jeremiah and to Israel, God spoke as if He were a human being talking to other human beings. He spoke as one of the four parties participating in this conversation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="7FQUWw5nVhs57CauWe1z_dnT-1bKTWaGoQ0VcRlPqqhv3YCOFg70BWlUDx10WbT18">B. Jeremiah’s Petition for Jehovah’s Care<br/>and Jehovah’s Answer<br/>with a Further Commission to Him</h2><p data-content-id="_1Uw53Q8BnPZ6UV9p6rGA8nEa44jItX6hl4RPQlM89czdLHmlIdPqSLe5LQNTgYYg"> Jeremiah responded to Jehovah’s speaking by petitioning Him for His care. “O Jehovah, You know; / Remember me and visit me, / And avenge me of my persecutors. / In Your longsuffering do not take me away; / Know that for Your sake I bear reproach” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56510" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:15">v. 15</span>). By using the word <em>know</em> in his petition, Jeremiah seemed to be reminding God concerning his situation. Jeremiah’s petition indicates that no matter how strong and spiritual he might have been, he was still human. As he asked God to remember him and visit him, he seemed to be saying, “O Jehovah, do not forget me. Do not give me up. I need You to remember me, to visit me, and to avenge me of those who are persecuting me for Your sake.” </p>
<p data-content-id="BqZPFRLgw98kbSgb8Hi1c6p3nO3qJXxKB-kWDRhfxRZL2fylKlegCgma_JzeWmXPQ"> In particular, Jeremiah prayed that, in His longsuffering, Jehovah would not take him away. Jeremiah seemed to be saying, “Jehovah, You are a God who can suffer a long time. I ask that in Your longsuffering You do not allow my persecutors to kill me. You are kind and compassionate, and You may allow my persecutors to go on doing evil things for a long time. I ask that, during the time of Your longsuffering, You will not allow my persecutors to take my life.” </p>
<p data-content-id="xoS3aB8bggngik3368-UKccPQdacsWuhgTPcP2VSkcf8UGJT53JBHpp4ILIlnAQx8"> The next verse (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56511" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:16">v. 16</span>) is very unusual and does not seem to fit here. In this verse Jeremiah says, “Your words were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The joy and rejoicing of my heart, / For I am called by Your name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.” According to the entire revelation in <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> the Holy Bible, God’s words are good for us to eat, and we need to eat them. When we eat God’s words, His word becomes our heart’s joy and rejoicing. </p>
<p data-content-id="ryNgMdLLxGzNdPUZnHlJ-xJ8WK437cXZyI_bjltu4X1W1mcuvEgdbXrzjpYp62B4L"> In this verse Jeremiah says not only that he found and ate God’s words but also that he was called by Jehovah’s name. The Hebrew words translated “I am called by Your name” may also be rendered “Your name is called over me.” In either case, Jeremiah was saying that he belonged to Jehovah and was under His name. </p>
<p data-content-id="dA9g112R6wtwAVhAjoQ_6pM66Dnm-favTe84a2fkR6ZKnV1iXOelgVWn5GULkVdQV"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56512" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:17">verse 17</span> Jeremiah goes on to say, “I did not sit in the assembly of mockers, nor did I exult. / Because of Your hand I sat alone, / For You have filled me with indignation.” The word <em>mockers</em> here does not denote despisers but those who mock others by rejoicing in a light way. Such mockers were probably mocking Jeremiah, who did not exult and who was not happy. Furthermore, because Jehovah’s hand was upon Jeremiah, he sat alone. Jehovah’s hand held him down and constrained him to sit quietly and endure the mocking. Although Jeremiah was quiet, he was filled with indignation. It was impossible for him to have joy or to rejoice. </p>
<p data-content-id="QOcu1PTGsauWKCuTN-ZLs8zA-oN29Yo4bls-LboSR19ZNV2y0006XK5EQhWcOdpBP"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56513" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:17">Verse 17</span> depicts Jeremiah’s suffering. Because of his suffering and disappointment, he said to his mother, “Woe is me.” She was silent, but Jehovah talked with Jeremiah to encourage and strengthen him. I cannot tell from Jeremiah’s answer whether he accepted or rejected God’s encouragement. It seems that God spoke in one way according to His feeling and that Jeremiah responded in a different way according to his feeling. Jeremiah seemed to be saying to Jehovah, “I am not happy, and I am not rejoicing. I am suffering, and I am full of indignation because Your hand is upon me.” </p>
<p data-content-id="KO1Ppd7egl5MxDTzJ27MzdJvspMZuZube8axoy99zrV9Hfa79zsxHBf3C_6jMFB18"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56514" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:18">Verse 18</span> continues, “Why is my pain unceasing, / And my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? / Will You indeed be to me like a deceitful brook? / Like waters that fail?” The Hebrew word for <em>fail</em> literally means “are not sure.” Jeremiah had been hurt, wounded, and he made his complaint to God, asking Him if He would be like a deceitful brook or like waters that fail. </p>

Israel’s Inquiry concerning Their Sins<br/>That Caused Jehovah’s Visitation<br/>in the Great Evil against Them,<br/>and Jehovah’s Answer to Them</h2><p data-content-id="jTp05_l_BWl6m_8iwcy3BmGqTYXSd5UPPr4VP79Xb5RuhV_9p7EUmSfDxC8xdFqR5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56528" data-verses="Jeremiah 16:10-18">16:10-18</span> we have a record of Israel’s inquiry concerning their sins that caused Jehovah’s visitation in the great evil against them, and Jehovah’s answer to them. The people would ask why Jehovah has pronounced great evil against them, and they would ask what was their iniquity and what was their sin against Jehovah. When they inquired in this way, Jeremiah was to tell them that their fathers <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> forsook Him and went after other gods and that they have done more evil than their fathers. Therefore, Jehovah would cast them far away from this land into a land which they have not known (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56529" data-verses="Jeremiah 16:10-13">vv. 10-13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="TJLO-7sHzwGAeDeMbthOdEMLUP7vbsm1afQJxQDpw6mh3szmGbP-afzf3e7CVn9ps"> In answering the inquiry of the people, Jehovah also made a promise to them regarding their restoration. “Therefore behold, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when it will no longer be said, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, but, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of the north and from every land where He had driven them; for I will bring them back to their own land, which I gave to their fathers” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56530" data-verses="Jeremiah 16:14-15">vv. 14-15</span>). Jehovah would do this after He had recompensed double for their iniquity and their sin, because they had profaned His land and their abominations had filled His inheritance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56531" data-verses="Jeremiah 16:18">v. 18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="nSykSi8Dzkx7rlOQ5IL8DBOcSNimpBxQ7rXdM2NhxDABuQKCvwZmuRJM-oRKkO_v6"> The conversation in these verses is very human. The people inquired of God in a human way, and He responded also in a human way. In His response, He explained the reason for the great evil, the calamities, that had come upon them, and He promised to bring them back to the land. He would even send “fishermen” to catch them and “hunters” to hunt for them in order to gather them and restore them. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="6_R3gJree1Pm-zuQPbV_nii6Vsbv--FVF3H1lV9NyaB0DGVNuFYOPl6avpsgCRFWR">B. Jeremiah’s Praise to Jehovah<br/>and Jehovah’s Acknowledgment of His Praise</h2><p data-content-id="R3DAAp7LuTzr5QTywgPF9-n1v8r7RBt-S7dzSfACjSpocGvQ54bAeboJIZavqJ8PK"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56532" data-verses="Jeremiah 16:19-21">Verses 19 through 21</span> speak of Jeremiah’s praise to Jehovah and of Jehovah’s acknowledgment of his praise. In his praise Jeremiah said, “O Jehovah, my strength and my stronghold, / My refuge in the day of distress; / To You the nations come / From the ends of the earth and say, / Surely our fathers inherited falsehood / And vanity, in which there is no profit. / Shall a man make gods for himself, / Though they are no gods?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56533" data-verses="Jeremiah 16:19-20">vv. 19-20</span>). As Jeremiah praised Jehovah, he spoke to Him in a very human way. In His acknowledgment of Jeremiah’s praise, Jehovah said, “Therefore behold, I am causing them to know; / At this time I will cause them to know / My hand and My might, / And they will know that My name is Jehovah” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56534" data-verses="Jeremiah 16:21">v. 21</span>). Jehovah’s speaking here was also <span class="pg" data-page-id="111" id="111">[111]</span> quite human. The conversation recorded in these verses is much like a conversation between two human beings. </p>

Judah’s sin is written with an iron pen. With the point of a diamond, it is engraved on the tablet of their heart and on the horns of their altars. God will give their wealth and treasures as spoil, and they themselves will let go of their inheritance. Jehovah will cause them to serve their enemies in a land which they do not know, for they have kindled a fire in His anger which will burn forever. </p>

The Curse of Trusting in Man<br/>and the Blessing of Trusting in Jehovah</h2><p data-content-id="m-9_FZSSONBzYxqNbcHQ1ATpSXAHimxecKNlJ7BbA5XVzfunX5H58YZ8zzGNG7UoU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56536" data-verses="Jeremiah 17:5-8">Jeremiah 17:5-8</span> is a word about the curse of trusting in man and the blessing of trusting in Jehovah. Concerning the blessing of trusting in Jehovah, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56537" data-verses="Jeremiah 17:7-8">verses 7 and 8</span> say, “Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah / And whose trust Jehovah is. / And he will be like a tree planted by water, / Which sends out its roots by a stream, / And will not be afraid when heat comes; / For its leaves remain flourishing, / And it will not be anxious in the year of drought / And will not cease to bear fruit.” </p>
<p data-content-id="ZiXhEknxjzatvebIYmZYSRwOhVRwFJ6fk2B32pao_RfIz8F6WkGgFhS25xH7AYBWE"> These verses can be understood in two different ways—according to the natural understanding and according to God’s economy. According to the natural understanding, these verses seem to indicate only that if we trust in God, we will be blessed, mainly in a material way. However, the revelation here includes much more than this. According to God’s economy, the one who trusts in God is like a tree planted by water, signifying God as the fountain of living waters (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56538" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">2:13a</span>). The tree grows beside the river by absorbing all the riches of the water into it. This is a picture of God’s dispensing. In order to receive the divine dispensing, we as the trees must absorb God as the water. </p>
<p data-content-id="AQQB_dTYue1Rhzg91v0ifNc395XPb0ZfZqyeUinh9hQWuj3H3gR5Pv0fS5qcnsAWW"> The thought here is the same as that in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56539" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>, where Paul says, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.” The watering is for the tree’s absorbing, and the <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> absorbing is the receiving of God’s dispensing. The tree grows with God as the Supplier and the supply. The supply is the riches of the supplying God dispensed into us as the plants so that we may grow into God’s measure. Eventually, the plants and God, God and the plants, are one, having the same element, essence, constitution, and appearance. </p>
<p data-content-id="F0z9H8uW6AZFrBLBWfOtEbN9qc8QESJMtyqly6gCslvW9uY3DyGu4FsQmX5vNfxqw"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56540" data-verses="Jeremiah 17:7-8">Jeremiah 17:7 and 8</span> are not concerned merely with such a shallow matter as trusting in God to receive material blessings. Actually these verses refer to God’s economy carried out by His dispensing. God is the living water to be dispensed into our being in order to become our very constituent. We all need to see the crucial significance of absorbing God as the living water that we may be constituted with His element and essence. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="CPl51KuiUuVRd63WzIYRZqyNPGDCELyPmm04MAeFUnbViUT5NigWropYLlUPwqHsA">E. The Deceitful and Incurable Heart of Man<br/>and the Searching, Test, and Reward of Jehovah</h2><p data-content-id="PDVQoKtYAJxviuVZpI542wdX5jaa-tB7WnkkJaYx4dORlqr5PWsUundDNB1v_Kk9f"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56541" data-verses="Jeremiah 17:9-11">Jeremiah 17:9-11</span> is concerned with the deceitful and incurable heart of man and with the searching, test, and reward of Jehovah. “The heart is deceitful above all things / And it is incurable; / Who can know it? / I, Jehovah, search the heart / And test the inward parts, / Even to give to each one according to his ways, / According to the fruit of his doings. / As a partridge broods over what she has not laid, / A man makes riches but not rightly; / In the midst of his days they will leave him, / And at his end he will be a fool.” Even this word regarding the deceitful and incurable heart of man is related to God’s economy with His dispensing. Yes, man’s heart is corrupt and deceitful; its condition is incurable. Nevertheless, even such a heart can be a tablet upon which God writes His law. Concerning this, Jehovah says, “I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56542" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33">31:33</span>). This reveals that God has a way to put Himself into man. Once He has come into man, God will spread from man’s spirit into his heart. This is God’s way, according to His economy, to deal with the heart of fallen man. </p>

Jeremiah spoke in a human way, and God also spoke in a human way, speaking as if He were a human being. In this conversation and in Jehovah’s further statement of Judah’s sins (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56559" data-verses="Jeremiah 16:10">16:10—17:27</span>), God’s economy is revealed. </p>
<p data-content-id="w7B2ly3akD68nMBqEd7c93jtPwHtxA198MFRr87lPFUoeqGN4RurJgqOvdEfsYiU-"> The book of Jeremiah reveals that God surely judges the evil ones, and sometimes He uses certain evil ones to judge other evil ones. This was the situation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56560" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:1">chapter fifteen</span>. God was intending to judge the people of Israel, and He sent Jeremiah to tell them that He would use the Babylonians to punish them. They responded by persecuting Jeremiah, and this caused him to be disappointed. In his disappointment Jeremiah said to his mother, “Woe is me, my mother, because you bore me, / A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land. / I have not lent with interest, / Nor have they lent to me; / Yet everyone curses me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56561" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:10">15:10</span>). Jeremiah’s mother was silent, but Jehovah came in to comfort and encourage him, saying, “Surely I will set you free for your good; / Indeed I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you / In a time of trouble and in a time of distress. / Can one break iron, / Iron from the north, or bronze?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56562" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:11-12">vv. 11-12</span>). The word <em>iron</em> <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> here refers to the Babylonians. God was assuring Jeremiah that He would use the Babylonians to punish Israel. After hearing this, Jeremiah petitioned Jehovah for His care, saying, “O Jehovah, You know; / Remember me and visit me, / And avenge me of my persecutors. / In Your longsuffering do not take me away; / Know that for Your sake I bear reproach” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56563" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:15">v. 15</span>). Jehovah answered with a further commission to Jeremiah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56564" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:19-21">vv. 19-21</span>) and also by placing restrictions on Jeremiah for His further commission (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56565" data-verses="Jeremiah 16:1-9">16:1-9</span>). Finally, Jehovah gave a further statement of Judah’s (as Israel’s) sins. </p>

God’s word makes our heart joyful. </p>
<p data-content-id="ryNgMdLLxGzNdPUZnHlJ-xJ0WKI_7cXZyI_bjltu4X1W1mcuvEgdbXrzjpYp62B4L"> What is crucial here is the revelation that God’s word is the divine supply as food to nourish us. Every kind of food has a nourishing element. God’s word, the divine supply, surely contains the element of nourishment. This nourishment is related to the divine dispensing, to God’s dispensing Himself into us. Through the word as our food, God is dispensing His riches into our inner being to nourish us that we may be constituted with His element. </p>

These verses also indicate that God is likened to water. God has planted us by Himself as the river of water. God is not only our food; He is also our drink, the water that goes along with the food. Our drinking of God as water is also a matter of His dispensing. As He dispenses Himself into us as water, God is supplying us with the rich element of His being that we may be constituted with His divinity. In this way, we human beings are constituted with the divine nature. </p>

God’s intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to His chosen people for their enjoyment. Stubborn Israel offended God to the uttermost, even forsaking Him as such a fountain of living waters (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56569" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">2:13</span>). God desires to be the fountain of living waters for us to drink that our thirst may be quenched and that we may be satisfied. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56570" data-verses="Jeremiah 17:1">chapter seventeen</span>, eventually the one who trusts in the very God who nourishes us and who waters us will enjoy Him as the fountain of living waters. </p>
<p data-content-id="OGG-FY948JCc0HrjqHM0n5-pXvmFayu1t3Rzs7YGi5Rsn8GmrQSi5Ks_NPFDtTRcK"> The food, the water, the very God, and the fountain of living waters—all these are one. Moreover, these are basic points of the divine thought concerning the carrying out of God’s economy by His dispensing. As God accomplishes His economy by dispensing Himself into us, He is our food, our water, and our fountain of living waters. How marvelous it is that in a portion of the Word concerned with God’s chastisement of His sinful and evil people, we have such a full picture of God’s economy by His dispensing! </p>

We should consider this word in relation to the foregoing points regarding God’s economy. We all need to learn that the way to keep God’s Sabbath is to enjoy Him, to rest in <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> Him, and to be satisfied in Him as the fountain of living waters. We should not do anything in ourselves or of ourselves. Rather, we should simply rest in this fountain and enjoy this fountain. The significance of keeping the Sabbath ordained by God is to take this fountain of living waters as our enjoyment, rest, and satisfaction. There is no need for us to do anything; we should simply be satisfied with all that God has done and accomplished. </p>
<p data-content-id="3nMDVhrLh74ojb_RJNZs3EMUkCk6Kqixf0ynlY6Srv9hH_PqwSgh_oJSYyF81NQR3"> In ancient times, those who were busy laboring on the Sabbath were those who had forsaken Jehovah. Having forsaken God, they labored in hewing out cisterns for themselves. The ones who labored in this way did not have any rest or satisfaction. Eventually their cisterns became broken and could hold no water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56572" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">2:13</span>). However, with those who trusted in Jehovah the situation was entirely different. On the Sabbath they could say, “Hallelujah for another day for us to rest in our God and be satisfied in Him! We are satisfied in Him for His rest and satisfaction. God rests with us, and we rest with Him to enjoy Him.” This is God’s economy. </p>

In other words, I have learned to pick the “fruit” in the Word. For this reason, in the first message of this life-study, I pointed out that we may compare our reading of the book of Jeremiah to picking fruit from trees in an orchard. In picking fruit we do not care about old branches or dry leaves; we care for ripe fruit. The “old branches” and “dry leaves” in the fifty-two chapters of Jeremiah are there for the purpose of showing us the “fruit,” that is, of showing us Christ as He is revealed in this book. The aspects of God’s economy covered in this message should certainly be regarded as ripe fruit. </p>

<p data-content-id="v9rp0k517gBAnKqJ4IffO1NLjfWSdxK5GywUqR5BgQleELuBpPD2r6-rllXVDLrSQ"> As the Potter our God has the absolute right over us. Regarding us, He has the right to do whatever He likes. This thought is found not only in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56576" data-verses="Jeremiah 18:1-20">Jeremiah 18 through 20</span> but also in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56577" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span>. I believe that Paul was considering these chapters of Jeremiah as he was writing <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56578" data-verses="Romans 9:1">Romans 9</span> concerning God’s sovereignty in His selection. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56579" data-verses="Romans 9:21">verse 21</span> he asks, “Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?” God, the Potter, certainly has such authority. His selection is according to His absolute right. He may choose one vessel and reject another. He has the full right to do anything in any way to His pottery. </p>
<p data-content-id="W3GVF7G-6II3g7lt4vzwS6mOCvlZ1Xzb_MriHDTu-Cy9-nxliNf9ii5OP4HfFOY_O"> From Jeremiah’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56580" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:10">15:10—17:27</span>, we can see that there was something within him that was different from God’s thought regarding Israel. I believe that the feeling within Jeremiah was that God’s judgment upon Israel was too severe. At least he was not satisfied with the situation. In a sense, he was arguing with God. Instead of arguing with God directly, Jeremiah argued indirectly by expressing his feeling to his mother, saying, “Woe is me, my mother, because <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> you bore me, / A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56581" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:10">15:10a</span>). This is a strong word. God did not give Jeremiah’s mother an opportunity to respond but came in to speak with Jeremiah and even to argue with him. As God spoke to Jeremiah, He asked him, “Can one break iron, / Iron from the north, or bronze?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56582" data-verses="Jeremiah 15:12">v. 12</span>). Here God was indicating that He was determined to use the Babylonians as iron to judge and punish Israel. </p>
<p data-content-id="w7B2ly3akD68nMBqEd7c93jRPyTFxA198MFRr87lPFUoeqGN4RurJgqOvdEfsYiU-"> Following this section in which he tells of his experience of arguing with God, Jeremiah went on to write a section concerning Jehovah as the Potter and Israel as the pottery. This section makes it very clear that God is absolutely free to do whatever He desires to His people. He has the full right, just as a potter has the full right over the pottery. If we see this, we will be able to understand these three chapters. </p>

Behold, as the clay is in the hand of the potter, so you are in My hand, O house of Israel.” This word to Israel was also a word to the prophet, a word that would clear up his concept. Jehovah seemed to be saying to Jeremiah, <span class="pg" data-page-id="123" id="123">[123]</span> “Do not hinder Me from doing whatever I will to do with the house of Israel. Israel is clay in My hand, and I deal with them in changeable ways. Depending on their condition, I can punish them or exalt them.” </p>

This word was God’s further vindication of Himself to Jeremiah. Although God had the full right, He would not punish Israel in a way that was unfitting. Here Jehovah seemed to be telling Jeremiah, “I am not unwise in dealing with Israel, and neither am I doing something that is not fitting. Look at Israel’s condition. If you consider their condition, you will agree with Me that they need to be punished.” </p>

The royal family of David was like a large tree, but because of the apostasy of Solomon and his descendants, that <span class="pg" data-page-id="133" id="133">[133]</span> tree was cut down, mainly by Nebuchadnezzar, leaving only a stump in the earth.

In bringing forth Christ as the Shoot of David, God brought together two descendants of David—Joseph, a descendant of Solomon, and Mary, a descendant of Nathan, another one of David’s sons.

Since Joseph was of the house and family of David, he went with Mary to Bethlehem, David’s city. While they were there, Mary gave birth to Jesus and laid Him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn. Christ’s birth at Bethlehem was a fulfillment of the prophecy in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56643" data-verses="Micah 5:2">Micah 5:2</span>. Because of Herod’s persecution, Joseph took the child and His mother to Egypt (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56644" data-verses="Matthew 2:14">Matt. 2:14</span>). Eventually, after the death of Herod, Joseph returned to Nazareth with the child and His mother (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56645" data-verses="Matthew 2:19-23">vv. 19-23</span>). This was the beginning of the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise concerning the raising up of Christ as the Shoot, as the new sprout, of David. </p>

According to the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord Jesus has given us the authority to bind and to loose. “I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56675" data-verses="Matthew 16:19">16:19</span>). The Gospel of Matthew is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens, which is a matter of authority. The church revealed in this book represents the kingdom to reign. Hence, the authority to bind and to loose is given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56676" data-verses="Matthew 16:19">16:19</span>, but also to the church itself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56677" data-verses="Matthew 18:17-18">18:17-18</span>). </p>

Go therefore and disciple all <span class="pg" data-page-id="139" id="139">[139]</span> the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Because all authority has been given to the Lord Jesus, the son of David as the heavenly King, He has sent His disciples to go and disciple all the nations.

Third, Isaac received the bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56685" data-verses="Genesis 24:67">Gen. 24:67</span>).

This covenant is related to God’s purpose in creating man. God made mankind to be His vessels to contain Him. God made man in His own image and after His likeness so that man could contain God, taking God as his life and life supply. For man to take God as his life and life supply is the greatest blessing in the universe. This is the enjoyment of the Triune God. However, due to the fall, this great blessing was lost by man. </p>

Have you ever heard of such a stealing, a stealing not of gold or silver but of God’s words? Nevertheless, <span class="pg" data-page-id="148" id="148">[148]</span> such a thing happened at Jeremiah’s time, and it still happens today. </p>
<p data-content-id="nSykSi8Dzkx7rlOQ5IL8DB-ASNSupBxQ7rXdM2NhxDABuQKCvwZmuRJM-oRKkO_v6"> Jeremiah was a genuine prophet who received words from God. Although there were other genuine prophets, most of the prophets in Judah were false. These false prophets could not have a way to receive Jehovah’s word, so they listened to those who spoke for God and then stole the words of Jehovah spoken by them. </p>
<p data-content-id="6_R3gJree1Pm-zuQPbV_niSmVsrn--FVF3H1lV9NyaB0DGVNuFYOPl6avpsgCRFWR"> The principle is the same today. Someone receives a revelation from God through the Word and then speaks this revelation. Others then take this word and speak it as if it were their own. They do not give any credit to the one who received the revelation; instead, they pretend that they themselves have received this revelation from God and that the words they are speaking are their own. To do this is to steal the word. I know of cases where certain people used my messages on Romans and on Revelation without giving me credit. What a shame for Christians to do such a thing! Concerning this, we should be honest and have a high ethical standard. If we use the words of someone else, we should give credit to that person. </p>

What is the straw to the grain? declares Jehovah.” The word of God which came forth from Jeremiah was grain, but the word of the false prophets was straw, chaff. For the word to be grain means that it is food for our nourishment and that it contains the divine essence to be dispensed into our being. </p>
<p data-content-id="sBp2800gseLZdTSAlTlwLc-ud7aCUQ-V_g88lCODvCMQJVBjVieMZgQ8G6knVI1QC"> The new Christian books published today contain a great deal of chaff but very little grain. Among the Christian books published after 1945, it has been hard to find even one book that is rich in nourishing grain or a book filled with the divine revelation concerning God’s plan.

On the negative side, the word, as fire, burns us and many of the things in which we have confidence; and the word, as a hammer, breaks down our self, our natural life, our flesh, our lusts, and our concepts.

The covenant made with Israel at Mount Sinai is called the first covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56898" data-verses="Hebrews 8:7">Heb. 8:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56899" data-verses="Hebrews 8:13">13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56900" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">9:1</span>), and the new covenant is called the second covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56901" data-verses="Hebrews 8:7">Heb. 8:7</span>). After the new covenant, God will not make any other covenants, for the new covenant is the consummation of God’s covenanting with His people. </p>
<p data-content-id="sBp2800gseLZdTSAlTlwLc--d7qqUQ-V_g88lCODvCMQJVBjVieMZgQ8G6knVI1QC"> The first covenant is called the covenant of law, and the second covenant is altogether wrapped up with God’s divinity. The law is a portrait, a picture, of God, depicting Him. But the law is not God Himself. The Ten Commandments give us a full portrait of what God is, but they do not give us the person of God. In contrast, the content of the new covenant is God Himself. </p>

Jehovah Putting His Law within Them<br/>and Writing It upon Their Hearts</h2><p data-content-id="LydA6pgW62hGE3L5Yo603BLpCCME_oJx7RQ3MfY2dPGEnkNVqPXUHGsEyrbjQDODr"> The first item of the new covenant is found in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56902" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33">Jeremiah 31:33a</span>. “This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts.” What kind of law can be put into people and be written upon their hearts? Such a law must be a law of life, and this law itself must be a life. Otherwise, it could not be put into us. <span class="pg" data-page-id="179" id="179">[179]</span> Furthermore, this law will be written upon our hearts, indicating that it will spread from the center of our being, our spirit, to the circumference, our heart. Thus, this law must be God’s life, the divine life, and God’s life is God Himself. In the new covenant God will put Himself into His chosen people as their life, and this life is a law. </p>
<p data-content-id="m-9_FZSSONBzYxqNbcHQ1AjlSXwfimxecKNlJ7BbA5XVzfunX5H58YZ8zzGNG7UoU"> Every life is a law. For example, the dog life is the dog law, and the bird life is the bird law. Likewise, the life of the peach tree is the law of the peach tree. The principle is the same with human beings. As human beings we have a human life, and this human life is a law that regulates us in every way. In particular, the law of the human life regulates the growth and development of a human being and causes all the parts of one’s body to be in the right place and to function in the right way. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZiXhEknxjzatvebIYmZYSRAChVhoFJ6fk2B32pao_RfIz8F6WkGgFhS25xH7AYBWE"> God’s life is the highest life, and the law of this life is the highest law. The New Testament calls this life eternal life, a life that is divine, uncreated, and indestructible. This eternal life is embodied in Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56903" data-verses="1John 5:11">1 John 5:11</span>), and it is actually Christ Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56904" data-verses="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>). The law of this life is wrapped up with the life-giving Spirit, who in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56905" data-verses="Romans 8:2">Romans 8:2</span> is called “the Spirit of life.” Hence, God, Christ, and the Spirit are this life, and through our regeneration this life is now within us to function as a law to us. This law is righteous and holy, and it is a law of love and of light. Because the eternal life within us is a law, it controls, governs, regulates, and restricts us in everything. What a marvelous law we have within us! </p>
<p data-content-id="AQQB_dTYue1Rhzg91v0ifNs795nnb0ZfZqyeUinh9hQWuj3H3gR5Pv0fS5qcnsAWW"> The law of life within us is for God’s economy. Without giving us His life as the inner law, God has no way to accomplish His economy. God’s economy is to dispense Himself into our being that our being may be constituted with His being to be one constitution with His being. This can be accomplished only by God putting Himself into us as the divine life. </p>
<p data-content-id="F0z9H8uW6AZFrBLBWfOtEb9xqcM4ESJMtyqly6gCslvW9uY3DyGu4FsQmX5vNfxqw"> Today hardly any Christians pay attention to the divine life as the inner law. Where can you hear a word about this in the Catholic Church, in the Orthodox Church, or in the Protestant denominations? Even the Brethren speak of this only in a very limited way. In Pentecostalism there is much interest in outward things but not in the inner law of life. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="180" id="180">[180]</span> the Lord’s recovery, however, we place great emphasis on eternal life and on the inner law as the function of this life. </p>
<p data-content-id="CPl51KuiUuVRd63WzIYRZqCBPGDSELyPmm04MAeFUnbViUT5NigWropYLlUPwqHsA"> The divine life has a function, and with this function there is a capacity, an ability. We can be holy because we have the capacity of holiness. We can be righteous because we have the capacity of righteousness. We can love others, even our enemies, because the divine life within us has the capacity to love. </p>
<p data-content-id="PDVQoKtYAJxviuVZpI542wtb5jaK-tB7WnkkJaYx4dORlqr5PWsUundDNB1v_Kk9f"> The teachings in the New Testament are just to develop this capacity, to encourage this capacity to grow. Likewise, all the messages given by this ministry are to strengthen and develop the divine life in its capacity for its function. The goal of this function is for God to dispense Himself into us to accomplish His economy, that is, to produce the increase of God for His expression, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. </p>

This is especially true of a covenant enacted by God. Like the sun, the moon, and the stars, the new covenant will remain forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56916" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:35-37">31:35-37</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56917" data-verses="Jeremiah 32:40">32:40</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56918" data-verses="Jeremiah 33:20-26">33:20-26</span>). </p>

In its essence, this law refers to the divine life, and the divine life is nothing less than the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive Christ, and the processed and consummated God. These three are one. The life-giving Spirit is the reality and realization of the all-inclusive Christ, and the all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of the consummated God. Thus, this inner law, remaining in our being all the time, reminds us that the very processed and consummated Triune God—the Spirit, the Son, and the Father—is with us all the time. We may say that the law is with us. But this law is the divine life, and the divine life is the processed and consummated Triune <span class="pg" data-page-id="184" id="184">[184]</span> God—the marvelous source as the Father, the wonderful element as the Son, and the excellent essence as the Spirit. This is the center, the content, and the reality of the new covenant. </p>

<p data-content-id="KO1Ppd7egl5MxDTzJ27Mzd5jsp8BuZube8axoy99zrV9Hfa79zsxHBf3C_6jMFB18"> As we consider the essence of the inner law of life, we see that this law has another aspect, that is, its function. This law functions. The function of the inner law refers to the divine capacity. In this law there is the divine capacity, and the divine capacity is almighty. This divine capacity can do everything in us for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. There is not a positive thing concerning the carrying out of God’s economy that this divine capacity is unable to do. According to its life, the law of the new covenant is the Triune God, and according to its function, it is the divine capacity. </p>

This capacity can also cause the believers in Christ to be constituted with God. Because the believers are constituted with God, they as a corporate people are God’s expression. Although the believers are constituted with God, there is still a distinction between them and God. God remains God with the Godhead, and we, the believers, are made the same as God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. This means that except for the Godhead, we are exactly the same as God. Since we are the same as God in life and in nature, we become His increase, His enlargement, as His fullness to express Him. This is the highest aspect of the capacity of the inner law of life. </p>

In addition to causing us to be constituted with God, the capacity of the inner law constitutes us to be the Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56920" data-verses="1Corinthians 12:13">1 Cor. 12:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56921" data-verses="Ephesians 5:30">Eph. 5:30</span>). This means that the divine life has the capacity to make us the Body of Christ. Furthermore, this capacity has all the abilities of all the functions of the Body. I hope that we all will be deeply impressed with the centrality and function of the inner law of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3nMDVhrLh74ojb_RJNZs3E8QkCUiKqixf0ynlY6Srv9hH_PqwSgh_oJSYyF81NQR3">THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br/>UNVEILING GOD’S ECONOMY WITH HIS DISPENSING</h2><p data-content-id="GavFbAHZwy2tSsSfbn19MOCMON04hKNdN7EMYKvswdWTwhcWqG65aQqo-Zv3gW-TT"> The central line of the divine revelation is to unveil God’s economy with His dispensing. God’s dispensing is simply to put Himself into us as the inner law of life. On the one hand, we have the divine life, which is the Triune God. On the other hand, we have the divine capacity. By this capacity we have the ability not only to know God but also to live God and even to be constituted with God. What a capacity! Furthermore, this capacity can constitute us to be the members of the Body of Christ, including all kinds of functions: those of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers—the joints of the rich supply—and those of every part of the Body that functions in its measure (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56922" data-verses="Ephesians 4:11">Eph. 4:11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56923" data-verses="Ephesians 4:16">16</span>). In essence the inner law of life is God in Christ as the Spirit, and in function this law has the capacity to constitute us with God and to constitute us the members of the Body of Christ with all kinds of functions, all kinds of abilities. I am happy, and even excited, to see this law operating in the saints in the Lord’s recovery. Hallelujah for this wonderful law of life! </p>

<p data-content-id="knUYwTFdT2nz4oaCMVUdIN4q7360e8fk8dlC0ce7njrQfhn5xXyyBIzOYxDcFh6RW"> Christians today are divided because they take many different ways other than Christ. The Catholic Church has the Catholic way, and the Orthodox Church has the Orthodox way. Each denomination and independent group has its own way. The Presbyterians have one way, and the Pentecostals have another way. </p>
<p data-content-id="JXO2QqZLRHSLiuSm-o0ojns5epw7JCdK3sDGA7-lFGILphgkdGElKB7gODuH9gUCL"> What should be our way in the Body of Christ? As the Body of Christ, we should take the way of the inner law, which is the Triune God with His divine capacity. We should all have one heart to love Him, and we should all take Him as our life and our way. This one heart and one way is the one accord (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56936" data-verses="Acts 1:14">Acts 1:14</span>). If we do not have one heart and one way, we cannot be in one accord. </p>
<p data-content-id="zQD_kArgRVvuVoaXr8GENqExAu0NKFYuD9dOb_IvfENB1OQYnRBDDiU1K0UAmq2vl"> For eternity in the New Jerusalem there will be only one way. John tells us, “He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56937" data-verses="Revelation 22:1-2">Rev. 22:1-2a</span>). In the middle of the street, the river of water of life flows, and in the river the tree of life grows. This indicates that the way, the life, and the life supply are all one. It also indicates what our way should be today. Our way in the Lord’s recovery is life; it is the inner law of life; it is the very Triune God Himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="af5EnakJh4m65x84SEdotkxkPqyKgXxck1P44ogmVN3hahNQGdYAUDnuRTcY0icjW"> I am sorry to say that in recent years there was a turmoil among us, and this turmoil brought in division. The reason for this turmoil was that certain ones wanted to take a way other than life, a way other than Christ, the Triune God, and the inner law. Divisions are always the result of taking a way other than Christ. If we keep ourselves to the one way, there <span class="pg" data-page-id="190" id="190">[190]</span> will be no division. We praise the Lord that in His restoration He will give His people one heart to love Him and express Him and one way to enjoy Him. </p>

King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to set free their servants, but afterward they turned around and brought their servants back into subjection. Then Jehovah spoke through Jeremiah that because they profaned His name when they turned and took back the servants, not listening to Him, transgressing His covenant, and not establishing the words of the covenant they had made before Him, He was proclaiming liberty to them to sword, to pestilence, and to famine. He would make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, giving them—the princes, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people—into the hand of their enemies who sought their life, and their corpses would be food for the birds and the beasts. Jehovah would also give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hand of their enemies who sought their life and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, which had withdrawn from them and would be brought back by Him to fight against Jerusalem, capture it, and burn it with fire. Moreover, Jehovah would make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant. </p>

In the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, Jehovah asked Jeremiah to invite the house of the Rechabites to the house of Jehovah to drink wine.

In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, Jehovah asked Jeremiah to write on a scroll book all the words which He had spoken to Jeremiah concerning Israel, concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations from the day He spoke to him, from the days of Josiah even to that day. Then Jeremiah asked Baruch the son of Neriah to write from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which He had spoken to him, on a scroll book (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56967" data-verses="Jeremiah 36:1-4">vv. 1-4</span>). </p>

Then Jehovah said further, “Behold, what I have built I am about to tear down; and what I have planted I am about to pluck up, even this whole land. And are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I am bringing evil upon all flesh, declares Jehovah, but I will give your own life to you as spoil in all places where you may go” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56969" data-verses="Jeremiah 45:4-5">vv. 4-5</span>). Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch to read the scroll to the people in the house of Jehovah on the day of fasting and to all the people of Judah who came from their cities. Baruch did accordingly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56970" data-verses="Jeremiah 36:6-8">36:6-8</span>). </p>

A leader among them, after hearing the word, went down to the king’s house and told the princes there what he had heard in that book. Then the princes sent someone to Baruch to ask him to come to them with the scroll in his hand and read it to them. After hearing all the words in it, they turned in fear one to another and told Baruch that they had to report all those words to the king. They asked Baruch and Jeremiah to hide themselves and to let no one know where they were (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56971" data-verses="Jeremiah 36:9-19">vv. 9-19</span>). </p>

The king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid and did not rend their garments. Rather, the king commanded his son and others to seize Baruch and Jeremiah, but Jehovah hid them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56973" data-verses="Jeremiah 36:24-26">vv. 24-26</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="U0NfuDerr3yjfHzjUQGmjIcA1NA3BsnW8BvVDp0BMMdMDj-ghQalUZjd0pqZu7PCO"> Then, after the king had burned the scroll, Jehovah told Jeremiah to take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56974" data-verses="Jeremiah 36:27-28">vv. 27-28</span>). Concerning Jehoiakim, Jeremiah was commanded to say, “Thus says Jehovah, You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written in it, saying, The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and will cause man and beast to cease from it?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56975" data-verses="Jeremiah 36:29">v. 29</span>). Jeremiah was to tell Jehoiakim that he would have no one to sit on the throne of David and that his corpse would be cast out to the heat by day and to the frost by night. Jehoiakim was also told that Jehovah would punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity and that He would bring on them and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem and on the men of Judah all the evil that He had spoken against <span class="pg" data-page-id="199" id="199">[199]</span> them.

From this we see that although Israel was stubborn in sinning against Jehovah, Jeremiah remained firm in his speaking for Him. </p>

Jehovah said, “Do not deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans will surely go away from us; for they will not go away.

I am not deserting to the Chaldeans” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56984" data-verses="Jeremiah 37:14">v. 14a</span>). However, the captain of the guard did not listen to him but seized him and brought him to the princes. The princes were angry with Jeremiah, struck him, and put him in prison, where he remained many days. </p>
<p data-content-id="IZ1MpxOaHJONo0UIxr69ecdBVwetksGfT3EScEci0_Hk0SNqWn-qvK2Aewoqb36Cy"> Later, Zedekiah the king sent and took him out; and the king questioned him in the king’s house secretly, asking, “Is there any word from Jehovah?” Jeremiah answered, “There is,” and then he said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56985" data-verses="Jeremiah 37:17">v. 17</span>). He also said to Zedekiah the king, “In what have I sinned against you or against your servants or against this people, that you have put me in prison? And where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56986" data-verses="Jeremiah 37:18-19">vv. 18-19</span>). Then he asked the king not to send him back to prison, lest he die there. So Zedekiah the king commanded that Jeremiah be placed into the court of the guard and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers’ street until all the bread was gone from the city. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. </p>

The princes heard <span class="pg" data-page-id="203" id="203">[203]</span> Jeremiah speaking to all the people that he who remained in the city would die, but he who went out to the Chaldeans would live and that the city would surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he would capture it. When the princes heard this, they said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the men of war who are left in this city and the hands of all the people by speaking such words to them; for this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56988" data-verses="Jeremiah 38:4">v. 4</span>). In reply, Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand, for the king can do nothing against you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56989" data-verses="Jeremiah 38:5">v. 5</span>). Then the princes cast Jeremiah with ropes into a pit in the court of the guard, and he sank into the mire. </p>
<p data-content-id="knUYwTFdT2nz4oaCMVUdIN4S73K8e8fk8dlC0ce7njrQfhn5xXyyBIzOYxDcFh6RW"> When the eunuch Ebed-melech, the Cushite, heard about this, he went to the king and told him the evil that the princes had done to Jeremiah the prophet, who would die in the pit because of the famine. Then Zedekiah the king commanded the eunuch, the Cushite, to take with him thirty men to bring Jeremiah out of the pit before he died. And the eunuch did accordingly. </p>
<p data-content-id="JXO2QqZLRHSLiuSm-o0ojnsBepAzJCdK3sDGA7-lFGILphgkdGElKB7gODuH9gUCL"> Then Zedekiah the king sent men to bring Jeremiah to himself at an entrance of the house of Jehovah. He said to Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56990" data-verses="Jeremiah 38:14">v. 14</span>). Jeremiah replied, “If I tell you, indeed will you not put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56991" data-verses="Jeremiah 38:15">v. 15</span>). Then Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah secretly, saying that as Jehovah, who had made his soul, lives he would not put him to death or give him into the hand of those who sought his life. </p>
<p data-content-id="zQD_kArgRVvuVoaXr8GENqEJAuE1KFYuD9dOb_IvfENB1OQYnRBDDiU1K0UAmq2vl"> After Zedekiah made this promise, Jeremiah said to him, “Thus says Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, If you will indeed surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, you will live, and this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your house will live. But if you do not surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape out of their hand” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56992" data-verses="Jeremiah 38:17-18">vv. 17-18</span>). When Zedekiah heard this, he told Jeremiah that he was afraid of the Jews who had deserted to the Chaldeans, that <span class="pg" data-page-id="204" id="204">[204]</span> they would give him into their hand and they would abuse him. Jeremiah assured Zedekiah that they would not give him up. Then he went on to say, “Listen now to the voice of Jehovah in what I am speaking to you, and it will be well with you, and your soul will live. But if you refuse to surrender, this is the word that Jehovah has shown me: Then behold, all the women who have been left in the house of the king of Judah will be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon....They will lead out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and you will cause this city to be burned with fire” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="56993" data-verses="Jeremiah 38:20-22">vv. 20-22a</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="56994" data-verses="Jeremiah 38:23">23</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="af5EnakJh4m65x84SEdotkxcPqCygXxck1P44ogmVN3hahNQGdYAUDnuRTcY0icjW"> After Jeremiah spoke these words, Zedekiah charged him not to let anyone know of these words and he would not die. Then he told Jeremiah how to answer the princes when they came to him and tried to find out what the conversation was between the king and Jeremiah. Jeremiah did according to the word of the king and remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured. </p>

Jehovah would deliver him, and he would not be given to the people of whom he was afraid. Jehovah would save him, and he would not fall by the sword. Rather, he would have his own life as spoil because he had put his trust in Jehovah. </p>

The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also slew all the nobles of Judah.

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="zQD_kArgRVvuVoaXr8GENqUlAvw9KFYuD9dOb_IvfENB1OQYnRBDDiU1K0UAmq2vl">GOD FULFILLING HIS ECONOMY<br/>BY DISPENSING HIMSELF INTO HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="af5EnakJh4m65x84SEdotkhwPrm-gXxck1P44ogmVN3hahNQGdYAUDnuRTcY0icjW"> The book of Jeremiah unveils how God fulfills His economy by dispensing Himself into His chosen people. This is the principle that God wants us to see in the first forty-five chapters of this book, chapters that cover many points and provide many illustrations. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="bwlikUUzkc6R97_6Vimm4o7H305y00mCqBA01eDhuiYO-3BQsTRQVR_xlNEw99agQ">THE TWO BASIC SINS OF GOD’S PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="qPEtYgsnw9DtC6P-ho1X_5AceZgktjw99kVW4BEgCfblL041Oqy3UdOX5R1CMSJ7p"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57060" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">2:13</span> Jehovah speaks concerning the two basic sins committed by the children of Israel. The first sin was forsaking Jehovah as the fountain, the source, of living waters; the second sin was hewing out for themselves broken cisterns that could not hold water. This second sin was a matter of not trusting in God but of trusting in themselves to do something for their own enjoyment. These two sins govern the entire book of Jeremiah. </p>
<p data-content-id="1tSSbspMlJYSW8N_4fMJyQE-ddje8IsOAsO1ImZ_mWhLwcExJHXU2CP-iNEN_Jyup"> The principle in the Bible is that God does not want His chosen people to take anything other than Himself as their source. After God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life, which signifies God as life. By doing this God was indicating that He wanted man to partake of the tree of life, <span class="pg" data-page-id="218" id="218">[218]</span> not anything else. To partake of the tree of life is to take God as our unique source, as our source of everything. </p>
<p data-content-id="9Db05uR9AaUGQrL9TYQnJinvIp9BFBx_--nuXQ8QSJFvAMz-bFHPDoBLq1h38lVCc"> What is sin? Sin is a matter of leaving God and doing something by ourselves and for ourselves. This is exactly what the children of Israel did. They forsook God as the fountain of living waters for their supply, and, according to their opinion, they did whatever they could to work out something by themselves for their enjoyment. I wish to emphasize that sin is to forsake God and to do something by ourselves and for ourselves. This is the principle throughout the Bible, and Jeremiah repeated this principle again and again so that we would be impressed. </p>
<p data-content-id="jTp05_l_BWl6m_8iwcy3Bmm6TYXSd5UPPr4VP79Xb5RuhV_9p7EUmSfDxC8xdFqR5"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57061" data-verses="Jeremiah 34:1">Jeremiah 34—45</span> is a section of twelve chapters showing us the stubbornness of Israel in sinning against Jehovah. In these chapters one thing is made clear—that Israel has forsaken God as the source, the fountain, of living waters. Consider, for example, the situation with Gedaliah. Although he was faithful in caring for Jeremiah, God’s prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57062" data-verses="Jeremiah 40:5-6">40:5-6</span>), he did not seek the Lord’s word (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57063" data-verses="Jeremiah 40:13-14">vv. 13-14</span>), because this was not his habit. He did not take God as his source to be one with Him and to receive whatever issued from Him. If he had been such a person, the first thing he would have done would have been to receive the word of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="TJLO-7sHzwGAeDeMbthOdEsbUP7vbsm1afQJxQDpw6mh3szmGbP-afzf3e7CVn9ps">BEING ONE WITH GOD TO RECEIVE THE WORD OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="nSykSi8Dzkx7rlOQ5IL8DBuMSNimpBxQ7rXdM2NhxDABuQKCvwZmuRJM-oRKkO_v6"> To take, receive, and keep the word of God, we must be absolutely one with God. We must trust in Him, rely on Him, and not have any opinion that comes out of ourselves. We should simply enjoy what God has done and what He will do for us. This is the way to fulfill God’s economy, and this is the new covenant. In the new covenant we are one with God and let Him write Himself into us as our life and as our life law with its capacity for us to function. We all need to see this. </p>
<p data-content-id="6_R3gJree1Pm-zuQPbV_niCqVsbv--FVF3H1lV9NyaB0DGVNuFYOPl6avpsgCRFWR"> The principle of the Bible, especially of the New Testament, is that God opens Himself to us that we may enter into Him, receive Him, and become one with Him. Then He will be in us, and we will be in Him, taking Him as everything. The first thing we will take is His word to express His thought, His will, His heart’s desire, and His good pleasure; <span class="pg" data-page-id="219" id="219">[219]</span> we will not care for our opinions or preferences. In this way we become His mouthpiece to speak Him forth to others for their supply. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="R3DAAp7LuTzr5QTywgPF9-Hlv8r7RBt-S7dzSfACjSpocGvQ54bAeboJIZavqJ8PK">THE STUBBORNNESS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL<br/>DUE TO THEIR NOT BEING ONE WITH GOD</h2><p data-content-id="sBp2800gseLZdTSAlTlwLcuid7q6UQ-V_g88lCODvCMQJVBjVieMZgQ8G6knVI1QC"> If we see this, we will realize that the stubbornness of the children of Israel was due to their not being one with God. For example, Johanan, the leader of the remnant, strongly determined to go to Egypt to take refuge. He feared that the Babylonians would come to avenge the murder of Gedaliah. But God wanted them to remain in the holy land to be a remnant of His people. God would visit them and grace them and even use them to be His people as a testimony of the living God on earth. However, they altogether misunderstood God by their consideration and by their opinion. Nevertheless, all the leaders of the forces and all the people begged Jeremiah the prophet to pray for them concerning the way in which they should go and the thing which they should do, promising him that whether it was good or evil, they would listen to the voice of Jehovah (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57064" data-verses="Jeremiah 42:1-6">42:1-6</span>). They said they would obey because they expected Jeremiah to go along with them. They expected that he would give them a “sugar-coated” word. Jeremiah, who was not one to speak such a word, told them that he would pray to Jehovah according to their words. </p>
<p data-content-id="w7B2ly3akD68nMBqEd7c93D5PyTlxA198MFRr87lPFUoeqGN4RurJgqOvdEfsYiU-"> Instead of being in a hurry to speak, Jeremiah waited for ten days. After ten days the word of Jehovah came to them through Jeremiah, telling them not to go to Egypt but to remain in Judah. Jehovah said, “If you will still remain in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not pluck you up” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57065" data-verses="Jeremiah 42:10">v. 10a</span>). This indicates that He would bless them, and they would enjoy Him. However, if they did not listen to this word but went to the land of Egypt, they would die there. Concerning this, Jehovah said, “If indeed you set your faces to go to Egypt and go to sojourn there, then the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, about which you are worried, will follow hard after you there in Egypt; and you <span class="pg" data-page-id="220" id="220">[220]</span> will die there. And all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt, to sojourn there, will die by sword, by famine, and by pestilence; and they will have no survivors or any who have escaped from the evil which I will bring on them” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57066" data-verses="Jeremiah 42:15-17">vv. 15b-17</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="LydA6pgW62hGE3L5Yo603Bb1CCM0_oJx7RQ3MfY2dPGEnkNVqPXUHGsEyrbjQDODr"> When Jeremiah finished speaking the words of Jehovah, all the people, including Johanan, accused him of lying. They said to him, “You are speaking falsehood; Jehovah our God has not sent you to say, You shall not go to Egypt to sojourn there” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57067" data-verses="Jeremiah 43:2">43:2</span>). Refusing to listen to the voice of Jeremiah to remain in the land of Judah, Johanan and all the leaders of the forces took the remnant and went to Egypt. </p>
<p data-content-id="m-9_FZSSONBzYxqNbcHQ1Az5SXAHimxecKNlJ7BbA5XVzfunX5H58YZ8zzGNG7UoU"> Once they were in Egypt, there was an argument between a great assemblage of those who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods and all the women who stood by, and Jeremiah the prophet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57068" data-verses="Jeremiah 44:15-30">44:15-30</span>). They told Jeremiah that they would not listen to him. Instead, they would burn incense to the queen of heaven (the wife of Nimrod) and pour out libations to her, just as they did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. They even went so far as to say that when they burned incense to the queen of heaven, they had plenty of food and were well off and did not see evil, but since they had ceased doing this, they lacked everything and were consumed by sword and by famine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57069" data-verses="Jeremiah 44:17-18">vv. 17-18</span>). That was a lie. When they were in Jerusalem, they were besieged and even forced to eat their children. Nevertheless, they told Jeremiah falsely that they were well off and did not experience calamities. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZiXhEknxjzatvebIYmZYSRQehVRwFJ6fk2B32pao_RfIz8F6WkGgFhS25xH7AYBWE"> The children of Israel were a people who were not one with God. If they had been one with God, there would have been no problem. If they had been one with God, they would have received God’s word and would have known His heart, His nature, His mind, and His purpose. If they had been one with God, then spontaneously they would have lived Him and would have been constituted with Him to be His testimony on earth. </p>

<p data-content-id="dA9g112R6wtwAVhAjoQ_6psi6BDG-favTe84a2fkR6ZKnV1iXOelgVWn5GULkVdQV"> The Bible shows us first that God is the source in every way. After He created man, God presented Himself to man as the real and sole object for man to seek after, that is, the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57079" data-verses="Genesis 2:9">Gen. 2:9</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="QOcu1PTGsauWKCuTN-ZLs8TY-q5S9Yo4bls-LboSR19ZNV2y0006XK5EQhWcOdpBP">The Fall of Man and a History of Sins</h2><p data-content-id="_1Uw53Q8BnPZ6UV9p6rGA8Hca44DItX6hl4RPQlM89czdLHmlIdPqSLe5LQNTgYYg"> Although God placed man in front of the tree of life, wanting him to partake of that tree, man was seduced and attracted to the other tree—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57080" data-verses="Genesis 2:17">2:17</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57081" data-verses="Genesis 3:1-6">3:1-6</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57082" data-verses="Genesis 3:11">11</span>). By eating of the fruit of this tree, man became fallen, and sin entered into him. After that, the history of mankind was nothing but a history of sins, with all the nations sinning continually in every way. Then God selected the children of Abraham to be a chosen people, but eventually they became the same as the nations. This continued until the end of the Old Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="BqZPFRLgw98kbSgb8Hi1c6JvnO3KJXxKB-kWDRhfxRZL2fylKlegCgma_JzeWmXPQ">The Coming of Christ, the Righteous Shoot</h2><p data-content-id="xoS3aB8bggngik3368-UKc8XQdqUsWuhgTPcP2VSkcf8UGJT53JBHpp4ILIlnAQx8"> Jesus Christ came as the righteous Shoot. Wherever He went in His ministry He encountered sin, death, demons, and <span class="pg" data-page-id="224" id="224">[224]</span> evil spirits. Just as God presented Himself as the tree of life in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57083" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span>, so Christ also presented Himself as life in the Gospel of John. He presented Himself to people as the bread of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57084" data-verses="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57085" data-verses="John 6:48">48</span>), that is, as the tree of life, and He told them that He came that they might have life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57086" data-verses="John 10:10">10:10</span>). Then He went to the cross to die for man in order to accomplish redemption for man. Through this, God has a standing to forgive man and to justify man. Eventually, this Jesus Christ became man’s redemption and man’s righteousness for man to receive justification from God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57087" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>). Based upon this, Christ as the embodiment of God has entered into us to be our life, even to be our inner law of life. </p>

At His table He enacted a law to be the new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57088" data-verses="Luke 22:20">Luke 22:20</span>). All the New Testament books from Acts through Revelation tell us what the new covenant is. The content of this new covenant is the Triune God within us to be our life, our life law, our life supply, our life capacity, and our everything that we may be constituted with God in His life and nature and thereby become His increase, His enlargement, to be His fullness for His eternal expression. First, this expression is the church; second, it is the kingdom; and eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, it is the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the new covenant of God to express God in a corporate way to the uttermost for eternity. </p>

Not only so, their nature was so evil, wicked, and corrupt that nothing could change it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57092" data-verses="Jeremiah 13:23">13:23</span>). They became just like the people whom Jesus met in the four Gospels. </p>

He has come into us to be our life, our life supply, our life law, our life capacity, and our everything that we may be constituted with God in His life and nature to be His enlargement, His increase, His fullness, for His expression. We will be such <span class="pg" data-page-id="226" id="226">[226]</span> an expression of God first in the church age, then in the age of restoration (the age of the millennial kingdom), and ultimately and consummately in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The New Jerusalem will be the embodiment of God’s new covenant. The new covenant, therefore, will ultimately issue in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="gXNDhKVKPDNG-PSy0ap2-awjIvblOp3E22wW4wcjBrQr3eBubnsiSZW6jjx_GhUd-">Jeremiah’s Prophecy concerning the Nations</h2><p data-content-id="eK3U6TivBGpZoPSpFXbBpktjNnm41kwZj3aus0PDhekjUWjEg8WYJwsu2zhwfFo9Q"> We have seen that <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57094" data-verses="Revelation 21:24">Revelation 21:24</span> speaks of the nations around the New Jerusalem. Jeremiah also speaks of the nations in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57095" data-verses="Jeremiah 46:1">chapters forty-six through fifty-one</span>. Actually, the nations in the new heaven and new earth will eventually come from the nations concerning which Jeremiah prophesied. This is a further indication that the book of Jeremiah is complete, even all-inclusive. </p>
<p data-content-id="54BtkgWnr1OFzxnK-WTO8UsmRMqANJkcAKfLdwJt4vlukEyz_ZCCopi7yupUc-Fah"> Why does Jeremiah prophesy concerning the nations? He does this because God needs them. On the one hand, God needs a people to express Him; on the other hand, He needs another people to look at, to behold, this expression. We may say that those who express God are the “actors” and that those who witness this expression are the “spectators.” For the fulfillment of His purpose, God needs both the actors—His chosen people—and the spectators—the nations. Therefore, the book of Jeremiah, following the spiritual sequence in the Bible, includes Jeremiah’s speaking concerning the nations. In this matter he is the same as Isaiah, Daniel, and Zechariah. As we will see, the principle is the same with the books of the Minor Prophets. </p>

These distract the church people from God’s economy and from God as the fountain of living waters. The aspect of the world typified by Philistia constantly opposes and troubles the people of God and the church and hinders God’s economy. </p>

Neither Israel nor Judah has been forsaken by his God; but their land (the land of the Chaldeans) is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57265" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:5">51:5</span>). Again God’s people are told to flee from the midst of Babylon and to let each man save his life. They are not to be cut off in Babylon’s iniquity. This is a time of vengeance to Jehovah; He will give full recompense to Babylon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57266" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:6">v. 6</span>). <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57267" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:8-10">Verses 8b through 10</span> continue, “Take balm for her pain, / If perhaps she may be healed. / We tried to heal Babylon, but she is not healed; / Forsake her, and let each one of us go to his own land; / For her judgment has reached to heaven / And has been lifted up to the clouds. / Jehovah has brought forth our righteousnesses; / Come and let us relate in Zion / The work of Jehovah our God.” </p>

Thus, the violence done to them and their flesh should be on Babylon and their blood on the inhabitants of Chaldea (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57269" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:35">v. 35</span>). Therefore, Jehovah says, “Behold, I will plead your cause / And execute vengeance for you; / And I will dry up her sea / And make her <span class="pg" data-page-id="244" id="244">[244]</span> fountain dry. / And Babylon will become heaps, / A habitation of jackals, / An astonishment and a hissing, / Without inhabitant” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57270" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:36-37">vv. 36-37</span>). Then Jehovah again charges His people to come out of Babylon, saying, “Come out from the midst of her, My people, / And let each man save his life / From the burning anger of Jehovah....You who have escaped the sword, / Go and do not stand still; / Remember Jehovah from afar, / And let Jerusalem come up in your heart” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57271" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:45">vv. 45</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57272" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:50">50</span>). </p>

Jeremiah told Seraiah that when he came to Babylon, he was to read all these words and say, “O Jehovah, You have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, so that nothing should dwell in it, neither man nor animal, for it will be an eternal desolation” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57274" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:61-62">vv. 61-62</span>). Jeremiah further told him that as soon as he had finished reading this book, he was to bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates and say, “Thus Babylon will sink and will not rise up, because of the evil which I will bring upon it, and they will weary themselves” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57275" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:63-64">vv. 63-64</span>). </p>

This is proved by the great human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57276" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>. This image is Babylon from the head to the toes. </p>
<p data-content-id="zQD_kArgRVvuVoaXr8GENqU1Au0dKFYuD9dOb_IvfENB1OQYnRBDDiU1K0UAmq2vl"> As we have pointed out, the origin of Babylon was Babel, the first nation constituted by man, which opposed God, exalted man, and worshipped Satan in all the idols. Babel was formed by a mighty man named Nimrod, a type of the Antichrist. Babel has its continuation in Babylon which, in the sight of God, is the consummation of human government. At the end of the Bible, Babylon is mentioned again in its religious and material aspects (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57277" data-verses="Revelation 14:8">Rev. 14:8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57278" data-verses="Revelation 16:19">16:19</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57279" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">17—18</span>).

This indicates that communism will not be long lasting.

The religious Babylon, the Roman church, was established when the papal system was built up, and it gradually spread into political circles, until eventually the Roman church was wrapped up with and became one with the Roman Empire. Thus, in Revelation the Roman Empire is likened to a beast, and the Roman church is likened to a woman riding on a beast (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57300" data-verses="Revelation 13:1">13:1</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57301" data-verses="Revelation 17:3">17:3</span>).

This means that the world situation is under the influence of Roman politics and Roman religion. Most of the present governments were adopted based on Roman law and Roman administration. In other words, modern government is built upon Roman principles of law and government. Furthermore, the Roman church is prominent in many nations, and the pope has a high political standing. Hence, today, both politically and religiously, the entire earth has been Romanized. In a very real sense, the whole world is Roman. <span class="pg" data-page-id="249" id="249">[249]</span> </p>

It is he who will destroy the Roman church at the beginning of the great tribulation. Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57307" data-verses="Revelation 17:16">Revelation 17:16</span> says, “The ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and burn her utterly with fire.” That the ten horns and the beast will hate the harlot and make her desolate means that Antichrist and the ten kings of the restored Roman Empire will persecute the Roman church. They will make the Roman church “desolate and naked,” meaning that they will destroy her, rob her of her riches, and expose her; they will “eat her flesh,” meaning that they will kill her members; and they will “burn her utterly with fire,” meaning that they will annihilate her altogether. </p>
<p data-content-id="jTp05_l_BWl6m_8iwcy3BmmuTYnKd5UPPr4VP79Xb5RuhV_9p7EUmSfDxC8xdFqR5"> Then, at the end of the tribulation, Christ will come down from the heavens, with the overcomers as His army, to fight against Antichrist directly and defeat him and cast him alive into the lake of fire (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57308" data-verses="Revelation 19:1">Rev. 19</span>). That will be the last fighting of man against God, a fighting that began at Babel and that will increase and intensify until the war at Armageddon. With Christ’s defeat of Antichrist, the entire Roman Empire will be <span class="pg" data-page-id="250" id="250">[250]</span> destroyed and all the Roman things will be removed, cleared away, from the earth. There will be no more Roman church or Roman Empire; that is, there will be no more Babylon. Then what will be prominent on earth will not be Babylon but the New Jerusalem. </p>

We see these two cities in Jeremiah and in Revelation. In the Old Testament, in Jeremiah, Babylon came to destroy Jerusalem and to make her a ruin, a desolation. At the end of the Bible, in Revelation, there are Babylon the Great and the New Jerusalem. Eventually, Babylon the Great will be destroyed, removed from the earth, and cast into the lake of fire, and the New Jerusalem will be brought in to be the prominent center of God’s eternal kingdom in the new heaven and new earth. </p>

In the life-study of this book, my concern is not merely with the historical facts and sequence but with the spiritual significance of the historical events recorded in this book. To understand the events themselves is one thing, but to see the spiritual significance of these events is another thing. We may know the events but not know their spiritual significance. We should not read the stories in the Bible or study the Bible in black and white without knowing the spiritual significance of what we are reading or studying. Therefore, my burden regarding <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57312" data-verses="Jeremiah 46:1">chapters forty-six through fifty-one</span> is that we see the spiritual significance of Jehovah’s punishment and judgment upon the nations involved with God’s elect, Israel. </p>

First, Jeremiah spoke concerning Israel’s sin and <span class="pg" data-page-id="252" id="252">[252]</span> Jehovah’s punishment on Israel. Then he spoke concerning God’s punishment and judgment upon the nations involved with Israel. In speaking concerning the nations, he mentions Egypt first (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57313" data-verses="Jeremiah 46:2-28">46:2-28</span>) and Babylon last (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57314" data-verses="Jeremiah 50:1">chs. 50—51</span>). This indicates that, in God’s view, the world is first Egyptian and then Babylonian. However, according to historical sequence, Babylon began first, from Babel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57315" data-verses="Genesis 10:8-10">Gen. 10:8-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57316" data-verses="Genesis 11:1-9">11:1-9</span>). God called Abraham out of Chaldea, the land of Babel, into the good land. But later, when Abraham became weak, he drifted to Egypt. </p>
<p data-content-id="HxbxQoIuGW5J3nC3vS7RQ5pLaEa2nlViRTwQ0nltH0QqH5KMg8o8FS80UCDTC5N5U"> Babel is the origin, the source, of man’s worship of idols, man’s rebellion against God, and human self-exaltation. After these things began, the world became Egyptian, with Egypt signifying the world in the aspect of making a living and having entertainment. At Babel man rebelled against God, worshipped idols, and exalted man’s self, but at Babel there was no way to make a living or to have entertainment. Hence, according to the sequence in Genesis, Babel is mentioned first and then Egypt. During the time of famine, Egypt was nearly the only place that still had food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57317" data-verses="Genesis 42:1-2">Gen. 42:1-2</span>). Egypt was the place of security and enjoyment. </p>

This is a type of us, God’s New Testament elect, who are very much involved with the world in its many aspects. The nations in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57318" data-verses="Jeremiah 46:1">chapters forty-six through fifty-one</span> typify nine different aspects of the world. Today the world has even more aspects. Jeremiah presents us such a picture so that we can live a church life that is not polluted by the different aspects of the world. We need to know how to have a clear separation from the world and not be wrapped up or mixed with any of its aspects. God will come in to judge the world in all its aspects and to make a clear distinction between the church as His elect and every aspect of the world. <span class="pg" data-page-id="253" id="253">[253]</span> </p>

Around us are all kinds of aspects of the world. We need to ask ourselves what aspect of the world we are involved with. We may be involved with the desire to help others through humanitarian efforts, or we may be occupied with the enjoyment of worldly amusements. In either case, we are away from God. </p>

In addition, the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar captured the holy vessels, which were used to serve God in the temple. Other people regarded those vessels as something holy, sanctified, and separated unto God and therefore did not dare to touch them. However, Nebuchadnezzar brought a great part of these vessels to Babylon and put them in the temple of his god (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57320" data-verses="Daniel 1:1-2">Dan. 1:1-2</span>). This insulted God to the uttermost and was the reason that God’s verdict on Babylon is described as His vengeance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57321" data-verses="Jeremiah 50:15">Jer. 50:15</span>), the “vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance for His temple” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57322" data-verses="Jeremiah 51:11">51:11</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="qPEtYgsnw9DtC6P-ho1X_5A0ebkQtjw99kVW4BEgCfblL041Oqy3UdOX5R1CMSJ7p"> Babylon was the worst nation in offending God, and its king was one with Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57323" data-verses="Isaiah 14:4">Isa. 14:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57324" data-verses="Isaiah 14:11-15">11-15</span>). Babylon, therefore, is God’s number one enemy, being both the beginning and the conclusion of human government on earth. Babylon will be thoroughly condemned, punished, and judged by God. God will judge Babylon to such an extent that nothing of Babylon will remain in the universe. Thus, when God destroys the restored religious and political Babylon the Great, He will rid the earth of His number one enemy, which rebels against God, exalts man, and worships idols. </p>

We should clear away any rebellion against God, any exalting of ourselves, and any worshipping of idols. Then we will be God’s elect under His dispensing to enjoy Him. Instead of enjoying Egypt as a good place for our living, we will enjoy the Triune God, and the church life will be our living. In such a situation we will be blessed by God. </p>

God has always liked to contact man, and in this contact He has made several covenants with man. The first covenant God made with man was the covenant with the created man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57327" data-verses="Genesis 2:8-9">Gen. 2:8-9</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57328" data-verses="Genesis 2:15-17">15-17</span>), and the second was His covenant with fallen man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57329" data-verses="Genesis 3:8-21">3:8-21</span>). Although God had close and intimate contact with Abel, no covenant was made with him. After Noah passed through the flood, God came in to make a covenant with him and his sons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57330" data-verses="Genesis 9:8-17">9:8-17</span>). Then after calling Abraham, God made a covenant with him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57331" data-verses="Genesis 12:2-3">12:2-3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57332" data-verses="Genesis 12:7-8">7-8</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57333" data-verses="Genesis 15:4-18">15:4-18</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57334" data-verses="Genesis 17:1-2">17:1-2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57335" data-verses="Genesis 22:17-18">22:17-18</span>), and this covenant was repeated with Isaac (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57336" data-verses="Genesis 26:3-5">26:3-5</span>) and with Jacob (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57337" data-verses="Genesis 28:13-15">28:13-15</span>). Later, when God brought Israel out of Egypt to Mount Sinai, He made a long covenant with Israel (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57338" data-verses="Exodus 20:1">Exo. 20—23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57339" data-verses="Exodus 24:3-8">24:3-8</span>). This covenant, the covenant of the law, is called the first covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57340" data-verses="Hebrews 8:7">Heb. 8:7</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57341" data-verses="Hebrews 8:13">13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57342" data-verses="Hebrews 9:1">9:1</span>), the old covenant. After traveling in the wilderness for forty years, Israel came to the land of Moab, and there God made another covenant with them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57343" data-verses="Deuteronomy 29:1">Deut. 29—30</span>). According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57344" data-verses="2Samuel 7:1">2 Samuel 7</span>, God also made a covenant with David. Finally, in the New Testament the Lord Jesus established the new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57345" data-verses="Luke 22:20">Luke 22:20</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="256" id="256">[256]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="_1Uw53Q8BnPZ6UV9p6rGA8H0a6srItX6hl4RPQlM89czdLHmlIdPqSLe5LQNTgYYg"> In the Bible God made eight covenants with man, but He counts only two covenants: the covenant made with Israel through Moses and the new covenant, the covenant of life, which is considered the second covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57346" data-verses="Hebrews 8:7">Heb. 8:7</span>). All the other covenants —the covenants with the created man, with the fallen man, with Noah, with Abraham, with Israel in the land of Moab, and with David —are considered by God as side covenants. Still, the covenant God made with Abraham corresponds to the new covenant and is the basis for the new covenant (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57347" data-verses="Galatians 3:1">Gal. 3</span>). If we study all these covenants thoroughly, we will see that God cares for only one covenant, the new covenant of life. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="BqZPFRLgw98kbSgb8Hi1c6JHnMzmJXxKB-kWDRhfxRZL2fylKlegCgma_JzeWmXPQ">THE CONTENT OF THE NEW COVENANT —<br/>THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</h2><p data-content-id="U0NfuDerr3yjfHzjUQGmjIME1Nw_BsnW8BvVDp0BMMdMDj-ghQalUZjd0pqZu7PCO"> The content of the new covenant is the Triune God, who has been processed and consummated to become everything to God’s chosen people. This new covenant was promised to Israel in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57348" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</span> (cf. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57349" data-verses="Hebrews 8:8-13">Heb. 8:8-13</span>), and it was absolutely, thoroughly, and completely fulfilled by the Lord Jesus when He established His table (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57350" data-verses="Matthew 26:26-29">Matt. 26:26-29</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57351" data-verses="Mark 14:22-25">Mark 14:22-25</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57352" data-verses="Luke 22:19-20">Luke 22:19-20</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57353" data-verses="1Corinthians 11:23-26">1 Cor. 11:23-26</span>). In instituting the table, the Lord Jesus made a covenant with the New Testament believers. </p>

Since Jeremiah spoke regarding the new covenant, this book, in a sense, is more important than the writings of Moses, which do not say anything about the new covenant. Although Moses prophesied very much concerning Christ, the covenant God made with Israel through him had nothing to do with Jesus Christ. Based on the fact that the book of Jeremiah prophesies concerning the new covenant, the book of Jeremiah may be considered an Old Testament book that is also a New Testament book. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="9Db05uR9AaUGQrL9TYQnJinDIp9RFBx_--nuXQ8QSJFvAMz-bFHPDoBLq1h38lVCc">Its Position</h2><p data-content-id="jTp05_l_BWl6m_8iwcy3BmmWTYXCd5UPPr4VP79Xb5RuhV_9p7EUmSfDxC8xdFqR5"> The position of the covenant of the law was that of a concubine. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57354" data-verses="Galatians 4:1">Galatians 4</span> Paul tells us that Abraham had two wives, representing two covenants. Sarah, the proper wife, represents the new covenant, and Hagar, the concubine, represents the old covenant of law. Because Hagar, the concubine, symbolizes the old covenant of the law, the position of this covenant is the position of a concubine. As Abraham cast out Hagar, when Christ came He put aside the old covenant and made it of no effect, replacing it with the new covenant. </p>
<p data-content-id="TJLO-7sHzwGAeDeMbthOdEs3UP7_bsm1afQJxQDpw6mh3szmGbP-afzf3e7CVn9ps"> Furthermore, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57355" data-verses="Romans 5:20">Romans 5:20</span> Paul tells us that “the law entered in alongside.” This means that the law was added later, that it was not God’s original intention to have the law. Rather, the law later came in alongside of something that was present before the law came. This indicates that the main line of God’s economy was there already. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="nSykSi8Dzkx7rlOQ5IL8DBugSNiWpBxQ7rXdM2NhxDABuQKCvwZmuRJM-oRKkO_v6">Its Function</h2><p data-content-id="6_R3gJree1Pm-zuQPbV_niCGVsbf--FVF3H1lV9NyaB0DGVNuFYOPl6avpsgCRFWR"> Whereas Christ’s ministry is a ministry of justification, Moses’ ministry was a ministry of condemnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57356" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:9">2 Cor. 3:9a</span>). Therefore, in God’s economy Moses’ ministry is not the central line. However, without the old covenant of the law made through Moses, Jeremiah could not have exposed Israel to the uttermost. In order to expose Israel, Jeremiah often referred to the covenant of the law. Here we see that the function of the law, which is something on the negative side, is to expose our fallen condition and situation. This helps us turn to the source, to the fountain of living waters, which in the New Testament is Christ as the embodiment of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="R3DAAp7LuTzr5QTywgPF9-HJv8bjRBt-S7dzSfACjSpocGvQ54bAeboJIZavqJ8PK">JEREMIAH’S LAYING THE FOUNDATION<br/>OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2><p data-content-id="sBp2800gseLZdTSAlTlwLcuOd7aiUQ-V_g88lCODvCMQJVBjVieMZgQ8G6knVI1QC"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57357" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:1">chapter thirty-one</span> Jeremiah laid the foundation of the new covenant, prophesying that God will put His law within us; that He will write His law into our mind that we may know God; that God will be our God and we will be His people; that we will not need anyone to teach us, because we will all have a teaching life within us; and that God will <span class="pg" data-page-id="258" id="258">[258]</span> forgive our iniquity and remember our sins no longer. In the new covenant we enjoy the inner law of life. This law of life brings us God’s person and also the divine capacity of the divine life, which can accomplish everything for God to fulfill His economy. By the inner law of life we have the capacity to know God, to live God, and even to be constituted with God in His life and nature so that we may be His corporate expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="w7B2ly3akD68nMBqEd7c93DVPyjNxA198MFRr87lPFUoeqGN4RurJgqOvdEfsYiU-"> We need all the twenty-seven books of the New Testament to define this one short portion of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57358" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:1">Jeremiah 31</span>. If we understand this portion in light of the entire New Testament, we will see that in this new covenant we have the church, the kingdom of God, God’s household, the house of God as God’s dwelling place in our spirit, the new man, and the Body of Christ as the fullness of the processed and consummated Triune God. Eventually, this new covenant will bring in the millennium. Ultimately and consummately, it will bring in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="LydA6pgW62hGE3L5Yo603BbZCC8c_oJx7RQ3MfY2dPGEnkNVqPXUHGsEyrbjQDODr"> Today there are many who have believed in Christ, who have received the blessing of the new covenant, and yet are not aware of the content of the new covenant and what it accomplishes and produces. Therefore, we have the burden to emphasize the new covenant again and again. May we all see the new covenant and be fully occupied with it. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="OGG-FY948JCc0HrjqHM0n4u1XuSNayu1t3Rzs7YGi5Rsn8GmrQSi5Ks_NPFDtTRcK">THE SHELL AND THE KERNEL</h2><p data-content-id="4RV9VV4Mn4S9URwdDF3r83JvMXzJYZNpnncuPZB9ytI-xHUsBjp-XFeSekOIs7VuD"> The book of Jeremiah may be likened to a walnut: on the outside there is a hard shell, and on the inside there is a kernel. When I was young, I read Jeremiah a number of times, but I touched only the “shell” of this book; I did not see anything of the “kernel.” Gradually, the Lord has opened the shell of Jeremiah and has shown me the kernel. In this message, therefore, I have the burden to speak a word concerning the kernel of the book of Jeremiah. </p>
<p data-content-id="o9vBX-P141WnchYVMJC2Pm0jydZISB0_q0WISuR6blpcC3G4PjPvM49r0nhG4rqrf"> This kernel includes three matters—what God wants from us, what we are in our fallen condition, and what Christ is to us. Jeremiah strongly presents these three matters to us, but they are concealed within the shell. In order to see these three things, we need to “crack” the shell of Jeremiah and concentrate on the kernel inside. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3nMDVhrLh74ojb_RJNZs3FcIkAQWKqixf0ynlY6Srv9hH_PqwSgh_oJSYyF81NQR3">WHAT GOD WANTS FROM US</h2><p data-content-id="yB54I3Z-wPZFRWis37JuAjGjdTQDJk4FPUR7_CvFFqaSXnCbOhjnjSopuViHa12KC"> What God wants from us is mentioned mainly in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57365" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">2:13</span>, which reveals that God is the fountain of living waters. God wants us to take Him as the fountain of living waters for our living. This means that He wants us to take Him as the source, the fountain, of our being. How can we take Him as our source? The only way to take God as the fountain of living waters is to drink of Him day by day. By drinking we take into us the living water that issues from God as the fountain. </p>
<p data-content-id="8XPZHdfo_xBvcKwjljmJJPBRv_lap8nfEvkJKYKizadJO2nJ4lfaNJTZ2qbaZw81A"> The importance of drinking of God as the fountain is <span class="pg" data-page-id="260" id="260">[260]</span> illustrated in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57366" data-verses="John 4:1">John 4</span>. To the Samaritan woman who had come to the well to draw water and whom the Lord Jesus had asked to give Him a drink, He said, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57367" data-verses="John 4:10">v. 10</span>). When she asked Him where He could get this living water, He answered, “Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57368" data-verses="John 4:14">v. 14</span>). The Lord’s word here indicates that whatever we drink becomes one with us. When we drink of God as the fountain of living waters, He becomes one with us, and we become one with Him. The more we drink of God, the more He is one with us and the more we are one with Him and constituted with Him in His life and nature. </p>
<p data-content-id="0R8I3Wh5f40wZoXfJwUCOPkZRXq1vPfjOMW-c-oNYxLoUPy8yNdoAk3rFV5QErhyU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57369" data-verses="Jeremiah 2:13">Jeremiah 2:13</span> says, “My people have committed two evils: / They have forsaken Me, / The fountain of living waters, / To hew out for themselves cisterns, / Broken cisterns, / Which hold no water.” The most evil thing in the eyes of God is to forsake Him as the source, as the fountain of living waters, and to turn to some other source. All other sources are idols. In this verse the idols are likened to broken cisterns, which cannot hold water. People today are busy hewing out for themselves all kinds of cisterns. Actually, these cisterns are idols. As we consider this situation, we need to realize that God wants us to take Him as the fountain, the source, of our life and our being. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="7FQUWw5nVhs57CauWe1z_c3H-1baTWaGoQ0VcRlPqqhv3YCOFg70BWlUDx10WbT18">WHAT WE ARE IN OUR FALLEN CONDITION</h2><p data-content-id="_1Uw53Q8BnPZ6UV9p6rGA93Qa44TItX6hl4RPQlM89czdLHmlIdPqSLe5LQNTgYYg"> Another aspect of the kernel of the book of Jeremiah is the exposure of what we are in our fallen condition. In this matter Jeremiah is very deep but also very simple. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57370" data-verses="Jeremiah 17:9">17:9</span> he speaks regarding the human heart, saying, “The heart is deceitful above all things / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?” Our heart is deceitful to the uttermost and incurable. Just as our heart is incurable, so our fallen nature is unchangeable. Thus, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57371" data-verses="Jeremiah 13:23">13:23</span> Jeremiah says, “Can the Cushite change his skin, / Or the leopard his spots? / Then you also may be able to do good, / Who are accustomed to do <span class="pg" data-page-id="261" id="261">[261]</span> evil.” In our fallen condition we are corrupt and rotten; there is no way for us to change, correct, or improve ourselves. The disciples of Confucius tried to use his teachings to improve themselves, but they have failed. As fallen human beings, we are incurable and unchangeable. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ryNgMdLLxGzNdPUZnHlJ-wZoWKIv7cXZyI_bjltu4X1W1mcuvEgdbXrzjpYp62B4L">The Shoot of David</h2><p data-content-id="dA9g112R6wtwAVhAjoQ_6ocu6DXO-favTe84a2fkR6ZKnV1iXOelgVWn5GULkVdQV"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="57372" data-verses="Jeremiah 23:5-6">Jeremiah 23:5 and 6</span> say, “Behold, days are coming, / Declares Jehovah, / When I will raise up to David a righteous Shoot....And this is His name by which He will be called, / Jehovah our righteousness.” Although Christ is God, He became a Shoot, or Sprout, of David. This means that He was incarnated to be a descendant of David. As a Shoot, the Sprout, of David, Christ is tender, living, and fresh. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="QOcu1PTGsauWKCuTN-ZLs9jU-o9e9Yo4bls-LboSR19ZNV2y0006XK5EQhWcOdpBP">Jehovah Our Righteousness</h2><p data-content-id="KO1Ppd7egl5MxDTzJ27MzcZ7spMJuZube8axoy99zrV9Hfa79zsxHBf3C_6jMFB18"> Christ, the righteous Shoot of David, is called Jehovah our righteousness. In our fallen condition we are corrupt, sinful, deceitful, incurable, and unchangeable. How could we ever be righteous before God? In ourselves this is impossible, but we can become righteous in Christ. Christ came to die on the cross for our sins, accomplishing redemption for us. Based upon Christ’s redemption, God is able to forgive our sins, to forget our sins, and to justify us. Furthermore, with the redemption of Christ as the foundation, Christ Himself has become our righteousness. Not only have we been justified by God, but God has given Christ to us to be our righteousness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57373" data-verses="1Corinthians 1:30">1 Cor. 1:30</span>). It is a wonderful fact that Christ has become one with us to be our righteousness. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="l_gYKm68xmWHDmvlR-_dO49IeoJIbMKJSISuKTTEgKhLDjdeuLU2Ksf0mFVTSIRGq">The Divine Life</h2><p data-content-id="OGG-FY948JCc0HrjqHM0n4u1XvWtayu1t3Rzs7YGi5Rsn8GmrQSi5Ks_NPFDtTRcK"> Outwardly, we are justified, having Christ as our righteousness, but inwardly we are still empty. Therefore, we need Christ to be something else to us. We need Christ as the divine life, the divine life that is wrought into our inner being <span class="pg" data-page-id="262" id="262">[262]</span> (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="57374" data-verses="Jeremiah 31:33">Jer. 31:33</span>). This life is a law which works in us to dispense into our being all that God is in His rich being. As a result of this dispensing, this transfusing of God Himself into us, we are no longer empty. On the contrary, we are filled with the dispensing Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="4RV9VV4Mn4S9URwdDF3r83JvMWntYZNpnncuPZB9ytI-xHUsBjp-XFeSekOIs7VuD"> The inner law of the divine life within us has the capacity to make us one with God. In this life with its law, God is our God, and we are His people. The way for God to be our God is His divine life, and the way for us to be His people is also the divine life. Eventually, in the divine life and by the working of the law of the divine life, God will be wrought into us, and we will live Him and be constituted with Him in His life and nature but not, of course, in His Godhead. </p>
<p data-content-id="o9vBX-P141WnchYVMJC2Pm0jyf9wSB0_q0WISuR6blpcC3G4PjPvM49r0nhG4rqrf"> Now we can see what God wants from us, what we are in our fallen condition, and what Christ is to us. God wants us to take Him as our source and to drink of Him every day so that He may become the river of the water of life within us. In our fallen condition we are hopeless, utterly corrupt, incurable, and unchangeable. But Christ has come to be our righteousness and our inner life. Outwardly, He is our righteousness for us to be justified by God. Inwardly, He is the divine life to fill us, to make us one with God, and even to constitute us with God that we may live God. Then we will be a corporate Body, the organism of the Triune God. This is the kernel of the book of Jeremiah. </p>
