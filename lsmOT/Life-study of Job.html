<p data-content-id="lu1rWVFMXAvXHaWwYt-TioSE34Vg65Xj8okY2jP3pP7sA_VmcJwe7gAiEHtHMiw2k"> 1) God deals with His saints for the purpose that they may gain Him as life. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NI4f6RH5E4QGj2Pf17QuWpywB_H3NE7R55-Q5vBSesL0recPo1UAxyd6s4vnwkJ3P">I. THE NAME</h2><p data-content-id="tpP37fHpiAj4rvTMHcC1yJlXJP_Q9w2NO3Bm0UrSTfsybX1rvzTzD-tHZTiccChYP"> The book of Job is named after its writer, Job, whose name means “hated” or “persecuted,” signifying what Job suffered of Satan, the enemy of God. Job surely suffered Satan’s hatred and persecution. </p>
<p data-content-id="hCrRxb5iWEiiuF6H1mo2mzIm9-tXNSKjE63fiJfvPUSmnT_C3kHcfb5u7pNbEaD7N"> In this book Satan as the enemy of God is a mystery to us. We cannot understand in full why Satan still has not only the freedom but also the “civil right” to go to God’s place and attend one of the councils held by God with His angels. Of course, what is described in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47287" data-verses="Job 1:1-2">Job 1 and 2</span> took place two thousand years before Christ died on the cross to destroy the devil, who has the might of death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47288" data-verses="Hebrews 2:14">Heb. 2:14</span>). Since Christ destroyed Satan on the cross, we may think that Satan no longer has the “civil right” to go into the presence of God. However, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47289" data-verses="Revelation 12:10">Revelation 12:10</span>, Satan still accuses us in the presence of God day and night. This right will be taken away from Satan at the beginning of the great tribulation. <span class="pg" data-page-id="2" id="2">[2]</span> When the overcomers arrive in the heavens, Satan will be cast down from the heavens to the earth. From that time onward, Satan will no longer have the right to come into the presence of God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="UIQOnevT9J1jipE6xb4eybcPnn_ON2xauBAu1hdOdN_zIrmZYe1fbWpdfODuG88rm">II. THE WRITER</h2><p data-content-id="MFNsqyUzUamIhTJE24OnYk9XX0iDG8HxGpqszonA6YCdPELFOtO_CjQxPRxFZMVdK"> The writer of the book of Job was Job. This is confirmed by <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47290" data-verses="Ezekiel 14:12">Ezekiel 14:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47291" data-verses="Ezekiel 14:14">14</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47292" data-verses="Ezekiel 14:20">20</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47293" data-verses="James 5:11">James 5:11</span>. These verses are a proof of the authenticity of this book. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="VOtlOdgrPMjWPQKL7r0SySd5QtFRhPOODrLqx2UYb8cM7VDI7r651PIfKrCgLIoJj">III. THE TIME</h2><p data-content-id="iW7odAwFn6M_vn6H50zofqH44E5UxdGbtd8WSDlh-7gKzwV-KsbolqbLfu4tzqPX5"> According to the way of Job’s nomadic living (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47294" data-verses="Job 1:3">Job 1:3</span>) and the way he offered the burnt offering for his children, this book should have been written at the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47295" data-verses="Job 1:5">v. 5</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47296" data-verses="Genesis 22:13">Gen. 22:13</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47297" data-verses="Genesis 31:54">31:54</span>), about 2000 B.C. This means that Job was written five hundred years before Moses wrote the Pentateuch. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="1U015OwRXAIob_SOImV2AsbwMZBNyZK4Lwgno4-lc2du5PtxzodTRPh1E-ubKI7xa">IV. THE PLACE</h2><p data-content-id="91WP5pqwF3GeT4dZnsCQLeY3TOSgBfNMBX4k5yl_wQ6n84JwqQgJtQ5KU9LUZXA01"> The book of Job tells us that Job lived in Uz, a city in Edom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47298" data-verses="Lamentations 4:21">Lam. 4:21</span>), west of the Arabian desert. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jNC2uuAHkXMsJoacm1HZhNqKRFlZfcxSeR2c-5zpPbACSVDIV6ph9SGbrosrq4Ngo">V. THE FORM OF WRITING</h2><p data-content-id="T8FlGRth-6Dzr11LrBrYpWyjb9QVVgiqYaGeaPr7UpSsZpzB--XVOOKxYGXo_75mi"> The book of Job is poetic in form, with the exception of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47299" data-verses="Job 1:1">chapters one and two</span> and the last eleven verses of <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47300" data-verses="Job 42:10">chapter forty-two</span>. Job is the first of the five poetic books in the Scriptures; the other four are the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. </p>

<p data-content-id="Rokq5hX0Vah3qLVg4I6mYNKFfI9cuuPbBfuT0AKL5hljVB5uuwsUPIVnHsl9OlOcR"> The contents of the book of Job are the expressions of the sentiments of godly men, including Job, his three friends, and the young man Elihu. This book is the record of the speaking of these five parties plus the speaking of God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="3" id="3">[3]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="sZrC8zOWInDRC4bQ132NgqCElPREOMb86SFuUaY_EwHDSNlNX5M8oYs40JVqj0W4o">1.

<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="LE0U7mbRuxHwEP0fSBNqx0NtfK_LEJw_JSvMSymIE7qHIabzqql3mQW44_FljuwBj">2.

This is the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="ZxI9cnvSgtMqm1OSHt51p3uqVKjPLzv9tgRwwmNir-R25AVjDLqGUFJGsSmNIhTB9">3.

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="F5gouwIlHW1OZ5CU_WNtn8Z5rFJGiXhrspMkGXwOR2jeTZWdbjjcvMFEhHU8tF1Ox">B.

The debates between Job and his three friends were mainly concerning judgment. They reasoned that Job must have been wrong in some regard or aspect and that the things which happened to him were a judgment from God. They may also have thought that Job’s children were wrong and died because of God’s judgment. Thus, the contents of this book involve the matter of God’s judgment. </p>

God Creating Man according to His Desire</h2><p data-content-id="vBSp6y8_glqCO4TVABrIOT-qkSgMBkgC2Zwvuo6axOAhCcjtHIpxQwPpo1QyB7AN7"> Furthermore, it was according to His desire that God created man that He might express Himself through man. In <span class="pg" data-page-id="4" id="4">[4]</span> order to be God’s expression, man must be under God’s rule, and this involves God’s judgment. </p>

No one will escape God’s judgment. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47301" data-verses="Romans 2:5-6">Romans 2:5 and 6</span> say, “According to your hardness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to each according to his works.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47302" data-verses="Acts 17:31">Acts 17:31</span> we are told that God “has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated.” This man is Jesus Christ, who has been charged by God to judge the living and the dead (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47303" data-verses="Acts 10:42">Acts 10:42</span>). Sooner or later, all will be judged by the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="u72kAJSdv5iq4y5s9KKVYgDoN4pJh-jfn308T5pXEItyoQ_NJZnrE02tEIRLcByhU">4. Some of His Judgments Being Temporary,<br/>and Some Being Ultimate</h2><p data-content-id="f1L7jK9t6ENjmxucoKpuCgaIHcn5Rwu_PumKI1XqZ_TP669brdAaI0gSQR9hknD4I"> Some of God’s judgments are temporary, like that on Sodom, and some are ultimate, like that at the great white throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47304" data-verses="Revelation 20:11-15">Rev. 20:11-15</span>). Concerning this, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47305" data-verses="1Timothy 5:24">1 Timothy 5:24</span> says, “The sins of some men are openly manifest, going before to judgment; and for others, they also follow after.” The sins of certain persons come to God’s judgment earlier, and the sins of others come later. God’s judgment, whether earlier or later, depends on His timing. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="I4LaSIw89KK1RQOLPKRMkjvhnVEPi6kG4YIlmJ5JQwX7q3bSa1RmEZ8in5cY5TLqO">5. Some People Prospering and Flourishing<br/>for Awhile, Even though They Are Sinful and Evil</h2><p data-content-id="H-W7Xbyzzvx2-IJ1DX_lDbauuqjt9vMRGagK-QPH0v4AJ86Cpz31r2GnhfP1vRVpI"> Because some of God’s judgments are temporary and others are ultimate, some people prosper and flourish, even though they are sinful and evil. Some suffer natural calamities because of the curse brought in through man’s sin (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47306" data-verses="Genesis 3:17-18">Gen. 3:17-18</span>). What they suffer may not be due to their sinful deeds. Because Adam fell, committing sin, the curse came in as a kind of judgment. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47307" data-verses="Romans 8:20-22">Romans 8:20 through 22</span>, “the creation was made subject to vanity” and, subject to the <span class="pg" data-page-id="5" id="5">[5]</span> slavery of corruption, “groans together and travails in pain together.” This also is a kind of judgment. Because of this judgment, people sometimes suffer natural calamities, even though they may not commit sin. Not all those who suffer a calamity such as a devastating hurricane suffer because they are sinful. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="XWguS6LLPk6Jlg41lxleJTwCuTRYU7tOT0mUeBHLvWlWEWGzWLSdkTthOoJ1Reqxj">6. Different Views concerning God’s Judgment</h2><p data-content-id="kPaHTugPPe89nd8axvLN_tej0gdsVteUVeNJznDb8D4_xlvyXLhfqVIUEskr3LhgN"> Job and his friends might have had different views in what they insisted on and debated about regarding God’s judgment. Much of their debate resulted from different views concerning God’s judgment. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="JjFzzQ_Qie2ytqq6nkUeVyhINkAc1E1SdCT1WO8WV6OUjqjm3piY68cQQaydykwgv">7. Job and His Friends<br/>Not Seeing the Positive Aspect of God’s Economy<br/>in Dealing with His Holy People</h2><p data-content-id="z6MyXQhaw5k-LBH1CCXsY1_8CrIQj7T4GTxYo75yweJ120cWEfAx-Nm-BmukTIq_Q"> It is evident that Job and his friends did not see the positive aspect of God’s economy in dealing with His holy people. That is, God wants to strip, not to judge, His holy ones that He might gain them so that they might gain Him more. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGzGatf7NsfAyxfkUqLe37SraI1s6z6iCVo5h_8JLJJqxAuV_-9UN4sKOlBjrJLHs"> Job’s friends thought that what he was suffering was a matter of God’s judgment. However, Job’s sufferings were not God’s judgment but God’s stripping. The Sabeans took away Job’s oxen and donkeys, the “fire of God” devoured his sheep, the Chaldeans took his camels, and a great wind caused the death of his sons and daughters (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47308" data-verses="Job 1:13-19">Job 1:13-19</span>). All these things were God’s stripping, but Job and his friends regarded them as God’s judgment. Throughout the centuries, many readers of the book of Job have had the same concept, thinking that Job suffered because of God’s judgment. </p>
<p data-content-id="b-q5XPKHb6vrf9nmeBv6YDi3lIpvyYCqR_zrJidNSnZboWufq731dwUx6aZnemkh2"> Have you ever had the thought that quite often God does something to strip you? Even though you may not be wrong, suddenly certain things happen to you, and God uses these things to strip you. Before I came into the Lord’s recovery, the word <em>stripping</em> was not in my spiritual dictionary. I had heard about judgment, punishment, and chastisement but not about stripping. It was from Brother Nee that I learned about God’s stripping. <span class="pg" data-page-id="6" id="6">[6]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="5v3HlaC7WfrHKR3w18yyBIzas4FvQriotcTrofucRGlKhiklEdrXslrVYDqR_w_up"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47320" data-verses="Job 1:1">Job 1:1</span> says, “There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and this man was perfect and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil.” Being perfect is related to our inner man, and being upright is related to our outer man. Furthermore, to be upright means that we are not crooked or biased. </p>
<p data-content-id="aGzGatf7NsfAyxfkXqLKx7SraI1s6z6iCVo5h_8JLJJqxAuV_-9UN4sKOlBjrJLHs"> In addition to being perfect inwardly and upright outwardly, Job feared God positively and turned away from evil negatively. However, even with the positive matter of fearing God, there is not anything that is actually positive. God did not create man merely to fear Him without doing anything wrong. The Bible tells us that God created man in His own image and after His likeness that man may express Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47321" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). This is the most positive thing among all positive things. To fear God and turn away from evil is not adequate, and actually this is not positive. The most positive thing is to express God. To express God is higher than fearing God and turning away from evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="b-q5XPKHb6vrf9nmdBvueDi3lIpvyYCqR_zrJidNSnZboWufq731dwUx6aZnemkh2"> Another word used in relation to Job the man is <em>integrity.</em> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47322" data-verses="Job 2:3">2:3</span> Jehovah tells Satan that Job “still holds fast his integrity.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47323" data-verses="Job 2:9">verse 9</span> Job’s wife asks him, “Do you still hold fast <span class="pg" data-page-id="10" id="10">[10]</span> your integrity?” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47324" data-verses="Job 27:5">27:5</span> Job says to his friends, “Until I die, I will not put away my integrity from me.” Finally, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47325" data-verses="Job 31:6">31:6</span> Job declares, “Let God know my integrity.” Whereas the words <em>perfect</em> and <em>upright</em> are adjectives, the word <em>integrity</em> is a noun. Integrity is the totality of being perfect and being upright; it is the totality of perfection plus uprightness. With respect to Job, integrity is the total expression of what he is. In character he is perfect and upright, and in his ethics he has a high standard of integrity. </p>

Because feasting, an excess in eating, can be worldly, Job sanctified his children after their days of feasting. He offered the burnt offerings for them continually. He surely was a godly father. </p>

Only <span class="pg" data-page-id="11" id="11">[11]</span> God knew that Job had a need, that he was short of God. Because of His loving concern for Job, God held a council in the heavens to talk about Job. </p>

<p data-content-id="4Z3ZpDvorgWtdhNEe_8M1egog-zO0jRNYJOE6XiRy834s8WLOMrxqBM5uykzo1Hnq"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47336" data-verses="Isaiah 14:15">Isaiah 14:15</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47337" data-verses="Ezekiel 28:16-17">Ezekiel 28:16-17</span> Satan was condemned by God and even sentenced by God. Yet in His wisdom and sovereignty God did not execute His judgment over Satan. He still has given Satan a certain limited time so that he can do something to meet some negative need in the fulfillment of God’s economy. God could not and would not ask any of His many excellent angels to do what was needed to damage Job. Without Satan, there would have been no one to do the ugly work of damaging Job in order to strip him of everything that he might be full of God. </p>
<p data-content-id="ok7bGt0pYndF_JXZQo7TFFXgW_oH760OMp75doRxuGAj4er8XnBp3UqChwPIwfiM5"> We may use the case of Judas in the New Testament as an illustration. One day the Lord Jesus said, “Was it not I who chose you, the twelve? Yet one of you is a devil” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47338" data-verses="John 6:70">John 6:70</span>). Why did the Lord choose Judas to be one of the twelve when He knew that Judas would betray Him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47339" data-verses="John 13:2">John 13:2</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47340" data-verses="John 13:27">27</span>)? Regarding a particular aspect of God’s eternal economy, there was the need of Judas. Without Judas, how could the Lord Jesus have been betrayed, and without being betrayed, how could He have gone to the cross? Thus, there was the need for Judas. </p>
<p data-content-id="32kxBpqEA8Y5ihk1aEp1q0MOiIlYffyQ1Dyd5XdYT5brTMwHFsT-wu2CtB_YnAgGO"> The situation is similar with Satan in the book of Job. There was the need for someone to damage Job, not to judge him but to strip him of everything. Job had been laboring under God’s blessing for many years and he had accumulated many things. He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a great many servants. He had a dear wife and <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> seven sons and three daughters. Moreover, Job was very successful in being perfect and upright and in holding to his integrity. His possessions, success, and attainment made him a contented and satisfied person. Although Job was full of possessions and full of his attainment, he did not have God within him. As God looked upon Job, He might have said, “Job, what shall I do with you? You are full of your possessions and your attainment, but you are not full of Me. You have Me in name, but you do not have Me within you.” Thus, for God’s dealing with Job, Satan was needed. Satan was the unique one in the universe who could and who would fulfill God’s intention of stripping Job of his possessions and his ethical attainment. </p>

We should not think that God was caught by Satan, for Satan was caught by God to do something for Him—to strip Job for God.

God’s consuming is to exhaust us, and God’s stripping is to take away our riches from us. First, God stripped Job of his possessions, and then God consumed him. Job’s suffering of the plague on his body was a consuming. Day by day and hour by hour, Job was being consumed. In the New Testament God’s consuming and stripping become pleasant things.

There were pressures on every side, yet Paul was not constricted. Every day he was cast down, but he did not perish. Paul did not curse the day of his birth, and he did not say that he preferred to die rather than to live. On the contrary, after much consideration Paul said that he still preferred to live, not to die, because to him to live was Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47400" data-verses="Philippians 1:21-25">Phil. 1:21-25</span>). Paul’s living Christ was for him to magnify Christ. His desire was to magnify Christ whether through life or through death (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47401" data-verses="Philippians 1:20">v. 20</span>). He did not care for life or death; he cared only for magnifying Christ. </p>

Renewing can be consummated only by consuming. If you are not consumed, you cannot be renewed. This kind of renewing by consuming adds to the weight of glory that you will share in the coming ages. We will all share the Lord’s glory, but the weight of glory will differ among the believers. Through God’s consuming, the glory that we will share will become an eternal weight. </p>

Instead of caring about our affliction, we need to care for the increase of the weight of glory.

He knew that the more he suffered, the more weight of glory he would share in eternity. </p>

He said that the innocent and the upright (the good) will never perish (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47424" data-verses="Job 4:7">v. 7</span>) and that those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble (the evil) reap the same (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47425" data-verses="Job 4:8">v. 8</span>). Speaking in a poetic manner, Eliphaz continued, saying, “By the breath of God they perish, / And by the blast of His anger they are consumed. / The roaring of the lion and the sound of the fierce lion / And the teeth of the young lions are broken; / The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, / And the whelps of the lioness are scattered” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47426" data-verses="Job 4:9-11">vv. 9-11</span>). </p>

These teachings did not come up to the standard of the divine revelation in the New Testament, that is, that man’s standing before God is based on how much of God he has gained. Eliphaz should have asked Job how much of God he had gained, but at that time the divine revelation had not reached such a level. Therefore, we should sympathize with Eliphaz in his limited understanding. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="I4LaSIw89KK1RQOLLKRUgjvhnVEPi6kG4YIlmJ5JQwX7q3bSa1RmEZ8in5cY5TLqO">III.

Job was suffering and was waiting to receive something from his friend, but Eliphaz did not minister anything to Job. This should be a warning to us regarding our speaking to the saints and our prophesying in the church meetings. Our words should not be vain but should minister the supply of life. </p>

Eliphaz said, “As <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> for me, I would seek after God, / And I would commit my cause to God, / Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47433" data-verses="Job 5:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>). This kind of speaking did not afford any kind of supply to Job in his suffering. Job was in one realm, and Eliphaz was in another realm. Thus, Eliphaz’s words were words of waste and vanity. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="JjFzzQ_Qie2ytqq6jkUGZyhINkAc1E1SdCT1WO8WV6OUjqjm3piY68cQQaydykwgv">V.

He admonished him not to reject God the Almighty’s chastening, so that Job might be blessed by God in His ways (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47434" data-verses="Job 5:17-27">vv. 17-27</span>). Eliphaz said to Job, “Behold, blessed is the man whom God corrects; / Therefore do not reject the chastening of the Almighty. / For He wounds, but He binds up; / He strikes, but His hands heal” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47435" data-verses="Job 5:17-18">vv. 17-18</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="aGzGatf7NsfAyxfkQqLCx7SraI1s6z6iCVo5h_8JLJJqxAuV_-9UN4sKOlBjrJLHs"> Eliphaz’s diagnosis of Job’s situation was altogether wrong; he was a useless physician. Later, Job said to his three friends, “Physicians of no value are you all” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47436" data-verses="Job 13:4">13:4b</span>). As such a physician, Eliphaz was unable to diagnose Job’s condition. </p>
<p data-content-id="b-q5XPKHb6vrf9nmaBvmeDi3lIpvyYCqR_zrJidNSnZboWufq731dwUx6aZnemkh2"> I am happy that we are now studying the book of Job. However, I am somewhat concerned that we may come to this book merely to gain more knowledge. We may condemn the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but we may add to the growth of the tree of knowledge by picking up mere knowledge from our study of Job. </p>
<p data-content-id="q9LWByW9sowyHnHDj-lm8YyaQHMmdqODVOmh-4Xsh45TftShz7ofquSfsTTNDV8XS"> We need to see that the entire Bible is a book on God’s eternal economy. In His economy God’s intention is to dispense Himself into us to be our life and our nature that we may be the same as He is in life and nature in order to express Him. What, then, about the stripping and the consuming? God’s stripping and God’s consuming are to tear us down. We are fallen and natural men. As such men, we need to be torn down. God must tear us down. Then God can have a base, a way, to build us up again. </p>
<p data-content-id="ywVha1__CW68RryIdV1AF_YsNSiGh9dXSMGONCAqRafMHio9AO0-5PpLPL5EeQZvV"> Many Christians think that fallen man needs help so that he can be made whole. However, in His economy God’s intention is not to make fallen man whole. Rather, God’s intention <span class="pg" data-page-id="35" id="35">[35]</span> is to tear us down and rebuild us with Himself as our life and our nature that we may be persons who are absolutely one with Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_7FAJWE6u9THMs6dMboubipY9mwwcfvTuycMJYyjH_RQug54iXh5grg6PMG3VoJp"> The book of Job shows us that God, through Satan as an ugly tool, was tearing Job down by two ways: stripping and consuming. God’s stripping and consuming were exercised over Job to tear Job down that God might have a base and a way to rebuild him with God Himself that he might become a God-man. This is what we should receive in our study of Job. </p>

He said, “Oh that my vexation were weighed indeed, / And that my ruin were lifted onto the scales together with it! / For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; / Therefore my words have been rash” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47440" data-verses="Job 6:2-3">vv. 2-3</span>). Then he went on to say that the arrows of the Almighty were with him and were the poison of which his spirit drank up and that the terrors of God were arrayed like an army against him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47441" data-verses="Job 6:4">v. 4</span>). </p>

Job said, “Oh that I might have my request, / And that God would grant me what I long for; / That God would be willing to crush me; / That He would release His hand and cut me off!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47443" data-verses="Job 6:8-9">vv. 8-9</span>). In his speaking Job surely was different from Paul, who rejoiced triumphantly when he was about to be martyred. <span class="pg" data-page-id="38" id="38">[38]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="4Z3ZpDvorgWtdhNEa_8Azegog-zO0jRNYJOE6XiRy834s8WLOMrxqBM5uykzo1Hnq"> “What is my strength, that I should wait? / And what is my end, that I should be patient? / Is my strength the strength of stones? / Or is my flesh bronze? / Is there any help for me at all within me, / And has all wisdom been driven away from me?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47444" data-verses="Job 6:11-13">vv. 11-13</span>). Here Job was challenging God, asking Him how much He would require of him. It seemed to Job that God was treating him as if he was stone or bronze. Job’s word regarding wisdom indicates that he had been exhausted in every way and had become empty. </p>

Job said to them, “To him who is fainting there should be kindness from his friend, / Else he will forsake the fear of the Almighty. / My brothers have dealt as treacherously as a desert brook, / As the rivulets of the desert brooks that pass away, / Which are turbid because of the ice, / And into which the snow hides itself. / When they are scorched, they are completely consumed; / When it is hot, they are dried up from their place” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47446" data-verses="Job 6:14-17">vv. 14-17</span>). Here Job compared his friends to water brooks that did not have much water. He also compared them to brooks that were turbid, dark, because of ice and snow and that were eventually scorched by the sun and became dry. Job was saying that his friends did not have any “water” with which to supply him as he was fainting. </p>

He loathed life and would not live forever (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47455" data-verses="Job 7:16">v. 16a</span>). He concluded by saying to God, “If I have sinned, what have I done to You, / O Watcher of man? / Why have You made me Your target so that I have become a burden to myself? / And why do You not forgive my transgression / And take away my iniquity? / For now I may lie down in the dust; / And You will seek me out, and I will not be” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47456" data-verses="Job 7:20-21">vv. 20-21</span>). This was Job’s complaint as he vindicated himself to God. <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="5v3HlaC7WfrHKR3wx8yfKIzas4FvQriotcTrofucRGlKhiklEdrXslrVYDqR_w_up">VII. JOB, LIKE HIS FRIENDS,<br/>BEING HALTED IN THE KNOWLEDGE<br/>OF RIGHT AND WRONG,<br/>NOT KNOWING GOD’S ECONOMY</h2><p data-content-id="NI4f6RH5E4QGj2Pfy7QiUpywB_H3NE7R55-Q5vBSesL0recPo1UAxyd6s4vnwkJ3P"> Job, like his friends, was halted in the knowledge of right and wrong, not knowing God’s economy, not realizing in an adequate way the purpose of God’s creating of man. He and his friends were devoid of the divine revelation and of the experience of the divine life. He had no idea that God had no intention to increase his perfection, uprightness, righteousness, and integrity. Rather, God’s intention was to strip all these human virtues which he had as his contentment, that he could seek and gain only God Himself. Neither his friends nor he were in the line of the tree of life as God ordained man to be. </p>
<p data-content-id="tpP37fHpiAj4rvTMAcC5wJlXJP_Q9w2NO3Bm0UrSTfsybX1rvzTzD-tHZTiccChYP"> God put the book of Job into the Bible as a black background. The speaking of Job and his friends indicated that although they apparently were godly men, they were short of God, and they did not express God. Job and his friends came together to debate, not to fellowship. They had nothing of God to fellowship with one another. </p>
<p data-content-id="hCrRxb5iWEiiuF6Hymo6gzIm9-tXNSKjE63fiJfvPUSmnT_C3kHcfb5u7pNbEaD7N"> We need to consider our speaking today in the church meetings. As we are practicing the New Testament way, we desire to nourish, to feed, all the saints that they may be perfected, equipped, to speak for God. What we want to hear is nothing other than God in Christ with the church. We speak what we are, we speak what we have, we speak what we enjoy, and we speak what we love and appreciate. If we love Christ and appreciate God in Christ, that is what we will speak. Then our prophesying in the church meetings will be rich in God with Christ and with the church. However, many have been members of the Body of Christ for years, but still they cannot speak even a short word for Christ. We may talk about Christ, but we may not live Christ or have the practice of appreciating Christ or exalting Christ. If this is our situation, how can we minister Christ to others by speaking Him for the divine dispensing? I hope that from now on our church life will be full of Christ, with Christ in our praying, praising, and prophesying. <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="UIQOnevT9J1jipE62b4S0bcPnn_ON2xauBAu1hdOdN_zIrmZYe1fbWpdfODuG88rm"> The Bible is a consistent book. It begins with God, and it ends with God. It begins with the tree of life, and it ends with the tree of life. It begins with the river of living water, and it ends with the river of living water. This shows us the consistency of the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="MFNsqyUzUamIhTJEx4Orak9XX0iDG8HxGpqszonA6YCdPELFOtO_CjQxPRxFZMVdK"> In this consistent book, the subject is God’s economy, God’s eternal plan, God’s arrangement, to have man to contain Christ—to have Christ as man’s life, as man’s nature, and even as man’s person. Our having Christ as our life, our nature, and our person means that we are constituted with Christ. As a result of being constituted with Christ, we become a Christ-man, a Christian. Then we express Christ by living Him, by magnifying Him, and by exalting Him. When we come together, whatever we do—our singing, praying, speaking, prophesying—will be an expression of Christ. </p>

<p data-content-id="xcBelsFoKBKqGldYS74WrcuHIzuwxp53_Rj3xXKybKy79uIHodFHOTy-sTaWtEGEf"> Before we come to Bildad’s rebuttal in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47461" data-verses="Job 8:1">chapter eight</span>, I would like to say something further concerning Job’s self-vindication in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47462" data-verses="Job 6:1">chapters six</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47463" data-verses="Job 7:1">seven</span>. Job’s vindication of himself in these chapters is an extract of the whole book. The entire book of Job is actually a kind of vindication. </p>
<p data-content-id="ruJXf7h9c1kanzo62yhC4SKQJU0OwWWXGJN3jJ-jizouerWpmisJQ4ttYoVHfFjeb"> As he vindicated himself, Job stated his grievances, challenged God, blamed his friends, justified himself, and expressed that he had the common knowledge of the vanity and end of human life. Job was challenging God and his friends to give him an answer. Actually, the entire book of Job, which has become a big problem to many Christians, needs an answer. As we will see, the needed answer is found not in the book of Job but in the New Testament. </p>
<p data-content-id="dH9hAkXiiF-7k7uGKnQyBsKx9rdrkllOzbLZ-a4sQ05stcuWf_c-TxgrK2gqN13UD"> After stating his grievances, longing for his vexation to be weighed and his ruin to be lifted onto the scales together with it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47464" data-verses="Job 6:2">6:2</span>), Job challenged God concerning how much God would require of him. Job seemed to be saying, “God, I have done what You have required me to do. What else do You want? What do You want me to be, and what do You want me to do? Because You did not tell me these things, I am puzzled.” When we come to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47465" data-verses="Job 9:1">chapter nine</span>, we will see that Job wanted an opportunity to present his “case” before God in “court,” with himself as the plaintiff and God as the defendant. However, <span class="pg" data-page-id="44" id="44">[44]</span> Job expected that God, who is almighty and wise, would win the case. As a result, Job felt that he had no way out of his situation. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q_6SBW44g52pELlZyabE48nI5NA-dy4tNzW0PnFTR1U6VsPMAyjU6KJVbLS1DcrUL"> After challenging God, Job turned to his friends, blaming them for not showing kindness to him, who was fainting under the striking of God. Job seemed to be saying to them, “Your way is not right. You reprove me, condemn me, and despise me. This is not love, and this is not kindness. I need direction. You should tell me what my direction should be. Tell me where I should go and what I should do.” </p>
<p data-content-id="KTsQm0Aqc4vYwK6u2KP1A8XjPLLidGGOpRx5e2Y4hzb9RcA0YYYYpl5HK8WmIFq-L"> Next Job turned to himself, justifying himself by saying that he was not wrong in anything. He expressed that he had the common knowledge of the struggle, the vanity, the trouble, the suffering, and the end of human life. Regarding this, he felt that he knew more than his friends did. Eventually, Job said that he loathed life and indicated that he no longer had any taste for life. Since there was no answer to his situation, Job concluded that the only thing for him to do was to die. </p>
<p data-content-id="peBulwTqnHSCXbKJ4SlSOJt3JCI4_dMM44S1fK_u0HNj_xyP44m-ysHnJ_J7lmQDV"> Job and his friends were in the wrong realm. They were in the realm of good and evil, in the realm of promoting man’s integrity. They needed to get into the right realm, the realm of the tree of life. They needed to come back to the tree of life. The tree of life was their answer. </p>
<p data-content-id="vBSp6y8_glqCO4TVGBrAKT-qkSgMBkgC2Zwvuo6axOAhCcjtHIpxQwPpo1QyB7AN7"> Instead of trying to attain to the peak of integrity, Job needed to do his best to pursue God, to pursue Christ the person directly. Job’s direction should have been toward that peak, not toward the peak of human integrity. This is the answer to Job and his friends regarding the purpose of Job’s sufferings. </p>
<p data-content-id="WAjiwjsA6dxZhXTWWjGYSgMtEZI5ZwADVw16jMYikxIOYzB7g3lc_Z48QnrDi_FQ8"> Let us now go on to consider Bildad’s rebuttal to Job in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47466" data-verses="Job 8:1">chapter eight</span>. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="2D5Jk28QAFCdGt9FX6fNBwtJ984uopeYsUQmOufEb5F3ddcoa7N0nPXdggU2-4PiP">I.

Bildad’s speaking was a rebuttal to Job’s vindication of himself. <span class="pg" data-page-id="45" id="45">[45]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="f1L7jK9t6ENjmxucuKpmOgaIHcn5Rwu_PumKI1XqZ_TP669brdAaI0gSQR9hknD4I">II.

Bildad implied that Job had condemned God, claiming that God had perverted justice concerning him. Bildad told Job that God would never do such a thing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="H-W7Xbyzzvx2-IJ1FX_xFbauuqjt9vMRGagK-QPH0v4AJ86Cpz31r2GnhfP1vRVpI">III.

To be fair, Bildad might have had some ground to say this, since Job’s children were killed while they were feasting and drinking wine. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kPaHTugPPe89nd8a3vLZ1tej0gdsVteUVeNJznDb8D4_xlvyXLhfqVIUEskr3LhgN">IV. BELIEVING THAT IF JOB SOUGHT GOD EARNESTLY<br/>AND MADE SUPPLICATION UNTO THE ALMIGHTY,<br/>AND IF JOB WAS PURE AND UPRIGHT,<br/>GOD WOULD ROUSE HIMSELF FOR HIM</h2><p data-content-id="JjFzzQ_Qie2ytqq6hkUGRyhINkAc1E1SdCT1WO8WV6OUjqjm3piY68cQQaydykwgv"> Bildad believed that if Job sought God earnestly and made supplication unto the Almighty, and if Job was pure and upright, then surely God would rouse Himself for him and restore well-being to his righteous habitation, including his family. Though his beginning was small, his end would be very great (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47470" data-verses="Job 8:5-7">vv. 5-7</span>). It is hard to say what was Bildad’s standard of purity and uprightness. His speaking was according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. While Bildad was speaking, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was growing. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="z6MyXQhaw5k-LBH1ECX0c1_8CrIQj7T4GTxYo75yweJ120cWEfAx-Nm-BmukTIq_Q">V.

Bildad’s word was full of disrespect and despising. <span class="pg" data-page-id="46" id="46">[46]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="b-q5XPKHb6vrf9nmYBvicDi3lIpvyYCqR_zrJidNSnZboWufq731dwUx6aZnemkh2">VI.

He said that the hope of the profane perishes, whose confidence is cut off and whose trust is a spider’s web. He leans upon his house, but it will not stand. He holds fast to it, but it will not endure (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47472" data-verses="Job 8:11-19">vv. 11-19</span>). This was the speaking not of a learned person but of one who was childish, foolish, and in darkness. </p>

God, Bildad said, would fill Job’s mouth with laughter and his lips with shouting. Those who hated Job would be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked would be no more (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47473" data-verses="Job 8:20-22">vv. 20-22</span>). Once again, Bildad spoke vain words. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="0XZzdNDndnSKNF9YRIntGsUqT-dr6IpQ9co4NVf_bYOdAL3qHOcBMfj2bDXuOUyou">VIII.

In his rebuttal there was no flavor of being enlightened in the divine revelation and no taste of being spiritual in the divine life. He was altogether in darkness and in the vanity of man’s ethics. His rebuttal was utterly powerless to convince Job, who was higher in things concerning God than his contemporaries. </p>
<p data-content-id="_OuO7Kl5M8CCcppPozLLNs-3fYHiX5j148dD9sZT8JVSsi5r_GlvWz7MHJTdj4EFG"> Even though Job was higher in such things than he was, Bildad presumed to rebuke him, to warn him, to teach him, to educate him, and to give him instructions. Bildad could do this because he was in darkness. Job was also in darkness, <span class="pg" data-page-id="47" id="47">[47]</span> daring to challenge God, and this opened the way for his friends to speak in darkness. Thus, both Job and his friends were in darkness. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47479" data-verses="Job 9:5-9">verses 5 through 9</span> Job alluded to God’s judgment upon the <span class="pg" data-page-id="50" id="50">[50]</span> preadamic universe. After asking how a man can be righteous before God, Job said, “If he is pleased to contend with Him, / He cannot answer Him one thing in a thousand. / He is wise in heart and mighty in strength—/ Who has ever resisted Him and come through whole?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47480" data-verses="Job 9:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>).

This indicates that Job expected that he and God would go to a law court to be judged. Job would be the plaintiff, and God would be the defendant. Here Job as the plaintiff had a wrong concept, thinking that God the defendant was dealing with him in anger. However, God’s dealing with Job was not God’s anger but God’s good pleasure.

The angels might have wondered what God’s purpose was in creating the earth and man. Adam himself did not know why God created him in His image after His likeness (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47491" data-verses="Genesis 1:26">Gen. 1:26</span>). God kept His intention hidden throughout the ages, not telling Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, or any of the prophets. The Creator did a lot in His creation, but before the New Testament time He did not unveil to anyone what His purpose was. </p>
<p data-content-id="VOtlOdgrPMjWPQKLyr0S-Sd5QtFRhPOODrLqx2UYb8cM7VDI7r651PIfKrCgLIoJj"> The hidden mystery is that God in His Divine Trinity desires to be dispensed and wrought into His creation, man, to make man His duplication, to make man His expression. Not knowing this, Job misunderstood God and thought that God was angry with him and was judging him and punishing him. God’s intention was not to judge Job or to punish him but to tear him down and then rebuild him with Himself. God knew that after Job had passed through a time of suffering, he would be rebuilt and become another person—a new man in God’s new creation. This is the answer to Job, to the book of Job, and to Job’s vindication. </p>
<p data-content-id="iW7odAwFn6M_vn6Hw0zkZqH44E5UxdGbtd8WSDlh-7gKzwV-KsbolqbLfu4tzqPX5"> The Bible of sixty-six books is for only one thing: for God in Christ by the Spirit to dispense Himself into us to be our life, our nature, and our everything that we may live Christ and express Christ. This should be the principle that governs our life. In a practical way, it should be today’s tree of life for our enjoyment. </p>
<p data-content-id="1U015OwRXAIob_SOBmV6GsbwMZBNyZK4Lwgno4-lc2du5PtxzodTRPh1E-ubKI7xa"> The Bible is not mainly a book of prophecy, teaching, or types. The Bible is a book of God’s economy. To say merely that the Bible is a book consistently on Christ is not adequate. The Bible is on Christ in God’s economy. God’s economy is to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity in Christ by the Spirit into us that we may have Him as our life, nature, and everything. When we experience this, it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47492" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Gal. 2:20</span>).

<p data-content-id="T8FlGRth-6Dzr11LiBrYtWyjb9QVVgiqYaGeaPr7UpSsZpzB--XVOOKxYGXo_75mi"> Job’s unyieldingness was due to the fact that he was devoid of the divine revelation and was thus unable to comprehend that God’s dealing with him through disasters was not in the realm of ethics, that is, did not depend on whether he did good or evil, or on whether he was right or wrong, but was in the sphere of God-gaining that he should be turned from seeking perfection in ethics to seeking and gaining God instead of anything else. </p>

Zophar was saying that Job was an empty-headed man, a person altogether lacking intelligence. In his despising and <span class="pg" data-page-id="53" id="53">[53]</span> even sarcastic speaking here, Zophar went so far as to liken Job to a foal of a donkey without any intelligence.

He would forget misery, and his time would rise more brightly than the noonday, or, though dark, it would still be like the morning. He would be secure with hope and lie down without being terrified. But the eyes of the wicked will fail, the way to flee will be lost to them, and their hope will be to end their breathing (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47499" data-verses="Job 11:13-20">vv. 13-20</span>).

<p data-content-id="P7nAcQf9nW3qhJTxLVIYCe7DaoxYQSOczBY5jfuQSQUCCeMCzGGxvivbTMMoYMcY1"> Zophar was absolutely blind in the comprehension of man’s standing before God, and his argument was altogether based on man’s natural concept in the realm of ethics, without any enlightenment of the divine revelation regarding what man should be to God. </p>

His speaking in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47505" data-verses="Job 12:12-25">12:12-25</span> indicates that he was quite knowledgeable.

Realizing that God had marked his paths and had set limits for him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47514" data-verses="Job 13:27">v. 27</span>), Job wanted God to explain the situation to him. As we have pointed out, Job did not know God’s purpose concerning him, although he believed that there was a purpose hidden in God’s heart. </p>
<p data-content-id="_OuO7Kl5M8CCcppPmzLLFs-3fYHiX5j148dD9sZT8JVSsi5r_GlvWz7MHJTdj4EFG"> The Bible, which consists of sixty-six books, begins with God and His creation in Genesis and consummates with the New Jerusalem in Revelation. Between these two ends of the Bible, there are history, teachings, prophecies, and types. But if we understand the Bible only according to these things, we still do not know the Bible. We need to see the eternal economy of God, which is God’s eternal intention with His heart’s desire to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity as the Father in the Son by the Spirit into His chosen people to be their life and nature that they may be the same as He is for His fullness, His expression. </p>
<p data-content-id="BLxW5DESliyXau9PWyzLonjteledfO0eqQVudoEY1ejMcvt_k9MtOUSX2y-H1I1xM"> The word <em>economy</em> is an anglicized form of the Greek word <em>oikonomia,</em> which means “house law, household management, or administration,” and derivatively, “administrative dispensation (arrangement), plan, economy.” This Greek word implies the notion of dispensing. A dispensing is different from a dispensation. The word <em>dispensing</em> denotes an imparting of something, whereas the word <em>dispensation,</em> as it is commonly used by Christians, refers to the way God deals with people during a particular age. Today many talk about God’s dispensations without seeing the crucial matter of God’s dispensing. </p>
<p data-content-id="xcBelsFoKBKqGldYc74LicuHIzuwxp53_Rj3xXKybKy79uIHodFHOTy-sTaWtEGEf"> An economy is an arrangement to carry out a plan for dispensing. God’s economy is God’s plan, God’s arrangement, for God to dispense Himself in His element, life, nature, and attributes, and all that He has achieved and attained into His <span class="pg" data-page-id="58" id="58">[58]</span> chosen people that they may be rebuilt by being constituted with the divine essence in the divine element of the divine source to be something divine. Before receiving God’s dispensing, we were merely human. After God’s rebuilding with the divine constitution we, like the Lord Jesus, become divinely human and humanly divine. Before incarnation Christ was only divine, but after His incarnation He became a God-man, a man with the divine nature. Now He is divinely human, and He is also humanly divine. Having been regenerated by Christ, we have become a part of Him, and now we are the same as He is—divinely human and humanly divine. </p>
<p data-content-id="ruJXf7h9c1kanzo64yhT2SKQJU0OwWWXGJN3jJ-jizouerWpmisJQ4ttYoVHfFjeb"> The regenerated ones, who are divinely human and humanly divine, spontaneously become an organism, the Body of Christ, which is the church of God as the new man in God’s new creation to carry out God’s new “career,” that is, to build up the Body of Christ for the fullness, the expression, of the Triune God. This fullness as the organism of the Triune God will consummate in the New Jerusalem. The Bible begins with God in His creation as the initiation and ends with the New Jerusalem, which is the mingling of the Triune God and all His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite people. The New Jerusalem is thus a constitution of God with man to express God for eternity. </p>
<p data-content-id="dH9hAkXiiF-7k7uGEnQnOsKx9rdrkllOzbLZ-a4sQ05stcuWf_c-TxgrK2gqN13UD"> To see this is to have an overview of the entire Bible. In our reading of the Bible, we need to focus our attention on God’s eternal economy for the divine dispensing. Unless we know God’s economy we will not understand the Bible. </p>
<p data-content-id="Q_6SBW44g52pELlZ8abt08nI5NA-dy4tNzW0PnFTR1U6VsPMAyjU6KJVbLS1DcrUL"> Christ is not only the center of the Bible but also the centrality and universality of God’s economy. It was in this economy that Christ became incarnated, that He went to the cross to pass through crucifixion, that He came out from death and entered into resurrection, and that in resurrection He was begotten of God to be God’s firstborn Son and as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to regenerate all His believers to make them the same as He is in life and nature that they might become His brothers and the sons of God. These sons plus the Firstborn all become a new man, with Him as the Head and with the church as His Body, to <span class="pg" data-page-id="59" id="59">[59]</span> carry out God’s eternal purpose to consummate in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="KTsQm0Aqc4vYwK6u4KPYN8XjPLLidGGOpRx5e2Y4hzb9RcA0YYYYpl5HK8WmIFq-L"> If we see this revelation concerning God’s economy, then we will be able to understand the book of Job. Job suffered God’s stripping and consuming, but he did not understand what was happening to him. Job could say, “You have hidden these things in Your heart; / I know that this is with You” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47515" data-verses="Job 10:13">10:13</span>). He knew that God had a purpose, but he did not know what God’s purpose was. </p>
<p data-content-id="lu1rWVFMXAvXHaWwQt-CgoSE34Vg65Xj8okY2jP3pP7sA_VmcJwe7gAiEHtHMiw2k"> Job and his three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, were in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Even though Job was on a somewhat higher level than his friends, he and they were still in the same realm. God was trying to rescue them from that realm and put them into the realm of the tree of life. The first thing God had to do was to strip Job, consume him, and tear him down so that he would become nothing as a person under suffering. This became the base for God to rebuild Job with the Divine Trinity, that Job could be a new man, a part of God’s new creation, to fulfill God’s eternal economy for God’s expression. </p>

However, in spite of verses such as these, the forty-two chapters in Job leave us with a crucial question of two parts: What was the purpose of God in His creating of man, and what is the purpose of God in His dealing with His chosen people? To answer this question, we need the entire Bible. In particular, the New Testament is a long answer to Job’s question. </p>
<p data-content-id="sZrC8zOWInDRC4bU032kuqCElPREOMb86SFuUaY_EwHDSNlNX5M8oYs40JVqj0W4o"> Job said that he wanted to argue with God and even “litigate” with God in “court,” making himself the plaintiff and God the defendant. But Job did not have the opportunity to do this, and his question concerning his suffering remained unanswered. The New Testament is God’s answer to Job. We may say that it is a message “faxed” from God to Job. This “fax,” this answer, reveals that God was not judging Job or punishing him but was stripping and consuming him so that <span class="pg" data-page-id="62" id="62">[62]</span> Job could be rebuilt with the Triune God. Although millions of people have read the New Testament, not many understand the answer that it contains. Thus, it is extremely important that we consider the vital aspects of the answer to Job revealed in the New Testament. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="wDyqKr25LNkmzu4am_LTPz05P7OVuQEWJxnW-S6GdQh0SV7rcig4Xs1OM6zvyJcWT">THE ITEMS IN GOD’S ANSWER</h2><h2 class="head2" data-content-id="MFNsqyUzUamIhTJA34Onck9XX0iDG8HxGpqszonA6YCdPELFOtO_CjQxPRxFZMVdK">Incarnation </h2>
<p data-content-id="VOtlOdgrPMjWPQKP6r0S2Sd5QtFRhPOODrLqx2UYb8cM7VDI7r651PIfKrCgLIoJj"> If we read the Old Testament with its prophecies, types, and plain words from Genesis through Malachi, we will see that the Old Testament ends with the promise that One was coming (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47525" data-verses="Malachi 4:5-6">Mal. 4:5-6</span>). The New Testament begins with God’s incarnation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47526" data-verses="Matthew 1:18-25">Matt. 1:18-25</span>). The very God who was in eternity, who created the heavens and the earth and billions of items and man, and who did so many things with mankind, came as the promised One. He came in a mysterious way without advertisement and without public notification. He entered into a virgin’s womb and, according to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47527" data-verses="Matthew 1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>, was born in that womb. He remained there for nine months, and then He was born out of that womb. From this we see that the incarnation was God’s coming out of eternity into time, to enter with His divinity into humanity. Prior to the incarnation, God was in eternity and man was in time. Through incarnation God brought the divine nature and the human nature together to make them one entity, even one wonderful person, named Jesus. Jesus, who is both God and man, is the totality of the result of the incarnation. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="iW7odAwFn6M_vn6D40zobqH44E5UxdGbtd8WSDlh-7gKzwV-KsbolqbLfu4tzqPX5">Human Living</h2><p data-content-id="1U015OwRXAIob_SKJmV2EsbwMZBNyZK4Lwgno4-lc2du5PtxzodTRPh1E-ubKI7xa"> The Lord Jesus lived on earth for more than thirty years. Many Christians, paying their attention to the miracles done by the Lord Jesus, do not know the real, spiritual, and intrinsic significance of Christ’s human living. Christ’s human living was just man living God to express the attributes of God in the human virtues. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="91WP5pqwF3GeT4ddmsCQHeY3TOSgBfNMBX4k5yl_wQ6n84JwqQgJtQ5KU9LUZXA01">Crucifixion</h2><p data-content-id="jNC2uuAHkXMsJoaYn1HZtNqKRFlZfcxSeR2c-5zpPbACSVDIV6ph9SGbrosrq4Ngo"> Eventually, the Lord Jesus went to the cross to be crucified <span class="pg" data-page-id="63" id="63">[63]</span> there. According to the revelation of the New Testament, the death that Christ died on the cross was all-inclusive and also vicarious for us. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="T8FlGRth-6Dzr11PqBrUvWyjb9QVVgiqYaGeaPr7UpSsZpzB--XVOOKxYGXo_75mi">Resurrection</h2><p data-content-id="nJML5FAvuoUKpyVUkziRD-BIVXrTdtA6LsYGwPunZ5VD1YX9tdJ4Cz07ZtS3KRtr4"> Christ entered into death and went into Hades to visit Hades. He stayed there for three days. Then He came out and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He was begotten of God to be God’s firstborn (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47528" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>). Not only so, in resurrection He was made the life-giving Spirit—not just a God-man but a Spirit that gives life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47529" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>). Moreover, when He was resurrected to be begotten of God to be God’s firstborn Son, He regenerated all His believers, making them the many sons of God and His many brothers as members of His Body (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47530" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="6EooGpKeBO3yoSxEPu7yMA3rrL8YofRbuj9g24UsVzrXnB1zgcT2elJ5YTwTJnq-Q"> From this we see that through Christ’s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, there is One who is the mingling of divinity with humanity. This One became the firstborn Son of God to express God. He also became the life-giving, life-imparting Spirit to germinate all those of the old creation who had been chosen by God to make them the new creation of God. Now, after the day of resurrection, there are four marvelous things in the universe: the mingling of God with man, the firstborn Son of God, the life-giving Spirit, and the organism of the Triune God. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="Rokq5hX0Vah3qLVk5I6qSNKFfI9cuuPbBfuT0AKL5hljVB5uuwsUPIVnHsl9OlOcR">Ascension</h2><p data-content-id="sZrC8zOWInDRC4bU032NkqCElPREOMb86SFuUaY_EwHDSNlNX5M8oYs40JVqj0W4o"> The first four items in God’s answer to the question concerning Job’s suffering are Christ’s incarnation, Christ’s human living, Christ’s crucifixion, and Christ’s resurrection. The fifth item is Christ’s ascension. After His resurrection the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples during a period of forty days, and then He ascended to the heavens. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="wDyqKr25LNkmzu4am_L-Ez05P7OVuQEWJxnW-S6GdQh0SV7rcig4Xs1OM6zvyJcWT">The Church as the New Man,<br/>as the Body of Christ,<br/>and as the Organism of the Triune God<br/>Consummating in the New Jerusalem</h2><p data-content-id="LE0U7mbRuxHwEP0bTBNq10NtfK_LEJw_JSvMSymIE7qHIabzqql3mQW44_FljuwBj"> In His ascension Christ poured out Himself as the <span class="pg" data-page-id="64" id="64">[64]</span> consummated Triune God and as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His members, to constitute all of them into one organic Body to be the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God. This is the church as the new man, as the Body of Christ, and as the organism of the Triune God, and this entity will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Thus, in God’s long answer to Job’s suffering there are ten main items: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, the church, the new man, the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God, and the New Jerusalem. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ms4li0Tx41JNal0TMbvN3eR1r7cPABtex0tpVk4Lr8jrNXPt1QZulAZEPIPlDnWrV">THE MAIN CONTENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p data-content-id="ZxI9cnvSgtMqm1OWGt51l3uqVKjPLzv9tgRwwmNir-R25AVjDLqGUFJGsSmNIhTB9"> The main contents of the New Testament are that the Triune God has an eternal economy according to His good pleasure to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people in His life and in His nature, to make all of them the same as He is in life and nature, to make them His duplication that they may express Him. This corporate expression will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Thus, the New Jerusalem is simply the enlarged, the increased, incarnation consummated in full, that is, the fullness of the Triune God for Him to express Himself in His divinity mingled with humanity. These are the contents of the New Testament, and this is the answer that Job needed. This is God’s answer concerning the purpose of Job’s suffering. </p>

Job’s Complaint concerning God’s Severe<br/>Strictness in Dealing with Him</h2><p data-content-id="-mTAkR7iIQE7J3fVxFUquGp_ifHg7GHBmSrVq9oP9LWWzIs68_3NUYA4uoHWK6ANb"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47535" data-verses="Job 13:3">13:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47536" data-verses="Job 13:20-28">20-28</span> Job contended with God for his case. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47537" data-verses="Job 14:1-22">14:1-22</span> Job went on to complain concerning God’s severe strictness in dealing with him, and then Job made his request of God to look away from him that he might rest. </p>
<p data-content-id="peBulwTqnHSCXbKN-Sl3EJt3JCI4_dMM44S1fK_u0HNj_xyP44m-ysHnJ_J7lmQDV"> As he argued with God Job said, “Man, born of woman, / Is of few days and full of trouble. / He comes forth like a blossom and is cut down, / He also flees like a shadow and does not remain. / And do You open Your eyes upon such a one / And bring me into judgment with You?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47538" data-verses="Job 14:1-3">vv. 1-3</span>). Job’s word about God bringing him into judgment implies the notion that there would be litigation involving Job and God in court, with Job as the plaintiff and God as the defendant. Job was wondering <span class="pg" data-page-id="66" id="66">[66]</span> whether God would bring him to court so that he could be judged there. Job was expecting this. </p>
<p data-content-id="vBSp6y8_glqCO4TRABrhBT-qkSgMBkgC2Zwvuo6axOAhCcjtHIpxQwPpo1QyB7AN7"> After saying that no one could bring a clean thing from an unclean, Job continued, “Since his days are determined, / And the number of his months is with You; / Since You have appointed his bounds, and he cannot go beyond” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47539" data-verses="Job 14:5">v. 5</span>). Here Job was saying that God had appointed limits that Job could not go beyond. He was altogether under God’s control. He wanted God to look away from him so that he could rest. He felt that he was a “hired hand,” an employee hired by God and subject to the limits set by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_7FAJWE6u9THMs-ZMbgqbipY9mwwcfvTuycMJYyjH_RQug54iXh5grg6PMG3VoJp"> Whereas there was hope that a tree which had been cut down would sprout again, there was no hope for a man who had been laid low. “A man lies down and does not rise up; / Until the heavens are no more, he will not awake, / Nor will he be roused from his sleep” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47540" data-verses="Job 14:12">v. 12</span>). Job said that once a man dies, he is finished. Then he told God, “Oh that You would hide me in Sheol, / That You would conceal me until Your anger has passed, / That You would set me an appointed time and remember me!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47541" data-verses="Job 14:13">v. 13</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="0XZzdNDndnSKNF9cXInhAsUqT-dr6IpQ9co4NVf_bYOdAL3qHOcBMfj2bDXuOUyou"> Job then asked, “If a man dies, will he live again? / All the days of my service I would wait, / Until a change for me should come” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47542" data-verses="Job 14:14">v. 14</span>). The Hebrew word translated “service” also means “warfare” or “distress.” To Job’s feeling, his life was a war, and his days were days of fighting. </p>
<p data-content-id="79gaGa6nQQEvhKOFrxIZsMxG6JE90xC-hZlCiBeqgqvZnyC0IbJ6vUfnRltF7fepm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47543" data-verses="Job 14:15-17">verses 15 through 17</span> Job continued, “You would call, and I would answer You; / You would long after the work of Your hands. / For now You number my steps. / Do You not watch over my sin? / My transgression has been sealed up in a bag, / And You have fastened up my iniquity.” Job thought that God was doing this to him. It seems that Job was too sensitive and that he was deeply troubled psychologically as a result of being in the realm of good and evil. </p>
<p data-content-id="_OuO7Kl5M8CCcppLuzLHHs-3fYHiX5j148dD9sZT8JVSsi5r_GlvWz7MHJTdj4EFG"> Finally, Job claimed that God destroyed the hope of man, prevailing forever against him, changing his countenance, and sending him away. “Only the pain of his own flesh does he feel, / And his own soul mourns for him” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47544" data-verses="Job 14:22">v. 22</span>).

According to Eliphaz, Job’s iniquity instructed his mouth, and Job chose the tongue of the crafty. Thus, Job’s mouth condemned him and his lips testified against him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47547" data-verses="Job 15:1-6">vv. 1-6</span>). </p>

Eliphaz asked him, “Are you the first man born? / Or were you brought forth before the hills? / Did you listen in on the secret council of God? / And do you limit wisdom to yourself? / What do you know that we do not know? / What do you understand that is not with us?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47549" data-verses="Job 15:7-9">vv. 7-9</span>). Then Eliphaz went on to tell Job that God’s gentle words of consolation were too small for Job, that he let his heart take him away, and that he turned his spirit against God. </p>

Eliphaz remarked that a man born of woman cannot be clean or righteous, that God puts no trust in His holy ones, and that even the heavens are not clean in His sight, much less a man who is abominable and corrupt and who drinks wrong like water (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47550" data-verses="Job 15:14-16">vv. 14-16</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="68" id="68">[68]</span> </p>

This warning was based on the principle of good and evil. In keeping with this principle, Eliphaz said that the wicked, whose heart prepares deceit, would be terrified by distress and straits, that they would not be rich and their wealth would not endure, that they would not go away from darkness, and that vanity would be their recompense. Eliphaz’s concept was altogether according to good and evil. In his view, the good people would prosper and the wicked would suffer. </p>
<p data-content-id="cKV2Ia0vFjWXw-s1CGj26c8AhIJsV60OrjXYrMo_Fb4xvwo2j9keFVTBzFDZ9J4P4"> After reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47552" data-verses="Job 12:1">chapters twelve through fifteen</span>, we can see the situation of both Job and Eliphaz. Job, a person of very strong character, had a superiority complex, and Eliphaz was a typical fool who tried to teach Job by rebuking and warning him according to the principle of good and evil. </p>

The first three items are the incarnation of the Triune God, the living of the Triune God in humanity on earth, and the all-inclusive death of Christ which He died on the cross to solve all the problems and to terminate all the negative things in the universe. The fourth item is the life-dispensing resurrection of Christ, in which Christ in His humanity was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God to bring in many more sons after Him, in which the Triune God in humanity became the life-giving Spirit for the divine dispensing, and in which all the believers in Christ were regenerated to be sons of God and members of Christ. The fifth item is the ascension of Christ with the pouring out of the consummated Spirit to produce the church. The remaining five items are the church of God, the Body of Christ, the new man, the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, and the New Jerusalem. All the other items unveiled in the New Testament are related to these ten main items either directly or indirectly. <span class="pg" data-page-id="70" id="70">[70]</span> </p>

For example, some emphasize baptism by immersion, a New Testament teaching but not one of the ten basic items in God’s economy. This emphasis has issued not only in a denomination devoted to baptism by immersion but also in disputes about the kind of water that should be used, about whether one should be baptized backward, forward, or downward, and about whether baptism should be in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit or simply in the name of Jesus. Other believers argue about matters such as presbytery (the management of the church by the elders) and about what kind of musical instruments, if any, may be used in the church meetings. Years ago I was told that a certain Brethren assembly was divided over the issue of whether a piano or an organ should be used in their meetings. This kind of situation is widespread among today’s Christians. Hardly anyone holds to the eternal economy of God for the divine dispensing. </p>

We need to consider how to experience all these items. How can we experience Christ’s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension? How can we have the experience of being a part of the church, the Body of Christ, the new man, and the organism of the Triune God? How can we, in a practical, experiential way, become a part of the New Jerusalem in eternity? </p>

We have only one God, but this unique God is triune—the Father, the Son, <span class="pg" data-page-id="71" id="71">[71]</span> and the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one. The Father is in the Son; the Son is in the Father; the Spirit is in both the Father and the Son; and both the Father and the Son are in the Spirit. The three not only coexist (exist together at the same time) but also coinhere (dwell in one another). No one can separate them. Among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit there is a distinction, but there is no separation. Because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and coinhere, when the Father is present, the Son and the Spirit also are present. </p>

But by passing through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, this unique God was processed. These five steps were the five sections of His process. By passing through these five sections of His process, the unique Triune God was processed and consummated to be today’s Triune God. </p>

The Spirit is the last of the three of the Divine Trinity. This consummated Spirit is actually the consummation of the Triune God. As the all-inclusive Spirit, He is the consummation, the aggregate, of the Triune God. When we receive Him, we receive the Son and the Father. This Spirit is the Son, and this Spirit is also the Father. All three—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—are the all-inclusive Spirit. Our God is the consummated Spirit. Our Father, our Lord, our Master, our Redeemer, and our Savior is the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is all-inclusive, compounded, and consummated. Even now He is within us. </p>

Then we need to live, to walk, by this Spirit, and we need to experience Christ, to enjoy God the Father, and even to enjoy the fullness of the Triune God by doing everything according to the Spirit. As long as we do everything according to the Spirit, we can experience Christ’s incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension with the outpouring of the Spirit. This will cause us to be the church of God, the Body of Christ, the new man, and the organism of the Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="P7nAcQf9nW3qhJT1BVIcEe7DaoxYQSOczBY5jfuQSQUCCeMCzGGxvivbTMMoYMcY1"> In our daily living we should not be in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but should be in the realm of the life-giving Spirit. We should not do anything according to good and evil. Instead, we should do everything according to the Spirit by being one spirit with the Lord. For instance, we need to be one spirit with the Lord in our speaking. Before I speak for the Lord, I pray one simple prayer: “Lord, be one spirit with me that I may be one spirit with You. Lord, speak in my speaking and make my speaking Your speaking.” This is to live in the dispensing of the eternal economy of God. When we live and speak in this way, we enjoy the divine dispensing, and Christ increases within us. Christ grows in us and we grow in Christ. Eventually, this growth will reach the full extent. </p>
<p data-content-id="-mTAkR7iIQE7J3fVyFU_lGp_ifHg7GHBmSrVq9oP9LWWzIs68_3NUYA4uoHWK6ANb"> Suppose there is a problem between you and your spouse.

<p data-content-id="peBulwTqnHSCXbKN9SleMJt3JCI4_dMM44S1fK_u0HNj_xyP44m-ysHnJ_J7lmQDV"> The book of Job contains many vain words, words of accusation and vindication. As we read this book we need to be mindful of God’s economy. We need to see that God’s eternal economy, which is the answer to the question raised by Job, is to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity—in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit—through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension with the outpouring of the Spirit to produce the church, the Body of <span class="pg" data-page-id="73" id="73">[73]</span> Christ, the new man, and the organism of the Triune God, which will issue in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. </p>

Although Job’s friends had come to him for the purpose of comforting him, he regarded them as “troubling comforters,” and he called their words “words of wind.” He asked them, “What has provoked you that you so respond?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47561" data-verses="Job 16:3">v. 3b</span>). The answer is that they were provoked by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47562" data-verses="Job 16:4-5">verses 4 and 5</span> Job continued, “I also could speak like you, / If your soul were in my soul’s stead; / I could join my words together against you / And shake my head at you. / I could strengthen you with my mouth, / And <span class="pg" data-page-id="76" id="76">[76]</span> the movement of my lips would mitigate your pain.” Job realized that his friends’ word was vanity, and he rejected it. </p>

Job went so far as to say that God had torn him to pieces, had delivered him over to the unjust and cast him down into the hands of the wicked, had broken him apart, had taken him by the neck and dashed him to pieces, and had set him up as His target. Thus, Job’s face was reddened with weeping, and on his eyelids was the shadow of death. </p>

Here we see that Job would not release God, that he would not let God go. Instead, Job expressed his desire that God would adjudicate for him in his case.

Regarding the wicked, Bildad went on to say that terrors frighten him all around, that his strength is famished, that calamity is prepared at his side, that he is rooted out of his tent, that brimstone is scattered upon his habitation, that the memory of him perishes from the earth, that he is thrust out from the light to the darkness and is driven from the world, and that he has no posterity and no progeny among his people. Then Bildad concluded, “Surely these are the dwellings of the unjust, / And this is the place of him who does not know God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47575" data-verses="Job 18:21">v. 21</span>). Bildad tried to give advice, but his words were words of waste. His logic and his warning were based on the principle of good and evil. </p>

Although God was stripping Job, He surely was not angry with him; neither did God consider Job as His adversary but as His intimate friend. Moreover, Job was not correct in saying that God had sent a troop <span class="pg" data-page-id="81" id="81">[81]</span> against Job. For God to do such a thing would be against the principle. </p>

His relatives had failed him and his acquaintances had forgotten him, and those who sojourned in his house and his maids considered him a stranger. He was a foreigner in their eyes. Job said that he called out to his servant, but his servant did not answer (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47585" data-verses="Job 19:13-16">vv. 13-16</span>). </p>

Job complained that even little children despised him; he arose, and they spoke against him. All the men with whom he took counsel abhorred him, and those whom he loved had turned against him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47586" data-verses="Job 19:17-19">vv. 17-19</span>). </p>

He asked his friends to pity him, for, according to his feeling, the hand of God had touched him and God was persecuting him. Then, using a figure of speech, he asked them why they were not satisfied with eating his flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47587" data-verses="Job 19:20-22">vv. 20-22</span>). </p>

<p data-content-id="8_7FAJWE6u9THMs-cMboqbipY9mwwcfvTuycMJYyjH_RQug54iXh5grg6PMG3VoJp"> If we do not have a complete vision of God’s economy, we might think that Job’s word, “My Redeemer lives,” is very good. However, the New Testament tells us not merely that our Redeemer lives but that He lives in us. To Job’s word we need to add the little phrase “in me.” This is according to Paul’s word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47590" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>: “It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.” If Christ lived only in the heavens, that would not have anything to do with us.

Our outer part, our body, is dust. Christ has not yet touched this part. Today Christ is living in our spirit to impart Himself from our spirit into our soul so that His element may be transfused into our soul for its transformation. One day He will come to “stand upon our dust,” that is, our body, to touch our body. Then our body of humiliation will be transfigured to be conformed to the body of His glory (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47592" data-verses="Philippians 3:21">Phil. 3:21</span>). At that time He will not only stand upon the dust of the earth, but He will touch our dust. </p>

Job continued by saying that the eyes of the wicked should see his destruction and that the wicked one should drink the wrath of the Almighty. After asking if someone will teach knowledge to God, seeing that He judges those who are on high, Job went on to say that the one who dies in his full strength and the one who dies in bitterness of soul both lie down in the dust, and the worm covers them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47622" data-verses="Job 21:20-26">vv. 20-26</span>). </p>

Then Job said that the travelers on the <span class="pg" data-page-id="88" id="88">[88]</span> roads are the evidence that the wicked man is spared in the day of calamity and they are led forth in the day of overflowing wrath. Next, Job asked who would declare the way of the wicked one to his face and who would repay him what he has done. According to Job, when the wicked is borne to the grave and kept by a watch, the clods of the valley are sweet to him. Moreover, all men go in procession after him, and those who went before him are without number (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47624" data-verses="Job 21:29-33">vv. 29-33</span>). </p>

Then Eliphaz accused Job of taking pledges from his brothers without cause, stripping the naked of their clothing, not giving water to the weary, withholding bread from the hungry, and sending widows away empty. As a result, according to Eliphaz’s logic, snares were around Job, dread and darkness troubled him, and an abundance of waters covered him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47629" data-verses="Job 22:6-11">vv. 6-11</span>). <span class="pg" data-page-id="89" id="89">[89]</span> </p>

The main point in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47631" data-verses="Job 22:21-30">verses 21 through 30</span> is that, according to Eliphaz’s logic, the God-seeking righteous man will be blessed and delivered by God. </p>
<p data-content-id="2D5Jk28QAFCdGt9BV6fZHwtJ984uopeYsUQmOufEb5F3ddcoa7N0nPXdggU2-4PiP"> The teaching of Eliphaz may seem to be very good; however, its source is not divine revelation but human logic. Furthermore, this teaching is based upon the principle of good and evil, which principle is the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>

This answer, given by God in His revelation, is altogether concerned with the Triune God Himself. </p>

Although God did many things in <span class="pg" data-page-id="92" id="92">[92]</span> the Old Testament, He did not move. Rather, from Adam to Christ, God remained in His divinity and stayed in eternity. He did not yet come out of eternity into time to enter with His divinity into man. But one day, after a period of four thousand years in which man had been tried, tested, and proved to be sinful and good for nothing, God came out of eternity and entered with His divinity into time, entering into the womb of a human virgin to join Himself to humanity. This was the first step of God’s move. The second step was His being born of that human virgin to be the God-man. After staying in the womb of a human virgin for nine months, He came out of that womb, not only with divinity but also with humanity, to be a human being by the name of Jesus. This human being is extraordinary, altogether uncommon, because He is the God-man. </p>

Then He rose up from the dead; He resurrected. Through His resurrection He brought His humanity into divinity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47646" data-verses="Romans 1:3-4">Rom. 1:3-4</span>). He was also born to be the firstborn Son of God to be the leading One of the many sons of God. In His resurrection He also became a life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47647" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). In other words, through death and resurrection He was consummated to be “the Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47648" data-verses="John 7:39">John 7:39</span>). Furthermore, in the resurrection of Christ, all those who were chosen by God were regenerated to be the many sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47649" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). </p>

This Body, this new man, is a mysterious organism for the processed and consummated Triune God. Eventually, this entity will be enlarged and consummated to be the New Jerusalem as the fullness, the corporate expression, of God for eternity. In the New Jerusalem we can see the mingling of God with man, so that God and man become one corporate entity. In the New Jerusalem we can also see the divine attributes expressed through the virtues of humanity for eternity. </p>

Jehovah Elohim is still there, but now He is <em>the</em> Spirit. The name of the Spirit is Jesus Christ.

We must treasure the two spirits in Galatians—the divine Spirit as the aggregate of the divine blessing to us and the human spirit as the receiver, the container, the keeper, of the divine Spirit. Thus, we need to take care of our spirit, doing everything by exercising our spirit. Then we will experience the divine Spirit living in us, making His home in us, and transforming us. The divine Spirit lives <span class="pg" data-page-id="95" id="95">[95]</span> in us to pray, to read the Bible, to speak God’s word, to love our spouse, and to visit sinners for the preaching of the gospel. Such a living is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the regenerated tripartite man.

The incarnation was the beginning of God’s move, which is for God to come out of eternity into time to enter with His divinity into humanity. Then God moved through human living and through His wonderful, all-inclusive death into resurrection. In resurrection Christ was begotten to be God’s firstborn Son.

The title “the Spirit” is used in <span class="pg" data-page-id="98" id="98">[98]</span> a particular way in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47673" data-verses="John 7:1">John 7</span>.

According to this view, the work of the Father in the Old Testament was replaced by the work of the Son in the Gospels, and then the work of the Son was replaced by the work of the Spirit in Acts through Revelation. Some who hold this view regard the three of the Divine Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—as three separate persons. However, after many years of study and experience, we can say that this understanding of the Triune God is not accurate. </p>
<p data-content-id="hCrRxb5iWEiiuF6Dzmo2mzIm9-tXNSKjE63fiJfvPUSmnT_C3kHcfb5u7pNbEaD7N"> The three of the Divine Trinity are different, or distinct, but they are not separate. If the Son were not different from the Father, the Son could not pray to the Father, as He did in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47676" data-verses="John 17:1">John 17</span>. Nevertheless, the Father and the Son are inseparable, for the Father and the Son coinhere, that is, the Son exists in the Father and the Father exists in the Son. For this reason, the Lord Jesus could say to Philip, who had asked Him to show them the Father, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47677" data-verses="John 14:9-10">John 14:9b-10</span>). Here we see that the Father and the Son, although distinct, coinhere and thus cannot be separated. Furthermore, the Father and the Son are in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Father and the Son. If we see this, we will realize that <span class="pg" data-page-id="99" id="99">[99]</span> the God who was incarnated and moved on earth was the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="UIQOnevT9J1jipE-3b4eybcPnn_ON2xauBAu1hdOdN_zIrmZYe1fbWpdfODuG88rm"> The New Testament unveils to us that Christ the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God and that the Spirit is the realization of the Son and the reality of Christ. Because the Spirit is the reality of Christ, we cannot have Christ apart from the Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. </p>

He was only divine but not human; He was only God but not man.

Job longed to know where he might find God, that he might come to God’s seat to present his cause in order before Him, filling his mouth with arguments (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47713" data-verses="Job 23:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). Confident that he knew the words which God would answer him and that he understood what God would speak to him, Job said that God would not contend with him in His power but would give heed to him. Since, according to Job, the upright man can argue with God, Job would be delivered forever from his Judge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47714" data-verses="Job 23:5-7">vv. 5-7</span>). Here Job seemed to be extremely sensitive and spoke as if he was <span class="pg" data-page-id="104" id="104">[104]</span> in a dream. While Job was speaking, God was silent, apparently not listening to all these things. </p>
<p data-content-id="I4LaSIw89KK1RQOPGKR9ujvhnVEPi6kG4YIlmJ5JQwX7q3bSa1RmEZ8in5cY5TLqO"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47715" data-verses="Job 23:8-10">verses 8 through 10</span> Job said, “Behold, I go forward, but He is not there; / And backward, but I do not perceive Him; / To the left, where He acts, but I cannot look on Him; / He hides Himself on the right, so I cannot see Him. / But He knows the way that I take; / Should He try me, I would come forth as gold.” Job could not find God where he imagined Him to be. Once again, Job’s word indicated that he was in some kind of dream. He was surely dreaming when he said that if God tried him, he would come forth as gold. </p>
<p data-content-id="H-W7Xbyzzvx2-IJxKX_QIbauuqjt9vMRGagK-QPH0v4AJ86Cpz31r2GnhfP1vRVpI"> Job went on to declare that his foot held fast to God’s steps, that he had kept God’s way and not turned back from the commandment of His lips, and that he had treasured the words of His mouth more than his apportioned food. However, Job said that God was of one mind and did what His soul desired, performing what had been appointed to Job. Therefore, Job was terrified at His presence and was in dread of Him, feeling that God had made his heart faint and that the Almighty had terrified him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47716" data-verses="Job 23:11-16">vv. 11-16</span>). </p>

Included among such ones are murderers and adulterers, who do not know the light (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47721" data-verses="Job 24:14-16">vv. 14-16</span>). “For morning is to all of them like the shadow of death, / Because they are acquainted with the terrors of the shadow of death” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47722" data-verses="Job 24:17">v. 17</span>). </p>

Job said that God preserves the mighty for awhile and then lets them be cut off like the ears of grain. Job concluded by saying, “If it is not so, then who will prove me a liar / And bring my words to nought?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47724" data-verses="Job 24:25">v. 25</span>).

His final word was brief. From his previous speakings Bildad might have learned the lesson that the way to lose the case and to appear foolish is to speak too much. This might have been the reason that his concluding word was so short. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ruJXf7h9c1kanzo-5yhTySKQJU0OwWWXGJN3jJ-jizouerWpmisJQ4ttYoVHfFjeb">A.

Then Bildad asked if there was any number to God’s armies, and if there are any upon whom His light does not arise (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47727" data-verses="Job 25:3">v. 3</span>). Bildad’s word here was not according to the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Nevertheless, like Job, he was showing off. </p>

Bildad asked how a man can be righteous before God, how a person born of a woman can be pure.

After God created man, He continued to be the “raw” God, the unprocessed God, observing, testing, and proving humanity but not yet moving or taking any action. Then one day He began to go through a process. Each step of this process has become an ingredient of the Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="8_7FAJWE6u9THMs-RMbFgbipY9mwwcfvTuycMJYyjH_RQug54iXh5grg6PMG3VoJp"> These ingredients include incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension. In eternity God had the ingredient of divinity but not the ingredients of humanity and human living. Through incarnation the ingredient of humanity was added to Him. This was followed by Christ’s human living and the crucial ingredient of His all-inclusive death on the cross. Next came the ingredient of resurrection, which is a matter of passing through death without being held by death. Through resurrection Christ was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47733" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>), and through resurrection He also became the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47734" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45b</span>). Furthermore, in the resurrection of Christ all God’s chosen ones were regenerated to be the sons of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47735" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>). In His ascension, another ingredient, Christ is transcendent. He is the One who is above all, and everything <span class="pg" data-page-id="108" id="108">[108]</span> is now under His feet (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47736" data-verses="Ephesians 1:19-23">Eph. 1:19-23</span>). Finally, we have the ingredient of Christ’s descension as the all-inclusive Spirit to produce the church, His Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="0XZzdNDndnSKNF9cfInALsUqT-dr6IpQ9co4NVf_bYOdAL3qHOcBMfj2bDXuOUyou"> As we consider all these ingredients, we can see that the processed and consummated Triune God is much richer than the “raw” God. Of course, the unprocessed God had the divine attributes, which may be regarded as ingredients, but now He also has the ingredients of incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, the life-imparting and life-producing resurrection, ascension, and descension, which issue in the Body. How rich our God is today! He is abundantly rich, aboundingly rich. He is everything to us as the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God. </p>
<p data-content-id="91WP5pqwF3GeT4ddvsCQDeY3TOSgBfNMBX4k5yl_wQ6n84JwqQgJtQ5KU9LUZXA01"> I have sometimes been asked why we pray to the Father or to the Lord Jesus but not to the Spirit. Actually, when we pray to the Father, we pray to the Spirit. When we pray to the Son, we pray also to the Spirit. Who is God? God is the Spirit. Who is the Father? The Father is the Spirit. Who is Christ? Christ is the Spirit. The totality, the aggregate, the consummation, of the Triune God with all His ingredients is the Spirit. Therefore, in the Spirit we have the three of the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—with all the steps of God’s process as the ingredients. </p>

God could not be wrought into Job in this way because at Job’s time God was still “raw.” He had not yet been processed and consummated through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension. Apart from Christ’s all-inclusive death, how could we be terminated? How could we be redeemed? Apart from Christ’s resurrection, how could we be germinated? We need to see that we are living at a great time—the time after the Triune God has been processed and consummated. </p>
<p data-content-id="nJML5FAvuoUKpyVUtziRH-BIVXrTdtA6LsYGwPunZ5VD1YX9tdJ4Cz07ZtS3KRtr4"> Our unique need as Christians is the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive, life-giving <span class="pg" data-page-id="109" id="109">[109]</span> Spirit. The Spirit is all that we need. Mainly we do not need righteousness or justification, nor do we need holiness or sanctification—our central need is the consummated Triune God as the Spirit with His rich supply. This Spirit is now in us and is one with us in life, in nature, and in essence, and we are one with Him. We all need to have a clear vision concerning this. </p>
<p data-content-id="6EooGpKeBO3yoSxEGu7yAA3rrL8YofRbuj9g24UsVzrXnB1zgcT2elJ5YTwTJnq-Q"> I can testify that, although I am very busy day by day, I am not the one working; rather, Christ, who lives in me, is the One working. Sixty-five years ago I did many things, but by the Lord’s mercy I have been learning of Paul to coordinate with the One living in me. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47737" data-verses="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> Paul said, “I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47738" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span> he said, “By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.” Humanly speaking, I cannot carry out the Lord’s work today or bear the burden of the churches around the globe. However, the work is easy to do and the burden is easy to bear when it is the processed and consummated One living in me who does the work and bears the burden. I praise Him that I simply enjoy His living and His working and rejoice in Him. </p>

Only the processed and consummated Triune God living in us as the all-inclusive Spirit can be a Christian. What the New Testament requires of us is too high. The kind of holiness required, for example, is something that we cannot produce. We praise the Lord that it is not we who need to fulfill the New Testament requirements but the Spirit in us who fulfills them. Instead of doing things in ourselves, we should simply enjoy His living and His working. Only the Spirit can be a Christian, and only the Spirit can be an overcomer. Remember, the Spirit is our God, our Father, our <span class="pg" data-page-id="110" id="110">[110]</span> Lord, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Shepherd, and our life and life supply. </p>
<p data-content-id="wDyqKr25LNkmzu4av_LyCz05P7OVuQEWJxnW-S6GdQh0SV7rcig4Xs1OM6zvyJcWT"> The Spirit is everything to us to live the Christian life. The Christian life is altogether the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit. In this Spirit we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In this Spirit we are in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47739" data-verses="Matthew 28:19">Matt. 28:19</span>). What kind of God do we have today? Our God is the processed and consummated Triune God, who is the consummated, all-inclusive Spirit as everything for our Christian life. When we have a need or a disability, we can remind Him of it. When we are facing a difficult situation, we can talk to Him about it. Then He, the One who lives in us, will come in to face the situation and to do whatever is needed. </p>

The Spirit is the consummated Triune God, and the bride is the regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified tripartite man. Eventually, the consummated Triune God and the glorified tripartite man will be married and become one in life, in nature, in element, and in essence. This will be a corporate entity—the New Jerusalem as the aggregate of the mingling of divinity and humanity to express the Triune God for eternity. Today’s church life should be a miniature of the marvelous New Jerusalem. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Q_6SBW44g52pELlR1ab848nI5NA-dy4tNzW0PnFTR1U6VsPMAyjU6KJVbLS1DcrUL">I. REBUKING BILDAD SARCASTICALLY</h2><p data-content-id="KTsQm0Aqc4vYwK6mxKPNA8XjPLLidGGOpRx5e2Y4hzb9RcA0YYYYpl5HK8WmIFq-L"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47744" data-verses="Job 26:1-4">26:1-4</span> Job rebuked Bildad sarcastically, saying, “How you have helped him who is without power! / How you have saved the arm of him who is without strength! / How you have counseled him who is without wisdom / And have plentifully declared sound knowledge! / To whom have you uttered words? / And whose spirit has come forth from you?” This surely was not a friendly word. Job’s three friends had come to visit him for the purpose of comforting and supporting him, but eventually Job and his friends got into a debate, contending and even fighting with one another. Their words had no spiritual light or reality. Instead, their speaking was according to the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Job’s friends only had the knowledge about such matters as being good in order to please God and to receive prosperity. <span class="pg" data-page-id="112" id="112">[112]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lu1rWVFMXAvXHaW4Zt-rioSE34Vg65Xj8okY2jP3pP7sA_VmcJwe7gAiEHtHMiw2k">II.

Job’s speaking here indicates that he had a superiority complex. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47745" data-verses="Job 26:5-14">verses 5 through 14</span> Job showed off his superior knowledge concerning the unlimited power of God. Job said that Sheol is naked before God, that He hangs the earth upon nothing, that He spread His cloud over the face of His throne, that by His power He stilled the sea and by His understanding He struck down Rahab (a sea monster spoken of in ancient narratives), and that by His Spirit the heavens became beauty. Then Job concluded by saying, “Behold, these are but the fringes of His ways; / And how small a whisper do we hear of Him! / But as for the thundering of His mightiness, who can comprehend it?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47746" data-verses="Job 26:14">v. 14</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="BLxW5DESliyXau9HfyzHqnjteledfO0eqQVudoEY1ejMcvt_k9MtOUSX2y-H1I1xM"> There was no need for Job to show off his superior knowledge or to speak to his friends in this way. The conversation between Job and his friends is not what we would expect from friends who care for each other. No one among them suggested that they pray and look to the Lord. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="xcBelsFoKBKqGldQV74HgcuHIzuwxp53_Rj3xXKybKy79uIHodFHOTy-sTaWtEGEf">III. HOLDING FAST INSISTENTLY<br/>TO HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND INTEGRITY</h2><p data-content-id="ruJXf7h9c1kanzoyxyhfwSKQJU0OwWWXGJN3jJ-jizouerWpmisJQ4ttYoVHfFjeb"> Job’s discourse in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47747" data-verses="Job 27:1-7">27:1-7</span> shows us that he held fast insistently to his righteousness and integrity. He declared that as God lives and as long as his breath was in him, his lips would not speak anything wrong nor would his tongue utter deceit. Then he said to his friends, “Far be it from me to declare you righteous!” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47748" data-verses="Job 27:5">v. 5a</span>). Here Job was saying that he would never admit that his friends were right. Following this, Job spoke a strong word about his integrity and righteousness: “Until I die, I will not put away my integrity from me. / To my righteousness I will hold fast, I will not let it go; / My heart does not reproach me for any of my days” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47749" data-verses="Job 27:5-6">vv. 5b-6</span>). He finished this part of his discourse with a word regarding his enemy: “May my enemy be like a wicked man, / And may he who rises up against me be like someone <span class="pg" data-page-id="113" id="113">[113]</span> unjust” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47750" data-verses="Job 27:7">v. 7</span>). Job’s thought was that, unlike others, he would never be unjust. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="dH9hAkXiiF-7k7uONnQrIsKx9rdrkllOzbLZ-a4sQ05stcuWf_c-TxgrK2gqN13UD">IV. TEACHING HIS FRIENDS HIGH-MINDEDLY<br/>CONCERNING THE HOPE OF THE PROFANE MAN</h2><p data-content-id="Q_6SBW44g52pELlR1abh28nI5NA-dy4tNzW0PnFTR1U6VsPMAyjU6KJVbLS1DcrUL"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47751" data-verses="Job 27:8-23">verses 8 through 23</span> Job continued by teaching his friends high-mindedly concerning the hope of the profane man. First, Job asked about the hope of the profane man when God cuts him off, taking away his soul and not hearing his cry. Then Job, having a superiority complex, said to his friends, “I will teach you about the hand of God; / What is with the Almighty I will not conceal” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47752" data-verses="Job 27:11">v. 11</span>). After this, Job went on to instruct his friends regarding the portion which the wicked man would receive from the Almighty. Concerning the wicked, Job claimed that his children will be multiplied for the sword, that those who remain of him will be buried in death, that the righteous will wear his garments and that the innocent will divide his silver, that terrors will overtake him like waters, that God will hurl at him and not spare, and that men will hiss him out of his place. </p>
<p data-content-id="KTsQm0Aqc4vYwK6mxKPUP8XjPLLidGGOpRx5e2Y4hzb9RcA0YYYYpl5HK8WmIFq-L"> There was no need for Job to speak a word such as this. This was a word with no light, life, love, or kindness. At best, this was a teaching as a kind of warning. However, none of his friends needed this teaching; they already knew these things and could have taught concerning them. Nevertheless, due to his superiority complex, he taught his friends in a high-minded manner. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lu1rWVFMXAvXHaW4Zt-OuoSE34Vg65Xj8okY2jP3pP7sA_VmcJwe7gAiEHtHMiw2k">V.

Job twice asked where wisdom can be found and where the place of understanding is (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47754" data-verses="Job 28:12">vv. 12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47755" data-verses="Job 28:20">20</span>). Then he said that God, who sees to the ends of the earth and beholds all that is under heaven, knows the place of wisdom and the way to it (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47756" data-verses="Job 28:23-24">vv. 23-24</span>). Thus, God said to man, “Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; / And to depart from evil <span class="pg" data-page-id="114" id="114">[114]</span> is understanding” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47757" data-verses="Job 28:28">v. 28</span>). Surely Job’s friends already knew about fearing the Lord and departing from evil. Every godly person knew this; there was no need for Job to repeat it. However, Job spoke in this way because he was high-minded and thought that in knowledge he was superior to his friends. </p>

DWELLING ON HIS EXCELLENT PAST</h2><p data-content-id="DyAowCz452QOQeurmGgyZgNThCWZmXEJsVZhT5WRi4Pcw3pXWpXPSuyVnCFUDdjJU"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47759" data-verses="Job 29:1">Chapter twenty-nine</span> is a record of Job’s dwelling on his excellent past. He recalled the days of his prime when the intimate counsel with God was over his tent, the Almighty was with him, and his children were around him. He remembered that he delivered the poor man who cried out and the orphan who had no one to help him. He also made the widow’s heart shout for joy. Thus Job could declare, “I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; / My justice was like a robe and a turban” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47760" data-verses="Job 29:14">v. 14</span>). Job went on to say that, in his excellent past, he was eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, and a father to the needy. Others listened to his counsel, and after his words they did not speak again. Job chose the way for them and sat as chief, dwelling “as a king among the troops, / As one who comforts those who mourn” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47761" data-verses="Job 29:25">v. 25</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="S7qkAmGv3xhf5wzShrxYtDybZEmf2NJTcRTvMGjAhpzT0jKMZxybV8IoKd0-DRf6N">VII. SIGHING OVER HIS MISERABLE PRESENT</h2><p data-content-id="guSQOY8dnNPxZIlrNpuLCVNGBoD_L6qKHF_2CRR1vpPyZViAVhpKKH8hjm7BMAgaK"> After dwelling on his excellent past, Job in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47762" data-verses="Job 30:1">chapter thirty</span> <span class="pg" data-page-id="116" id="116">[116]</span> sighed over his miserable present. Job said that those who were younger than he held him in derision and that others made him a byword, abhorred him, and stood aloof from him, casting off restraint in his presence. Next, Job said that terrors had turned upon him, that his prosperity had passed away like a cloud, that his soul was poured out within him, and that days of affliction had taken hold of him. Job continued by saying that he cried to God, but God did not answer him. According to Job’s feeling, God had turned to become cruel to him. Job said to Him, “I know that You will bring me into death, / And to the house appointed for all living” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47763" data-verses="Job 30:23">v. 23</span>). Job also sighed over the fact that when he expected good, evil came, and when he waited for light, darkness came. Job concluded by saying that his inward parts were in turmoil, that days of affliction had drawn near to him, and that his harp had become mourning and his pipe, the voice of those who weep. Here we see a picture of Job’s sufferings. </p>
<p data-content-id="LE0U7mbRuxHwEP0XSBNm30NtfK_LEJw_JSvMSymIE7qHIabzqql3mQW44_FljuwBj"> Job did not understand the reason for his sufferings, but today we know the reason. It was true that Job suffered, but his suffering was allowed by God for a purpose. God wanted to take away all his successes. Job was very successful, both materially and ethically. He had attained to a very high degree of perfection and uprightness. That was his integrity, and he was proud of it. Job considered his perfection and integrity as a robe to cover him and as a turban to glorify him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47764" data-verses="Job 29:14">29:14</span>). However, God took these away in order that Job would pursue God Himself instead of other things, yet Job did not understand. He thought that he was right and that God had done something wrong toward him. Therefore, he was hoping to have an opportunity to present his case before God. From this we can see that Job was altogether in another realm, one which was contrary to God’s desire. </p>
<p data-content-id="ms4li0Tx41JNal0fNbvB1eR1r7cPABtex0tpVk4Lr8jrNXPt1QZulAZEPIPlDnWrV"> Eventually, Job recognized that he had known God only “by the hearing of the ear” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47765" data-verses="Job 42:5">42:5a</span>). He had heard about God and he had believed in God, but he had never seen God. However, through all the strippings and consumings, the time came when Job saw God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47766" data-verses="Job 42:5">42:5b</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ZxI9cnvSgtMqm1OaHt55j3uqVKjPLzv9tgRwwmNir-R25AVjDLqGUFJGsSmNIhTB9"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47767" data-verses="Matthew 5:8">Matthew 5:8</span> says, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” Here, seeing God is a great reward in the <span class="pg" data-page-id="117" id="117">[117]</span> kingdom. According to the clear view in the New Testament, to see God is to receive God into us. If seeing God is merely an objective seeing of God and nothing else, that means very little. But seeing God is to receive God, and this means that God comes into us as our element to renew us, to transform us, because God’s coming in adds the divine element into our being. This divine element works on us and in us to renew us, discharging all our old element. Eventually, our entire being becomes new. This is transformation. </p>
<p data-content-id="Aqsw4GvKkD8eO4yHOcem-BFXBCOt4O90Gfbyt25_f73eCPo63WssyXb84PRPc1ltk"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47768" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">Second Corinthians 3:18</span> says, “We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.” First we behold God, that is, see God; then we reflect Him and are transformed. In our seeing God we are being transformed into His glorious image, from one degree of glory to another. This is from the Lord Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="F5gouwIlHW1OZ5Cc_WNlj8Z5rFJGiXhrspMkGXwOR2jeTZWdbjjcvMFEhHU8tF1Ox"> The God whom Job saw was also the Spirit, but at that time God was still in His original state. God had His divine element with His divine attributes, but He did not have anything related to incarnation, humanity, and human living. According to <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47769" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>, the God whom we are looking at today is different, for He is much richer in His ingredients. Hence, the more we look at Him, the more we receive His ingredients into our being as our inner supply to work on us, to discharge the old, and to make us new. This is to transform us into God’s image. </p>
<p data-content-id="Cm5NyYb1PEdEBUqHfcrUA08kc7-E_K0JxIT9_tbk8RYEHJ2-0f9E8-ncIQ47SwJT9"> Seeing God should issue in the transformation of our being into God’s image. I do not believe Job had such a realization when he saw God. It is a fact that his sufferings did issue in one thing—he saw God. It is hard to say, however, in what way Job saw God, whether in a physical way or in the way of a spiritual revelation. </p>
<p data-content-id="P7nAcQf9nW3qhJT5CVIQCe7DaoxYQSOczBY5jfuQSQUCCeMCzGGxvivbTMMoYMcY1"> Our way of looking at God today is altogether a matter in the spirit. The God whom we may look at is the consummated Spirit, and we can look at Him in our spirit. Sometimes we are too busy or too careless to take the opportunity to look at the Lord. In our morning watch, even if only for fifteen or twenty minutes, we have time to be with the Lord, time to <span class="pg" data-page-id="118" id="118">[118]</span> remain in the Spirit. At such a time we may pray-read His word, talk to Him, or pray to Him with short prayers. Then we will have the sense that we are receiving something of God’s element, that we are absorbing the riches of God into our being. In this way we are under the divine transformation day by day. </p>
<p data-content-id="-mTAkR7iIQE7J3fZxFUzjGp_ifHg7GHBmSrVq9oP9LWWzIs68_3NUYA4uoHWK6ANb"> Our Christian life is a life not of changing outwardly but of being transformed from within by having the divine element added into our inner being to replace our old element. This is altogether by our looking at the processed and consummated God, who is the all-inclusive Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="peBulwTqnHSCXbKB-SlSGJt3JCI4_dMM44S1fK_u0HNj_xyP44m-ysHnJ_J7lmQDV"> By reading Job’s final word in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47770" data-verses="Job 30:1">chapter thirty</span>, we can realize that Job and his friends were walking on the way of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They were not in the realm of endeavoring to see God in order to learn of Him and especially to receive Him so that they could be transformed with His element and essence to be made the same as God in life and in nature. We all need to see a clear comparison between the way taken by Job and his friends and the way revealed in the New Testament. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47779" data-verses="Philippians 3:8">Philippians 3:8</span> Paul says, “Moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.” The suffering here is for the gaining of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47780" data-verses="Colossians 1:24">Colossians 1:24</span> Paul says, “I now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.” The suffering here is for the Body.

<p data-content-id="iW7odAwFn6M_vn6P60zNTqH44E5UxdGbtd8WSDlh-7gKzwV-KsbolqbLfu4tzqPX5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47781" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">verse 25</span> Paul went on to say that he became a minister of the church according to the stewardship of God to complete the word of God. The Greek word translated “stewardship” here is <em>oikonomia,</em> which has been anglicized as the word “economy.” Hence, we may also say that Paul became a minister according to the economy of God. In his ministry Paul was charged by God to do a wonderful work—to complete the word of God, that is, to complete the divine revelation in God’s written word. The “word of God” in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47782" data-verses="Colossians 1:25">verse 25</span> is, according to Greek grammar, the mystery in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47783" data-verses="Colossians 1:26">verse 26</span>, “the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but <span class="pg" data-page-id="120" id="120">[120]</span> now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47784" data-verses="Colossians 1:26-27">vv. 26-27</span>).

In the Old Testament we do not see God’s move but only God’s preparatory work for Him to move. God’s move began in the four Gospels with Christ’s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This was the beginning of God’s move in Christ to bring forth His Body. </p>
<p data-content-id="ok7bGt0pYndF_JXRQo7fDFXgW_oH760OMp75doRxuGAj4er8XnBp3UqChwPIwfiM5"> Christ, the incarnated God, entered into humanity to bring divinity into humanity, making these two entities one, joining them together to be one entity, the God-man. Now God and man are one in nature, in life, in essence, in element, and even in expression. How wonderful that there is such a One in the universe! This One passed through human living, entered into the all-inclusive death, and came out of death into resurrection. Through resurrection and in resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47786" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>) and the life-giving Spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47787" data-verses="1Corinthians 15:45">1 Cor. 15:45</span>), and He regenerated all His believers to be the sons of God and the members of Himself. As a result, the church has appeared on the scene. </p>
<p data-content-id="32kxBpqEA8Y5ihk9aEp5g0MOiIlYffyQ1Dyd5XdYT5brTMwHFsT-wu2CtB_YnAgGO"> Before this, God’s move was just in one person, Christ. This means that God was moving only in Himself. Now, since Christ ascended and descended to bring forth the church, God’s move has entered into a second stage—the stage of God’s move in a corporate vessel. First, God moved in Christ singly as a personal vessel; now God is moving in the church as a corporate vessel. As such a vessel the church is the enlargement of Christ, the expansion of Christ. Now God’s move is in a corporate way. This corporate way is just the <span class="pg" data-page-id="121" id="121">[121]</span> Body of Christ, the church, the new man, the organism of the Triune God. </p>

<p data-content-id="Yj1E9-l69h9I-vz6m5loM7spNchk42nn6KfzgGbdDuSwOZPCebZepmo0kTOr6_Csq"> This stage of God’s corporate move is revealed in Acts through Revelation. This is the deepest and the most profound, heavenly, divine, spiritual, and organic section of the Bible. This section concerns God’s eternal economy regarding Christ as the mystery of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47788" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Col. 2:2</span>) and the church, the Body, as the mystery of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47789" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4">Eph. 3:4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47790" data-verses="Ephesians 3:6">6</span>). Christ is the mystery of God, and the Body of Christ is the mystery of Christ. These two mysteries are the contents of the divine economy. </p>

The substance, essence, element, and expression of this part of the Word are simply the processed, consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive, compound, indwelling Spirit who indwells us in our spirit to be our life, our nature, our essence, and our everything, that we may be the same as the Triune God in life and nature to be His fullness as His full expression in a corporate way. </p>
<p data-content-id="S7qkAmGv3xhf5wzSirx9vDybZEmf2NJTcRTvMGjAhpzT0jKMZxybV8IoKd0-DRf6N"> The processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit is in our spirit. Therefore, as Christians we should remain in our spirit. We should not go to visit our flesh, and we should not befriend our soul. Our spirit is our precious place. To worldly people it is a prison, but to us it is a palace. Here in our spirit we can enjoy the processed Triune God. </p>

Exercising our spirit is like breathing. Even when we are resting we are still breathing. We may say that breathing signifies our exercising of our spirit. Just as we breathe without ceasing, we need to <span class="pg" data-page-id="122" id="122">[122]</span> pray unceasingly (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47791" data-verses="1Thessalonians 5:17">1 Thes. 5:17</span>).

This will cause us to be deified, that is, to be constituted with the processed Triune God to be made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. In this sense we may speak of the deification of the believers, a process that will consummate in the New Jerusalem. </p>
<p data-content-id="tpP37fHpiAj4rvTEEcC5wJlXJP_Q9w2NO3Bm0UrSTfsybX1rvzTzD-tHZTiccChYP"> Do you know what the New Jerusalem is? The New Jerusalem is a composition of God’s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified people who have been deified. On God’s side, the Triune God has been incarnated to be a man; on our side, we are being deified, constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God so that we may be made God in life and in nature to be His corporate expression for eternity. This is the highest truth, and this is the highest gospel. </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="peBulwTqnHSCXbKB7SlPEJt3JCI4_dMM44S1fK_u0HNj_xyP44m-ysHnJ_J7lmQDV">THE PRINCIPLE OF GOD’S MOVE ON EARTH</h2><p data-content-id="vBSp6y8_glqCO4TdFBrZBT-qkSgMBkgC2Zwvuo6axOAhCcjtHIpxQwPpo1QyB7AN7"> The New Testament, a record of God’s move, shows us that God can never move apart from man. In the beginning of the New Testament, God moved into man, gained man, and became a man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47823" data-verses="Matthew 1:21-23">Matt. 1:21-23</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47824" data-verses="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47825" data-verses="John 1:14">14</span>). He moved not only as God and not merely as man; He moved as the God-man. This was the reason that in the four Gospels the high priests, the elders, the scribes, and the Roman officials did not know who Jesus was. They could not determine whether His activities were the activities of God or the activities of a man. He was a mystery, for He was God, yet man; He was man, yet God. </p>
<p data-content-id="WAjiwjsA6dxZhXTeVjG9agMtEZI5ZwADVw16jMYikxIOYzB7g3lc_Z48QnrDi_FQ8"> Athanasius, one of the early church fathers, said concerning Christ, “He was made man that we might be made God,” and “The Word was made flesh...that we, partaking of His Spirit, might be deified.” This is the principle of God’s move on earth. God’s move is in man and through man. God’s move is to deify man, making man God in life and in nature but not, of course, in the Godhead. </p>
<p data-content-id="2D5Jk28QAFCdGt9NU6fsIwtJ984uopeYsUQmOufEb5F3ddcoa7N0nPXdggU2-4PiP"> In the four Gospels Christ was just one person, but on the day of Pentecost, after His death, resurrection, ascension, and descension, He was enlarged and expanded from one person into thousands of persons (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47826" data-verses="Acts 2:41">Acts 2:41</span>). A large group of people <span class="pg" data-page-id="130" id="130">[130]</span> began to move in the divine move. In the four Gospels God moved in man’s move, but in Acts man moved in God’s move. God and man moved together. The chief priests, the elders, the scribes, and the Roman officials did not understand what had happened to Peter and John, because they knew them only as Galilean fishermen (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47827" data-verses="Acts 4:13">4:13</span>). Nevertheless, they had to admit that what these men did was divine (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47828" data-verses="Acts 4:16">4:16</span>). When they moved, God moved. Eventually, Gamaliel, a great rabbi, advised the Sanhedrin, the highest court of the Jews, concerning the apostles, saying, “Withdraw from these men and leave them alone; for should this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest you be found to be even fighters against God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47829" data-verses="Acts 5:38-39">5:38-39</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="S7qkAmGv3xhf5wzSkrx9nDybZEmf2NJTcRTvMGjAhpzT0jKMZxybV8IoKd0-DRf6N">CHRISTIANS BEING MYSTERIOUS<br/>BECAUSE THEY MOVE IN GOD’S MOVE<br/>AND GOD MOVES IN THEIR MOVE</h2><p data-content-id="guSQOY8dnNPxZIlrIpuqJVNGBoD_L6qKHF_2CRR1vpPyZViAVhpKKH8hjm7BMAgaK"> Genuine Christians are mysterious and cannot be understood by unbelievers. We Christians are a mystery because we move in God’s move, and God moves in our move. God and we, we and God, move together. The worldly people know only the human part of us—they do not realize that we also have a divine part. This divine part, which is involved in our move in God’s move and God’s move in our move, is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="eFq9eeSNkZqoWu2M0F2iRCX-YYc3pfT0ssFp0h3tN18DX-UXw4uUl_kRtmncYE0-L">THE REALM OF ETHICS AND THE REALM OF GOD</h2><p data-content-id="5v3HlaC7WfrHKR34z8yTIIzas4FvQriotcTrofucRGlKhiklEdrXslrVYDqR_w_up"> Job pursued something in the realm of ethics, but we Christians today pursue something in the realm of God. What we are doing is a mystery, and this mystery is the Triune God consummated as the Spirit indwelling us, moving with us, and even moving in us. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="NI4f6RH5E4QGj2PXw7QuSpywB_H3NE7R55-Q5vBSesL0recPo1UAxyd6s4vnwkJ3P">THE SPIRIT AND WE BEING ONE</h2><p data-content-id="tpP37fHpiAj4rvTECcC12JlXJP_Q9w2NO3Bm0UrSTfsybX1rvzTzD-tHZTiccChYP"> We are not merely one <em>with</em> the Spirit, but we <em>and</em> the Spirit are one. This is illustrated by the move of the apostle Paul and his co-workers in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47830" data-verses="Acts 16:1">Acts 16</span>. They were forbidden by <span class="pg" data-page-id="131" id="131">[131]</span> the Holy Spirit to turn to the left into Asia (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47831" data-verses="Acts 16:6">v. 6</span>), and they were not allowed by the Spirit of Jesus to turn to the right into Bithynia (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47832" data-verses="Acts 16:7">v. 7</span>). This indicated a straight forward direction for their move. Paul then received a vision of a Macedonian man, and after considering the vision, Paul and his co-workers concluded that God had called them to announce the gospel to the Macedonians (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47833" data-verses="Acts 16:10">v. 10</span>). This is a wonderful picture of man moving in God’s move, of man and God moving together. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="hCrRxb5iWEiiuF6Pwmo2izIm9-tXNSKjE63fiJfvPUSmnT_C3kHcfb5u7pNbEaD7N">NOT TAKING ANY ACTION<br/>APART FROM THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2><p data-content-id="UIQOnevT9J1jipEy0b4e2bcPnn_ON2xauBAu1hdOdN_zIrmZYe1fbWpdfODuG88rm"> We should not take any action apart from the all-inclusive Spirit. We should not face any situation or meet any need apart from the Spirit. When He moves, we move; when we move, He moves. We need to practice this in our married life. If you desire to say something to your spouse, you should wait for a period of time, until you have the assurance that your speaking is the move of the Spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="MFNsqyUzUamIhTJMz4OnUk9XX0iDG8HxGpqszonA6YCdPELFOtO_CjQxPRxFZMVdK"> We need to learn not to do things too quickly. Acting hastily is the living of a descendant of Adam. Those who live in that way are quick to speak, to act, and to deal with others. We must remember that, as Christians, we are not the only ones moving. On the contrary, we are moving in another One’s moving, and another One is moving in our moving. This kind of life is a constituent of the church. This kind of life keeps the Body of Christ in a living condition. However, not to move in the Spirit’s move and not to have the Spirit in our move will bring death into the church. </p>
<p data-content-id="VOtlOdgrPMjWPQKD-r0S-Sd5QtFRhPOODrLqx2UYb8cM7VDI7r651PIfKrCgLIoJj"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47834" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> does not say that the Spirit speaks with the bride; rather, this verse says, “The Spirit and the bride say....” The two speak together. This indicates that we should not merely speak <em>with</em> the Spirit; we <em>and</em> the Spirit should speak together. If this is the case, our speaking will be living and full of impact. The way we must take today is the way of moving in the move of the Spirit and of having the Spirit moving in our move. </p>

<p data-content-id="kPaHTugPPe89nd8S1vLZ9tej0gdsVteUVeNJznDb8D4_xlvyXLhfqVIUEskr3LhgN"> Elihu thought of himself as wise, but in being angry against Job and his three friends he was very foolish.

Then to these older ones Elihu said, “Hear me; / I too will declare what I know” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47840" data-verses="Job 32:10">v. 10</span>).

He desired to speak that he might have some relief, without respecting any man’s person nor flattering any man (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47843" data-verses="Job 32:20-22">vv. 20-22</span>). </p>

Elihu spoke here without any politeness or humility. If we would speak to others in such a way, they would surely be offended. Today we certainly should not tell the saints to give ear to all our words. </p>
<p data-content-id="0XZzdNDndnSKNF9QTInhIsUqT-dr6IpQ9co4NVf_bYOdAL3qHOcBMfj2bDXuOUyou"> Elihu then declared that his words would manifest the uprightness of his heart and that his tongue would speak what he knew sincerely (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47845" data-verses="Job 33:3">v. 3</span>). Saying that the Spirit of God had made him and that the breath of the Almighty had enlivened him, Elihu told Job, “If you can, respond to me; / Arrange your words before me; take your stand” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47846" data-verses="Job 33:5">v. 5</span>). Furthermore, Elihu said that no fear of him would terrify Job <span class="pg" data-page-id="135" id="135">[135]</span> and that Elihu’s pressure could not be heavy upon him (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47847" data-verses="Job 33:7">v. 7</span>). This kind of talk was altogether unnecessary. </p>

According to Elihu, Job was also not right in saying, “Behold, He finds occasions for hostility against me; / He considers me as His enemy. / He puts my feet in stocks; / He watches all my paths” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47849" data-verses="Job 33:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>). Explaining that God is greater than man, Elihu continued by rebuking Job, asking him, “Why do you contend with Him, / Saying that He does not answer for any of His affairs?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47850" data-verses="Job 33:13">v. 13</span>). It is hard to understand why Elihu talked to Job in such a way. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ruJXf7h9c1kanzoy0yhT2SKQJU0OwWWXGJN3jJ-jizouerWpmisJQ4ttYoVHfFjeb">A.

Elihu claimed that God speaks to men in two ways—in a dream, a night vision, and by opening the ears of men and sealing up their instruction. Do you believe that God contacts people only in these two ways? Elihu was actually setting up a rule for God to follow. This is something that no one should do. </p>

According to Elihu, God accomplishes all these things for a man twice, even three times (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47853" data-verses="Job 33:19-30">vv. 19-30</span>). </p>

What kind of wisdom could Elihu teach Job? No wisdom was expressed in Elihu’s speaking. </p>
<p data-content-id="4Z3ZpDvorgWtdhNMZ_8Izegog-zO0jRNYJOE6XiRy834s8WLOMrxqBM5uykzo1Hnq"> Thus far, Elihu had not answered Job with a clear view—in spite of the full assurance he had that he could answer Job adequately concerning the purpose of God in dealing with Job—like the apostle Paul’s clear vision in the New Testament concerning the goal of gaining Christ in his suffering of the loss of all things (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47855" data-verses="Philippians 3:8-14">Phil. 3:8-14</span>). Elihu’s word had nothing of the divine wisdom. With Paul, however, there was a clear word of revelation. Hence, Paul’s word was truly the word of wisdom. </p>

Rather, God will render a man’s work to him and will cause a man to receive that which is according to his own way (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47868" data-verses="Job 34:11">v. 11</span>).

Elihu said that God’s eyes are upon the ways of a man and that He sees all their steps; that He, knowing the actions of the mighty men, breaks them in pieces without inquiry and puts others in their stead; and that He strikes them as He would evil men because they turned aside from following Him and would not regard any of His ways. Toward the end of this speech, Elihu asked Job, “Should He recompense to fit you, since you have rejected it?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47872" data-verses="Job 34:33">v. 33a</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="ms4li0Tx41JNal0fKbvN3eR1r7cPABtex0tpVk4Lr8jrNXPt1QZulAZEPIPlDnWrV"> By reading <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47873" data-verses="Job 34:1">chapter thirty-four</span>, we can realize that Elihu was a person who was full of the knowledge of good and evil. This young man should have considered that Job and his three friends already knew all the things that he was speaking. But he was so full of knowledge, he said that he would burst if he did not speak. </p>
<p data-content-id="ZxI9cnvSgtMqm1OaAt51l3uqVKjPLzv9tgRwwmNir-R25AVjDLqGUFJGsSmNIhTB9"> I have often wondered why this book does not say that Job and his three friends and Elihu came together to pray by exercising their spirits to touch God. I cannot understand how such a group of godly men could come together without any prayer. They just exercised their minds. Their speaking was all composed of poetry. Even Elihu’s word was spoken in poetic form. That requires much exercise of the mentality. Why would they not pray together to seek the Lord’s mind, to seek the Lord’s purpose? What a pity that they did not do this! </p>

Elihu asked him if he considered his answer to be just.

But according to Elihu, no one says, “Where is God my Maker, / Who gives songs in the night, / Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth / And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47880" data-verses="Job 35:10-11">vv. 10-11</span>). Elihu then said that God does not answer their cry because of the pride of evil men. He said further that God does not hear and regard an empty cry (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47881" data-verses="Job 35:12-13">vv. 12-13</span>).

<p data-content-id="I4LaSIw89KK1RQODIKRQijvhnVEPi6kG4YIlmJ5JQwX7q3bSa1RmEZ8in5cY5TLqO"> Elihu went on to say that Job had said that he did not behold God, that his cause was before God, and that he had to wait on God. According to Elihu, because God had not visited in His anger nor regarded such great arrogance, Job had opened his mouth in vanity and had multiplied words without knowledge (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47882" data-verses="Job 35:14-16">vv. 14-16</span>). Elihu accused Job of speaking <span class="pg" data-page-id="141" id="141">[141]</span> vanity, but what about his own words?

They did not pray, and they did not have fellowship with God or with one another in spirit. Although they were godly men, they did not come together to pray by exercising their spirit to touch God. Instead of exercising their spirit, they exercised their mind to compose poetry and to make a display of their knowledge. In this matter, Elihu followed the example of the older ones and spoke in the same way. Therefore, he said, “Hear me; / I too will declare what I know” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47888" data-verses="Job 32:10">32:10</span>). As we have pointed out, Elihu was a person who was full of the knowledge of good and evil. He was not a person in the spirit. </p>

Here the word <em>spirit</em> refers not to the Spirit of God but to the human spirit as the organ for us to realize and respond to God’s move. Only spirit (our spirit) can respond to Spirit (God’s Spirit). </p>
<p data-content-id="cKV2Ia0vFjWXw-s5EGjf2c8AhIJsV60OrjXYrMo_Fb4xvwo2j9keFVTBzFDZ9J4P4"> At that time John had been exiled to the island of Patmos. John was alone, having no church, church meetings, or fellowship with the saints. Nevertheless, John was in spirit. This means that John was a person who remained in his spirit. Because he was in his spirit, he was in reality a member of the Body of Christ and a part of the new man. <span class="pg" data-page-id="144" id="144">[144]</span> </p>

This book is composed of four major visions: (1) the vision of the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47890" data-verses="Revelation 1:1">chs. 1—3</span>); (2) the vision of the destiny of the world (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47891" data-verses="Revelation 4:1">chs. 4—16</span>); (3) the vision of Babylon the Great (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47892" data-verses="Revelation 17:1">chs. 17—18</span>); and (4) the vision of the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47893" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">chs. 21—22</span>). John was in his spirit when he saw these four visions (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47894" data-verses="Revelation 1:10">1:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47895" data-verses="Revelation 4:2">4:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47896" data-verses="Revelation 17:3">17:3</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47897" data-verses="Revelation 21:10">21:10</span>). We too need to be in our spirit to see the visions in this book. It is not merely a matter of mental understanding in our mind but of spiritual realization in our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="0XZzdNDndnSKNF9QRInhAsUqT-dr6IpQ9co4NVf_bYOdAL3qHOcBMfj2bDXuOUyou"> First, John saw the lampstands as the symbols of the churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47898" data-verses="Revelation 1:12">1:12</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47899" data-verses="Revelation 1:20">20</span>), indicating God’s economy concerning the Body of Christ. Then in this book there are the seven epistles to the seven churches (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47900" data-verses="Revelation 2:1">chs. 2—3</span>). In these seven epistles we have the speaking of the Spirit to the seven churches. This is followed by the scene in the heavens (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47901" data-verses="Revelation 4:1">chs. 4—5</span>), the seven seals (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47902" data-verses="Revelation 6:1">6:1—8:5</span>), the seven trumpets (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47903" data-verses="Revelation 8:6">8:6—11:19</span>), and the seven bowls (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47904" data-verses="Revelation 15:1">15:1—16:21</span>). John also saw the destruction of religious Babylon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47905" data-verses="Revelation 17:1-18">17:1-18</span>), the destruction of material, commercial Babylon (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47906" data-verses="Revelation 18:1-24">18:1-24</span>), the marriage of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47907" data-verses="Revelation 19:5-10">19:5-10</span>), Christ’s defeating and destroying of Antichrist (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47908" data-verses="Revelation 19:11-21">19:11-21</span>), the binding of Satan (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47909" data-verses="Revelation 20:1-3">20:1-3</span>), the millennial kingdom (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47910" data-verses="Revelation 20:4-6">20:4-6</span>), and the judgment of the great white throne (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47911" data-verses="Revelation 20:11-15">20:11-15</span>). Eventually, John saw the new heaven and the new earth with the ultimate consummation of God’s economy, the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47912" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-27">21:1-27</span>). Such visions came to him because he was in spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="79gaGa6nQQEvhKOJtxIZsMxG6JE90xC-hZlCiBeqgqvZnyC0IbJ6vUfnRltF7fepm"> When I was young, I was very interested in studying the prophecies in the book of Revelation. Today I have less interest in the prophecies but more interest in being enlightened by considering the spiritual visions in this book, in particular the visions of the seven lampstands and of the New Jerusalem. At the beginning of Revelation, we have the local churches as the golden lampstands; at the end, we have the New Jerusalem as the unique, universal golden lampstand in <span class="pg" data-page-id="145" id="145">[145]</span> eternity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47913" data-verses="Revelation 21:10-11">21:10-11</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47914" data-verses="Revelation 21:18">18b</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47915" data-verses="Revelation 21:23">23</span>). Seeing the visions in Revelation will help you to be a person in the spirit. </p>

On the Lord’s Day John was in his spirit. We all need to learn to be imprisoned in our spirit and not to get out of our spirit. We must be persons who are in our spirit all the time. If we are this kind of person, others will not be able to understand us because in spirit we are moving as our God is moving in us. </p>
<p data-content-id="xcBelsFoKBKqGldQS74HkcuHIzuwxp53_Rj3xXKybKy79uIHodFHOTy-sTaWtEGEf"> When we turn to our spirit and get into our spirit, even while we are driving, we may sing, praise, or rejoice. We may also cry, weeping as we pray, “Lord, look at the situation of Your Body.” We have all tasted this to some extent. We must be perfected and built up to be such persons. There is no other way to be a lover of God, to be a seeker of Christ, or to be an overcomer than to be in spirit. </p>

And this God is the consummated Spirit, the reality of Christ. Furthermore, when you have Christ, you have the church because Christ is the Head of the new man and the church is the Body. Then you will enjoy the church, the Body, as well as Christ, the Head. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="Q_6SBW44g52pELlRyabh68nI5NA-dy4tNzW0PnFTR1U6VsPMAyjU6KJVbLS1DcrUL">THE PREVAILING PRAYERS OF A PERSON<br/>IN THE SPIRIT MOVING IN THE LORD’S MOVE</h2><p data-content-id="KTsQm0Aqc4vYwK6m2KPUD8XjPLLidGGOpRx5e2Y4hzb9RcA0YYYYpl5HK8WmIFq-L"> When you are in the spirit, the matters of the local church will come to you, and this will cause you to pray for the situation of the church. These prayers are the real, prevailing prayers because you pray in your spirit and because, in spirit, you are moving in the Lord’s move. Your prayer is the Lord’s move in you. You and the Lord, the Lord and you, are two moving together and praying together. This is quite sweet and is very different from the prayer that is out of <span class="pg" data-page-id="146" id="146">[146]</span> responsibility, obligation, or some kind of duty. This is a prayer in sweet fellowship with the Lord. </p>
<p data-content-id="lu1rWVFMXAvXHaW4et-CooSE34Vg65Xj8okY2jP3pP7sA_VmcJwe7gAiEHtHMiw2k"> The way to be such a person is very simple—the way is to be in our spirit. I very much like the phrase “in spirit on the Lord’s Day.” First, John was in his spirit, and then he heard the voice, a “loud voice like a trumpet.” When he turned to see the voice that spoke with him, he saw the vision of the seven golden lampstands (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47916" data-verses="Revelation 1:12">Rev. 1:12</span>). We all need to learn of John to be in our spirit to see the vision and to enjoy the Lord, to enjoy the Body, and to enjoy the speaking of the Spirit to the churches. </p>

He said, “I will bring my knowledge from afar / And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. / For truly my words are not false; / One perfect in knowledge is with you” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47920" data-verses="Job 36:3-4">vv. 3-4</span>). I do not believe that Elihu was speaking for God at all; he was speaking absolutely for himself, making a display of his knowledge. Actually, he had less knowledge than Job and the three friends. Although Elihu said that he ascribed righteousness to God, he in fact ascribed everything to himself, going so far as to refer to himself as “one perfect in knowledge.” </p>

Here Elihu skipped from one subject to another, and it is difficult to know what he was talking about. </p>
<p data-content-id="6EooGpKeBO3yoSxIHu7yEA3rrL8YofRbuj9g24UsVzrXnB1zgcT2elJ5YTwTJnq-Q"> Elihu said that God “does not preserve the wicked man <span class="pg" data-page-id="148" id="148">[148]</span> alive” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47922" data-verses="Job 36:6">v. 6a</span>). This is not true, for many wicked people are still living. Elihu also said that those who hear God and serve Him “will spend their days in prosperity / And their years in pleasantness” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47923" data-verses="Job 36:11">v. 11</span>). Such a concept is altogether according to the principle of good and evil. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47924" data-verses="Job 36:16">verse 16</span> he went on to say, “Indeed He allures you from the jaws of distress / Into a spacious place, where there is no constraint; / And what is upon your table would be full of fatness.” </p>

Here Elihu seemed to be saying that Job was not enjoying a table full of fatness because he was occupied with the judgment of the wicked, continually thinking that God should exercise His judgment upon the wicked, with justice being the verdict of judgment. Thus, judgment and justice had taken hold of Job. </p>

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47929" data-verses="Job 36:26">36:26</span> Elihu declared, “Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him; / The number of His years we also cannot search out.” In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47930" data-verses="Job 37:5">37:5</span> he said, “God thunders wondrously with His voice; / He does great things that we cannot comprehend.” Elihu’s speaking here is a display of his ability and capacity to compose <span class="pg" data-page-id="149" id="149">[149]</span> poetry.

He concluded his charge by saying, “The Almighty—we cannot find Him out; / He is excellent in power, / And justice and the abundance of righteousness / He will not damage” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47932" data-verses="Job 37:23">v. 23</span>). </p>

INSTRUCTING JOB TO FEAR GOD</h2><p data-content-id="P7nAcQf9nW3qhJT5LVIcEe7DaoxYQSOczBY5jfuQSQUCCeMCzGGxvivbTMMoYMcY1"> Finally, in his last word to Job, Elihu instructed Job to fear God, who does not look upon any who are wise of heart (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47933" data-verses="Job 37:24">v. 24</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="-mTAkR7iIQE7J3fZ4FU_lGp_ifHg7GHBmSrVq9oP9LWWzIs68_3NUYA4uoHWK6ANb"> Concerning the purpose of God in dealing with Job, even in the highlight of his final word to Job, Elihu did not have the capacity to afford Job a divine revelation that is up to the New Testament level, namely, that God’s purpose in allowing the believers to suffer the loss of all things is that they may gain God as their eternal portion for them to inherit and enjoy as the eternal life unto eternity, as the Lord revealed to His disciples in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47934" data-verses="Matthew 19:27-29">Matthew 19:27-29</span>. </p>
<p data-content-id="peBulwTqnHSCXbKB3SleMJt3JCI4_dMM44S1fK_u0HNj_xyP44m-ysHnJ_J7lmQDV"> Job was suffering, and his three friends came to comfort him. Elihu was also there to help the situation. However, these godly people did not pray for Job nor did they fellowship with one another by exercising their spirit that all of them might receive a certain amount of spiritual supply. That would have helped them find out the real purpose of God’s dealing with Job. They talked about God, and they also referred to their spirit, but in all their debates there is no hint that they were exercising their spirit. Rather, they were exercising their mind, searching for words from the heavens, from the air, from the birds in the air, from the beasts on the earth, and from the fish in the sea, to compose their poetry. </p>
<p data-content-id="vBSp6y8_glqCO4TdJBrMIT-qkSgMBkgC2Zwvuo6axOAhCcjtHIpxQwPpo1QyB7AN7"> If we would have vital groups today, we need to be warned by these talks. The group we see in the book of Job affords us a negative example, an example of the kind of group meeting we should not have in the church life today. <span class="pg" data-page-id="150" id="150">[150]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="WAjiwjsA6dxZhXTeZjGUUgMtEZI5ZwADVw16jMYikxIOYzB7g3lc_Z48QnrDi_FQ8"> When we come together in the vital groups, the first thing we must do is to pray. The vital groups are groups of vital prayer. In the vital groups, learn not to pray old prayers with old terms, prayers according to your tradition. Learn always to pray new and fresh prayers. Try to exercise your spirit, because the very God, our present God, our God today, is right in our spirit with all His bountiful supply. Thus, when you come to the vital groups, you should remain in your spirit and exercise your spirit. In your spirit you will pick up some new terms and new expressions. You can do this because you have the Triune God as the consummated Spirit in your spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="2D5Jk28QAFCdGt9NY6fBHwtJ984uopeYsUQmOufEb5F3ddcoa7N0nPXdggU2-4PiP"> The groups are vital in these two spirits: vital in our human spirit and vital in God’s divine Spirit. The last part of the Bible—from Acts through Revelation—covers the matter of the divine Spirit who is now in our spirit to become one spirit (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47935" data-verses="1Corinthians 6:17">1 Cor. 6:17</span>). The content of this portion of the Word is a life of these two spirits. God moves in man and man moves in God in these two spirits. Therefore, when you come to the vital groups, you should turn to the spirit, remain in the spirit, and exercise the spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="u72kAJSdv5iq4y5k0KKRWgDoN4pJh-jfn308T5pXEItyoQ_NJZnrE02tEIRLcByhU"> Do not come to the vital groups to talk naturally yet quite intimately. That kills the groups. Instead, exercise your spirit to praise God or to sing a stanza or a few lines of a hymn. This kind of praising and singing stirs up the spirits of those in the vital group. Then everyone will follow to pray. </p>
<p data-content-id="f1L7jK9t6ENjmxuUhKpqMgaIHcn5Rwu_PumKI1XqZ_TP669brdAaI0gSQR9hknD4I"> The second thing we should do in the vital groups is to fellowship. After the prayer, we should fellowship, perhaps about the home affairs or the troubles of the saints, yet we should fellowship in our spirit by exercising our spirit. Our speaking concerning a saint who is sick should not be in ordinary words but in words from the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. When you speak out, try to bring the group into the two spirits. This will make a great difference, and this will help to lay the foundation for the vital group to move in the two spirits. Furthermore, when you visit others, at your home, in their home, or in the meeting hall, exercise your spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="I4LaSIw89KK1RQODGKRUsjvhnVEPi6kG4YIlmJ5JQwX7q3bSa1RmEZ8in5cY5TLqO"> The move of the Triune God today is altogether in the two spirits, in Himself as the consummated Spirit dwelling in our <span class="pg" data-page-id="151" id="151">[151]</span> regenerated spirit. These two spirits—the divine Spirit and the human spirit—have become one spirit. To be a Christian is simply to take care of these two spirits for God’s move. Learn to live a Christian life in this way. Do not try to learn so many teachings, but try to study and read the Bible for the nourishment and stirring up of your spirit that your spirit may be exercised to contact the divine Spirit in your spirit. </p>

However, this does not mean that God is not for judgment. Concerning this matter of judgment, we should not be careless. Rather, we need to differentiate between God’s government with His judgment and God’s dealing with His people. Often the dealings of God are related to the governmental judgment of God. God does not allow anyone to annul His judgment. </p>

This indicates that Job gained God in his personal experience (in addition to knowing God in his vain knowledge by tradition) and that he abhorred himself. </p>
<p data-content-id="P7nAcQf9nW3qhJT9DVI1Oe7DaoxYQSOczBY5jfuQSQUCCeMCzGGxvivbTMMoYMcY1"> Seeing God equals gaining God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47961" data-verses="Matthew 5:8">Matt. 5:8</span>). To gain God is to receive God in His element, in His life, and in His nature. Eventually, this not only makes us one with God—it even makes us a part of God. I prefer not to use the phrase “one with” in describing our relationship with God because to be made a part of God, to be constituted with God in His life and nature, is more than being one with God. We see God that we may be constituted with God, yet we do not have any share in the Godhead. </p>

Seeing God transforms us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47963" data-verses="2Corinthians 3:18">2 Cor. 3:18</span>), because in seeing God we receive His element into us. As we receive God, a new element comes into us, and the old element is discharged. This metabolic process is transformation. To see God is to be <span class="pg" data-page-id="158" id="158">[158]</span> transformed into the glorious image of God. This makes us a part of God that we may express God in His life and represent Him in His authority. </p>

Job was right in saying that his sufferings were not a matter of God’s judgment. Job felt that, according to his conscience, he had not done anything that required God to come in to judge him or to punish him. Nevertheless, he was suffering and he wanted to investigate his situation with God. Job’s three friends, however, insisted that Job’s sufferings were a proof that he had done something wrong and was being judged by God. Thus, God came in to condemn the three friends and to vindicate Job to a certain extent. </p>

This indicates that God is perfect and kind in dealing with those who love Him. Even today, after God deals with us by stripping us and consuming us, and after His purpose is accomplished, God gives us His physical blessings. However, God’s purpose in dealing with His people is not to give physical blessings to them but to give Himself to them as their eternal portion, which ultimately consummates in the New Jerusalem (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47967" data-verses="Revelation 21:1">Rev. 21—22</span>). </p>

<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="I4LaSIw89KK1RQOHPKRFujvhnVEPi6kG4YIlmJ5JQwX7q3bSa1RmEZ8in5cY5TLqO">EXPOSING JOB</h2><p data-content-id="H-W7Xbyzzvx2-IJ5DX_oIbauuqjt9vMRGagK-QPH0v4AJ86Cpz31r2GnhfP1vRVpI"> God’s intention in appearing to Job was to expose him, to show him that he really was nothing. God’s appearing also implied that He wanted to help Job to know that he was in the wrong realm. When God asked Job so many questions concerning the universe (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47972" data-verses="Job 38:4-38">38:4-38</span>) and concerning the animals (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47973" data-verses="Job 38:39">38:39—39:30</span>), His intention was to enable Job to see that he, a person who remained in himself, was considering things regarding the universe and God that were far beyond his capacity. Thus, God questioned Job again and again in order to silence him. God seemed to be saying, “Job, I am doing something that you do not know. I intend to give you something that is not in your realm but is in another realm.” </p>
<p data-content-id="XWguS6LLPk6Jlg45lxlvBTwCuTRYU7tOT0mUeBHLvWlWEWGzWLSdkTthOoJ1Reqxj"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47974" data-verses="Job 40:10">40:10</span> God said to Job, “Deck yourself now with majesty and excellency, / And array yourself with honor and splendor.” Here God was actually asking Job about his majesty and excellency and about his honor and splendor, with the intention that Job would realize that he did not have any majesty, excellency, honor, and splendor. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47975" data-verses="Job 40:12-13">verses 12 and 13</span> God went on to say, “Look upon everyone who is proud; bring him down; / And tread down the wicked where they stand. / Hide them in the dust together; / Bind their faces in the hidden place.” Here God was telling Job that he should look at himself and realize that he was proud, even though he had no reason to be proud. Furthermore, God was indicating to Job <span class="pg" data-page-id="162" id="162">[162]</span> that he should be abased, that he should be hidden in the dust and even buried there. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="kPaHTugPPe89nd8WxvL42tej0gdsVteUVeNJznDb8D4_xlvyXLhfqVIUEskr3LhgN">JOB BEING IN THE PRIMITIVE STAGE<br/>OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</h2><p data-content-id="cKV2Ia0vFjWXw-s9CGj68c8AhIJsV60OrjXYrMo_Fb4xvwo2j9keFVTBzFDZ9J4P4"> Job was in the primitive stage of the divine revelation. Many things that God intended to do in His move, which began with the incarnation, Job knew nothing about. God had many things within Himself, but He could not unveil them to Job. God could not speak to Job about these things. </p>
<p data-content-id="Yj1E9-l69h9I-vz-l5loI7spNchk42nn6KfzgGbdDuSwOZPCebZepmo0kTOr6_Csq"> The word of the Lord Jesus to Nicodemus regarding regeneration can also be applied to Job’s situation: “If I told you of the things on earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you of the things in heaven?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47976" data-verses="John 3:12">John 3:12</span>). As <span class="verse" data-ref-id="47977" data-verses="John 16:12-13">John 16:12 and 13</span> reveal, the Lord Jesus was even limited in what He could say to His disciples: “I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.” Many of these things were revealed to the apostle Paul. Today, following Paul, we speak of such matters as God’s economy, the divine dispensing, and the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. However, many of today’s Christians do not understand these matters and even regard them as nonsense. </p>
<p data-content-id="E0ZlnpgZ0_YcqGR6bvfBFHFt9IJ4sko6wLzvEYnCFq4I3Jg48GwDidatr5qTAdQcQ"> God’s move from the incarnation to the consummation of the New Jerusalem involves many spiritual things, including regeneration, renewing, sanctification, transformation, glorification, and transfiguration. Because Job was in the primitive stage of the divine revelation, he could not understand any of these things. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="DyAowCz452QOQeuvmGgrQgNThCWZmXEJsVZhT5WRi4Pcw3pXWpXPSuyVnCFUDdjJU">GOD’S DESIRE TO BRING JOB INTO ANOTHER REALM</h2><p data-content-id="S7qkAmGv3xhf5wzWhrx9jDybZEmf2NJTcRTvMGjAhpzT0jKMZxybV8IoKd0-DRf6N"> Job was in the realm of building up something that was wrong. He was building up himself in his perfection, uprightness, and integrity. He thought that he was absolutely right. He was proud of what he had built up, and he trusted in that <span class="pg" data-page-id="163" id="163">[163]</span> and glorified himself in that. That was his robe to cover his entire being, and that was his crown to be his glory. </p>
<p data-content-id="guSQOY8dnNPxZIlvNpuqNVNGBoD_L6qKHF_2CRR1vpPyZViAVhpKKH8hjm7BMAgaK"> Actually, Job was wrong. God in His eternal economy has no desire to build up these things. Rather, He considers all these things as frustrations and intends to strip them away from us, consuming them bit by bit. When everything is stripped away, then you will see God, and He will attract you to receive Him. Then you will have God’s nature, life, element, essence, and even His being. This will cause a metabolic change within you to transform you from the present form of your human being to another form, the form of the divine being. As a result of this transformation, you will be a person reflecting God, that is, expressing Him and dispensing Him to others. </p>
<p data-content-id="eFq9eeSNkZqoWu2IxF2iVCX-YYc3pfT0ssFp0h3tN18DX-UXw4uUl_kRtmncYE0-L"> This was God’s intention with Job, and this is His intention with us today. Now you and God may be in two different realms. But God wants to transfer you from your present realm into His realm, not only to make you one with Him but even to make you a part of Him. </p>
<p data-content-id="5v3HlaC7WfrHKR3828yTMIzas4FvQriotcTrofucRGlKhiklEdrXslrVYDqR_w_up"> Suppose someone had tried to talk to Job about all these things. If someone had done this, Job might have said, “What are you talking about? I have learned a lot about God from my forefathers, and I have been paying attention to what I have learned. Yet you say that I am in the wrong realm and that God intends to build up something of Himself in me. You speak to me about incarnation, regeneration, and transformation, but I do not know what any of these things mean.” Job simply did not have the capacity to receive such a revelation. He did not have these terms in his spiritual dictionary. </p>
<p data-content-id="NI4f6RH5E4QGj2PT17QuepywB_H3NE7R55-Q5vBSesL0recPo1UAxyd6s4vnwkJ3P"> In principle, the situation is the same with many Christians today. The divine revelation has been given, it has been written, and it has been interpreted. Nevertheless, many believers have no understanding of the economy of God or of the divine dispensing according to the divine economy. They may think that being a Christian is simply a matter of believing that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior, who shed His blood for our sins and who has saved us through His death; that the Holy Spirit is now with us to help us to behave ourselves well and to do good that God may be <span class="pg" data-page-id="164" id="164">[164]</span> glorified; and that we will go to heaven when we die. Those who hold this concept of the Christian life may not realize that being a Christian also involves sanctification, transformation, conformation, the divine dispensing of the divine economy, and the New Jerusalem as the enlargement of the processed and consummated Triune God. If you want to teach them about these matters, you must do so in a very gradual way, beginning with the most elementary things. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="tpP37fHpiAj4rvTAHcC16JlXJP_Q9w2NO3Bm0UrSTfsybX1rvzTzD-tHZTiccChYP">THE REALM OF THE OLD CREATION<br/>AND THE REALM OF THE NEW CREATION</h2><p data-content-id="hCrRxb5iWEiiuF6L1mo6kzIm9-tXNSKjE63fiJfvPUSmnT_C3kHcfb5u7pNbEaD7N"> We all need to realize that today there are two different realms—the realm of the old creation and the realm of the new creation. The realm of the old creation is the realm of natural things, and the realm of the new creation is the realm of divine things. We were born into the old creation, into the natural sphere, yet God wants us to be divine. For this, we need a great transfer: We need to be transferred out of Adam into Christ. The first aspect of this transfer is regeneration. We need to be regenerated, and then we need to be renewed. As we are renewed, certain parts of our being will be “peeled off” and replaced by a new element that will cause us to be transformed and eventually conformed to the image of Christ, who is the firstborn Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="47978" data-verses="Romans 8:29">Rom. 8:29</span>). </p>
<p data-content-id="UIQOnevT9J1jipE2xb4SwbcPnn_ON2xauBAu1hdOdN_zIrmZYe1fbWpdfODuG88rm"> We also need to learn how to talk to others about the spiritual things in the new creation. For example, suppose that you speak to a believer about being transformed into the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God. That believer might say, “I have heard about the only begotten Son of God but not about the firstborn Son. Who is the firstborn Son of God?” I am concerned that you may not be able to explain this. </p>

God took a rib out of Adam and built it up into a woman to match Adam to be his counterpart. This is a type showing how God in Christ is the Husband, needing a match, a counterpart.

Hence, in their debates concerning God’s relationship with man, there was no hint that indicates that they had received divine revelation beyond the matters of God’s judgment and God’s regard for man in his burnt offering. And they did not speak any word that implies anything concerning Christ and the Spirit of God. They were in the primitive stage of the divine revelation. </p>

Therefore, in this life-study of Job, my principle has been to study Job in relation to the divine revelation in the Bible as a whole. We need to keep this in mind as we consider in this message the central point of God’s appearing to Job. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="lu1rWVFMXAvXHaW8at-TioSE34Vg65Xj8okY2jP3pP7sA_VmcJwe7gAiEHtHMiw2k">JOB NOT KNOWING THAT GOD<br/>IS UNLIMITED AND UNSEARCHABLE<br/>AND NOT UNDERSTANDING<br/>HOW MUCH GOD COULD BE TO HIM</h2><p data-content-id="Os89QnyD5lG8iS6EHLQ87Mk4bp4oHMMEyjtwWCpoXpyDKBFE8hSFYs7awWZBQHXcy"> After all the speaking of Job, his three friends, and Elihu, we have God’s appearing to Job with the divine unveilings (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48030" data-verses="Job 38:4">38:4—41:34</span>). This is followed by a word concerning Job’s gaining God in his personal experience and his abhorring of himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48031" data-verses="Job 42:1-6">42:1-6</span>). I am concerned that, by paying attention to so many other things, you may not see the central point of God’s appearing to Job. This central point concerns what God intended to do to Job by His appearing to him. </p>
<p data-content-id="4Z3ZpDvorgWtdhNIf_8l5egog-zO0jRNYJOE6XiRy834s8WLOMrxqBM5uykzo1Hnq"> God appeared to Job in order to help him to realize that God is unlimited, unsearchable, and untraceable. God asked Job many questions about the universe and about the animals to impress him with the fact that He is unlimited. God seemed to be saying to him, “Job, you actually do not know who I am. You do not realize that I am unlimited. Also, you cannot imagine what I intend to give you. Job, I intend to give you Myself, making Myself your enjoyment so that you can become a part of Me. I am not satisfied that you have your own integrity, perfection, and uprightness. I want you to have Me. My intention is to give you nothing other than Myself.” <span class="pg" data-page-id="176" id="176">[176]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="ok7bGt0pYndF_JXVRo7-IFXgW_oH760OMp75doRxuGAj4er8XnBp3UqChwPIwfiM5">THE DIVINE REVELATION<br/>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT UNVEILING WHAT<br/>WAS ON GOD’S HEART<br/>WHEN HE APPEARED TO JOB</h2><p data-content-id="NI4f6RH5E4QGj2PT37QuWpywB_H3NE7R55-Q5vBSesL0recPo1UAxyd6s4vnwkJ3P"> To understand God’s intention in His appearing to Job, we need the entire Bible, especially the New Testament. For God to give Himself to Job was not a simple matter. This involved a long process beginning with Christ’s incarnation and including His human living, His all-inclusive death on the cross, His resurrection, and His ascension. Because Job was in the primitive stage of the divine revelation, God could not have spoken to him about all these things. It would have been impossible for Job to understand them. All these matters were clearly defined and recorded in the New Testament two thousand years later. Even today, many believers do not have the proper understanding of these things. </p>
<p data-content-id="tpP37fHpiAj4rvTAFcC1yJlXJP_Q9w2NO3Bm0UrSTfsybX1rvzTzD-tHZTiccChYP"> As an illustration of our difficulty in understanding the divine things, let us consider the case of Nicodemus in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48032" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span>. The Lord Jesus said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48033" data-verses="John 3:3">v. 3</span>). Not understanding this, Nicodemus replied, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48034" data-verses="John 3:4">v. 4</span>). What a terrible misunderstanding! The Lord Jesus went on to speak to Nicodemus about being born of water and the Spirit, telling him that “that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48035" data-verses="John 3:6">v. 6</span>). Nicodemus then asked, “How can these things be?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48036" data-verses="John 3:9">v. 9</span>). Eventually, the Lord Jesus said to him, “If I told you of the things on earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you of the things in heaven?” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48037" data-verses="John 3:12">v. 12</span>). Regeneration, being born anew, concerns the divine life, yet it takes place on earth. If Nicodemus could not understand something that takes place on earth, how could he understand the things that take place in heaven? </p>
<p data-content-id="hCrRxb5iWEiiuF6L3mo2mzIm9-tXNSKjE63fiJfvPUSmnT_C3kHcfb5u7pNbEaD7N"> <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48038" data-verses="John 3:1">Chapter three</span> of John speaks not only about regeneration but also about the increase of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48039" data-verses="John 3:30">v. 30</span>). All the regenerated people will become the increase of Christ, and the increase of Christ is His bride (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48040" data-verses="John 3:29">v. 29</span>). In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48041" data-verses="John 3:1">John 3</span> two crucial words are “bride” and “increase.” We need to see that as <span class="pg" data-page-id="177" id="177">[177]</span> Christians we are Christ’s increase. However, many of today’s believers have no understanding concerning this. </p>
<p data-content-id="UIQOnevT9J1jipE2zb4eybcPnn_ON2xauBAu1hdOdN_zIrmZYe1fbWpdfODuG88rm"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48042" data-verses="John 14:1">John 14</span> the Lord Jesus, on the night He was to be betrayed, took the opportunity to speak to His disciples certain matters concerning the Divine Trinity, who would produce the bride as the increase of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48043" data-verses="John 16:1">John 16</span> the Lord told His disciples that although He had yet many things to say to them, at that time they could not bear them (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48044" data-verses="John 16:12">v. 12</span>). Later, after Christ had passed through death and had entered into resurrection to become the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality would come to guide the disciples into all the reality (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48045" data-verses="John 16:13">v. 13</span>). On the evening of the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus appeared to them, and “He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48046" data-verses="John 20:22">20:22</span>). However, not even at that time was the divine revelation given in full. There was still the need for Christ to ascend and to pour out Himself as the Spirit upon His disciples to make them the church, as recorded in the first part of Acts. But not even then was the complete revelation given. Later, Paul was raised up by God, and to him was given the full revelation concerning the mystery of God, which is Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48047" data-verses="Colossians 2:2">Col. 2:2b</span>), and the mystery of Christ, which is the church (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48048" data-verses="Ephesians 3:4">Eph. 3:4</span>). The church is the issue of the Triune God to be the organism of the Triune God. This organism is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is the new man. Eventually, all this will consummate in the New Jerusalem, the corporate expression of the Triune God for eternity in the new heaven and new earth. All these things—beginning with the incarnation of the Triune God and consummating with the New Jerusalem—were on God’s heart when He appeared to Job. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="MFNsqyUzUamIhTJI04OnYk9XX0iDG8HxGpqszonA6YCdPELFOtO_CjQxPRxFZMVdK">GOD REDUCING JOB TO NOTHING<br/>AND MAINTAINING HIS EXISTENCE THAT GOD<br/>MIGHT IMPART HIMSELF INTO HIM</h2><p data-content-id="VOtlOdgrPMjWPQKH5r0SySd5QtFRhPOODrLqx2UYb8cM7VDI7r651PIfKrCgLIoJj"> Instead of speaking to Job regarding these things that were on His heart, God asked him about other things, including himself. For instance, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48049" data-verses="Job 40:10-14">40:10-14</span> He said to him, <span class="pg" data-page-id="178" id="178">[178]</span> “Deck yourself now with majesty and excellency, / And array yourself with honor and splendor. / Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, / And look upon everyone who is proud, and abase him. / Look upon everyone who is proud; bring him down; / And tread down the wicked where they stand. / Hide them in the dust together; / Bind their faces in the hidden place. / Then even I will praise you, / That your own right hand can save you.” Here God was asking Job if he had any majesty, excellency, honor, and splendor. God’s intention was to cause Job to realize that he had nothing and that he was nothing. </p>
<p data-content-id="iW7odAwFn6M_vn6L70zofqH44E5UxdGbtd8WSDlh-7gKzwV-KsbolqbLfu4tzqPX5"> Job did not know God’s purpose in dealing with him, and God had no way to tell him about this. Not knowing about the councils held in the heavens concerning him, Job was enjoying his life on earth. Then, suddenly, he lost his possessions and his children. This was the stripping away of Job’s possessions. Following this, there was an attack upon Job’s body, and this led, through his daily sufferings, to the gradual consuming of Job himself. As we read the record in this book, we can see that layer after layer was peeled away from Job. This peeling away was the consuming. Job was consumed to such an extent that he became skin and bone. </p>
<p data-content-id="1U015OwRXAIob_SCKmV2AsbwMZBNyZK4Lwgno4-lc2du5PtxzodTRPh1E-ubKI7xa"> Job did not know what was going on. He questioned God, but there was no answer. Eventually God came in to show Himself to Job. In His appearing, God seemed to be saying to Job, “Now here I am. Job, you must realize that I am unlimited, unsearchable, and untraceable. Look at Me—I am the One with majesty, excellency, honor, and splendor. Do you think that your small mind can search Me out or trace Me out? Do you still intend to litigate against Me, to take Me to court? You do not know what I intend to do with you. You do not know what I will give you. Job, My intention is to reduce you to nothing, yet to maintain your existence so that I may have a time to impart Myself into you. Job, I intend to give you Myself.” </p>

God’s dealing with Job in all the disasters and His stripping him of all that he was, were to take away his contentment in his godly attainments and obtainments and to remove all the barriers and coverings so that he could be emptied for some further seeking after God and could realize that he was very short of something in his human life. At the end of the book of Job, after all, God came in, indicating that what Job was short of in his human life was God Himself. But up to the age of Job, there was not a revelation like what is positively, clearly, and fully unveiled in the New Testament. For this reason, the book of Job does not actually have a completed ending, which should be God fully gained in Christ by Job to make him one with God that he might enjoy God as his portion in Christ. Such a revelation can be fully found only in the New Testament. </p>

Since the book of Psalms shows progress beyond the book of Job concerning the divine revelation and concerning our seeking after God, it would not be fitting for the Psalms to come before Job. Spiritually speaking, it is significant that, in the sequence of books in the Scriptures, the Psalms comes after Job. </p>

In this book there is no prayer or praise offered to God. Furthermore, there is no hint that Job, his three friends, and Elihu had any kind of thirst for God. In contrast to the psalmists, they did not seek God, pant after God, pray to God, or wait on God. </p>

<p data-content-id="ok7bGt0pYndF_JXVUo7fLFXgW_oH760OMp75doRxuGAj4er8XnBp3UqChwPIwfiM5"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48139" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> there is a certain amount of seeking after God, but it is a seeking after God in His law. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48140" data-verses="Psalms 2:1">Psalm 2</span>, on the contrary, we have the praise of Christ and the unveiling of Christ. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48141" data-verses="Psalms 1:1">Psalm 1</span> the psalmist was seeking after God, yet he did not seek God directly, but made the law of God the goal of his seeking.

In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48145" data-verses="Psalms 36:1">Psalm 36</span> the psalmist was clear that the object of his seeking should be God Himself in His house.

This part corresponds with the record of Job and may be considered a continuation of Job in the style of human expressions of human sentiments in human views and concepts. In this matter, Job and the Psalms are like two brothers who closely resemble each other. </p>

This part should be taken as the highest divine revelation in the Old Testament concerning Christ as the centrality and universality of God’s economy, which is strongly stressed by Christ Himself in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48146" data-verses="Luke 24:44">Luke 24:44</span> and by the apostle Paul in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48147" data-verses="Hebrews 1:5-13">Hebrews 1:5-13</span> and <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48148" data-verses="Hebrews 10:5-7">10:5-7</span>. </p>

Such a picture is clearly presented. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="eFq9eeSNkZqoWu2I2F2ubCX-YYc3pfT0ssFp0h3tN18DX-UXw4uUl_kRtmncYE0-L">B.

There was some divine revelation, but it was in a primitive stage. <span class="pg" data-page-id="194" id="194">[194]</span> </p>

For example, the divine revelation in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48149" data-verses="Psalms 45:1">Psalm 45</span> concerning Christ as the King is very high. </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="hCrRxb5iWEiiuF6Lymo-mzIm9-tXNSKjE63fiJfvPUSmnT_C3kHcfb5u7pNbEaD7N">D.

Our contentment with what we know of God is a hindrance to our progressing in the understanding of the divine revelation. </p>

<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="iW7odAwFn6M_vn6L-0zgfqH44E5UxdGbtd8WSDlh-7gKzwV-KsbolqbLfu4tzqPX5">F.

If we come to the Psalms without reading the <span class="pg" data-page-id="195" id="195">[195]</span> book of Job, we will be lacking part of the background necessary for understanding the secrets in the Psalms. </p>
<p data-content-id="91WP5pqwF3GeT4dVgsCYLeY3TOSgBfNMBX4k5yl_wQ6n84JwqQgJtQ5KU9LUZXA01"> We have seen that our principle in this study of Job is to study this book according to what is revealed in the Bible as a whole. If we come to the book of Job without the proper understanding of the divine revelation in the entire Scriptures, this book will not mean very much to us, and we will not understand the goal of God’s dealing with Job. </p>
<p data-content-id="jNC2uuAHkXMsJoaQh1HRhNqKRFlZfcxSeR2c-5zpPbACSVDIV6ph9SGbrosrq4Ngo"> Some readers of Job know about his patience and endurance (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48150" data-verses="James 5:10-11">James 5:10-11</span>) and about the material blessing Job received at the end, but they do not know either what it means to see God or what God’s intention was in His appearing to Job. Regarding God’s dealing with Job, there were certain mysterious things, and these things are to some extent unveiled in the Psalms. For a complete unveiling we need to come to the New Testament to see the revelation concerning Christ’s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension to produce the church as the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. </p>

The psalmists were right in seeking after God, but they were not right in making the law of God the goal of their seeking. They needed to be turned in their seeking from the <span class="pg" data-page-id="196" id="196">[196]</span> law to Christ. Whereas the law is a side line in the Scriptures, Christ, the tree of life, is the main line. </p>

<p data-content-id="vBSp6y8_glqCO4TZGBrRBT-qkSgMBkgC2Zwvuo6axOAhCcjtHIpxQwPpo1QyB7AN7"> In these messages we have been considering the significance of the book of Job according to the Bible as a whole. In the divine revelation in the holy Scriptures there are two trees, two sources, two lines, two principles, and two ends. These are the matters that we will cover in this message. </p>
<p data-content-id="WAjiwjsA6dxZhXTaWjGFagMtEZI5ZwADVw16jMYikxIOYzB7g3lc_Z48QnrDi_FQ8"> In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48175" data-verses="Genesis 2:1">Genesis 2</span> there are two trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. However, in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48176" data-verses="Revelation 21:1-2">Revelation 21 and 22</span> we see only one tree—the tree of life—in a holy city. In the center of this city is the throne of God and of the Lamb (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48177" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">22:1</span>), indicating God’s administration. God and the Lamb are not sitting side by side on the throne; rather, God is in the Lamb much like light is in a lamp. The Lamb is the lamp (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48178" data-verses="Revelation 21:23">21:23</span>), and God is the light in the lamp. This indicates that God and the Lamb, the light and the lamp, are one. Out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, that is, out of the one God, flows a river, and on the two sides of this river grows the tree of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48179" data-verses="Revelation 22:2">22:2a</span>). According to the principle, if the tree of life ends in the city of water, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil must end in the lake of fire. All the evil things in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48180" data-verses="Revelation 22:1">Revelation 22</span> are involved with the lake of fire. Thus, the two ends are the city of water and the lake of fire. Between the two sources and the two ends are two lines, which become two <span class="pg" data-page-id="198" id="198">[198]</span> ways. Each source issues in a line that becomes a way consummating in an end. </p>

God created man, breathing into him the breath of life (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48191" data-verses="Genesis 2:7">Gen. 2:7</span>), which became man’s spirit; but at that time, He did not put Himself into man as man’s life. </p>

<p data-content-id="I4LaSIw89KK1RQOHJKRUgjvhnVEPi6kG4YIlmJ5JQwX7q3bSa1RmEZ8in5cY5TLqO"> According to the divine revelation, knowledge is Satan, good is Satan, and evil is Satan. Today the world is in an age that worships knowledge. Before eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve were ignorant, not knowing, so they had no sin. After they ate of the tree of knowledge, their eyes were opened, and they became knowledgeable. That was sin. We all consider that to commit sin is sin, but we may not consider that knowing sin is sin. </p>
<h2 class="head3" data-content-id="H-W7Xbyzzvx2-IJ5FX_9Hbauuqjt9vMRGagK-QPH0v4AJ86Cpz31r2GnhfP1vRVpI">7. The Genuine Good Being God Himself</h2><p data-content-id="XWguS6LLPk6Jlg45jxlGNTwCuTRYU7tOT0mUeBHLvWlWEWGzWLSdkTthOoJ1Reqxj"> The genuine good is God Himself (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48193" data-verses="Matthew 19:17">Matt. 19:17a</span>); hence, gaining God equals gaining the genuine good. When the rich young ruler came to the Lord Jesus and called Him, “Good Teacher,” the Lord Jesus said, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One—God” (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48194" data-verses="Mark 10:17-18">Mark 10:17-18</span>). If besides God we gain any other good, that is terrible. If we touch the good things outside of God, this means that we touch Satan. The Bible teaches us that knowledge, good, and evil all are Satan. In the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, therefore, evil and good are equal. <span class="pg" data-page-id="200" id="200">[200]</span> </p>

To eat means to take in something that is outside of us and then digest and assimilate it. We must be careful concerning what we eat. Surely, today’s television and so many different kinds of newspapers and magazines are branches of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>

<p data-content-id="aGzGatf7NsfAyxfodqLX77SraI1s6z6iCVo5h_8JLJJqxAuV_-9UN4sKOlBjrJLHs"> There are two great things in the Bible—the divine dispensing and the divine economy. In this message we will cover these two matters. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="b-q5XPKHb6vrf9nqXBv3VDi3lIpvyYCqR_zrJidNSnZboWufq731dwUx6aZnemkh2">I. THE DIVINE ECONOMY BEING<br/>GOD’S ETERNAL PLAN TO DISPENSE CHRIST<br/>INTO HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE</h2><p data-content-id="q9LWByW9sowyHnHPu-lL0YyaQHMmdqODVOmh-4Xsh45TftShz7ofquSfsTTNDV8XS"> The word <em>economy</em> is an anglicized form of the Greek word <em>oikonomia,</em> which means “household law or household management or household administration and derivatively administrative dispensation, plan, economy.” The divine economy is God’s eternal plan to dispense Christ into His chosen people to produce, constitute, and build up the organic Body of Christ (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48264" data-verses="Ephesians 1:10">Eph. 1:10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48265" data-verses="Ephesians 3:8-10">3:8-10</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48266" data-verses="1Timothy 1:4">1 Tim. 1:4</span>). Since Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, for God to dispense Christ into His chosen people actually means that God dispenses Himself in Christ into His chosen people. In brief, God’s economy is to gain a Body for Christ. This Body is the enlargement of the Triune God for His expression that He may be satisfied. <span class="pg" data-page-id="206" id="206">[206]</span> </p>

THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br/>BEING TO IMPART CHRIST<br/>AS LIFE AND THE LIFE SUPPLY<br/>INTO HIS BELIEVERS</h2><p data-content-id="4Z3ZpDvorgWtdhNIU_8Azegog-zO0jRNYJOE6XiRy834s8WLOMrxqBM5uykzo1Hnq"> The divine dispensing is to impart Christ as life and the life supply into His believers (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48267" data-verses="Galatians 1:15-16">Gal. 1:15-16</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48268" data-verses="Colossians 3:4">Col. 3:4a</span>). </p>
<h2 class="head2" data-content-id="ok7bGt0pYndF_JXVao7fDFXgW_oH760OMp75doRxuGAj4er8XnBp3UqChwPIwfiM5">A. In God’s Redemption</h2><p data-content-id="32kxBpqEA8Y5ihk5QEp5g0MOiIlYffyQ1Dyd5XdYT5brTMwHFsT-wu2CtB_YnAgGO"> This dispensing of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is first in God’s redemption (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48269" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48270" data-verses="John 19:34">19:34</span>). The central point, the goal, of God’s redemption is not merely to redeem us from our sins and from the condemnation of sin (eternal perdition), but to release, that is, to dispense, God Himself as the divine life into His redeemed ones. <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48271" data-verses="John 12:24">John 12:24</span> says that Christ in His incarnation as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and died. Just as there is life in a grain of wheat, within the human shell of Christ’s physical body there was the divine life. When He was on earth in the flesh, the divine life within Him was concealed in the shell of His human body. He went to the cross and died, and the death of the cross broke this human shell and released the divine life to produce many grains. This is to release the divine life into all these grains. Also, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48272" data-verses="John 19:34">John 19:34</span> says that when Christ died on the cross, two elements, blood and water, flowed out of Him. Blood is for redemption, and water is for the releasing of the divine life. Thus, the redeeming death of Christ becomes the life-releasing death. </p>

In God’s Salvation</h2><p data-content-id="cKV2Ia0vFjWXw-s9LGj64c8AhIJsV60OrjXYrMo_Fb4xvwo2j9keFVTBzFDZ9J4P4"> The divine dispensing is also in God’s salvation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48273" data-verses="Romans 5:10">Rom. 5:10</span>). God’s redemption is the foundation of His salvation. Based on His redemption, God has to save us by the life of Christ. The first step of this saving is to regenerate us, which is to impart the divine life into us. Thus, God’s salvation is centered in life-dispensing. </p>

In Saving Sinners</h2><p data-content-id="E0ZlnpgZ0_YcqGR6SvfBBHFt9IJ4sko6wLzvEYnCFq4I3Jg48GwDidatr5qTAdQcQ"> The divine dispensing is involved also in the saving of <span class="pg" data-page-id="207" id="207">[207]</span> sinners (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48274" data-verses="John 3:3">John 3:3</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48275" data-verses="John 3:5-6">5-6</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48276" data-verses="Titus 3:5">Titus 3:5</span>). When God saves sinners, He regenerates them, dispensing Himself as life into their being. When we go to seek sinners for Christ, we need to point out to them that they need God’s life and that the way to receive God’s life is to be born of God, to be regenerated. </p>

To perfect the saints is to dispense Christ into them so that they can grow to maturity. When we preach the gospel, we impart Christ into sinners. When we nourish the new believers, we dispense Christ into them as food, as the nourishing element. Likewise, when we perfect the saints, we minister Christ to them, dispensing Christ into them not only as milk but also as solid food (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48279" data-verses="1Corinthians 3:2">1 Cor. 3:2</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="48280" data-verses="Hebrews 5:13-14">Heb. 5:13-14</span>). </p>

In Prophesying</h2><p data-content-id="NI4f6RH5E4QGj2PT87QiUpywB_H3NE7R55-Q5vBSesL0recPo1UAxyd6s4vnwkJ3P"> The divine dispensing is also in prophesying (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="48281" data-verses="1Corinthians 14:3">1 Cor. 14:3</span>). When we prophesy in our meetings, our prophesying must minister Christ. We should not merely speak concerning a part of the Bible or merely talk about doctrine; we should do our best to put Christ into our prophesying. Then the reality of our ministry will be Christ Himself. </p>

<p data-content-id="UIQOnevT9J1jipE24b4S0bcPnn_ON2xauBAu1hdOdN_zIrmZYe1fbWpdfODuG88rm"> We need to see that God’s economy is to dispense Himself in Christ into us, beginning with regeneration and continuing with nourishing and perfecting until we become mature.

<p data-content-id="nJML5FAvuoUKpyVcsziZH-BIVXrTdtA6LsYGwPunZ5VD1YX9tdJ4Cz07ZtS3KRtr4"> God has done everything necessary to consummate Himself into the one Spirit.

When we were attracted by Christ, believed in Him, and called on the name of the Lord Jesus, a living person entered into us. This One is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. When He as the Spirit dwells in us, that indwelling One is Christ, and Christ is the Triune God. This One is all-inclusive, and today as the consummated Spirit He indwells our spirit. </p>
<p data-content-id="6EooGpKeBO3yoSxMHu76AA3rrL8YofRbuj9g24UsVzrXnB1zgcT2elJ5YTwTJnq-Q"> When we were saved, the Spirit came into our spirit to regenerate our spirit, to enliven our spirit, and to be mingled with our spirit. The Christian life is a story of this mingled Spirit. To live a normal Christian life is to care for the two spirits—the divine Spirit in our regenerated human spirit. </p>

The more we receive, the more He dispenses. In this way we gain all the elements of the Triune God in His person, in His nature, and in His life. As a result, the Triune God grows in us. When He grows in us, we grow in Him. This is all a story of life-dispensing. <span class="pg" data-page-id="209" id="209">[209]</span> </p>
