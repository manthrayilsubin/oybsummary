In just one day an entire harvest can be <span class="pg" data-page-id="12" id="12">[12]</span> consumed; nothing can stop the devouring locusts. The armies of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome were like locusts coming to devastate Israel totally, devouring their people, land, fields, produce, food, and drink and cutting off their offerings. </p>
<p data-content-id="fZGz0Sq4vYbzZlI2l6m8P5xT0iOb3a2XKlp69wmBgT3z_uson5PK40nTNb2_qxTxF"> Apparently, these four empires are human like the great human image representing the totality of human government. However, in the sight of God they are beasts. Babylon is the lion; Medo-Persia is the bear; Greece is the leopard; and Rome, being the totality of the first three, is the most wild and devastating beast of all. Ultimately, these four empires are four horns used by Satan to devastate God’s chosen people. The prophecies concerning this are now history. </p>

Thus each empire continued to live. The culture of Babylon was adopted by Medo-Persia; the culture of Medo-Persia was adopted by Greece; and the culture of Greece was adopted by Rome. From this we see that the Roman Empire inherited the cultures of the three foregoing empires. The dominion of the Roman Empire is over, but its “life,” its culture, continues. In a sense, we all are Roman citizens, for we are under the influence of the spirit of the Roman Empire, especially in the matters of politics and law. Today the world’s culture is Roman, yet, being an accumulated culture, it contains the cultures of the Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks. </p>
<p data-content-id="HrXAYtFiPwGUclp1LitUsj0LP9Bspjg7Y_TKokaagLnJ3nYY1r2-GmFbhlzXRQcjp"> The Bible covers four things: God’s chastisement on His elect people, God’s punishment of the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration. These four matters are covered in Joel, a short book of three chapters. First, God sent the locusts to devastate Israel. This was His chastisement for Israel’s great evils. Second, this book reveals that God will punish and judge the Gentile nations. Third, Joel speaks concerning the outpouring of the processed, consummated, compound Spirit, the Spirit of God compounded with Christ’s humanity, Christ’s death and its effectiveness, and Christ’s <span class="pg" data-page-id="13" id="13">[13]</span> resurrection with its power. This is the Holy Spirit who was poured out on the day of Pentecost, and this Spirit is the consummated Christ for the manifestation of Christ. This manifestation began with the incarnation of Christ and has been confirmed and strengthened by the outpouring of the Spirit because, through that outpouring, the individual Christ became the corporate Christ, initiating the church life and the church age. The church is the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59805" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15-16">1 Tim. 3:15-16</span>). Hence, we are the manifestation of Christ. Now we are awaiting the fourth matter revealed in the book of Joel—the glorious day of restoration, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. This is the revelation of the Bible, and this is the history of the universe. </p>
<p data-content-id="Xa0Hw2KHdhlZF7i_ns5eNhJnjaGLojpKOUhT2T1jid29eine4nH4mKCPvaGNRtXAo"> The four empires signified by the locusts are very worldly, but they are used by God’s Craftsman (Christ—<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59806" data-verses="Daniel 2:34-35">Dan. 2:34-35</span>) as His instrument to chastise Israel and punish the nations. In this way God is accomplishing whatever is needed for Christ to be manifested in full, that the entire universe may be fully restored. </p>

A major revelation in Joel is that God has raised up four empires symbolized by four kinds of locusts, beginning with Babylon and continuing with Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire, to devastate the one small nation of Israel, God’s elect. Today this devastation is still going on. Along the way, while such a history was proceeding, God poured out Himself as the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended One, the processed and consummated Triune God as the Spirit, upon the believers of Christ. That outpouring produced the church and began the age of mystery. Everything concerning the church is a mystery, and this mystery is the manifestation of Christ. Now we are here in the church doing things in a mysterious way to usher in the final appearing of Christ to bring in the age of restoration, the thousand-year kingdom, which is the prelude to the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. This is the revelation in the book of Joel. </p>

This prophecy was fulfilled as a foretaste on the day of Pentecost (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59833" data-verses="Acts 2:1-4">Acts 2:1-4</span>, <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59834" data-verses="Acts 2:16-21">16-21</span>), and it will be fulfilled as a full taste before the great tribulation for the salvation and regeneration of many of the returned Israelites. This outpouring is different from the outpouring of the Spirit on the last day of the tribulation (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59835" data-verses="Zechariah 12:10">Zech. 12:10</span>) for the salvation of the remnant of the Jews under Antichrist’s besieging. </p>
<p data-content-id="jARNgrD-iutcgAx4e1_bGOZUTYXfKJD6ltJMIkyuzb4m3lkbGDsy9usVGFZXS8IuU"> The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was the Spirit of God compounded with Christ’s humanity, death, resurrection, and ascension. This compounded Spirit who has been poured out is the realization of Christ and the consummation of the Triune God. God poured Himself upon those who called on the name of the Lord. This outpouring produced the church. Formerly, there were only the Jews and the Gentiles, but now there is the church as a third entity (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59836" data-verses="1Corinthians 10:32">1 Cor. 10:32</span>). The church is mysterious, for it is in the church that Christ is manifested. </p>
<p data-content-id="TLODph-DZNTbj1BLvkRX4OeTrM4fy48yteyaIx9Hcq_GKe_w5JXsVdjEn2goT8lFl"> The outpouring of the consummated Spirit is Christ’s coming. Christ came through incarnation. Eventually, He died and was resurrected, and, in a sense, He went away. But by the outpouring of the Spirit He came back to be manifested. By this outpouring all the disciples and saved ones on the day of Pentecost became parts of the corporate Christ. The individual Christ has thus become the corporate Christ, the <span class="pg" data-page-id="19" id="19">[19]</span> enlarged, increased Christ, which is the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59837" data-verses="1Timothy 3:15-16">1 Tim. 3:15-16</span>). </p>

Our text for the study of history is the Bible, in particular the short book of Joel. In this book we see the nations as the locusts and the devastation of Israel by these locusts. Here we also see a great outpouring of the Spirit as the consummated Triune God upon those Jews who call upon the name of Jehovah and who thus are regenerated to become part of the church for the manifestation of Christ. </p>

It is true to say that Daniel’s prophecy is the controlling factor for us to understand and interpret the prophecies in the Bible.

These four kinds of locusts denote the four sections of the entire human government on earth signified by the great human image in <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59878" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span>. After these four sections of human government, which will end with Antichrist, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, human government will be brought to an end. <span class="pg" data-page-id="24" id="24">[24]</span> </p>

<p data-content-id="Aq7luzRSbCjjgSApNec0CRS-jV3-VcGQEgZGxClCfWbYDudvFEaWAZMgJl6fBCgZd"> The four kinds of locusts, corresponding to the four sections of human government, will occupy a long period of time in human history, from the time of Nebuchadnezzar to the time of Antichrist. This period will last for at least twenty-seven centuries. Between the times of Nebuchadnezzar and Antichrist, there will be a long time in which the Jews will have no nation, no kings, no priests, no prophets, and no temple as the God-ordained center where they can worship God. Today the Jews are still being consumed by the locusts of the human, Gentile government. </p>

While the Roman Empire was chastising rebellious Israel, God did something silently and mysteriously. God used the Roman Empire to keep the region around the Mediterranean Sea—the center of human habitation—in a peaceful order. Highways were built, shipping routes were established on the sea, and a common language, Greek, was spoken by all the peoples. It was at that time that God came to be incarnated by being born of a virgin in a small city, Bethlehem, and eventually lived in Nazareth. For thirty-three and a half years the God of everlasting love lived on the earth in His humanity as a man. After this He went to the cross and died the death of a criminal under the Roman form of capital punishment. Although the worldlings did not realize it, Christ died a vicarious, all-inclusive death. After three days He resurrected. On the same day, in the morning of His resurrection, He ascended to the Father and descended again to the earth to meet with His disciples. Forty days later, in the presence of His disciples, He ascended to the heavens. After ten more days, on the day of Pentecost, He came down again <span class="pg" data-page-id="25" id="25">[25]</span> by being poured out as the Spirit upon three thousand of His believers, making each of the three thousand the same as He is in life and nature. The issue of that outpouring of the Spirit was a corporate Christ, which is the manifestation of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="P2TM1asWh_8TtLF2rc8zBPxl8SbRSvW7rNl9sUfX6KoOOZ031PmewzVBIiuIgwpEk"> From this we see that it was through the Roman locusts that both God’s redemption and the preaching of the gospel were carried out. First, the gospel was spread throughout the Roman Empire and then, as a result of Roman imperialism, to other parts of the world. The Romans invented imperialism, and all the Western powers are parts of the Roman Empire. After Britain defeated Spain to become the world power, for more than two centuries the gospel was spread to every corner of the earth through Roman imperialism. </p>

We are joined neither to the consuming of the Roman locusts nor to the suffering of Israel but to the manifestation of Christ. Little of Christ is manifested in the Roman Catholic Church and in the denominations, but Christ is manifested in His recovery. Today we are in the line in which Christ is being manifested. The line of the manifestation of Christ will eventually bring us into the fuller manifestation of Christ in the age of restoration. This fuller manifestation of Christ will consummate in the fullest manifestation of Christ in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. This is the proper eschatology. This is the best, the clearest, and the most inclusive eschatology. </p>

These locusts denote the human government which has been existing for twenty-seven hundred years and which continues to exist. The governments of the nations have been and are still being used by God to consume Israel. On earth today there is such a consuming factor involving the nations. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="jARNgrD-iutcgAx4e0fbNe5UTYXfKJD6ltJMIkyuzb4m3lkbGDsy9usVGFZXS8IuU">THE SECOND FACTOR—<br/>THE SUFFERING OF ISRAEL</h2><p data-content-id="TLODph-DZNTbj1BLvlxXyeuTrM4fy48yteyaIx9Hcq_GKe_w5JXsVdjEn2goT8lFl"> The second factor, the second principle, is the suffering factor, the suffering of Israel under the locusts. Israel has been suffering the consuming of the locusts for almost twenty-seven centuries. As we consider Israel’s suffering, we may wonder why God has allowed it to last so long. We may question why God has permitted His elect to suffer under the consuming locusts. On the one hand, God allows this suffering to continue; on the other hand, He does not allow Israel to be utterly consumed. Israel is the only nation that has suffered the consuming of the locusts for such a long time. Nevertheless, Israel continues to endure and to last. <span class="pg" data-page-id="30" id="30">[30]</span> </p>
<p data-content-id="onV1TzI4d1aywGxU4TEQhyk5LnUB60q4U09fvH4cB0Fh7HyqMjP4t3_sCN6IS8DQd"> These two factors—the consuming factor involving the nations in four stages and the suffering factor involving Israel—have been present for a major part of human history. Many books have been written about world history, but these books do not touch these factors, these principles, as we are doing here. </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="3P_iCJgyxc8aeeEnV4P2WZND4sSFKJ06gX_cc5ZciRved3zPQF3ur-fr_C9foRo7S">GOD’S PURPOSE<br/>CONCERNING THE SUFFERING FACTOR</h2><p data-content-id="GnPPaPneiaPuTAfOs10JIm5RsODZvYK-T_8Od1wuzngSQzxC6QGisPu7jGnXb7QfU"> We come now to the crucial matter of God’s purpose concerning the suffering factor. The suffering factor is the factor which produced the incarnation. Through incarnation the almighty, eternal, infinite God was brought into humanity and mingled with humanity. Nothing, not even the creation of the universe, could be greater than this! God’s purpose in allowing Israel to suffer under the locusts was to bring forth a couple, Mary and Joseph, so that God could be born in man, of man, and out of man to become no longer only God but a God-man. Hence, the suffering factor was the factor to consummate the divine incarnation; the suffering of the Jews was the factor to produce the incarnation. As a result of God’s entering into humanity and His mingling with humanity, there is now a unique person—Jesus—who is both the complete God and a perfect man. God became a man, the man Jesus, and lived on this earth, making His home in Nazareth for thirty years. Surely this is the greatest miracle in the entire universe! </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="cVeluaqB9GIcSpGToQnMDKvYa_107wMEX0cH1smTwTSKgIxsJFXPnSJJ_5jyVXhlx">GOD’S USE<br/>OF THE CONSUMING FACTOR</h2><p data-content-id="YbJSSMTW32mmpoDoTYrLdHR5qTG774dPeI330LuXolhJKtN-IuOZUhRA6nkPAf7cE"> We have seen that Israel was used by God through so much suffering for the purpose that God could be born out of man to be a God-man. Now we need to see how God has used the consuming factor and is still using this factor. </p>
<p data-content-id="ECx9SDojNNQ0Moz7CHd995xr1EXFZd_X4El6c3W80lnOo254zyHA9m5sSLbCCgXh8"> It is the first factor, the consuming factor, that has afforded all the necessary facilities in the environment for the carrying out of God’s purpose. The Roman Empire, the aggregate of the four empires, afforded everything necessary for the incarnated God to live and move and work on earth. <span class="pg" data-page-id="31" id="31">[31]</span> Furthermore, the Roman Empire afforded the means for Christ to be crucified, for it had the governmental authority, prepared a cross, and even provided the soldiers to crucify the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p data-content-id="DwKagsDUYbMRg5_gznY3gaPJKF0474ysA2DM7VyPi-zRvhdmfYEgd9tWD99MhN44Q"> Both the consuming factor and the suffering factor have been useful to God. The Jews had lost their nation and had been scattered everywhere, wandering for centuries. Humanly speaking, that was a tragedy. But on the day of Pentecost, after God had consummated His long process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, He needed to pour Himself out upon the entire human race, not only upon one people but upon all peoples. For this outpouring a particular occasion was required, and the Roman Empire made it possible. First, the Roman Empire had scattered the Jews among all the peoples. Then, on exactly the right day, when the time was ripe, the Roman Empire provided the way for the scattered people to come back to Jerusalem to enjoy the feast. At that joyful time, God suddenly came down upon the people. From this we see that through the means of the suffering one, Israel, and by all the facilities provided by the consuming locust, the Roman government, God poured Himself out upon all flesh. Now we, as the church, are the manifestation of Christ, produced by the outpouring of the processed and consummated Triune God upon all flesh. </p>
<p data-content-id="SK02aySkhWKNLL6uUYdOBTBrExUhZytgerLWl8U1H3k1vy27NkAzPNmQO7ZoKcJTW"> Today’s locusts are also useful to God and to us, the members of the church, the Body of Christ. Because of the locusts we have such things as the telephone, the microphone, the recorder, the airplane, the computer, and the fax machine. Because of the locusts we in the United States enjoy the freedom of speech and the freedom to meet together as the church. The facilities provided by the locusts also save us a great deal of time. Therefore, we are thankful for the “locust” government and for the “locust” telephone and computer companies. In a very real sense, all the locusts are working for us. The millions of locusts swarming on earth today are serving us so that we may be here for the manifestation of Christ. <span class="pg" data-page-id="32" id="32">[32]</span> </p>
<h2 class="head1" data-content-id="gREB02TF02cxBf5UyivUkZzU90P0F9_GgAUfsKLZWgsnRkYqVT49uxTMmWPb44DDx">THE THIRD FACTOR—THE BENEFICIARIES</h2><p data-content-id="eIvLtNlD7N_8dX4CNs16BCl1KYXPoG5Vunj9SoUf0Uz0snIJoiW_NW815Fw4nVmkv"> The consuming of the locusts and the suffering of Israel are both for us. This means that we in the church life today are the beneficiaries of both the Jews and the nations. This is the third factor, the third principle. Paul says that all things work together for good for us (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59884" data-verses="Romans 8:28">Rom. 8:28</span>). Hence, we are the third factor—the beneficiaries. As the beneficiaries, we should thank the Lord for all that He has done for us through the consuming of the locusts and the suffering of the Jews. </p>

In the future there will be an actual, practical, and real restoration, but today we, the third factor, are experiencing the restoration, the fourth factor, as we participate in and enjoy the manifestation of Christ, which has come through the first two factors, the consuming of the locusts and the suffering of Israel. </p>

<p data-content-id="L45OLXLK_SaJNNrAL6ppLW_zud_GtJYTom9QKt6ROe2_qWwBwiPAj2oJ-d-qRMxsB"> In Joel we see the history of God, of man, and of God’s economy. It was according to God’s economy that the four kinds of locusts were raised up to consume Israel for so many years in order that He could fulfill His economy by being incarnated into humanity through Israel. Then with the help of the Roman Empire, Christ lived on earth, was crucified, and was resurrected to be enlarged, to produce the church. All of this was through these two factors—the consuming locusts and the suffering Israel—that God could fulfill His economy to have an expression, the organic Body of Christ. We are this Body, this expression. This is the universal history according to God’s economy. In this message I would like to give a further word on this universal history. </p>

In this universe there are two histories: the history of man, the human history, and the history of God, the divine history. We may liken the history of man to the shell of a walnut and the history of God to the kernel within the shell. In the Minor Prophets the “shell” is clearly defined, and the “kernel” is revealed in some detail. Unfortunately, however, most readers of the Bible pay attention only to the shell and not to the kernel. </p>
<p data-content-id="Aq7luzRSbCjjgSApNe80LDS-jV3-VcGQEgZGxClCfWbYDudvFEaWAZMgJl6fBCgZd"> The shell, the history of man, is easily seen. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59888" data-verses="Daniel 2:1">Daniel 2</span> this history is signified by a great human image, with the <span class="pg" data-page-id="34" id="34">[34]</span> four sections of this image corresponding respectively to the Babylonian Empire, the Medo-Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire. Although it is easy for us to see the shell, which is something outward and physical, we must have a kind of intrinsic insight in order to see the kernel within the shell, to know the divine history within the human history. </p>

<p data-content-id="WJr_vxnBxmUpVo8EW3bLfment197J6csxoNdIrrFdC6hfpHGfz5-bYq1UGxvm-oOw"> If we would know the divine history that takes place within the human history, we first need to realize that the Triune God is eternal. For God to be eternal means that with Him there is no beginning. Within Himself, this eternal One made an economy. According to His economy, God wants to work Himself into man to be one with man, to be man’s life, life supply, and everything, and to have man as His expression. God’s intention in His economy is thus to have a corporate entity, composed of God and man, to be His expression for eternity. This divine history began with the eternal God and His economy. </p>

<p data-content-id="fZGz0Sq4vYbzZlI2l7m8N4xT0iOb3a2XKlp69wmBgT3z_uson5PK40nTNb2_qxTxF"> The divine history continued with the incarnation and human living of Christ. One day the very God who created the universe became incarnated, being conceived of the Holy Spirit within the womb of a human virgin and then born of this virgin to be the God-man, the One who is the complete God and a perfect man. It is marvelous that God became a man named Jesus and that this man lived in Nazareth, working as a carpenter, until the age of thirty. Christ’s incarnation and His human living both are parts of the divine history, the history of God within the history of man. </p>

His crucifixion was a vicarious death, an all-inclusive death which terminated the old creation and solved all problems. His death ushered Him into resurrection. On the one hand, in His resurrection He was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59889" data-verses="Acts 13:33">Acts 13:33</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59890" data-verses="Romans 1:4">Rom. 1:4</span>; <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59891" data-verses="Romans 8:29">8:29</span>).

<p data-content-id="Xa0Hw2KHdhlZF7i_nt5ePgJnjaGLojpKOUhT2T1jid29eine4nH4mKCPvaGNRtXAo"> Furthermore, through Christ’s resurrection millions were begotten, regenerated, by God (<span class="verse" data-ref-id="59893" data-verses="1Peter 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</span>) to be sons of God and to be members of the Body of Christ, the church. The Christ who was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected, the Christ who ascended to the heavens and then descended as the Spirit, has produced the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God. The church today is the enlargement of the manifestation of Christ. Thus, the church also is part of the divine history, the intrinsic history of the divine mystery within the outward, human history. This part of God’s history has lasted for more than nineteen hundred years, and it is still going on. </p>

There will be the meeting of two figures—Antichrist, a figure in the outward, human history, and Christ with His overcomers, the Figure in the intrinsic, divine history.

Although a great many people have read and continue to read the Bible, few know what the Bible talks about.

We may say that the man created in God’s image was a “photograph” of God. As a photograph of a person shows us something concerning that person himself to a certain degree, so the man created by God as a photograph of God can show forth God only to a limited extent. After God created man, He was with man, but He was still outside of man. Hence, in the Old Testament we see God not in man or one with man but simply with man.

Beginning with the first chapter of Matthew and continuing to the last chapter of Revelation, we have God coming into man and being one with man. The New Testament reveals <span class="pg" data-page-id="39" id="39">[39]</span> that God is now in man and one with man. Thus, God’s history in the New Testament is the history of God in man. </p>

<p data-content-id="VhWrFV51ZvCeQLjdPr3S_IRPbUNrCz6gUzlNH1tpcNzo5oIOXvS4Sg4cS04TtOuzg"> Regarding the history of God in man, the incarnation of Christ accomplished two things. First, the incarnation brought God into man. Before the incarnation, as the Old Testament reveals, God was merely with man; He was outside of man. But by incarnation God entered into man, and from that time onward the history of God was different. Whereas in the past God was with man, and His history was a history with man, now God was in man, and His history began to be a history in man. </p>
<h2 class="head4" data-content-id="iZ6WcWseumRihYoC2V2gcbmAt4d1zjg4dAairuEouW3ykPT9mCU3OqkBlbw_XUOUV">Making God One with Man</h2><p data-content-id="1xeIiLGbwPNG46hPFU-tbCF5o3cnvJR5bgm8D3LEH2OclobTdkdiLmnDeQ9irzsIl"> Second, the incarnation made God one with man. As a result of the incarnation, there was a wonderful person—a person who is the mingling of God with man. This person, Jesus, is not only God, and He is not merely a man. He is the complete God and the perfect man. Further, He is not only God in man—He is God mingled with man. </p>
<p data-content-id="9LFVRvuS4Nyhm75tsK7iCplkNV_o9gZYY6i_s3lzByFI7nLiwx56g1YYYhvBsWuJz"> From this we see that the incarnation was an unprecedented event. Prior to the incarnation, there was not such a person, a person who is both God and man. But now, as a result of the incarnation, there is a wonderful person who is the mingling of God with man. </p>

A verse which speaks of this involvement is <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59900" data-verses="Revelation 22:17">Revelation 22:17a</span>, which says, “The Spirit and the bride say, Come!” The Spirit is the consummated Triune God, and the bride is the transformed tripartite man. As this verse reveals, these two, the Spirit and the bride, will be married, joined to become one entity, one corporate person. This is a strong indication that, in the New Testament, God is in man and is one with man. The <span class="pg" data-page-id="40" id="40">[40]</span> New Jerusalem is a marvelous sign demonstrating how God is in man and is one with man. </p>

God was with man with the intention of coming into man and being one with man. Man was created by God for this purpose. But although God had such a purpose in creating man, man has another, subtle, purpose, and these two purposes do not agree. God has His way, and man has his way. Because of this, even when man cooperates with God, he does this not by God’s way but by his own way. Thus, there are two lines—God’s line and man’s line. God wants to come into man and to be one with man. Man, however, does not take God’s way but insists on his own way. This insistence has caused, and continues to cause, great failure. As a result, in the sight of God man has become sinful, corrupt, and abominable. </p>

When God chastises His people Israel, He has no intention of utterly destroying them. On the one hand, God chastises Israel; on the other hand, He has promised not to destroy them completely. </p>
<p data-content-id="wDrkKlSXrXixh2XpVocCDZkdwbvWJPFHvybSIV6ke_cKlnc5dsDFTXr3fVg2ompCj"> In order to chastise Israel God needs a “rod,” a means of discipline, and this rod is the nations. In <span class="verse" data-ref-id="59901" data-verses="Joel 1:4">Joel 1:4</span> the nations are likened to locusts in four stages: the cutting locust (the Babylonian Empire), the swarming locust (the Medo-Persian Empire), the licking locust (the Macedonian-Grecian Empire), and the consuming locust (the Roman Empire). Of these four kinds of locusts—Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Roman—the Roman locusts are still with us today. </p>
<p data-content-id="L45OLXLK_SaJNNrAL65pMGPzud_GtJYTom9QKt6ROe2_qWwBwiPAj2oJ-d-qRMxsB"> Although God allows the locusts to cut, swarm, lick, and consume, He does not permit them to destroy His people <span class="pg" data-page-id="41" id="41">[41]</span> utterly. Whenever the locusts have gone too far, acting without regard for justice, God has come in to punish them. Whereas God uses the nations to chastise Israel, He also punishes the nations for going too far. </p>

Thus, the Minor Prophets speak not only of the chastisement of Israel and the punishment of the nations but also of the issue of this chastisement and punishment—the manifestation of Christ. </p>
<p data-content-id="Aq7luzRSbCjjgSApNes0ARS-jV3-VcGQEgZGxClCfWbYDudvFEaWAZMgJl6fBCgZd"> The manifestation of Christ has a goal, and this goal is to restore the fallen universe. The fall of the universe was caused by two rebellions. The first rebellion was the rebellion of Satan and the angels who followed him; the second was the rebellion of man. These two rebellions—the angelic and the human—defiled and polluted the universe, so the God-created universe needs a restoration. </p>
